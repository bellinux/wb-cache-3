He hated writing; the ink always crept up his fingers and the smell of ink offended him. And he was filled with unexpressed doubts. Why should writing slope down from right to left?

6000|$|Hence {{it follows}} that the utmost power of art can only be given in a {{material}} capable of receiving and retaining the influence of the subtlest touch of the human hand. That hand is the most perfect agent of material power existing in the universe; and its full subtlety can only be shown when the material it works on, or with, is entirely yielding. The chords of a perfect instrument will receive it, but not of an imperfect one; the softly bending point of the hair pencil, and soft melting of colour, will receive it, but not even the chalk or <b>pen</b> <b>point,</b> still less the steel point, chisel, or marble. The hand of a sculptor may, indeed, be as subtle as that of a painter, but all its subtlety is not bestowable nor expressible: the touch of Titian, Correggio, or Turner, [Footnote: See Appendix IV., [...] "Subtlety of Hand."] is a far more marvellous piece of nervous action than can be shown in anything but colour, or in the very highest conditions of executive expression in music. In proportion as the material worked upon is less delicate, the execution necessarily becomes lower, and the art with it. This is one main principle of all work. Another is, that whatever the material you choose to work with, your art is base if it does not bring out the distinctive qualities of that material.|$|E

6000|$|Possess yourself, therefore, of any cheap work on botany {{containing}} outline {{plates of}} leaves and flowers, {{it does not matter}} whether bad or good: [...] "Baxter's British Flowering Plants" [...] is quite good enough. Copy any of the simplest outlines, first with a soft pencil, following it, by the eye, as nearly as you can; if it does not look right in proportions, rub out and correct it, always by the eye, till you think it is right: when you have got it to your mind, lay tracing-paper on the book, on this paper trace the outline you have been copying, and apply it to your own; and having thus ascertained the faults, correct them all patiently, till you have got it as nearly accurate as may be. Work with a very soft pencil, and do not rub out so hard[200] as to spoil the surface of your paper; never mind how dirty the paper gets, but do not roughen it; and let the false outlines alone where they do not really interfere with the true one. It is a good thing to accustom yourself to hew and shape your drawing out of a dirty piece of paper. When you have got it as right as you can, take a quill pen, not very fine at the point; rest your hand on a book about {{an inch and a half}} thick, so as to hold the pen long; and go over your pencil outline with ink, raising your <b>pen</b> <b>point</b> as seldom as possible, and never leaning more heavily on one part of the line than on another. In most outline drawings of the present day, parts of the curves are thickened to give an effect of shade; all such outlines are bad, but they will serve well enough for your exercises, provided you do not imitate this character: it is better, however, if you can, to choose a book of pure outlines. It does not in the least matter whether your pen outline be thin or thick; but it matters greatly that it should be equal, not heavier in one place than in another. The power to be obtained is that of drawing an even line slowly and in any direction; all dashing lines, or approximations to penmanship, are bad. The pen should, as it were, walk slowly over the ground, and you should be able at any moment to stop it, or to turn it in any other direction, like a well-managed horse.|$|E

Our members account for approximately 75 % of the manufacture and distribution of writing instruments in this country. A list of our members is attached as Exhibit 1. WIMA has regularly participated in rulemakings before the CPSC since the agency’s formation in 1973. We are writing to you about a very serious compliance problem involving lead in ball point pens and roller ball pens. Based upon our analysis, all pen points used in these products, when marketed as children’s products as defined by Section 235 (a) of the CPSIA, will be violative of Section 101 (a) (2) of the CPSIA when the total lead provision goes into effect on February 10, 2009. And {{there is no alternative}} metal {{that can be used for}} pen points that does not contain some violative quantity of lead. Accordingly, WIMA, on behalf of its members, and any other importers, manufacturers or distributors similarly impacted, files this Section 101 Request for Lead Content Exclusion for <b>Pen</b> <b>Point</b> Components.

Forty sera could be examined microscopically in approximately 30 min. All sera reacting with one or more antigens were tested for rheumatoid factor by the latex method, absorbed with glutaraldehyde-cross-linked human IgG, and retested for the presence of IgM antibody. IgM antibody to cytomegalovirus was demonstrated in sera from four newborns, but IgM antibody to rubella virus could not be detected until 21 days after birth, although rubella virus was isolated from sera from five younger infants. This may indicate that rubella IgM levels in many congenitally infected newborns are too low to be measured by the immunofluorescence method. Five percent of the sera from infants in this study possessed demonstrable IgM antibody to one of the antigens...|$|E

The present study investigated 4 strains; E. coli 1 and S. maltophilia, one of each was isolated from hospitals wastewater and the others from drinking water, based upon API 20 E identification protocol, antibiotic-resistance and plasmid profiles. Their plasmids were also found genetically-affiliated based on restriction analysis preliminary mapping, and PCR-based techniques (ERIC and RAPD); as recommended tools for partial fingerprinting. Results elucidated 60 – 70 % identical regions on their plasmids. The two S. maltophilia and two E. coli isolates are almost the same. These findings may nominate, or at least <b>pen</b> <b>point</b> hospitals wastewater {{to be one of}} the main sources contaminating drinking water with bacteria at Al-Madinah Al-Munwwarah city.

Even though this theoretical model mostly concerns the written word, Noordzij applies it to printed type as well, as he defines typography as ′writing with prefabricated characters′.
