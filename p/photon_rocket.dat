The need for orbiting satellite solar power plants and related astrionics for active control of large space structures for space stations and colonies in an age of space industrialization is demonstrated. Various forms of spacecraft propulsion are described including liquid propellant rocket engines, nuclear reactors, thermonuclear rocket engines, electrorocket engines, electromagnetic engines, magnetic gas dynamic generators, electromagnetic mass accelerators (rail guns), laser rocket engines, pulse nuclear rocket engines, ramjet thermonuclear <b>rocket</b> engines, and <b>photon</b> <b>rockets.</b> The possibilities of interstellar flight are assessed...|$|R

According to Dr. Tony Martin, controlled-fusion engine and the nuclear-electric systems have very low thrust, equipment to convert nuclear energy into electrical has a large mass, which results in small acceleration, which would take a century to achieve the desired speed; thermodynamic nuclear engines of the NERVA type require a great quantity of fuel, <b>photon</b> <b>rockets</b> have to generate power {{at a rate of}} 3 W per kg of vehicle mass and require mirrors with absorptivity of less than 1 part in 106, interstellar ramjet's problems are tenuous interstellar medium with a density of about 1 atom/cm3, a large diameter funnel, and high power required for its electric field.

40|$|A {{family of}} {{explicit}} exact solutions of Einstein's equations in four and higher dimensions is studied which describes <b>photon</b> <b>rockets</b> accelerating {{due to an}} anisotropic emission of photons. It is possible to prescribe an arbitrary motion, so that the acceleration of the rocket need not be uniform - both its magnitude and direction may vary with time. Except at location of the point-like rocket the spacetimes have no curvature singularities, and topological defects like cosmic strings are also absent. Any value of a cosmological constant is allowed. We investigate some particular examples of motion, namely a straight flight and a circular trajectory, and we derive the corresponding radiation patterns and the mass loss of the rockets. We also demonstrate the absence of "gravitational aberration" in such spacetimes. This interesting member of the higher-dimensional Robinson-Trautman class of pure radiation spacetimes of algebraic type D generalises the class of Kinnersley's solutions {{that has long been}} known in four-dimensional general relativity.

40|$|The {{absence of}} {{gravitational}} radiation in Kinnersley’s “photon rocket ” solution of Einstein’s equations is clarified {{by studying the}} mathematically well-defined problem of point-like <b>photon</b> <b>rockets</b> in Minkowski space (i. e. massive particles emitting null fluid anisotropically and accelerating because of the recoil). We explicitly compute the (uniquely defined) linearized retarded gravitational waves emitted by such objects, which are the coherent superposition of the gravitational waves generated by {{the motion of the}} massive point-like rocket and of those generated by the energy-momentum distribution of the photon fluid. In the special case (corresponding to Kinnersley’s solution) where the anisotropy of the photon emission is purely dipolar we find that the gravitational wave amplitude generated by the energymomentum of the photons exactly cancels the usual 1 /r gravitational 1 wave amplitude generated by the accelerated motion of the <b>rocket.</b> More general <b>photon</b> anisotropies would, however, generate genuine gravitational radiation at infinity. Our explicit calculations show the compatibility between the non-radiative character of Kinnersley’s solution and the currently used gravitational wave generation formalisms based on post-Minkowskian perturbation theory. 2...|$|R
40|$|The device {{described}} {{has been}} developed to provide solar X-ray flux data as a standard measurement in daytime launchings of the British high altitude research rocket, Skylark. This measurement {{is of particular interest}} in those rounds primarily concerned with ionospheric studies. It is shown that the scope of an X-ray monitor may quite simply be extended to cover the wide range of intensities occurring with the different degrees of solar activity. In a series of launchings, already begun, data on the variation of short-wavelength solar X-radiation are being accumulated, whilst comparison with concurrent rocket ionospheric studies may add {{to an understanding of the}} role of solar X-radiation in this field. The results of a first rocket flight of the monitor, which took place in “quiet” solar conditions in the autumn of 1959, are reported and discussed.

50|$|The power per thrust {{required}} for a perfectly collimated output beam is 300 MW/N (half this {{if it can be}} reflected off the craft); very high energy density power sources would be required to provide reasonable thrust without unreasonable weight. The specific impulse of a photonic rocket is harder to define, since the output has no (rest) mass and is not expended fuel; if we take the momentum per inertia of the photons, the specific impulse is just c, which is impressive. However, considering the mass of the source of the photons, e.g., atoms undergoing nuclear fission, brings the specific impulse down to 300 km/s (c/1000) or less; considering the infrastructure for a reactor (some of which also scales with the amount of fuel) reduces the value further. Finally, any energy loss not through radiation that is redirected precisely to aft but is instead conducted away by engine supports, radiated in some other direction, or lost via neutrinos or so will further degrade the efficiency. If we were to set 80% of the mass of the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> = fissionable fuel, and recognizing that nuclear fission converts about 0.10% of the mass into energy: then if the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> masses 300,000 kg then 240,000 kg of that is atomic fuel. Therefore, the fissioning of all of the fuel will result in the loss of just 240 kg of mass. Then 300,000/299,760 kg = an mi/mf of 1.0008. Using the rocket equation, we find vf = ln 1.0008 × c where c = 299,792,458 m/s.vf then may be 239,930 m/s which is about 240 km/s. The nuclear fission powered <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> may accelerate at a maximum of perhaps 1/10,000 m/s² (0.1 mm/s²) which is 10−5g. The velocity change would be at the rate of 3,000 m/s per year of thrusting by the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket.</b>|$|E
50|$|Meyer et al. {{concluded}} that for interstellar fights, recycling photon propulsion vehicles {{are much more}} energy efficient than an onboard <b>photon</b> <b>rocket,</b> such as the nuclear photonic rocket. They proposed possible applications of photon recycling using passive resonant optical cavities (lasers outside the optical cavity), such as the Laser Elevator.|$|E
50|$|For a <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> the {{efficiency}} {{is too small}} to be competitive. Other technologies may have better efficiency if the ejection velocity is less than light speed, or a local field can interact with another large scale field of the same type residing in space, which is the intent of field effect propulsion.|$|E
50|$|A laser {{could be}} used as a <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> engine, and would solve the reflection/collimation problem, but lasers are {{absolutely}} less efficient at converting energy into light than blackbody radiation is - though one should also note the benefits of lasers vs blackbody source, including unidirectional controllable beam and the mass and durability of the radiation source.|$|E

50|$|If a <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> {{begins its}} journey in low earth orbit, then {{one year of}} {{thrusting}} {{may be required to}} achieve an earth escape velocity of 11.2 km/s if the vehicle is already in orbit at a velocity of 9,100 m/s. Upon escaping the Earth's gravitational field the rocket will have a heliocentric velocity of 30 km/s in interplanetary space. Eighty years of steady photonic thrusting would be then required to obtain a final velocity of 240 km/s in this hypothetical case.|$|E
50|$|Kinnersley {{earned his}} Ph.D. from Caltech in 1968, under the {{direction}} of Kip Thorne. In 1969, he published an exact null dust solution to the Einstein field equation and thereby created the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket,</b> an object with mass propelled by the emission of light (radiation without mass). This solution remains one of the few known exact solutions with clear physical interpretations, and in consequence it is widely cited as an important breakthrough. In 1978, Kinnersley, C. Hoenselaers, and Basilis C. Xanthopoulos published an important solution generating method for solving the Einstein field equation.|$|E
5000|$|Photons {{transfer}} {{their energy}} to the spacecraft by redshifting upon reflection. Thus the higher the spacecraft speed, the higher the efficiency. The figure shows the energy transfer efficiency from photons to the spacecraft's kinetic energy {{as a function of}} β=v/c (the spacecraft velocity divided by the light velocity) in photon propulsion. As the spacecraft velocity approaches the light velocity (v ≈ c) the efficiency of photon propulsion approaches 100%. The lower solid curve in the figure represents the efficiency of conventional <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> or sail with photon recycling. The upper solid line represents schematically an example the efficiency of a recycling <b>photon</b> <b>rocket,</b> such as a PLT. At low β, the recycling rocket can have a high thrust amplification factor (in this example, ~3,000), however as β approaches 1, the amplification factor converges to 1 and the overhead of recycling is unneeded. Therefore, these rockets are projected to bridge the efficiency gap. The simplest recycling scheme is a Herriot cell with multi-bouncing laser beams between two high reflectance mirrors that do not form a resonant optical cavity as illustrated in Figure 4. This cell type approach was first proposed by Meyer, et al., followed by Simmons and McInnes. Mertzger and Landis [...] proposed a multi-bounce lightsail craft, such that the beam is reflected {{back and forth between the}} lightsail and a source reflector. Advanced reflectors permit more than 1000 bounces, reducing power requirements by 1000x compared to single bounce proposals. Using 100 MW to 1 GW lasers, a sub-100 day Mars transit is possible. The first experimental attempt on photon thrust amplification in a non-resonant Herriot-cell type optical cavity was performed by Gray et al. who obtained amplified photon thrust of ~0.4 µN with a 300-W laser and a photon thrust amplification factor of ~2.6.|$|E
50|$|The {{observed}} {{thrust of}} experimental results {{has been argued}} to exceed the maximum efficiency of a perfectly collimated <b>photon</b> <b>rocket,</b> comprised between 3.33 and 6.67 µN/kW. However, the paper follows on White's idea of a degradable quantum vacuum for effective pair production, and Lewis's original concept of the photon {{which would be the}} conserved entity of nature, not its carried energy: The authors argue that the environment modifies photon energy and that pairing of photons within the electromagnetic energy density gradient of a resonant cavity would cause a shift down in energy, and the loss of electromagnetic potential becomes available for thrust, so according to the authors the level of energy of the paired photon when it escapes the cavity and the associated thrust efficiency remain an open question. The authors also argue that the cavity walls become transparent for the photon pair when it forms; as it has no associated electromagnetic field, it escapes the cavity to sparser surroundings.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is clear}} {{on the basis of}} the above {{calculations}} that a relativistic rocket would likely need to be a rocket that is fueled by antimatter. Other antimatter rockets in addition to the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> that can provide a 0.6c specific impulse (studied for basic hydrogen-antihydrogen annihilation, no ionization, no recycling of the radiation) needed for interstellar space flight include the [...] "beam core" [...] pion rocket. In a pion rocket, antimatter is stored inside electromagnetic bottles in the form of frozen antihydrogen. Antihydrogen, like regular hydrogen, is diamagnetic which allows it to be electromagnetically levitated when refrigerated. Temperature control of the storage volume is used to determine the rate of vaporization of the frozen antihydrogen, up to a few grams per second (amounting to several petawatts of power when annihilated with equal amounts of matter). It is then ionized into antiprotons which can be electromagnetically accelerated into the reaction chamber. The positrons are usually discarded since their annihilation only produces harmful gamma rays with negligible effect on thrust. However, non-relativistic rockets may exclusively rely on these gamma rays for propulsion. This process is necessary because un-neutralized antiprotons repel one another, limiting the number that may be stored with current technology to less than a trillion.|$|E
40|$|The spacetimes for Vaidya's {{radiating}} stellar {{exterior and}} Kinnersley's <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> in a cosmological background are obtained by performing the same conformal transformation as {{is used to}} obtain the Robertson-Walker metric from Minkowski spacetime. In {{the case of the}} cosmological radiating stellar exterior, a two-fluid solution is found that obeys all of the energy conditions and consists of a null fluid and a perfect fluid that asymptotically falls off to the standard cosmological values for pressure and density at infinite radius. For the cosmological <b>photon</b> <b>rocket,</b> the massless case is first interpreted to obtain a solution for an accelerating cosmological reference frame, and then the general case is interpreted: in both cases, a two-fluid solution is found that consists of a null fluid and an imperfect fluid that possesses heat conduction and anisotropic stress. The imperfect fluid appears to contain an inhomogeneous dark energy component that acts to accelerate the matter through space via a pressure gradient, but this component has negative energy density on the trailing side of the rocket, meaning only the leading side of the rocket is guaranteed to satisfy the weak and dominant energy conditions. Unlike spacetimes that have rotation but no acceleration, the cosmological <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> can serve {{as an example of a}} spacetime that contradicts Mach's notion of acceleration, since an observer would see empirical evidence of acceleration even though the matter does not accelerate relative to the universe's background matter distribution.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the idea of}} a <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> through the {{complete}} annihilation of matter with antimatter, first proposed by Sänger, is not a utopian scheme as it is widely believed. Its feasibility appears to be possible by the radiative collapse of a relativistic high current pinch discharge in a hydrogen-antihydrogen ambiplasma down to a radius determined by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Through this collapse to ultrahigh densities the proton-antiproton pairs {{in the center of the}} pinch can become the upper GeV laser level for the transition into a coherent gamma ray beam by proton-antiproton annihilation, with the magnetic field of the collapsed pinch discharge absorbing the recoil momentum of the beam and transmitting it to the spacecraft. The gamma ray laser beam is launched as a photon avalanche from one end of the pinch discharge channel. The idea of the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> was first proposed by Sänger [1], but at that time considered to be utopian.

40|$|A "space drive" is a {{hypothetical}} device that generates a propulsive force in free space using an input of power {{without the need}} for a reaction mass. Any device that generates photons (e. g., a laser) would qualify as a propellantless "photon rocket," but the force generated by emitting photons per power input (3. 33 μN/kW) is too small to be a practical propulsion device. The ability to generate greater force per power input would be highly desirable, but, as demonstrated in this paper, such a device would be able to operate as a perpetual motion machine of the first kind. Since applying a constant force results in a constant acceleration, the kinetic energy of a mass driven by such a device increases quadratically with time, while the energy input increases only linearly with time. Thus, at some point, the kinetic energy of the device-driven mass exceeds the energy input, and if this energy is collected via decelerating the mass (via regenerative electromagnetic braking, for example), then there would be a net gain in energy. For devices with thrust-to-power ratios on the order of 1 N/kW that have been discussed recently in connection with the so-called EM drive, this breakeven occurs at velocities low enough to be feasible with current technology, clearly demonstrating the absurdity of such a device. When relativistic effects are taken into account, it is shown that the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> can only reach energy breakeven as the accelerated mass asymptotically approaches the speed of light. Thus, any device with a thrust-to-power ratio greater than the <b>photon</b> <b>rocket</b> would be able to operate as a perpetual motion machine of the first kind, and thus should be excluded by the First Law of Thermodynamics...|$|E
