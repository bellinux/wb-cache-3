While in office he was indicted at the Colombo High Court for an alleged sexual assault on a housemaid in 2015 and retied in early 2016. The case against him was <b>fixed</b> <b>for</b> <b>hearing</b> on May 23 by Colombo High Court after he pleaded not guilty. The Attorney General indicted de Abrew under Clause-365 of the Penal Code on two counts of sexual abuse and assault in June last year at Ratmalana. This is the first and only occasion of a judge of the Supreme Court being indicted on criminal charges.|$|R
6000|$|The wood-carver {{was glad}} to be {{recalled}} to the business of his craft, and his eyes shone as he received instructions for a carved wooden doorway for Pagett, which he promised should be splendidly executed and despatched to England in six months. It is an irrelevant detail, but in spite of Orde's reminders, fourteen months elapsed before the work was finished. Business over, Bishen Singh hung about, reluctant to take his leave, and at last joining his hands and approaching Orde with bated breath and whispering humbleness, said he had a petition to make. Orde's face suddenly lost all trace of expression. [...] "Speak on, Bishen Singh," [...] said he, and the carver in a whining tone explained that his case against his brothers was <b>fixed</b> <b>for</b> <b>hearing</b> before a native judge and- -here he dropped his voice still lower till he was summarily stopped by Orde, who sternly pointed to the gate with an emphatic Begone! ...|$|R
60|$|The date which Clementina had <b>fixed</b> <b>for</b> <b>hearing</b> from Hinkle by cable {{had long}} passed, {{and the time}} when she first hoped {{to hear from him}} by letter had come and gone. Her address was with the {{vice-consul}} as Mrs. Lander's had been, and he could not be ignorant of her disappointment when he brought her letters which she said were from home. On the surface of things it could only be from home that she wished to hear, but beneath the surface he read an anxiety which mounted with each gratification of this wish. He had not seen much of the girl while Hinkle was in Venice; Mrs. Lander had not begun to make such constant use of him until Hinkle had gone; Mrs. Milray had told him of Clementina's earlier romance, and it was to Gregory that the vice-consul related the anxiety which he knew as little in its nature as in its object.|$|R

All that they possessed would not cover it. On the other hand, if they won, this rich Company might carry the matter to a higher Appeal Court, and so involve them in a fresh succession of anxieties and expenses. Do what they would, there was always danger. Frank said little, and he slept little also.|$|R

60|$|And {{then had}} come the unlooked-for tidings of the {{imminent}} proceedings for divorce. And such a divorce! There were cross-suits and allegations and counter-allegations, charges of cruelty and desertion, everything {{in fact that}} was necessary {{to make the case}} one of the most complicated and sensational of its kind. And the number of distinguished people involved or cited as witnesses not only embraced both political parties in the realm and several Colonial governors, but included an exotic contingent from France, Hungary, the United States of North America, and the Grand Duchy of Baden. Hotel accommodation of the more expensive sort began to experience a strain on its resources. “It will be quite like the Durbar without the elephants,” exclaimed an enthusiastic lady who, to do her justice, had never seen a Durbar. The general feeling was one of thankfulness that the last of the strikes had been got over before the date <b>fixed</b> <b>for</b> the <b>hearing</b> of the great suit.|$|R

50|$|The Election Commission then <b>fixed</b> 3 January <b>for</b> <b>hearing</b> the Samajwadi Party (SP) factions led by Mulayam Singh Yadav {{and his son}} Akhilesh Yadav {{to settle}} the dispute over control of the party and its {{election}} symbol, ‘cycle’.The Election Commission heard both factions for about 4 hours and reserved its order on who gets ownership to the party’s cycle symbol. The Akhilesh faction was represented by senior lawyers Rajeev Dhavan and Kapil Sibal and Mulayam Singh faction was represented by senior advocate and former Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran. Parasaran argued that the Election Commission lacked jurisdiction to allocate the symbol to one of the factions as there was no split in the party such as SP (Mulayam) and SP (Akhilesh) and there was no splinter group. He also said the meeting called by Ramgopal Yadav on 1 January in which Akhilesh was elected Samajwadi Party president, was not in accordance with the party’s constitution and therefore, was illegal and unauthorised.|$|R

Irrespective of this, {{the majority of}} older adults do not seek professional help <b>for</b> <b>hearing</b> impairment and/or do not obtain hearing aids.

40|$|Purpose: In May 2001, to {{integrate}} biological, psychological, and social {{aspects of human}} functioning, the World Health Assembly endorsed the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The aim {{of this article is}} to describe the creation of Comprehensive and Brief ICF Core Sets <b>for</b> <b>Hearing</b> Loss. The core sets consist of the most relevant ICF categories <b>for</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. Method and Results: Four preparatory studies were carried out and presented at a consensus conference, resulting in a Comprehensive ICF Core Set <b>for</b> <b>Hearing</b> Loss, consisting of 117 ICF categories, and a Brief ICF Core Set <b>for</b> <b>Hearing</b> Loss, consisting of 27 categories (of the 117). Conclusion: The Comprehensive ICF Core Set <b>for</b> <b>Hearing</b> Loss can be a user-friendly tool for conducting comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessments. The Brief ICF Core Set can be used for many purposes, such as research and population studies. However, its most common use is by individuals seeking to provide a brief description and assessment of functioning of a person with hearing loss. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association...|$|R

5000|$|In 1675, Fagg was at {{the centre}} of an intense storm {{concerning}} parliamentary privilege, when a Dr Thomas Shirley sought {{to bring an action}} against him in the House of Lords concerning a property matter. On 4 November 1675, the Lords resolved to fix 20 November as the date for the matter to be heard. Five days later, in reply, the Commons resolved that the action was in breach of their privilege and that Fagg should make no defense of it. On 17 November, the Lords appointed three counsel to plead Shirley's case. On the 18th, the Commons resolved to seek a Conference with the Lords [...] "for avoiding the occasions of reviving {{the differences between the two}} Houses", and a committee was appointed for the purpose. The Lords accepted the invitation. On 20 November, the Commons ordered that Shirley be taken into custody by the Serjeant-at-Arms, for breach of their privilege, and also ordered the posting of notices warning of legal action against anyone pleading Shirley's case. That day, Shirley appeared in person in the Lords, with Richard Wallop, one of his counsel, who asked to be excused, but the Lords ordered Wallop to represent Shirley, with the hearing deferred until the 22nd. Later that day, a motion in the Lords that the King be prayed to resolve the matter by dissolving parliament was lost by two votes, 48 in favour and 50 against. However, two days later, on the day <b>fixed</b> <b>for</b> the new <b>hearing,</b> the King prorogued both Houses of Parliament for several months, to bring the dispute to an end.|$|R
