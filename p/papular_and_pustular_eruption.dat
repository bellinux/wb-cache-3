40|$|Abstract: Erlotinib is low molecular-weight quinazolin {{derivatives}} which selectively {{inhibit the}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGF-R) tyrosine kinase activity of the intracellular domain, block autophosphorylation and the subsequent sig-naling cascades. EGF-R is expressed on basal keratinocytes, sebocytes, the outer root sheath of hairs, and endothelial cells in the skin, and plays important roles in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, attachment and migra-tion of keratinocytes, inflammation, and wound healing. Therefore, inhibition of EGF-R causes a number of cutaneous adverse reactions. Among them, severe skin lesions are very stressful, and impair {{quality of life of}} patients. Moreover, they even bring disadvantages such as drug withdrawal or interruption. Several review papers describe representative or common skin lesions which appear either during the first a few weeks or at later phases. Common skin manifestations in-clude <b>papular</b> <b>and</b> <b>pustular</b> follicular <b>eruptions</b> (acneiform eruption), xerosis, paronychia, pruritus, and abnormalities of hairs; however, other than those eruptions, several unusual lesions are also induced. Early intervention of dermatologists and management of skin lesions are quite important, because discontinuance of the drug is unfavorable for patients with clinical benefits for cancers. In this brief review, various cutaneous manifestations seen in Japanese patients treated with erlotinib (Tarceva) are shown, and current management of representative severe conditions is also described...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{report a}} case of severe {{pustular}} vasculitis most probably due to losartan (Cozaar) which is an antihypertensive drug inhibiting the receptors for angiotensin II. CASE REPORT: A 64 -year-old woman, suffering from hypertension, developed a widespread and rapidly evolving bullous <b>and</b> <b>pustular</b> <b>eruption</b> without any other clinical sign. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis and junctional blisters were present with deposits of both IgA and IgG at these sites. Withdrawal of losartan, which was the only drug taken by the patient, and tapered corticotherapy cleared the lesions. The rash left a prominent mottled hyperpigmentation. It did not recur during the following months {{despite the presence of}} antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. DISCUSSION: So far only a few cutaneous side effects have been reported following losartan intake. This drug was the likely culprit in the present case. Vasculitis was extremely severe and polymorphous. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|It is {{difficult}} for rosacea patients to discern which products and ingredients will be beneficial to their skin and which products will lead to an exacerbation of the {{signs and symptoms of}} rosacea. In this paper, the authors provide a brief overview of rosacea, its pathogenesis, signs and symptoms, and the management of the two major rosacea subtypes—erythematotelangiectatic rosacea <b>and</b> <b>papular</b> <b>pustular</b> rosacea. Reviewed in greater detail are the common ingredients used in over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers with discussion of how these ingredients potentially benefit or harm the skin of patients with rosacea. Clinical studies investigating the benefits of using certain over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers in patients with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea <b>and</b> <b>papular</b> <b>pustular</b> rosacea with or without topical prescription therapy are also reviewed. The specific formulas used in the clinical studies include a sensitive skin synthetic detergent bar, a nonalkaline cleanser and moisturizer, polyhydroxy acid containing cleanser and moisturizer, and a ceramide-based cleanser and moisturizer formulated in a multivesicular emulsion. Based on review of available data, the authors conclude that the use of mild over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers is beneficial for patients with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea <b>and</b> <b>papular</b> <b>pustular</b> rosacea. The properties of over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers that contribute to their mildness include an acidic-neutral pH to minimize the flux in skin pH; surfactants or emulsifiers that will not strip the skin of its moisture or strip the lipids and proteins of the stratum corneum; moisturizing ingredients such as emollients, humectants, and occlusives; and formulas without potential irritants and allergens.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Acne is {{a common}} skin disease that affects the {{follicular}} unit of the skin. Inflammatory- and noninflammatory forms of acne exist. The most affected areas on the body include the face, {{upper part of the}} chest and the back. These are the areas with the most sebaceous follicles. Acne occurs when hyperkeratinisation causes the cells of the hair follicle to shed too fast. These cells then block the follicle opening. Thus, sebum cannot pass through the hair follicle onto the skin. The human skin is composed of three layers, namely the epidermis, which acts as a waterproof layer and a barrier to infections; the dermis, which contains the skin appendages; and the subcutaneous fat layer. Skin acts as a protective layer against pathogens and damage to the body. It also provides a semi-impermeable barrier to prevent water loss. Azelaic acid and niacinamide are both currently used in the treatment of acne. Azelaic acid is a saturated dicarboxylic acid which is used to treat mild to moderate acne. It has antibacterial, keratolytic and comedolytic properties. Niacinamide, on the other hand, is the amide of nicotinic acid and is beneficial in the treatment of both <b>papular</b> <b>and</b> <b>pustular</b> acne. It has a demonstrated anti-inflammatory action and causes dose-dependent inhibition of sebocyte secretions. The Pheroid™ delivery system is a colloidal system that consists of even lipid-based submicron-and micron-sized structures that are very unique in nature. This technology is able to improve the absorption and/or efficacy of various active ingredients, as well as other compounds. In this study, a cream, Pheroid™ cream, a gel and a Pheroid™ gel were formulated, containing both azelaic acid and niacinamide. Stability tests were conducted on these formulations for six months, and it was established that none of the formulations were stable under the different storage conditions. Tests that were conducted during stability testing, as determined by the Medicines Control Council, included: assay, mass variation, appearance, viscosity, pH determination and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Diffusion studies (12 hours long in total) with vertical Franz cells were conducted with Caucasian female skin obtained after abdominoplastic surgery. Tape-stripping followed in order to establish the epidermis and dermis concentrations of azelaic acid and niacinamide. Significant concentrations of both active ingredients were found in the epidermis and the dermis after 12 hours. Master...|$|R
