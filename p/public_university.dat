40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{challenges}} experienced by Kenyan <b>public</b> <b>universities</b> in implementation of e-learning and recommend possible solutions towards its successful implementation.

50|$|In Indonesia, University and College Admission is {{dependent}} on the University or College Status. Generally, <b>Public</b> <b>Universities</b> conduct their admission in unified system in two systems as in 2017.

From the results, it is clear that the students feel that the facilities for the PWD provided still need to be improved. From the result, we know that although the facilities for the PWD are provided in <b>public</b> <b>universities,</b> the PWD still cannot move independently and need help from the normal students. Moreover, the existing facilities are not built according to the standards.
