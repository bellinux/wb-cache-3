5|$|The Flames {{entered the}} 2010 NHL Entry Draft without a {{selection}} {{in the first}} two rounds. They would have picked 13th overall, however that pick was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes as part of a 2009 trade for Olli Jokinen. Their second round pick went to the Chicago Blackhawks as part of a 2008 deal in which Calgary acquired Rene Bourque. The Flames' first selection was early in the third round, a pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Anton Stralman. They selected Max Reinhart with that <b>pick.</b> <b>His</b> father Paul was also a former Flames draft pick. Calgary made one trade at the draft, sending their sixth round pick (163rd overall) to the Sharks in exchange for goaltender Henrik Karlsson.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E
5|$|Mulder's own {{problems}} arise when {{his cell phone}} rings and Krycek disappears from his car. Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out. Krycek is about {{to pull the trigger}} when a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless. Krycek pushes his gun over and tells Skinner to shoot Mulder, telling him Mulder's life will grant him a thousand lives. Instead, Skinner raises his gun and shoots Krycek in the head. Doggett attempts to apprehend Rohrer and Crane but ends up being chased by the two. The pursuit ends up in the FBI garage and ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his car into the garage wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead.|$|E

5|$|Ziggler {{entered the}} 2016 Royal Rumble as the 28th entrant, lasting 7 minutes, but was {{eliminated}} by the eventual winner, Triple H. The next night on Raw, Ziggler faced Kevin Owens in a losing effort, but defeated him {{the following two}} weeks in a row. On the February 15 Raw, Ziggler {{was involved in a}} fatal five-way match for the Intercontinental Championship, where Owens regained the title after pinning Tyler Breeze. At Fastlane, Ziggler challenged Owens to a match for the Intercontinental Championship, which he lost. In the following weeks, Ziggler began to re-ignite his feud with The Authority, and on the March 14 episode of Raw, he confronted Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. This resulted in Ziggler being granted a match against Triple H where if he won, he could <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> match at WrestleMania (excluding the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match); however, Ziggler lost. At WrestleMania 32, Ziggler competed against Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, The Miz, Stardust, Sin Cara and Zack Ryder in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, which was won by Ryder.|$|E
25|$|In {{much of his}} career, Saionji {{tried to}} {{diminish}} {{the influence of the}} Imperial Japanese Army in political issues. He {{was one of the most}} liberal of Emperor Hirohito's advisors, and favored friendly relations with Great Britain and the United States. However, he was careful to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> battles, and would concede defeat when he knew he could not win (e.g. his inability to prevent the Tripartite Pact).|$|E
25|$|Antonio had {{developed}} a strong relationship with Cardinal Jules Mazarin and was given responsibility for the French contingent within the College of Cardinals and for the nomination of Giulio Cesare Sacchetti at the papal conclave of 1644 which was to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> uncle's successor. But his efforts were in vain and the Spanish nominee, Giovanni Battista Pamphili (of the powerful Pamphili family), was elected as Pope Innocent X.|$|E

25|$|In 1958 the New York market ripped apart. The Yankees were {{becoming}} the dominant draw, and {{the cities of}} the West offered generations of new fans in much more sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring these big names to the West, Los Angeles gave Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour {{of the city and}} asked him to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> spot. The Giants were given the lease to the PCL San Francisco Seals digs while Candlestick Park was built for them.|$|E
25|$|David Stern is a {{computer}} geek who takes {{a job with the}} Dordogne River Valley archeological site just to be close to where his girlfriend is going to school. When Doniger calls Marek and asks him to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> three best people to return to New Mexico, Marek chooses Stern {{to be part of the}} team. When the science behind the ability to transmit people to other universes is discussed, Stern probably understands it better than anyone else. Stern is also the only one who recognizes that it is dangerous and chooses not to go. However, by not going, Stern becomes a key part of the team by assuring their survival in his innovations to rebuild the water walls that provide buffer for the re-building team. Stern saves their lives.|$|E

25|$|In the 2014 tour of England, Sharma secured {{his career}} best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's, with an {{aggressive}} spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win. During {{the first test}} of the series, Sharma suffered the slight ignominy of becoming Alastair Cook's sole Test wicket when caught down the leg side. India finished the series losing 3–1. He finished the 2015 three-match Test series in Sri Lanka with 13 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul in the third Test at SSC. At {{the end of the}} match, he was handed a one match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC), following an altercation with Dhammika Prasad {{in the course of the}} match. The series also saw him <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> 200th wicket in Tests. India won the series 2–1.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010, Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin signed on. Ashley Greene {{was offered}} the role of Sidney's cousin, Jill, but the role later went to Emma Roberts. Lake Bell was to play Deputy Judy Hicks, but dropped out four days before filming due to {{scheduling}} conflicts, causing the role to ultimately go to Marley Shelton. Nancy O'Dell reprises her role from {{the second and third}} films as a reporter. Roger L. Jackson returned as the voice of Ghostface. Lauren Graham was to play Kate Roberts, the mother of Roberts' character, but dropped out a few days into principal photography. Craven, like in the previous three films, has a cameo and took to his Twitter to ask fans to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> role (the cameo was, however, deleted from the final cut of the film). The Hollywood Reporter reported that Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell have cameos {{in the beginning of the}} film akin to Drew Barrymore and Jada Pinkett Smith in the first and second Scream. Shenae Grimes and Lucy Hale also have cameos in the film.|$|E
25|$|Booker T began teaming with Chris Benoit, eying the United States Championship again. Meanwhile, after {{a series}} of matches with MNM, Sharmell {{introduced}} some villainous tactics, to which Booker feigned ignorance. Benoit was allowed to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> next challenger to see who would face him at No Mercy, so Booker, Christian, and Orlando Jordan tried to impress Benoit by winning matches. He could not choose, so he made it a fatal four-way for No Mercy, where Benoit successfully defended his title. On the October 21 episode of SmackDown, Booker T defeated Benoit for the United States Championship, due to unseen help from Sharmell. Theodore Long later showed footage of Sharmell interfering in Booker's matches. Booker went to apologize to Benoit and give him a rematch, but then attacked Benoit, busting him open with the U.S. title belt. Turning heel once again {{for the first time since}} 2004, Booker cemented his heel turn boasting that he had been fully aware of what Sharmell had been doing and had been playing dumb to fool everyone.|$|E

25|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for Ferrari's home race at Monza, but a complete lack of movement {{for a few seconds}} at the start saw him drop down the order. Showing good pace however, he managed to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> way {{from the back of the}} field to fifth. Räikkönen blamed a 'clutch positioning' problem, whilst team boss Arrivabene suggested Räikkönen had caused the anti-stall to kick in himself due to 'messing with his fingers' although he clarified it saying he did not fully know at the time. Nevertheless, he remained at one podium of the season, as team mate Vettel finished second to take his tally to eight in twelve races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Räikkönen showed consistent performances in the practice sessions and qualified in 3rd, behind Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. Räikkönen maintained the position through the race despite being uncomfortable with the car, to take his second podium finish of the season. Räikkönen ended the season by finishing third in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to take his third podium of the year and securing fourth place in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
25|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} The Rock and Steve Austin. On the February 20 episode of SmackDown!, The Rock {{returned}} to WWE after a six-month hiatus from wrestling (since SummerSlam). On that evening, {{he was in}} a confrontation with Hulk Hogan before their WrestleMania X8 rematch at No Way Out. At the No Way Out event, The Rock defeated Hogan with the help of Mr. McMahon. On the following night's episode of Raw, The Rock returned to the Raw brand in a 20-man Battle royal that would determine the opponent for the World Heavyweight Championship. Rock however, was unable to win after he was eliminated by Booker T; after the match, Rock criticized Steve Austin for being chosen as the Superstar of the Decade by the WWE fans in January, beginning the feud between Rock and Austin. The following week on Raw, Austin, who was on a long hiatus before returning that previous Sunday at No Way Out, made his WWE television return, as he cut a promo about the WWE fans, before he was interrupted by Rock, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania because The Rock, himself, was obsessed of not beating Austin at a WrestleMania event by the time they fought at WrestleMania XV and X-Seven during a four-year span. As soon as the challenge was made, Raw General manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the following week on Raw, Rock would face Booker T in a match, and if he won, he would have the choice to face either Austin or Triple H at WrestleMania. On the March 10 episode of Raw, Rock, with Bischoff's approval, announced that he would <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> own opponent for later that night, {{which turned out to be}} The Hurricane, in hopes for Rock to gain an easy victory. However, Austin made his way down the entrance ramp, which distracted Rock and allowed Hurricane to Roll up Rock into a successful pinfall, which made the Austin-Rock match at WrestleMania official. On the March 24, and final episode of Raw leading into WrestleMania, Austin was banned from entering the arena that night. He managed to enter the arena and attack Rock, however, before Rock fled the ring.|$|E
500|$|For sequencing, {{the band}} decided that each band member would be {{allocated}} {{a side of}} the record, an arrangement inspired by Pink Floyd's 1969 double album Ummagumma. The band drew straws to select songs; Hurley won the draw and decided to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> solo track [...] "You Need the Glory", followed by Boon and Watt. The fourth side of the record was named [...] "Side Chaff", an admission that the songs present were the leftover songs.|$|E

His political opposition, and local dislike of his stance on slavery and participation in the treason trial, made him unlikely to win renomination, and he sought only to <b>pick</b> <b>his</b> successor. [...] His choice was defeated for the Whig nomination.|$|E
