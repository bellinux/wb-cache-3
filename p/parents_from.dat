5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, teachers and <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> the 1950s onwards, {{because of the}} alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E

In 2015 Ockwell-Smith branched away from the 'Calm' line of books to release The Gentle Sleep Book. The Gentle Sleep Book offers sleep advice from birth to five years and does not involve any controlled crying techniques. The Gentle Sleep Book sold 25,000 UK copies {{in the first year}} of publication and frequently appears on bestseller lists. The Gentle Parenting Book, which provides an introduction to gentle <b>parenting</b> <b>from</b> birth to seven years, was published in Spring 2016, closely followed by Why Your Baby's Sleep Matters, also in Spring 2016.|$|R
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Luís Alves {{moved with}} his <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> his grandparents' farm to Rio de Janeiro and was {{enrolled}} at the Seminário São Joaquim (Saint Joachim School), which became PedroII School in 1837. On 4 May 1818, he was admitted into the Royal Military Academy. The entire course (which ran from the first to seventh year) was mandatory for artillerymen and engineers but infantrymen were only required to take first- and fifth-year classes. Luís Alves took the first- and fifth-year classes in 1818 and 1819, respectively. Though he could have skipped the other years, he chose to take second-year classes in 1820 and third-year classes in 1821. The subjects he studied in the Royal Military Academy ranged from arithmetic, algebra and geometry to tactics, strategy, camping, fortification in campaign and terrain reconnaissance. He was promoted to alferes (equivalent to a modern-day second lieutenant) on 12 October 1818, and to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant) on 4 November 1820.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E

5|$|Sen, No-Face and Boh {{meet with}} the now benevolent Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face becomes Zeniba's spinner. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus {{revealing}} Haku's real identity as the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> {{among a group of}} pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They quietly walk back to their car (which is now covered in dust) and drive away.|$|E

5|$|The {{disappearance}} of Chandra Levy {{became a national}} topic {{of the news media}} in the summer of 2001, with 63 percent of Americans closely following the case. The media swamped Levy's <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> the moment they decided to go to Washington, D.C. in search of their daughter. According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.|$|E

5|$|They {{were created}} either as pendants, that is {{conceived}} as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both <b>parents,</b> <b>from</b> which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E
5|$|Worker {{termites}} {{undertake the}} most labour within the colony, {{being responsible for}} foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely caste {{to be found in}} infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components. It frees the <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Some termite species do not have a true worker caste, instead relying on nymphs that perform the same work without differentiating as a separate caste.|$|E
5|$|A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is {{admitted}} in obstetrics and gynaecology, and is revealed {{to suffer from}} advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her <b>parents,</b> <b>from</b> whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were Amish, shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who {{is admitted}} in orthopedics, coping {{with the news that}} he {{will never be able to}} compete in races after the extensive surgical procedure. Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has been spending the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic. At the conclusion of the episode, Yang confides in Burke, who unexpectedly proposes to her, whereas O'Malley, who finally admits how affected he was by the death of his father, proposes to Torres.|$|E

5|$|Bhimsen {{felt the}} need to finish off his rivals, but at the same time, felt a need to take {{precaution}} before going after immediate members of the royal household. For almost two years after returning to Kathmandu, Rana Bahadur had no official position in the government – he was neither a king, nor a regent, nor a minister – yet he felt no qualms in using the full state power. Not only did Rana Bahadur carry out the Baisathi Haran under Bhimsen's advice, he was also able to banish all non-vaccinated children, as well as their <b>parents,</b> <b>from</b> the town during a smallpox outbreak, in order to prevent King Girvan from catching that disease. Now, after almost two-year, all of a sudden Rana Bahadur was made mukhtiyar (chief authority) and Bhimsen tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. Bhimsen had also secretly learned of a plot to oust Rana Bahadur. Tribhuvan Khawas (Pradhan), a member of Sher Bahadur's faction, was imprisoned on the re-opened charges of conspiracy with the British that led to the Knox's mission, but for which pardon had already been doled out, and was ordered to be executed. Tribhuvan Khawas decided to reveal everyone that was involved in the dialogue with the British. Among those implicated was Sher Bahadur Shah.|$|E
5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E
5|$|There, Marty {{encounters}} the teenaged George, who is bullied by his classmate Biff. After Marty saves George from {{an oncoming}} car and is knocked unconscious, he awakens {{to find himself}} tended to by an infatuated Lorraine. Marty leaves and tracks down Doc's younger self to help him return to 1985. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently {{change the course of}} history and alter the future; because of this, Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. Marty realizes that he has prevented his <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> meeting and Doc warns Marty that he will be erased from existence if he does not find a way to introduce George to Lorraine. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty sets about introducing his parents, but he antagonizes Biff and his gang in the process.|$|E

5|$|Verdi paid close {{attention}} to his financial contracts, making sure he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased. For I Lombardi and Ernani (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); Attila and Macbeth (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire. His contracts with the publishers Ricordi in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on. He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace. In 1844 he purchased Il Pulgaro, 62 acres (23 hectares) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings, providing a home for his <b>parents</b> <b>from</b> May 1844. Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli ({{now known as the}} Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto's main street. In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant'Agata in Busseto, which had once belonged to his family. It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the Villa Verdi, where he lived from 1851 until his death.|$|E
