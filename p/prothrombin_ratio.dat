40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of aging on the {{anticoagulant}} response to warfarin. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A university hospital outpatient anticoagulation clinic. PATIENTS: All patients (n = 530) monitored in the anticoagulation clinic over a 10 -year period (1980 to 1990). The 530 study patients had {{a mean age of}} 61. 5 (+/- 14. 7) years (age range, 12 to 90 years). The patients were stratified into four age groups: younger than 50 years (n = 97); 50 to 59 years (n = 107); 60 to 69 years (n = 149); and 70 years or older (n = 177). MEASUREMENTS: For each patient, a dose-adjusted mean <b>prothrombin</b> time <b>ratio</b> was calculated by dividing the mean <b>prothrombin</b> time <b>ratio</b> by the mean daily warfarin dose. RESULTS: Older patients {{were more likely to be}} female (P less than 0. 001), to have more medical problems (P less than 0. 001), to be taking more medications (P less than 0. 001), and to weigh less than younger patients (P less than 0. 001). Across age groups, there were no significant differences in the use of medications that potentiated or inhibited the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. The <b>prothrombin</b> time <b>ratio,</b> when adjusted for dose, was significantly increased in older patients (P less than 0. 001). The increased anticoagulant response to warfarin seen with increasing patient age persisted even after simultaneously controlling for relevant demographic and clinical variables in a multivariate model. Other factors significantly associated with an increased sensitivity to warfarin included use of a medication with a potentiating interactive effect with warfarin, female gender, and overall medication use. Increased body weight and duration of warfarin use exceeding 6 months were found to be inversely related to anticoagulant response. CONCLUSION: The anticoagulant response to warfarin is exaggerated with advancing age. This finding emphasizes the need for close monitoring of older patients treated with warfarin therapy...|$|R

40|$|From {{clinical}} observation {{it would}} appear that hyperthyroid patients are particularly sensitive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin.

War-farin produced a greater fall in factors II and VII and a greater increase in PTR and PTT-K in the hyperthroid state than in the euthyroid state. The enhanced response to warfarin in hyperthroid-ism was, however, relatively greater for the PTR than for the PTT-K.

40|$|The {{management}} of trauma-related coagulopathy and haemorrhage is changing from a reactive strategy to a proactive early intervention with blood products and haemostatic agents. Although major haemorrhage and massive transfusion {{are associated with}} higher mortality, the pattern of this association with modern trauma care is poorly described. In addition, early predictors of massive transfusion, which might trigger a proactive haemostatic resuscitation strategy, are not currently available. We review recent literature relating to predictors of massive transfusions {{and the relationship between}} transfusion and mortality. Stanworth and colleagues have explored the relation between blood loss and mortality in trauma patients in a study stimulated by the changing approach to early trauma management [1]. The traditional approach advocates packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions and early coagulation testing in the hospital laboratory using assays such as the <b>prothrombin</b> time <b>ratio,</b> the activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, and platelet concentration. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and sometimes cryoprecipitate was based on results that may be delayed for 60 minutes following sampling. Current guidelines recommend transfusion when <b>prothrombin</b> time <b>ratio</b> or activated partial thromboplastin time ratio> 1. 5, platelet count < 50 × 10 9 /l, or fibrinogen level < 1. 5 to 2. 0 g/l [2], or after a certain proportion of the circulating volume is lost.

Sex ratio (male/female) was 3 / 1, mean age was 50.8 (1.5) years, and median admission SAPS II score was 82 [78 – 88]. CA was due to acute myocardial infarction in 66 patients (70  %), acute decompensation of chronic cardiomyopathy in 8 (8.5  %), pulmonary embolism in 4 (4.3  %), drug intoxication in 3 (3.2  %), anaphylactic shock in 3 (3.2  %), and miscellaneous causes in 10 (10.6  %). CA occurred out of hospital for 78 (83  %) patients, and ventricular fibrillation was the first rhythm in 56 (59.6  %). Median no-flow and low-flow times were 0 [0 – 5] and 30 [15 – 42.75] min, respectively. Before VA-ECMO initiation, median left ventricle ejection fraction was 15 [10 – 20] % and aortic velocity time integral (VTI) 7 [5 – 9] cm. Median time between cardiac arrest and VA-ECMO implantation was 7.4 [3.3 – 14] hours, and median duration of ECMO support was 4 [2 – 6] days. Fifty-five (59  %) patients died, while on VA-ECMO, 33 (35.1  %) were successfully weaned, 4 (4.3  %) were bridged to a left ventricle assist device and 2 (2.1  %) to heart transplantation. 28 -day, 6 -month and 12 -month survival rates were 29.8, 27.7 and 26.6  %, respectively. Causes of death were multiple organ failure (65.2  %), brain death (16.7  %), postanoxic encephalopathy (13.6  %) and CA recurrence (4.5  %).

The first comparison group consisted of 15 patients with hypertension stage II, the second comparison group consisted of 15 patients with OA stage 2, the control group - 15 almost healthy people.

The patients {{were divided into two}} subgroups according to the blood loss and time from the end of pelvic arterial embolization to complete hemostasis: good-response (16 patients) and poor-response groups (5 patients). The following predictive factors were compared between the groups: (1) patient characteristics; (2) blood loss; (3) time between delivery (or onset of bleeding) and pelvic arterial embolization; (4) obstetrical disseminated intravascular coagulation score comprising clinical background, clinical signs, and laboratory data; (5) individual disseminated intravascular coagulation score; (6) shock index; and (7) laboratory data including platelet count, <b>prothrombin</b> time-international normalized <b>ratio,</b> fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products, and antithrombin-III at the time of pelvic arterial embolization.
