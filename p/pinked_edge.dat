I never was the figure for clothes, anyway. Long, gangling boy to start with, and a lean, stoop-shouldered man. I found out some time ago that a fellow wa'n't {{necessarily}} a bad fellow because he had money, or a good fellow because he hadn't. But I hadn't quite got over hating a man because he had style. Well, I suppose {{it was a kind of}} a survival, as old Tylor calls it. But I tell you, I sniffed round you a good while before I made up my mind to swallow you. And that turnout of yours, it kind of staggered me, after I got over the clothes. Why, it wa'n't so much the colt,--any man likes to ride after a sorrel colt; and it wa'n't so much the cutter: it was the red linin' with <b>pinked</b> <b>edges</b> that you had to your robe; and it was the red ribbon that you had tied round the waist of your whip. When I see that ribbon on that whip, damn you, I wanted to kill you." [...] Bartley broke out into a laugh, but Kinney went on soberly. [...] "But, thinks I to myself: 'Here! Now you stop right here! You wait! You give the fellow a chance for his life. Let him have a chance to show whether that whip-ribbon goes all through him, first. If it does, kill him cheerfully; but give him a chance first.' Well, sir, I gave you the chance, and you showed that you deserved it. I guess you taught me a lesson. When I see you at work, pegging away hard at something or other, every time I went into your office, up and coming with everybody, and just as ready to pass the time of day with me as the biggest bug in town, thinks I: 'You'd have made a great mistake to kill that fellow, Kinney!'

As the rather heavy flowers tend to bow their heads, Abraham Darby is suited to be trained as a climber.|$|R
5000|$|The 1980s {{began with}} the first Surgeon General’s Report on the Health Consequences of Smoking for Women. [...] This report—published nearly 15 years after the {{original}} 1964 Surgeon General’s Report—came nearly sixty years after tobacco companies began marketing their products to women. The smoking rate of women in 1980 was at 29.3%. In 1987, Brown & Williamson introduced the Capri cigarette, which following suit with other feminine cigarettes was a long, slim, elegant cigarette geared toward feminine hands. 1990 saw the women’s smoking rate at 22.8%, continuing its slow decline. The Virginia Slims tennis tour {{came to an end}} in 1994, after 23 successful years. This was just one of many broad spectrum advertising methods that ended in the 1980s and 1990s as public sentiments regarding smoking began their shift. The 1990s were marked by continued restrictions on smoking in public and workplaces. The late 1980s and 1990s were also marked by increased marketing to teenagers and young adults. Many of the same marketing strategies used with women were used with this target group. By 1998, the women’s smoking rate had dropped to 22%. 1998 also marked the year of the Master Settlement Agreement. The beginning of the 21st century saw women smoking at a rate of 22.8%, which was a slight increase compared to the previous decade. [...] Advertising and marketing remained static after the 1998 Settlement Agreement. Advertising campaigns looked to present more modern and cutting-edge packaging and language, appealing to a younger and hipper demographic. In 2001, the most recent Surgeon General’s Report in regards to women and smoking was released. [...] RJ Reynolds entered the women’s market in 2007, with its Camel No. 9 cigarette. The packaging is very contemporary in feel, and very feminine at the same time. It features <b>pink</b> <b>edging</b> as a distinct contrast on the black packaging and the interior of the package is lined in pink foil. The cigarettes are sold in light and menthol light varieties, with the latter featuring a teal highlight and foil, instead of the pink of the regular lights. [...] The first decade of this century has also been marked by mass smoking regulations. A multitude of cities, municipalities, and states have passed legislation prohibiting smoking in public places, such as bars, restaurants, and an assortment of other public venues. [...] This is a growing phenomenon, which will help to reduce smoking rates in the United States. The overall smoking rate in the United States has dropped from approximately 46% in 1950 to approximately 21% in 2004.|$|R
6000|$|Order, Diptera (Flies).—The sexes differ {{little in}} colour. The {{greatest}} difference, known to Mr. F. Walker, {{is in the}} genus Bibio, in which the males are blackish or quite black, and the females obscure brownish-orange. The genus Elaphomyia, discovered by Mr. Wallace[444] in New Guinea, is highly remarkable, as the males are furnished with horns, of which the females are quite destitute. The horns spring from beneath the eyes, and curiously resemble those of stags, being either branched or palmated. They equal in length {{the whole of the}} body in one of the species. They might be thought to serve for fighting, but as in one species they are of a beautiful <b>pink</b> colour, <b>edged</b> with black, with a pale central stripe, and as these insects have altogether a very elegant appearance, it is perhaps more probable that the horns serve as ornaments. That the males of some Diptera fight together is certain; for Prof. Westwood[445] has several times seen this with some species of Tipula or Harry-long-legs. Many observers believe that when gnats (Culicidæ) dance in the air in a body, alternately rising and falling, the males are courting the females. The mental faculties of the Diptera are probably fairly well developed, for their nervous system is more highly developed than in most other Orders of insects.[446] ...|$|R
