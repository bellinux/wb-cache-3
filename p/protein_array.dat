Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) can be used to degrade mRNA levels of a specific gene, thereby reducing the corresponding protein levels within cells.

50|$|Proteins {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} {{to changes in}} their microenvironment. This presents a challenge in maintaining protein arrays in a stable condition over extended periods of time. In situ methods involve on-chip synthesis of proteins as and when required, directly from the DNA using cell-free protein expression systems. Since DNA is a highly stable molecule it does not deteriorate over time and is therefore suited to long-term storage. This approach is also advantageous in that it circumvents the laborious and often costly processes of separate protein purification and DNA cloning, since proteins are made and immobilised simultaneously in a single step on the chip surface. Examples of in situ techniques are PISA (protein in situ array), NAPPA (nucleic acid programmable <b>protein</b> <b>array)</b> and DAPA (DNA array to <b>protein</b> <b>array).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} methods of producing protein arrays require the separate in vivo expression of {{hundreds or thousands of}} proteins, followed by separate purification and immobilization of the proteins on a solid surface. Cell-free <b>protein</b> <b>array</b> technology attempts to simplify protein microarray construction by bypassing the need to express the proteins in bacteria cells and the subsequent need to purify them. It takes advantage of available cell-free protein synthesis technology which has demonstrated that protein synthesis can occur without an intact cell as long as cell extracts containing the DNA template, transcription and translation raw materials and machinery are provided. Common sources of cell extracts used in cell-free <b>protein</b> <b>array</b> technology include wheat germ, Escherichia coli, and rabbit reticulocyte. Cell extracts from other sources such as hyperthermophiles, hybridomas, Xenopus oocytes, insect, mammalian and human cells have also been used.|$|E
50|$|In the in situ method, protein {{synthesis}} {{is carried out}} on a <b>protein</b> <b>array</b> surface that is pre-coated with a protein-capturing reagent or antibody. Once the newly synthesized proteins are released from the ribosome, the tag sequence that is also synthesized at the N- or C-terminus of each nascent protein will be bound by the capture reagent or antibody, thus immobilizing the proteins to form an array. Commonly used tags include polyhistidine (His)6 and glutathione s-transferase (GST).|$|E
40|$|Advancements in {{lithography}} {{methods for}} printing biomolecules on surfaces are {{proving to be}} potentially beneficial for disease screening and biological research. Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) is a versatile micro and nanofabrication technique that {{has the ability to}} produce functional biomolecule arrays. The greatest advantage, with respect to the printing mechanism, is that DPN adheres to the sensitive mild conditions required for biomolecules such as proteins. We have developed an optimised, high-throughput printing technique for fabricating <b>protein</b> <b>arrays</b> using DPN. This study highlights the fabrication of a prostate specific antigen (PSA) immunoassay detectable by fluorescence. Spot sizes are typically no larger than 8 mm in diameter and limits of detection for PSA are comparable with a commercially available ELISA kit. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of the array surface gives great insight into how the nitrocellulose substrate functions to retain protein integrity. This is the first report of <b>protein</b> <b>arrays</b> being printed on nitrocellulose using the DPN technique and the smallest feature size yet to be achieved on this type of surface.

40|$|Motivation: Proteins play {{a crucial}} role in {{biological}} activity, so much can be learned from measuring protein expression and posttranslational modification quantitatively. The reverse-phase <b>protein</b> lysate <b>arrays</b> allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in many different cellular samples simultaneously. Existing approaches to quantify <b>protein</b> <b>arrays</b> use parametric response curves fit to dilution series data. The results can be biased when the parametric function does not fit the data. Results: We propose a non-parametric approach which adapts to any monotone response curve. The non-parametric approach is shown to be promising via both simulation and real data studies; it reduces the bias due to model misspecification and protects against outliers in the data. The non-parametric approach enables more reliable quantification of <b>protein</b> lysate <b>arrays.</b> Availability: Code to implement the proposed method in the statistical package R is available at...|$|R
