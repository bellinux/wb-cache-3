40|$|International audienceThere {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the study of}} preferences for their utility in solving problems related to decision making. Most of the preference representation languages developed in the literature are based on comparative preference statements since they offer a simple and intuitive way for expressing preferences. They can be further interpreted following different semantics, imparting a greater flexibility on how outcomes can be compared. So far the main objective has been to rank-order the set of outcomes given a set of comparative preference statements and one or several semantics. Tackling this problem from a different angle, we look into the behavioural aspects of the <b>preference</b> <b>semantics</b> and statements by attempting to formalise the intuition behind them using postulates studied in preference logics and non-monotonic reasoning. We select the postulates w. r. t. three criteria: coherence, syntax independence and inference. Thus, our analysis provides a means to determine those properties that are satisfied for a given <b>preference</b> <b>semantics...</b>|$|E

5000|$|A key {{component}} {{of the notion of}} <b>preference</b> in <b>semantics</b> was that the interpretation of an utterance is not a well- or ill-formed notion, as was argued in Chomskyan approaches, such as those of Jerry Fodor and Jerrold Katz. It was rather that a semantic interpretation was the best available, even though some preferences might not be satisfied. So, in [...] "The machine answered the question with a low whine" [...] the agent of [...] "answer" [...] does not satisfy that verb's preference for a human answerer—which would cause it to be deemed ill-formed by Fodor and Katz—but is accepted as sub-optimal or metaphorical, and, now, conventional. The function of the algorithm is not to determine well-formedness at all but to make the optimal selection of word-senses to participate in the overall interpretation. Thus, in [...] "The Pole answered..." [...] the system will always select the human sense of the agent and not the inanimate one if it gives a more coherent interpretation overall.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{decentralized}} method for communities of agents to reach semantic agreements on subjective ontology elements’ correspondences / mappings, via belief propagation.

We address this problem as a distributed extension of the max-plus algorithm via belief propagation. We show the potential of such an approach in a number of networks with varying complexity and for different cases of semantic disagreement between agents. ...|$|R

It is also then easy to find a total order on outcomes which extends the conditional preference order, and an approach to constrained optimisation can be used which generalises a natural approach for CP-nets.

First, an exposition is given on how aboutness relates to relevance - a fundamental notion in information retrieval. A short summary is given on how aboutness is defined in more prominent information retrieval models.

These allows properties of aboutness to be expressed independent of any given information retrieval model. As a consequence, information retrieval models can be theoretically compared according to what aboutness postulates they support. The Boolean and Coordinate retrieval models are compared in this fashion. In addition to model-theoretic aboutness, preferential entailment and conditional probabilities are employed to define aboutness between primitive information carriers.
