40|$|Granulation is an {{important}} industrial process used to produce many foods, medicines, consumer products, and industrial intermediate products. This thesis focuses on high shear wet granulation with the specific case study of detergent manufacture using a high shear <b>pin</b> <b>mixer.</b> The key rate process in detergent manufacturing {{was determined to be}} the mechanical dispersion of the semi-solid surfactant binder. The <b>pin</b> <b>mixer</b> and mechanical dispersion utilized experiments, population balance models, and discrete element method (DEM) models. ^ The mechanical dispersion of the surfactant binder was studied using a lab scale 6 liter <b>pin</b> <b>mixer.</b> An experimental method was developed to isolate mechanical dispersion from the other rate processes of granulation. Experiments were conducted over a range of impeller speeds, mixing times, and surfactant injection temperatures. Two surfactants where used each with different yield stresses. The yield stresses of both surfactants were characterized using uniaxial compression tests and extrapolated to the impact speeds observed in the <b>pin</b> <b>mixer.</b> Using the yield stress to calculate the Stokes deformation number revealed that the breakage of surfactant would occur at all impact conditions in the <b>pin</b> <b>mixer.</b> The mechanical dispersion results demonstrated that the rate process could be modeled as a breakage process. The results determined that the key parameter governing the mechanical dispersion of paste was the number of revolutions of the impeller. This implies that impaction or sudden stress from the impeller is the mechanism that causes nuclei breakage. ^ The results of the mechanical dispersion experiments were then used to develop a mechanistic semi-empirical model. Because the results indicated that breakage should occur for every impact with the impeller, the model was based on particle impact efficiency between the impeller and nuclei. The impact efficiency was described in a way similar to particle gas filtration where the Stokes number is the characteristic dimensionless group. The population balance model was breakage only and was able to accurately predict the full size distributions of the surfactant nuclei. The results showed that the model was able to accurately account for the effect of tip speed and number of revolutions. This was found by fitting the simulation to a single impeller speed and then predicting the size distributions by varying only the velocity input. ^ Finally, a DEM unit shear cell was developed to understand the transmission of stress from a bulk material to a single large particle of interest similar to surfactant nuclei. The simulation examined the effect of both shear rate, placement of the large particle, and the material properties. The results determined that the material properties used in the simulation had a much greater effect on the shear profile and stress in the shear cell than the effect of the macroscopic shear rate. Using the von Mises yield criteria, the results demonstrated that the shear cell transmitted more stress to the large particle than the yield stress characterized experimentally from the surfactant. The results indicate that the surfactant should break in shear within the <b>pin</b> <b>mixer.</b> ^ Mechanical dispersion has been successfully modeled for the case of detergent granulation in the <b>pin</b> <b>mixer.</b> The combined results demonstrate that mechanical dispersion of surfactant can be modeled as a breakage process. The number of impeller orations and the Stokes number are key parameters to accurately describe and model the simulation. The surfactant should break apart due to both impact and shear within the granulator. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{value-added}} granulated {{organic fertilizer}} produced from poultry litter and biosolids using agglomeration techniques with a <b>pin</b> <b>mixer</b> is described. The granulated organic fertilizer includes granules biosolids, a nitrification inhibitor, such as dicyandiamide, and a binding agent, such as lignosulfonate, urea formaldehyde, or water. The nitrogen {{concentration of the}} granulated organic fertilizer is increased by being fortified with urea. The poultry litter and biosolids formulated into the granulated organic fertilizer aid in flowability, storage, and spreading, while value-added plant nutrient ingredients provide an environmentally safer fertilizer than fresh poultry litter, municipal biosolids and/or many commercially available products commonly used in urban and agricultural systems. The binding agents change the fertilizer granule water soluble phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations and reduce fines and dust. The nitrification inhibitor reduces nitrogen losses via leaching and denitrification, while biosolids decrease water soluble and total phosphorus concentrations in runoff water for environmental protection...|$|E

40|$|Dust {{generated}} from electric arc furnaces (EAF's) employed in steelmaking plants is currently {{listed as a}} hazardous waste because of its toxic metgllic constituents, i. e., lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and hexavalent chromium (Cr 6). Disposal of the waste at controlled landfills is not only expensive, but also has associated long-term liability concerns. Recycling of pelletized electric arc furnace (EAF) dust from carbon and low-alloy steel production was evaluated through a comprehensive, experimental program at a participating steel plant. Equipment for pelletizing the dust was evaluated, and a 3 -foot-diameter disc pelletizer with an 8 -inch-diameter <b>pin</b> <b>mixer</b> was selected for the pilot trials. two separate blocks of testing. The experimental design was comprised of Block I focused {{on the effects of}} recycling fresh pelletized EAF dust on power consumption and other important variables, whereas Block I 1 focused on conducting a fate analysis of zinc and other heavy metals under continuous recycling conditions. The tests demonstrated the feasibility of pelletizing and recycling EAF dust. Power consumption increased approximately 4 percent during recycling. No significant change occurred in the tap-to-tap heat time. An increase in coke consumption was noted during recycling. Because plant operating conditions precluded the availability of high zinc-bearing scrap for the Block I 1 tests, the zinc content of the dust was almost 50 percent lower than that in Block I. despite some degree of recycle. The zinc content of the dust, however, increased from 9 weight percent to 15 weight percent during the short continuous recycling period. Preliminary economic.,analyses show that the recycling option may be a favorable one for many steel plants. The EAF dust recycling technology is immediately applicable; it requires only specific engineering design for a given steel plant installation and the resolution of specific permitting requirements. 89...|$|E
