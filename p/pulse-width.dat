The effects of the outer terminators, cable length, and connection of the voltage limiter on the induced voltages at the systems are studied by using the proposed EMT approach. It has been found that adding a resistance between the system’s shielding enclosure and the ground can effectively reduce the coupling through the shielded cable.

2500|$|The {{simplest}} (and also, the highest-amplitude) waveform {{that can}} be produced by a two-level converter is a square wave; however this would produce unacceptable levels of harmonic distortion, so some form of <b>Pulse-width</b> modulation (PWM) is always used to improve the harmonic distortion of the converter. As {{a result of the}} PWM, the IGBTs are switched on and off many times (typically 20) in each mains cycle. This results in high switching losses in the IGBTs and reduces the overall transmission efficiency. [...] Several different PWM strategies are possible for HVDC but in all cases the efficiency of the two-level converter is significantly poorer than that of a LCC because of the higher switching losses. A typical LCC HVDC converter station has power losses of around 0.7% at full load (per end, excluding the HVDC line or cable) while with 2-level voltage-source converters the equivalent figure is 2-3% per end.|$|E

Delivery of micro-Joules level energies to the tissue was made possible by a large, 31 μm, air-cored inhibited-coupling Kagome fiber. We overcome the fiber’s low NA by using lenses made of high refractive index ZnS, which produced an optimal focusing condition with 0. 23 NA objective. The optical design achieved a focused laser spot size of 4. 5 μm diameter covering a 75 × 75 μm 2  scan area in a miniaturized setting.

40|$|Most of the {{experiments}} planned for LCLS will require accurate measurements of xray pulse temporal history, including pulse shape and relative timing with optical lasers. These requirements are particularly daunting given the recent demands for shorter <b>pulse-widths</b> (< 50 fs), {{some of which are}} discussed at the LCLS workshop[1]. This LOI addresses a novel approach to these measurements. There are two main elements: a new xray detection technology which converts the xray temporal history into an amplitude modulated optical probe beam and a high-speed recording technique that records this modulated optical probe beam, in a single-transient format. Conversion of the xray temporal history into the optical domain is accomplished in a semiconductor (e. g., GaAs). The xrays produce a modulation of the material’s dielectric function which is then sensed by the phase modulation of the optical probe beam. Through interferometry this phase modulation is converted into an amplitude modulation of the optical probe beam. With the xray information in the optical domain, both pulse shape information and cross-timing with other lasers is more readily accomplished. Our approach to the optical recording element is to use “temporal imaging ” to “stretch ” the temporal duration of the short optical pulse, in a very high-fidelity manner. The resulting optical pulse is “magnified ” in time, resulting in a slower pulse which can then be measured and recorded with more conventional means optical techniques, such as optical streak cameras.

We have investigated the optical properties of thin ITO films in the ultraviolet spectrum The transmission and reflection measurements showed that thin ITO films had better transparencies than thin Au films for wavelengths greater than 280 mn. Using a microwave compatible fabrication process, we have fabricated Au and ITO based Schottky photediodes on n-/n+ GaN epitaxial layers. We have made current-voltage (I-V), spectral quantum efficiency, and high-speed characterization of the fabricated devices. I-V characterization showed us that the Au-Schottky samples had better electrical characteristics mainly due to the larger Schottky barrier. However, due to the better optical transparency, ITO-Schottky devices exhibited higher quantum efficiencies compared to Au-Schottky devices. ITO-Schottky photodiodes with ∼ 80 nm thick ITO films resulted in a maximum quantum efficiency of 47 %, whereas Au-Schottky photodiode samples with ∼ 10 nm thick Au films displayed a maximum efficiency of 27 % in the visible-blind spectrum.

40|$|Currently, {{considerable}} resurgent interest {{exists in}} the concept of superradiance (SR), i. e., accelerated relaxation of excited dipoles due to cooperative spontaneous emission, first proposed by Dicke in 1954. Recent authors have discussed SR in diverse contexts, including cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum phase transitions, and plasmonics. At the heart of these various experiments lies the coherent coupling of constituent particles to each other via their radiation field that cooperatively governs the dynamics of the whole system. In the most exciting form of SR, called superfluorescence (SF), macroscopic coherence spontaneously builds up out of an initially incoherent ensemble of excited dipoles and then decays abruptly. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of this photon-mediated, cooperative, many-body state in a very unlikely system: an ultradense electron-hole plasma in a semiconductor. We observe intense, delayed pulses, or bursts, of coherent radiation from highly photo-excited semiconductor quantum wells with a concomitant sudden decrease in population from total inversion to zero. Unlike previously reported SF in atomic and molecular systems that occur on nanosecond time scales, these intense SF bursts have picosecond <b>pulse-widths</b> and are delayed in time by tens of picoseconds with respect to the excitation pulse. They appear only at sufficiently high excitation powers and magnetic fields and sufficiently low temperatures - where various interactions causing decoherence are suppressed. We present theoretical simulations based on the relaxation and recombination dynamics of ultrahigh-density electron-hole pairs in a quantizing magnetic field, which successfully capture the salient features of the experimental observations.
