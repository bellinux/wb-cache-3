He was an early opponent of German Nazism and assisted refugee scientists, including Enrico Fermi, by helping them find work in the United States, and to adjust to life in a new country.|$|E

The plan had to be given up and, after Mary and Eleanor's failure to negotiate peace between the Empire and France, Mary's letters to Charles began to resemble the theatrical outbursts of their aunt Margaret.|$|E

At {{the conclusion of}} the study, P put forward a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 250,000lbf engine called the XLR-129, which used a two-position expanding nozzle to provide increased efficiency over a wide range of altitudes.|$|E

5|$|A 1990 CDOT design <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new {{bridge was}} dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 {{the city of}} Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT {{expedited}} the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|A <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new {{underground}} railway {{running from}} Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party {{set up by}} the British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened as part of a second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. Cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones.|$|E
5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began to wane, Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered running for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to the Paducah Sun showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> coal severance tax.|$|E

5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{with the}} Royal Commission's report {{about to be}} published, the GNP {{returned}} to Parliament with two bills for consideration. The first bill revived the 1903 <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> branch from Piccadilly Circus to the City of London, passing and interchanging with Strand station. The second proposed an extension and relocation of Strand station to the junction of Strand and Surrey Street. From there the line was to continue as a single tunnel under the River Thames to Waterloo. The first bill was again delayed and withdrawn. Of the second, only the relocation of Strand station was permitted.|$|E

Brooks' <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar against his better judgment.|$|E
