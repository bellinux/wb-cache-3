50|$|Often used in disc brakes, {{the brake}} caliper {{assembly}} consists {{of one to}} two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel <b>pistons</b> (caliper <b>pistons).</b> <b>Brake</b> calipers {{are one of the}} most important parts of a vehicle and are essential for your car's ability to stop.The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels using the friction they create with metal disks (rotors). They work by taking the pressure given by the master cylinder to force the pistons against the rotor. The development and use of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902. In a disc-braking system the rotors are attached to the car's wheels and spin together.|$|R

40|$|Low {{pressure}} die casting is process to make the xi-simmetric product such as cylinder head, <b>piston,</b> <b>brake</b> drum and etc. The process is injected the molten metal with high speeds and pressure into a metallic die. The low {{pressure die}} casting process has some advantages as a low-cost and high-efficiency precision forming technique. The low {{pressure die casting}} having the permanent die and filling systems are placed over the furnace containing the molten alloy. The filling of the cavity is obtained by forcing using the pressurized gas to order a rise the molten metal into a tube, which connects the die to the furnace. The tube called stalk made from ceramics because ceramics has high temperature resistance and high corrosion resistance. However, care should be taken for the thermal stress when the tube is dipped into the molten metal. To reduce the risk of fracture it is important because fracture may happen due to the thermal stresses. In this paper, thermo-fluid analysis is performed to calculate surface heat transfer coefficient. Then, the finite element method is applied to consider the thermal stresses when the stalk is dipped into the crucible with varying the dipping speeds. It is found that the stalk with slowly dipping is better than fast dipping to reduce the thermal stress...|$|E

The performance of a short duration wind tunnel which uses the thermal decomposition of nitrous oxide to augment the flow stagnation enthalpy is simulated in the present work.

However, by introducing a mixture of nitrous oxide and nitrogen ahead of the piston, {{it should be possible to}} provide a test gas which closely simulates the properties of air.
