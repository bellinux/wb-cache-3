40|$|AbstractStatement of the problemPoly methyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) acrylic resin, although {{being the most}} popular denture base material, is associated with poor mechanical properties. It has been documented that acrylic resin can be strengthened with an addition of structural component (filler) added in the acrylic matrix, to form a composite structure. ObjectiveTo evaluate and compare the transverse strength, impact strength, surface hardness and water sorption of 10 % and 20 % zirconia (ZrO 2) reinforced high impact acrylic resin with that of high impact acrylic resin (Trevalon HI, Dentsply India). Materials and methodsThere were 30 specimens {{in each of the}} four tests, amounting to a total of 120 specimens. Each of the tests had 10 specimens fabricated from high impact acrylic resin (control); 10 specimens fabricated from 10 % zirconia (ZrO 2) and 10 specimens fabricated from 20 % zirconia (ZrO 2) reinforced high impact acrylic resin. Specimens were subjected to the test of transverse strength in Universal Testing Machine, impact strength in Izod <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> and surface hardness by Vickers Microhardness tester according to ISO Specification No. 1567. Water sorption was assessed according to ADA Specification No. 12. Data were analyzed by means of a one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison test. ResultsA significant increase in the transverse strength was observed in the reinforced specimens when compared to the control group. Impact strength and surface hardness were found having lesser values compared to the control group. Water sorption was found to increase on the addition of 10 % and 20 % zirconia (ZrO 2) but the value lied below 0. 8 mg/cm 2 i. e. within the limit of ADA Specification No. 12. ConclusionReinforcement of acrylic resin with zirconia powder affects its physical and mechanical properties significantly...|$|E

Maheu and Bakht (1994) developed a new barrier wall using GFRP, New Fiber Composite Material for Reinforcing Concrete (NEFMAC) grids, with connection to the deck slab by means of double-headed tension bars of steel spaced at 300  mm. This new barrier wall system was adopted in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CSA 2006 a). El-Salakawy et al. (2003) tested to-collapse PL- 2 and PL- 3 barrier walls reinforced with low-modulus GFRP bars. They conducted <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> (El-Salakawy et al. 2005) on the developed barriers in lieu of vehicle crash testing. In 2007, El-Gamal et al. (2007) conducted <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> on PL- 2 and PL- 3 barrier walls reinforced with GFRP bars with lower tensile strength and bigger modulus of elasticity than those used in the earlier <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing.</b> In 2011, Charron et al. (2011) developed a precast bridge parapet made with fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) using the nonlinear finite-element computer modeling. Specific properties of high- and ultrahigh-performance FRC were exploited in these designs. Others conducted finite-element analysis modeling of GFRP-reinforced bridge barrier (Hedjazi et al. 2016; Khederzadeh and Sennah 2015). They conducted experimental testing on the developed FRC barrier to examine the barrier wall cantilever action and compared the results with numerical simulation. Buth et al. (2003) conducted vehicle crash test on a 685 -mm-height bridge open-rail reinforced with glass fibre-reinforced polymer bars. Sennah et al. (2011, 2014) developed GFRP-reinforced PL- 3 barriers and crash-tested it using tractor-trailer and then tested under static loading to collapse (Khederzadeh and Sennah 2014). These tested resulted in two MTO Standard Drawings that are currently used by contractors and consulting engineering to bid on MTO bridge projects. Few authors conducted tests on the capacity of barrier–deck junction incorporating GFRP with headed-ends and bars with 180 ° hooks (Azimi et al. 2014 a, b; Rostami et al. 2016). El-Salakawy and Islam (2014) examined experimentally two repair strategies of a GFRP-reinforced concrete bridge barrier damage by vehicle impact. Most recently, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, AASHTO (2009) established bridge guide specifications for GFRP-reinforced concrete bridge decks and traffic railings. However, this guide does not provide procedure for the design of the barrier wall except for the diagonal tension in the deck slab below the barrier–deck junction based on a recent work by Matta and Nanni (2009).|$|R

Finite element models of the cast-in-place and retrofit T 203 and T 501 barrier specimens were developed using LS-DYNA, and they were validated using the <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests.</b> Using those models, vehicular crash simulations were conducted to NCHRP Report 350 Test Level- 3 and Test Level- 4 standards to predict the performance and robustness of the retrofit T 203 and T 501 barrier designs when subjected to large impact forces...|$|R
40|$|Occupant {{thoracic}} injury incurred during {{side impact}} automotive crashes constitutes {{a significant portion}} of all fatal and non-fatal automotive injuries. The limited space between the impacting vehicle and occupant can result in significant loads and corresponding injury prior to deceleration of the impacting vehicle. Within the struck vehicle, impact occurs between the occupant and various interior components. Injury is sustained to human structural components such as the thoracic cage or shoulder, and to the internal visceral components such as the heart, lungs, or aorta. Understanding the mechanism behind these injuries is an important step in improving the side impact crash safety of vehicles. This study is focused on the development of a human body numerical model for the purpose of predicting thoracic response and trauma in side impact automotive crash. The human body model has been created using a previously developed thoracic numerical model, originally used for predicting thoracic trauma under simple impact conditions. The original version of the thorax model incorporated three-dimensional finite element representations of the spine, ribs, heart, lungs, major blood vessels, rib cage surface muscles and upper limbs. The present study began with improvements to the original thorax model and furthered with the development of remaining body components such that the model could be assessed in side impact conditions. The improvements to the thoracic model included improved geometry and constitutive response of the surface muscles, shoulder and costal cartilage. This detailed thoracic model was complimented with a pelvis, lower limbs, an abdomen and a head to produce the full body model. These components were implemented in a simplified fashion to provide representative response without significant computational costs. The model was developed and evaluated in a stepwise fashion using experimental data from the literature including side abdominal and pelvic <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests.</b> The accuracy of the model response was investigated using experimental testing performed on post mortem human subjects (PMHS) during side and front thoracic <b>pendulum</b> <b>impacts.</b> The model produced good agreement for the side thoracic and side shoulder <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> and reasonable correlation during the frontal thoracic <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test.</b> Complex loading via side sled <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> was then investigated where the body was loaded unbelted in a NHTSA-type and WSU-type side sled test system. The thorax response was excellent when considering force, compression and injury (viscous criterion) versus time. Compression in the thorax was influenced by the arm position, which when aligned with the coronal plane produced the most aggressive form of compressive loading possible. The simplified components provided good response, falling slightly outside experimental response corridors defined as one standard deviation from the average of the experimental PMHS data. Overall, the predicted model response showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data, {{while at the same time}} highlighting areas for future developments. The results from this study suggested that the numerical finite element model developed herein could be used as a powerful tool for improving side impact automotive safety...|$|R

40|$|Four {{kinds of}} nitroamine {{propellants}} with different RDX contents (10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 %) {{were prepared to}} study the effect of RDX content on the mechanical properties and combustion properties of nitroamine propellant. The mechanical properties and combustion properties of nitroamine propellant at the normal temperature (20  °C) and low temperature (− 40  °C) were <b>test</b> by using <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine,</b> drop hammer <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> and closed bomb vessel. The test {{results show that the}} impact strength of 30 % RDX-contained nitramine propellant is maximum, but 40 % RDX-contained nitramine propellant has the minimum impact strength. And the crushing height of propellant with 20 % RDX-contained was the highest, but the crushing height of propellant with 40 % RDX-contained the lowest. With the increase in RDX content in nitramine propellant, the energy of nitramine propellant increases and its burning rate reduces, but 40 % RDX-contained nitramine propellant did not meet this trend at the low temperature because of its poor mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Results of an {{investigation}} of the mechanical performance of injection moulded long glass-fibre reinforced polyamide 6, 6 composites are presented. The glass-fibre content in these composites was varied over the range of 10 - 50 % by weight using fibres with average diameters of 10, 14 and 17 μm. <b>Impact</b> <b>testing</b> was carried out at − 40, 23 and 80 °C on dry-as-moulded and boiling water conditioned samples. The results from these long fibre composites are compared with standard extrusion compounded short glass-fibre materials. Data on the influence of fibre diameter, fibre concentration, residual fibre length, hydrothermal conditioning and testing temperature on the composite performance in notched and unnotched <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> and multiaxial instrumented <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> are presented and discussed. All of the above parameters are shown to have significant influence on impact performance.
