6000|$|We might further {{dwell on}} the facts, that Lord signifies high-born, or, as the same root gives a word meaning heaven, {{possibly}} heaven-born; that, before it became common, Sir or Sire, as well as Father, was the distinction of a priest; that worship, originally worth-ship--a term of respect {{that has been used}} commonly, as well as to magistrates--is also our term for the act of attributing greatness or worth to the Deity; so that to ascribe worth-ship to a man is to worship him. We might make much of the evidence that all early governments are more or less distinctly theocratic; and that among ancient Eastern nations even the commonest forms and customs appear to have been influenced by religion. We might enforce our argument respecting the derivation of ceremonies, by tracing out the aboriginal obeisance made by putting dust on the head, which probably symbolises putting the head in the dust: by affiliating the <b>practice</b> <b>prevailing</b> among certain tribes, of doing another honour by presenting him with a portion of hair torn from the head--an act which seems tantamount to saying, [...] "I am your slave;" [...] by investigating the Oriental custom of giving to a visitor any object he speaks of admiringly, which is pretty clearly a carrying out of the compliment, [...] "All I have is yours." ...|$|E

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{striking}} characteristics of contraceptive practice in the world today are the wide variation in patterns of use across countries and the tendency of the distribution of use by method to persist or narrow, even as new methods become available. The argument advanced in this article is that the disposition to commit to a reduced range of methods results from positive feedback in the process of contraceptive choice, and follows the logic of path dependence. The positive feedback derives, in large part, from social interaction among both the providers and the users of contraceptive methods. The persistence of outmoded contraceptive regimes is illustrated with the experience of Mexico and Brazil.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The Problem The {{general purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the completeness and adequacy of student personnel services in Negro colleges of the South Atlantic States. Specifically, the problem was (1) to identify and analyze the nature of student personnel practices in Negro colleges of the South Atlantic States; (2) to compare student personnel practices in private colleges, public colleges, junior colleges, senior colleges, colleges accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and colleges not accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools; (3) to analyze these practices in light of significant trends as revealed through a review of the literature in the field of student personnel work; and (4) to offer suggestions and recommendations commensurate with what appears to be sound policy and <b>practice</b> <b>prevailing</b> in the field of student personnel work. methods of investigation 1. Permission to study the student personnel programs in the colleges was requested from the governing authorities of the institutions. 2. Cooperation in securing data was requested from the coordinators of student personnel services. 3. A personal visit was made to each institution and data were obtained by an interview with the coordinator of student personnel services. Administrative officers, faculty members, and students were also consulted for information. An interview instrument was designed for structuring the interviews. 4. Literature in the field of student personnel work was reviewed in order to discover what appears to be sound policy and <b>practice</b> <b>prevailing</b> in the field. This information was useful in devising the interview instrument; it served as a basis for making comparisons and inferences for suggesting improvements of student personnel services. 5. A rating scale was designed by the writer to serve as a self-evaluation device for each institution. Findings and conclusions The results of the cumulative point averages from the rating system and the percentage ratings of the different categories of colleges were as follows: (1) accredited colleges rated first; (2) senior colleges rated second; (3) private colleges rated third; (4) public colleges rated fourth; (5) nonaccredited colleges rated fifth; and (6) junior colleges rated sixth. Weaknesses were more pronounced in the deeper aspects of the services. The term "deeper aspects" refers to the use of methods which delve deep into the personality of the individual in assisting him in solving problems and making decisions and choices. Adequate provision was made for the development of the religious life of students, functional student governing bodies in residence halls, and part-time jobs for students. The recent establishment of the majority of junior colleges contributed to many of the inadequacies in their student personnel programs. Recommendations Several suggestions were made by the writer for the improvement of the many services and their different aspects; however, careful scrutiny revealed that the weaknesses in the deeper aspects of services and the following elements wore most in need of improvements (1) trained coordinators of student personnel services; (2) better communication between college personnel workers and high - school counselors; (3) involvement of the student personnel staff in the admissions program; (4) more attention directed toward remedial services, vocational counseling and testing, and placement in nonteaching positions; (5) referral by faculty advisers to special counselors; (6) provision for more student union buildings or similar structures; (7) use of more interest, personality and general achievement tests; and (8) making the research and evaluation service real and practical...|$|E
40|$|This essay, {{written as}} part of a {{symposium}} on the evolution of Justice Kennedy’s jurisprudence, surveys three areas of criminal procedure under the Sixth Amendment: sentence enhancements, the admissibility of hearsay, and the regulation of defense counsel’s responsibilities. In each area, Justice Kennedy has been a notable voice of pragmatism, focusing not on bygone analogies to the eighteenth century but on a hard-headed appreciation of the twenty-first. He has shown sensitivity to modern criminal <b>practice,</b> <b>prevailing</b> professional norms, and practical constraints, as befits a Justice who came to the bench with many years of private-practice experience. His touchstone is not a bright-line rule derived from history, but a flexible approach that is workable today. Notwithstanding the press’s assumptions about him as a swing Justice, his approach is remarkably consistent and principled. The essay explores four important themes in his Sixth Amendment jurisprudence. First is the use of history. Justice Kennedy is a moderate originalist, looking to history where it works but adapting it to modern realities, especially to new circumstances and new problems. Second is his common-law incrementalism and flexibility, in contrast to some other Justices’ rigid formalism. Third is Justice Kennedy’s structural approach to the Constitution as fostering dialogue among branches and levels of government. He emphasizes federalism and checks and balances, not a strict separation of powers. Fourth is his use of practicality and common sense to leaven theoretical abstractions. He looks closely at the purposes of laws, their effects, the lessons of expertise, and the existence of alternative solutions. In interpreting the Sixth Amendment, then, Justice Kennedy is fundamentally a practical lawyer, applying the humble wisdom born of experience rather than the rigid extremes that flow from a quest for theoretical purity...|$|E

The aim of this research is to suggest solutions to address the limitations of current estimating <b>practice</b> <b>prevailing</b> in the Sri Lankan construction industry comparing to the proposed best estimation practice. This research has been conducted through literature reviews, questionnaire survey and interviews. The questionnaire included sixteen steps identified as the best estimation practice through literature review and interviews, with a view to find out the current estimation practice of Sri Lankan contractors. The analysis of data revealed although they are following all sixteen steps, they couldn’t able to gain the maximum benefit of those steps owing to some limitations. Therefore in order to find out the solutions for those limitations Seventeen interviews were carried out. Among those, nine interviews were from contractors and eight interviews were from consultants. These conclude that limitations and solutions identified by the contractors were similar with those identified by the consultants. In the comparison of their opinions the degree of agreement on most of the factors between them is high. It shows consultants’ understanding about contractors’ works are quite high. The study recommended that both contractors and consultants give more attention to the cost estimating process to manage the projects in a better way and to hire qualified technical staff in order to obtain an accurate estimate. Contractors were requested to keep databases and to make relevant changes and modifications in their existing estimating practices in their future projects.

40|$|Most managers, {{when confronted}} with a {{difficult}} strategic decision, {{would like to know}} what is the <b>prevailing</b> <b>practice</b> in their industry. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>practice</b> interests managers, in part, because it may indicate which decisions are good, even "best. " The rationale is "Darwinian economics," which proposes that competitive markets operate to force at least an approximation of optimal behavior, because "wrong" decisions are extinguished by the market mechanism. If so, the bulk of survivors make good business decisions and their collective practice is worth knowing, meaning it should be difficult to improve upon. This paper tests whether <b>prevailing</b> <b>practice</b> represents "good" decisions. The context is the decision whether to fill a sales district with a company (integrated) sales force or with outside agents (independents). The outcome of the choice is the ratio of sales to the cost of running the sales force, i. e., selling efficiency. A model is described which summarizes industry decisions, and two propositions are developed. Proposition 1, a simple version, states that efficiency declines as firms depart from the industry rule as to when they should integrate. Proposition 2, a contingent version, states that efficiency declines as firms depart from the industry rule in unpredictable selling environments but that conforming to the rule has no impact in predictable environments. The rationale is that firms learn the environment well enough to know when to depart from the rule in predictable settings but not otherwise. The relationship between efficiency and conformity to <b>prevailing</b> <b>practice</b> is examined for 93 sales districts of 11 recognized electronic component manufacturers. The results support proposition 2 : the most efficient sales forces conform to <b>prevailing</b> <b>practice</b> and the least efficient deviate, but only in uncertain environments.

5000|$|Data of a USDA study {{indicate}} that, in 2002, about 0.6% of non-solar energy {{use in the}} United States was accounted for by production of meat-producing livestock and poultry. [...] This estimate included embodied energy used in production, such as energy used in manufacture and transport of fertilizer for feed production. (Non-solar energy is specified, because solar energy is used in such processes as photosynthesis and hay-drying.) Changes in livestock production practices influence {{the environmental impact of}} meat production, as illustrated by some beef data. In the US beef production system, <b>practices</b> <b>prevailing</b> in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16.3% less greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents), 12.1% less withdrawn water use and 33.0% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977. [...] From 1980 to 2012 in the US, while population increased by 38%, the small ruminant inventory decreased by 42%, the cattle-and-calves inventory decreased by 17%, and methane emissions from livestock decreased by 18%; [...] yet despite the reduction in cattle numbers, US beef production increased over that period.|$|R
