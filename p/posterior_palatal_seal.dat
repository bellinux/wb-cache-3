25|$|Retention is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture is prevented from moving vertically {{in the opposite direction}} of insertion. The better the topographical mimicry of the intaglio (interior) surface of the denture base {{to the surface of the}} underlying mucosa, the better the retention will be (in removable partial dentures, the clasps are a major provider of retention), as surface tension, suction and friction will aid in keeping the denture base from breaking intimate contact with the mucosal surface. It is important to note that the most critical element in the retentive design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve 'suction'. The border seal is composed of the edges of the anterior and lateral aspects and the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> <b>seal.</b> The <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> <b>seal</b> design is accomplished by covering the entire hard palate and extending not beyond the soft palate and ending 1–2mm from the vibrating line.|$|E

30|$|The {{authors were}} able to {{identify}} reduction in the median <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> space in individuals with a dolichofacial pattern. A previous study also observed changes in the dimensions of the upper airway related to the reduction in the medial <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> space in individuals with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) [8]. This measurement expresses the distance from the soft palate to the posterior wall of the pharynx and has a close relationship with the dimensions of the soft palate. The increased length of which was related to presence of OSAS in other researches [8, 29, 30] and the present study. The highest alteration values in upper airway dimensions in OSAS patients occur in the oropharynx [8] and were related to the reduction of the median <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> space [31]. In individuals with a vertical pattern, the mandible is normally retracted and rotated downwards and backwards, thus diminishing the oropharyngeal space [26] Furthermore, the base of the tongue accompanies the direction of mandibular rotation, being positioned downward and backward, thus the soft palate is in a more retrusive position, diminishing the median <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> space.|$|R

The aims of this study was to evaluate the dimensional accuracy of both direct and indirect relining methods on the maxillary <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> <b>seal</b> area.   Materials and Methods: A maxillary edentulous model was selected. A 1. 5 mm layer of wax was placed on the model to create a space for relining material and impression was done by the silicone material and 20 casts was prepared. By putting the wax on the casts and performed of flasking, 20 dentures were prepared. Direct reline method (as Chair side with GC reline) and indirect method (with Acrosoft-TC and firing with Acropars 100) were evaluated. The relined bases were put on the model and the spaces between them in five points (two points on the ridge, two points in the deepest part of palate and one point in the middle of palate) were calculated by the Stereo microscope and each calculations was repeated 5 times and the mean dimensional changes was measured. To compare the groups, data were analyzed using multivariate analysis.   Results: The gap of P. P. S area was between 740. 86 and 2356. 49.

Aims: The study was carried out to evaluate the relationship between PPS width of the patient intra-orally and cephalometric tracing of the same patient. Second part of the study was formulated to determine whether the anterior and posterior vibrating lines can be distinguished as two separate lines by different observers. Materials and Methods: A lateral cephalogram was made to trace the hard and soft palatal contour, and the angle of the palatal contour was measured with the v-ceph program. Correlation analysis was conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} the distance from anterior to posterior vibrating lines and the angle of the palatal contour at the junction of the hard and soft palate.

40|$|The {{fracture}} of complete dentures fabricated using Polymethyl methacrylate resin constitutes {{a challenge to}} the clinician and remains an unresolved problem. To determine whether gradual increase in load or different posterior teeth positions in maxillary denture would influence the pattern of stress. Two groups of maxillary dentures were fabricated with different posterior teeth positions (Group I with teeth on the crest of the ridge; Group II with buccal to the crest of the ridge.) using casts prepared from prefabricated edentulous molds, with 5 dentures in each group. Two strain gauges were cemented on to the midline of each denture, one on the anterior palatal area and other on the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> area. The dentures were loaded from 0 to 110  N in steps of 10  N, and the strains induced were measured. Differences of the stress magnitudes between the 2 groups were statistically analyzed using Mann–Whitney U test. The anterior palatal area of the maxillary denture was dominated by a tensile stress, which was greater in the group II than in group I. The <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> area was dominated by compressive stress but the outer placement of the maxillary teeth caused a significant decrease in the compressive stress. The high anterior tensile stress with compressive stress in the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> area during loading may be responsible for denture base fractures that initiate from the anterior palatal area.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the thickness of}} palatal masticatory mucosa in posterior teeth by transgingival probing and determine its relation with age and gender. Materials and Methods: Forty systemically healthy volunteers with age range 16 – 38 years were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eighteen measurement points were made on the cast that was transferred onto the palate using clear acrylic stent to measure thickness. Three different lines a, b, and c: 3, 8, and 12 mm, respectively, from the gingival margin were made starting at the mid-palatal aspect of the canine and ending over the palatal root of the second molar. Six points were defined {{on each of the}} lines: Ca (mid-palatal aspect of the canine), P 1 (mid-palatal aspect of the first premolar), P 2 (mid-palatal aspect of the second premolar), M 1 (palatal root of the first molar), Mi (interproximal aspect {{between the first and second}} molar), and M 2 (palatal root of the second molar). Results: Soft-tissue thickness progressively increased in sites further from the gingival margin and was thickest adjacent to mid-palatal aspect of the second premolar 12 mm away from gingival margin. Younger age group patients had thinner <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> mucosa as compared to older age group patients. Males had thicker <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> mucosa as compared to females, but results were statistically insignificant.

Purpose: This study was carried out to evaluate {{the effect of the}} arch form and water sorption on the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> base adaptation of ProBase Hot dentures compared to those processed by conventional heat cure acrylic resin. Materials and Methods: Forty waxed denture bases were prepared for U-shaped and V-shaped palatine arch forms from both ProBase Hot and Acrostone materials. Waxed denture bases were flasked, packed and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immediately after decasting, the dentures were repositioned on their corresponding casts to measure the amount of gap formed between denture base and cast at 5 points along the posterior border of denture base using a measurescope. Denture bases were stored in tap water for 4 weeks then the same test was repeated. Results: Both palatine arch forms exhibited a significant amount of posterior palatine base discrepancy particularly {{at the center of the}} palate. The V-shaped arch form showed a greater amount of discrepancy than that with the U-shaped vault. ProBase Hot denture bases showed better palatal adaptation than that of the Acrostone denture bases.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the methods used by private practitioners and students to fabricate a <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> <b>seal</b> in dentures and determine how many clinicians carry out this procedure themselves. Materials and methods: The laboratory slips, final impressions and final casts at jaw registration, try-in and finish stages of complete dentures of 50 student cases from the University of Pretoria and 10 cases from 5 private dental laboratories respectively were examined to determine the presence, position and dimensions of the post dam. Photographs and impressions were taken with polyvinyl siloxane impression material in cases where the post dam were marked and/or scribed. The impressions were sectioned with a scalpel and measurements were recorded with the aid of an Iwansson gauge and Carl Zeiss microscope. Depth and width was recorded at the midpalatal suture, right and left posterolateral, and right and left hamular notch areas of the scribed post dams. Results: In the private laboratory cases one of the 50 cases had the post dam marked at the secondary impression stage. In the student laboratory cases, 20 % were marked at the secondary impression stage, 14 % at the jaw registration and 12 % at the try-in stages. Only 4 % were scribed, all at the try-in stages. Measurements for post dam dimensions could only be made in 2 cases.

40|$|Context: By convention, the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> <b>seal</b> area {{is located}} on the palate between the {{anterior}} and posterior vibrating lines. However, there are opposing views on whether the anterior and posterior vibrating lines can be distinguished as two separate lines of flexion. Aims: The study was carried out to determine whether the anterior and posterior vibrating lines can be distinguished as two separate lines of flexion by unbiased observers. A second part of the study was formulated to evaluate whether the palpatory method correlated with the nose-blowing method in locating the anterior line of flexion Materials and Methods: Twenty-three dental undergraduate clinical students were selected as observers. Twenty-three edentulous patients were randomly selected. The students were asked to record the anterior and posterior vibrating line on one patient each using two differently colored marking pencils. Also, the anterior vibrating line was marked by the palpatory method (using T burnisher) using a third colored marking pencil. The marked lines were then transferred onto the previously made impression of modeling plastic. Results: Of the 23 recorders used in the study, 19 could locate separate anterior and posterior lines of flexion. In 4 cases, the anterior and posterior lines of flexion coincided and were not distinct. In 20 cases, the palpatory method produced a line anterior to the line located by the Valsalva maneuver. Conclusions: The anterior and posterior vibrating lines could be located by the undergraduate students as two separate lines of flexion when the appropriate action was elicited for each of them; and the palpatory method produced a line slightly anterior to the anterior vibrating line located by the Valsalva maneuver...|$|E

40|$|Context: Most of the maxillary {{complete}} dentures do not adapt accurately to {{the cast}} {{because of the}} changes in the resin during polymerization. The amount of heat associated with processing of polymethyl methacrylate has been correlated with the adaptation of the processed denture base to its supporting tissues. Aims: This study conducted to determine the effect of different curing temperatures on the accuracy of fit of a complete maxillary denture and to compare with that of fiber-reinforced acrylic resins. Materials and Methods : An ideal maxillary rubber mould used to make an edentulous cast. Forty-eight stone casts made from the ideal rubber mould. Out of 48 identical stone casts, 44 stone casts with wax adapted processed using simple acrylic resin. The remaining four stone casts were processed using fiber-reinforced acrylic resin. However, processing time for 12 hrs was maintained constant for all the samples. The variable to investigate was the temperature. Therefore, four denture bases processed at each temperature from 60 °C to 80 °C with two-degree increments for a total of 44 samples using simple acrylic resin. Remaining four samples processed at 70 °C using fiber-reinforced acrylic resin. A traveling microscope used to measure the discrepancy between each cast and its denture base. Statistical analysis used: Analyzed with Student′s unpaired t test. Results : Minimum distortion was observed at 70 °C. Maximum distortion was observed for the denture bases processed at 80 °C.

40|$|Introduction: The {{posterior}} palatal area is {{the most}} important area for retention of maxillary dentures and must be considered carefully during and after the reline. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> <b>seal</b> in relined complete dentures with two different methods. Materials & Methods: An average size of edentulous maxillary acrylic arch without undercuts was selected in this in vitro study. The alginate impression was made of this model ten times and was poured with a type IV gypsum product, and the casts of control groups were prepared. Then 10 definitive bases were created for each cast. For the experimental groups, one relief wax layer with a thickness of 2 mm was put in post-dam area for relining processes. Then, 20 alginate impressions were made of this model. On definitive base, clear heat-cured acrylic bases were fabricated. In experimental groups, bases were divided into 2 groups of 10 : first group was relined with heat-cured acrylic resin and another one was relined with cold cured acrylic resin. All of the bases were put in distilled water for two weeks and then each of them was placed on the definitive base. One code was considered for each model. The gap in posterior area between acrylic bases and arch was measured in five points (a-b-c-d-e: mid line, two points in hamular notch, and two points between midline and hamular notch) by two practicers in two different times (during two weeks) with light B× 60 microscope. The data were analyzed by Tukey and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: The results of this study indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in the amount of gap at point A between control (bases without reline) and experimental groups (P= 0. 047). At point D {{there was no significant difference}} between experimental groups, but a significant difference was detected between control group and bases relined with cold cure acryl (P< 0. 05).

The only character exhibiting unusually high individual variation was length of <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> foramen. All other characters exhibited individual variation within acceptable limits...|$|R
40|$|Oral focal mucinosis (OFM), an oral {{counterpart}} of cutaneous focal mucinosis, {{is a rare}} disease of unknown etiology. Its pathogenesis {{may be due to}} the overproduction of hyaluronic acid by a fibroblast, at the expense of collagen production, resulting in focal myxoid degeneration of the connective tissue, primarily affecting the mucosa overlying the bone. It has no distinctive clinical features, as the diagnosis is solely based on the histopathological features. This article reports of a 32 -year-old female having the rare disease of oral focal mucinosis, involving the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> mucosa, and discusses its clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis of myxomatous lesions of the oral cavity...|$|R
50|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M. manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed sagittal crest (a crest that provides support for muscles of the head). Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M. brachytragos and M. mahafaliensis, but unlike in M. aelleni and M. manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> spine.|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that {{the opening of the}} midpalatal suture with tooth-borne palatal expanders is V-shaped with a larger split anteriorly and a progressively smaller split towards the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> region [2, 5 – 7]. Gautam et al. [25] reported in a finite element method (FEM) investigation with conventional rapid palatal expansion (RPE) that the maxillary center of rotation in the horizontal plane is located between the lateral and medial pterygoid plates. The pterygopalatine suture, due to the rigid interlock between articulating bones, cannot be split by tooth-borne expanders [9], and therefore, it acts like a hinge around which the maxillary halves rotate during the expansion, producing the V-shaped movement of maxilla.|$|R

40|$|Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is {{the most}} common salivary gland tumor {{characterized}} by histo-morphological diversity in the form of myxoid, hyalinized, chondroid, osseous, and squamous areas. In this paper, we report a rare case of predominantly oncocytic variant of PA in a 45 -year-old male patient on the <b>posterior</b> <b>palatal</b> region. Microscopic examination showed homogenous eosinophilic cellular mass composed of epithelial components arranged in the form of tubular and solid patterns. The polygonal and oval cells showed abundant dark eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. The cell borders were distinct with a central nucleus showing prominent nucleoli. Interestingly at few places, cholesterol clefts were seen surrounded by macrophages and giant cells. The tumor was surgically excised with no evidence of recurrence after 2 years...|$|R

As is characteristic of Miniopterus, the first upper premolar (P1) is smaller and more simplified than the second (P2).|$|R
