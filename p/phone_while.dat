5|$|Just {{before the}} 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth {{the manager of}} the Yankees' top minor-league team, the Newark Bears, but he was talked out of it by his wife, Claire, and his {{business}} manager, Christy Walsh. Shortly afterward, Tigers owner Frank Navin made a proposal to Ruppert and Barrow—if the Yankees traded Ruth to Detroit, Navin would name Ruth player-manager. Navin believed Ruth would not only bring a winning attitude to a team that had not finished higher than third since 1923, but would also revive the Tigers' sagging attendance figures. Navin asked Ruth to come to Detroit for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him {{to take part in a}} celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii. Ruth and Navin negotiated over the <b>phone</b> <b>while</b> Ruth was in Hawaii, but those talks foundered when Navin refused to give Ruth a portion of the Tigers' box office proceeds.|$|E

40|$|There is {{technology}} {{available that}} can block mobile <b>phones</b> <b>while</b> driving. The {{aim of this}} research was to determine if mobile phone blocking technology is an effective and acceptable method for reducing driver distraction among drivers of corporate fleet vehicles. Two different technologies were assessed: one required software to be installed on mobile <b>phones,</b> <b>while</b> the other technology used software in addition to external Bluetooth hardware that paired with the phones. A sample of 104 study participants who regularly drove a corporate fleet vehicle were recruited through a major corporation in South Australia. Each participant experienced one of the two technologies, and their opinions on the technology and <b>phone</b> use <b>while</b> driving were assessed using pre- and post-trial questionnaires. A majority of participants reported that phone blocking was not reliable but a majority nonetheless considered the technology they trialed to be an effective way of preventing <b>phone</b> use <b>while</b> driving. Mobile <b>phone</b> blocking technologies may provide a useful method of changing mobile <b>phone</b> use behaviour <b>while</b> driving.

25|$|The use {{of mobile}} phones {{by people who}} are driving has become {{increasingly}} common, for example as part of their job, {{as in the case of}} delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile <b>phone</b> <b>while</b> driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.|$|E

40|$|The {{apparently}} higher crash risk {{among individuals}} who use cell <b>phones</b> <b>while</b> driving {{may be due}} both to the direct interference of cell phone use with the driving task and tendencies to engage in risky driving behaviors independent of cell phone use. Measurements of actual highway driving performance, self-reported aberrant driving behaviors {{as measured by the}} Manchester Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), and attitudes toward speeding, passing behaviors and relative concern about being involved in a crash were assessed. Individuals who reported frequently using cell <b>phones</b> <b>while</b> driving were found to drive faster, change lanes more frequently, spend more time in the left lane, and engage in more instances of hard braking and high acceleration events. They also scored higher in self-reported driving violations on the DBQ and reported more positive attitudes toward speeding and passing than drivers who did not report using a cell <b>phone</b> regularly <b>while</b> driving. These results indicate that a greater reported frequency of cell <b>phone</b> use <b>while</b> driving is associated with a broader pattern of behaviors that are likely to increase the overall risk of crash involvement.

We find evidence for the endogeneity of mobile phone and hands-free device usage, and our analysis suggests that individuals who are more likely to use hands-free devices are more careful drivers even without them. Once we correct for the endogeneity of usage, our models predict no statistically significant increase in accidents from mobile phone usage, whether hand-held or hands-free. Our results call into question previous cost-benefit analyses of bans on mobile <b>phone</b> usage <b>while</b> driving, which typically assume that such bans will have a salutary effect...|$|R
