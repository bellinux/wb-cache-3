5|$|Yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} {{have been}} reported flocking to Banksia cones ten days after bushfire as the follicles open.

A cockatoo spends about twenty minutes on each pine cone.|$|E

5|$|Brushes Clough and Pingot {{are former}} coal and {{sandstone}} quarries on Crompton Moor. During the 1970s, quarrying was halted, {{the land was}} reclaimed, and thousands of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> were planted. The area has since been used for recreation, including hiking, orienteering, and mountain biking. Brushes Clough Reservoir was constructed in the 19th century by the Oldham County Borough Council, using stone quarried from this site. The area is now managed by United Utilities.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{such as the}} California ground squirrel, western gray squirrel, and dusky-footed woodrat live in this region. Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, western tanagers, and lazuli {{buntings}} {{are common}} in the area. Nine species of warblers, three species of vireos, and two species of thrushes can also be found. The pileated woodpecker has been spotted rarely in large <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} {{is covered}} by taiga {{in the south and}} tundra in the north. In the tundra, cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and firs.|$|E

5|$|White pine blister rust, a {{fungal disease}} that infects conifer trees, was accidentally {{introduced}} in British Columbia in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s.

5|$|Widely {{distributed}} in the Northern Hemisphere, Tricholoma vaccinum is found in northern Asia, Europe and North America. The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with spruce or <b>pine</b> <b>trees,</b> and its mushrooms are found on the ground growing in groups or clusters in late summer and autumn. Although some consider the mushroom edible, it is of poor quality and not recommended for consumption. The ectomycorrhizae of T.vaccinum {{has been the subject}} of considerable research.|$|E

5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> from copper toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also {{plays a role in}} the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{correctly}} {{identifies the}} origin of amber as the fossilised resin of <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b> Evidence cited includes {{the fact that some}} samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers {{to the way in which}} it exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the queen bee and the use of smoke by beekeepers at the hive to collect honeycomb. He praises the song of the nightingale.|$|E

5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b> The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
5|$|The fungus grows {{predominantly}} in coniferous forests, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal {{associations with}} living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground {{in summer and}} autumn. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as mushrooms appear under <b>pine</b> <b>trees,</b> generally in summer and autumn. It has a matte brown to maroon-coloured cap and its stem is often large and swollen, and the overall colour may have an orange-red tinge. As with other boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body is variable.|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} features {{thin and}} acidic soil, and hosts plants like witherod, Indian pear, Labrador tea, wintergreen, and blueberry shrubs. It is a woodland area, with birch, tamarack, maple, oak, beech, and white <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b> Given {{the development of}} the land by the Armdale Yacht Club, plant growth is now largely limited to the hill on which the main clubhouse sits; most of the peninsula was paved in 1971. Fish caught from Melville Island include cod and mackerel. Local birds include grebes, loons, and alcids.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows {{on the ground in}} {{deciduous}} or mixed woods, usually in association with <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b> It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common Albatrellus ovinus, from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised, and microscopically by the amyloid (staining bluish-black to black with Melzer's reagent) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of A.subrubescens contain scutigeral, a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity. A.subrubescens mushrooms are mildly poisonous, and consuming them will result in a short-term gastrointestinal illness.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive effects can be {{variously}} described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b> However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b> These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
