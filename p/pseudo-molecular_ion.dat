40|$|<b>Pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> {{formation}} is an artifact common to most analyses performed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. These species are non-covalent complexes formed between an analyte {{of interest and}} any other components (such as mobile phase, additives, and impurities) present in the ionized sample band. Published literature addresses <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> formation in routine analyses {{as well as in}} complicated molecular recognition processes. The majority of these works are directed towards the formation of complexes in the positive ionization mode. Consequently, investigation of <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> formation in the negative ionization mode is a logical extension of work in this area. Experiments presented here detail the work performed on elucidation of factors controlling ionization efficiency of aromatic acid pseudo-molecular ions by electrospray ionization in the negative ionization mode. Sets of tested acidic analytes, including ibuprofen derivatives and benzoic acid derivatives, were analyzed in the presence of various solution systems by flow injection analysis to determine the effect of pH, concentration, injection volume...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnesium {{gluconate}} is {{a classical}} pharmaceutical compound {{used as a}} source of magnesium for the prevention and treatment of hypomagnesemia. To the best of our knowledge, a robust and reliable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry technique has not yet been reported for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of magnesium gluconate. This study describes the method development for the LC–ESI–MS/MS analysis of magnesium gluconate using three different reversed-phase HPLC conditions (Method I–III) with comprehensive fragmentation pattern and the structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy. The LC–MS and NMR data were found in accordance with the structure of magnesium gluconate. When magnesium gluconate was dissolved in the acetonitrile and water–methanol solutions, it exists in situ in three different forms: magnesium gluconate itself, gluconic acid, and magnesium gluconate chelate with gluconic acid by a coordinate covalent bond. Method I exhibited <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> peaks with more magnesium gluconate chelates with gluconic acid, while method II showed an adduct of magnesium gluconate with the solvent along with the molecular ion peak. There was no <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> peaks found in method III. Thus, method III was found to be the more accurate, robust and reliable LC–MS method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis, structural characterization, and could also be suitable for the pharmacokinetic study of magnesium gluconate. The detailed fragmentation analysis might be useful for the structural characterization of unknown divalent organometallics...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{simple and}} {{straightforward}} procedure to analyze phosphorylated sphingoid bases has been developed. After phase separation of lipid extracts under alkaline conditions, the compounds were quantitatively recovered in the aqueous upper phase. Following a clean-up of the aqueous phase on C 18 -solid phase extraction columns, the amino-group of the bases was derivatized {{by means of}} phenylisothiocyanate addition. FAB-MS of the phenylthiocarbamate derivatives of sphingenine- and sphinganine-phosphate in the negative mode revealed the expected <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions</b> (M- 1) at 513 m/z and 515 m/z, respectively. Moreover, a typical fragmentation pattern, characterized {{by the loss of}} the phenylthiocarbamate moiety (m/z = 135), was observed. When applied to rat tissues, the presence of sphingenine-phosphate in brain, kidney and liver could easily be demonstrated. Highest levels, amounting to 5 nmol/g of wet weight, were present in brain...|$|R

Direct injection of urine and LC-MS-MS with rapid chromatography and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization {{was used in the}} screening step. The cutoff levels were chosen to be at the limit of detection for most analytes to identify as many positive samples as possible. Typically one ion transition was monitored from the <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions</b> in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Of the 797 positive screening findings, 518 (65 %) were confirmed by a second LC-MS-MS analysis including solid-phase extraction. Confirmed analytical findings included 22 cases positive for N-benzylpiperazine, 88 for 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine and metabolites, 4 for 1 -phenyl- 2 -butylamine, 24 for zolpidem and metabolites, 118 for zopiclone and metabolites, and 1 for zaleplon.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of the fast atom {{bombardment}} (FAB) tandem mass spectrometric analysis of six trihydroxamate siderophores as the free ligand or as iron complexes in several matrixes. It demonstrates that the [M + H - 53]+ and [M + H - 16]+ ions always detected in the FAB spectra are not fragments, but for the first the free ligand resulting from a decomplexation in the matrix, and for the second a reduction product. The tandem mass spectrometric study of the fragmentation shows that the main fragments result from the break of either peptide or hydroxamate C-N bonds, or (when present) of an ester linkage. When the iron is present in the complex, the heterolytic break of the hydroxamate-iron bond creates a positive charge on the iron, and a negative charge on the hydroxamate group. This causes positive fragments of the free ligand to become corresponding neutrals in the complex, and inversely, when a hydroxamate bond is broken. As the free ligand <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> is always present in the FAB spectra of the complex, this feature is useful for structural elucidation. Iron has an Fe- 54 isotope representing 6. 35 % of the Fe- 56 isotope. This allows identification of iron complexes by a comparison of the daughter spectra of both isotopic pseudo-molecualr ions. As most of the positive fragments in the daughter spectra contain iron, they are shifted two mass units lower by the presence of Fe- 54. No fragments or neutral losses typical of all the siderophores were identified, and thus there is no selective scan mode for this compound class. Unambiguous identification of the <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> of siderophore iron complexes can be achieved by the presence in the FAB spectrum of the free ligand, the reduction product and the iron isotopic peak. Clear confirmation can be obtained by a comparison of the daughter spectra of these ions...|$|E

Carbonyl signals were absent, and the methyl signal of C- 14 at the azulene system was shifted upfield. The 1 H NMR spectra of both compounds indicated two additional oxymethylene protons, which were connected with sp 3 carbons at δ C 58.1 and 56.6, respectively, indicating the presence of the dihydroazulene alcohols 2 and 3; the latter is known to be very unstable [3, 6, 12].|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper reports {{our effort}} to develop a {{comprehensive}} HPLC-MSn-based dereplication strategy for phorbol ester (PE), deoxyphorbol ester (DE) and ingenol ester (IE) profiling in plant extracts. The method consisted in two sequential analysis exploiting specific hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap instrument modes. A first run was performed using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode targeting fragmentation of PE and DE/IE coupled with the acquisition of MS 2 spectrum for the ions at m/z 311 and m/z 313, respectively. A second run was then completed based on precursor ion scan mode (PIS) and automatic MS 2 acquisition for each <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion.</b> The developed approach was used to investigate ten Euphorbia extracts showing bioactivity against chikungunya virus replication. Experiments allowed partial annotation of three DE/IE but no PE was detected. Results suggested that other types of diterpene esters displayed PE- and DE/IE-like fragmentations. The study of jatrophane ester (JE) standards by CID fragmentation using low and high resolution mass spectrometry confirmed this hypothesis.

40|$|International audienceStructural {{characterization}} of molecular species by mass spectrometry supposes {{the knowledge of}} the type of ions generated and the mechanism by which they dissociate. In this context, a need for a rationalization of electrospray ionization(+) (-) mass spectra of small molecules has been recently expressed. Similarly, {{at the other end of}} the mass scale, efforts are currently made to interpret the major fragmentation processes of protonated and deprotonated peptides and their reduced forms produced in electron capture or electron transfer experiments. Most fragmentation processes of molecular and <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions</b> produced in the ion source of a mass spectrometer may be described by a combination of several key mechanistic steps: simple bond dissociation, formation of ion-neutral complex intermediates, hydrogen atom, hydride ion or proton migrations and nucleophilic attack. Selected crucial aspects of these elementary reactions, occurring inside positively charged ions, will be recalled and illustrated by examples taken in recent mass spectrometry literature. Emphasis will be given on the protonation process and its consequence in terms of structure and energetic...|$|R

High-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) identified in all individual samples at least seven Caribbean ciguatoxins (C-CTXs) comprising C-CTX- 1 and its epimer C-CTX- 2 ([M + H](+) m/z 1141. 58), and five new C-CTX congeners with <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions</b> at m/z 1141. 58, 1143. 60, 1157. 57, 1159. 58, and 1127. 57. In some samples, additional C-CTX isomers were detected with [M + H](+) ions at m/z 1141. 58 (two), 1143. 60 (one) and 1157. 57 (two). The two low-toxic pools contained only four to six ciguatoxins. The comparison in relative proportions of four different mass classes ([M + H](+) at m/z 1141, 1143, 1157 and 1127) showed that the group at m/z 1157 increased (2 - 20 %) with flesh toxicity. More than 80 % of group m/z 1141 comprised C-CTX- 1, C-CTX- 2 and their isomer C-CTX- 1 a whose level in this group correlated with fish toxicity.

40|$|Abstract] A {{complete}} general unknown {{screening procedure}} was developed using liquid chromatography-mass pectrometry (LC-MS), a coupling that {{can increase the}} range of compounds amenable to MS. Sample preparation was by solid. phase extraction on a mixed-mode support in parallel with serum deproteination in order to recover the most hydrophilic compounds. Chromatography employed a reversed-phase narrow. bore column (150 x l-ram i. d.) and a 50 -min gradient elution at low flow-rate (50 pUmin), compatible with the electrospray source used without splitting nor heating. The single quadrupole LC-MS instrument used was operated in the 100 to 1100 u mass range in both {{the positive and negative}} modes, with two different, alternated collision-induced dissociation voltages in the source, in order to obtain the molecular or <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions</b> as well as fragments for the compounds analyzed. The addition of spectra obtained at low and high fragmentation voltages gave reconstructed spectra for each polarity, representing library entries. Finally, a program was created in order to detect the peaks of interest in the chromatographic noise using a very efficient signal processing algorithm, compute their relative retention time with respect to the internal standard (glafenine), draw their reconstructed spectra, search them in the libraries, and edit a report...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTUlomoides dermestoides (Fairmaire, 1893) is a beetle used in {{alternative}} medicine treatments in some South American countries. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of phenolic fractions (PF) from U. dermestoides. The PF were separated from crude extracts in acetone (PFAc) and ethanol (PFEtOH). The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu test. Volatile and semi-volatile compounds presents in crude extracts were identified by GC-MS; moreover, phenolic fractions were analyzed by HPLC-MS. The cellular viability, after exposition to phenolic fractions, was determined by Trypan blue exclusion test and MTT reduction assay on immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCat); the degree of DNA damage was detected by alkaline comet-DNA assay. The TPC in PFAc and PFEtOH were: 11. 34 ± 0. 88 mgGAE/g and 6. 52 ± 1. 28 mgGAE/g, respectively (mean. dif: 4. 951; p value = 0. 0000). In both samples, HPLC-MS showed a <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> [M-H]− at m/z 153, tentatively identified as protocatechuic acid. The results of cytotoxic assays suggest that the viability of HaCat cells depends on the concentration and exposure time of each treatment. Furthermore, the comet assay revealed moderate genotoxic effect after 48 hours of exposure to PFAc (40 to 160 μg. mL− 1); cytotoxic/genotoxic activity of this fraction could be related to the higher phenol contents...|$|E

Mycotoxin fragmentation patterns obtained by High Energy Collision Dissociation (HCD) have been investigated to obtain quantitative and confirmatory information (two characteristic masses per mycotoxin) using OrbitrapTM based high resolution mass spectrometry. LC-HRMS (full scan) detection carried out by HCD allowed to monitor the <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> and an additional characteristic fragment (for each mycotoxin) with mass accuracy in the range 0. 1 - 3. 9 ppm, meeting the current European regulatory requirements for LC-MS confirmatory analysis. A sample preparation procedure based on polymeric solid phase extraction cartridges was applied, allowing recoveries higher than 74 % for all tested toxins, with relative standard deviation lower than 13 %. Detection limits in the range 0. 5 - 3. 4 µg/kg were obtained for all tested matrices. A critical comparison between the proposed method and a validated method based on triple quadrupole mass spectrometry showed similar performances in terms of detection limits, recoveries and repeatability, and matrix effects.

These {{were accompanied by}} a triglycosyl archaeol (TGA), lacking characteristic sulfate groups. Tandem-mass spectrometry was employed to provide fingerprints for identifying these known lipids, as well as small amounts of unsaturated phospholipids. These contained 3 and 6 double bonds in their archaeol moiety, suggested by negative tandem-MS of intact phospholipids, as indicated by differences between their <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ion</b> and specific fragment ions designated as π 2.

40|$|Sodium {{salicylate}} (NaSAL) {{has been}} shown to be a promising antidote for the treatment of paraquat (PQ) poisonings. The modulation of the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory pathways, as well as the antithrombogenic properties of NaSAL are probably essential features for the healing effects provided by this drug. Nevertheless, a possible direct chemical reactivity between PQ and NaSAL is also a putative pathway to be considered, this hypothesis being the ground of the present study. In accordance, it is shown, for the first time that PQ and NaSAL react immediately in aqueous medium and within 2 – 3 min in the solid state. Photographs and scanning electron photomicrographs indicated that a new chemical entity is formed when both compounds are mixed. This assumption was corroborated by the evaluation of the melting point, and through several analytical techniques, namely ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS), liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS) and infrared spectroscopy, which revealed that stable charge-transfer complexes are formed when PQ is mixed with NaSAL. LC/ESI/MS/MS allowed obtaining the stoichiometry of the charge-transfer complexes. In order to increase resolution, single value decomposition, acting as a filter, showed that the chargetransfer complexes withm/z 483, 643 and 803 correspond to the <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions,</b> respectively 1 : 2, 1 : 3 and 1 : 4 (PQ:NaSAL).

40|$|Toad {{skins and}} venom glandular {{secretions}} {{have been widely}} used for centuries in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for the treatment of various ailments such as cancer, sores, toothache, local inflammation and pain. The active chemical constituents from traditional oriental medicines have demonstrated potential in the development of effective therapeutic pharmaceuticals. Our primary focus in this research was to identify and characterise ‘active’ compounds or groups of compounds for their potential as neuropsychiatric disorder therapeutics. For this aim, we utilised a variety of solvents, i. e., the aqueous, 60 % ethanol (aqueous) and acetic acid (aq) (at two different pHs) for extractions of Australian cane toad skins to identify chemical constituents. The identification of compounds was carried out using HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS based on the accurate mass measurement for molecular ions and MS/MS analysis, whereby accurate mass <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions</b> and characteristic fragment ions were compared to published reference data, including mass bank and NIST. As a result, we have to date identified 42 major constituents including alkaloids, amino acids, bufadienolides, fatty acids, nucleobases, nucleosides and vitamins mostly from the aqueous and 60 % ethanol extracts. Of the 42 constituents identified, 29 were found in the aqueous extract, 35 were found in the ethanol (aq) extract and only 10 in the pH 1. 78 acetic acid extract and 11 in the pH 2. 17 acetic acid extract of the cane toad skins. Therefore, the aqueous and 60 % ethanolic extracts present the greatest potential for ongoing development in our assays. There have been no previous reports on the identification of many of the constituents we have here identified in Australian cane toad skins. These findings, while somewhat consistent with findings in toad skins in other countries, identifies the presence of potential bioactive constituents. Our results showed that HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS is an effective method to characterise and identify components in Australian cane toad skin extracts. Chemical profiling is an essential initial step in the identification and therapeutic exploitation of bioactive agents present in Australian cane toad skin extracts.

40|$|Kinetic data is {{presented}} {{for a variety}} of ion-neutral reactions which are relevant to the atmosphere of Titan and to the chemistry occurring in interstellar clouds. The data were recorded with a Selected Ion Flow Tube (SIFT) operating at room temperature (294 ± 4 K) and at a pressure of 0. 46 Torr. Results of the recent Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan have identified several species in the atmosphere of Titan not predicted by pre-Cassini models of the atmosphere. In order to determine the fate of three of these species (methylenimine, propionitrile and cyanodiacetylene) in Titan's ionosphere, their reactivity with the principal ions in Titan's upper ionosphere has been examined. As expected, collision rate proton transfer reactions dominate the chemistry with association channels also observed with many of the hydrocarbon ions. The results of the Cassini mission also identified several individual reactions as being of potential importance to models of Titan's atmosphere and this chemistry has also been examined. The above studies are also relevant to the interstellar medium where each of the neutral reactants have also been detected. The results of some proton transfer equilibrium studies are also presented. The gas phase basicities of propyne and acetylene have been determined to be 681 kJ mol⁻¹ and 617. 4 kJ mol⁻¹ respectively. Their relative proton affinities can be estimated from these values. A combined experimental/theoretical study of the proton affinity of cyanodiacetylene (HC₅N) has enabled this value to be estimated at 770 ± 20 kJ mol⁻¹. Details of an attempt to complete the first laboratory measurement of the crucial reaction between H₃⁺ and atomic carbon are presented. The generation of atomic carbon in sufficient quantities for reaction in the SIFT was not possible with the microwave discharge source used. Other generation methods have also been explored with the laser photolysis of carbon suboxide expected to provide a possible solution to the problems encountered. The results of an investigation into the applicability of lithium ions (Li⁺) to SIFT-MS are presented. The lithium ions associated with each of the twenty-one neutral analytes examined to form <b>pseudo-molecular</b> <b>ions.</b> The association reactions were rapid (k ~ 10 ⁻⁹ cm³ s⁻¹) for large hydrocarbons but were much slower for smaller analytes (k < 10 ⁻¹¹ cm³ s⁻¹). In order to clarify some unusual experimental observations, the effect of water molecules on the observed chemistry has been examined in detail. The measured chemistry has important consequences for the applicability of Li⁺ to SIFT-MS where the presence and detection of an identifiable ion of the analyte is essential.
