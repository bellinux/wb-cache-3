The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his <b>parents,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good for the country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E

25|$|For example, if José Santos Almeida and Maria Abreu Melo had a daughter, {{her name}} could simply be Joana Melo Almeida (given name + mother's last name + father's last name). However, they {{could give her}} two given names, for example Joana Gabriela, and combine their {{surnames}} in various ways, such has Joana Gabriela Melo Almeida, Joana Gabriela Abreu Melo Almeida (two surnames from the mother, one from the father), Joana Gabriela Abreu Santos Almeida (one name from the mother, two from the father), or even Joana Gabriela Abreu Melo Santos Almeida (two names from each parent). It would also be possible to use surnames that {{are not part of}} either parent's legal name, but which the <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> entitled to use, i.e., a surname from a grandparent or a great-grandparent that was not transmitted to the father or the mother. This child would probably become known by her final surname, Joana Almeida. However, her parents could decide to change the order of surnames and name her Joana Almeida Melo, etc. In this case she would probably be known as Joana Melo.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

500|$|Both Fishburne and Bassett also {{remarked that}} an {{important}} message of Akeelah and the Bee is to [...] "speak properly" [...] rather than strictly in vernacular, although Bassett {{emphasized the importance of}} the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees.

500|$|Druckmann {{felt that}} players, {{specifically}} <b>parents,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able {{to relate to}} Joel's character and his bonding with Ellie.

Druckmann became intrigued by players who discussed Joel's morality, distinguishing him as a hero or villain; Druckmann felt that Joel was only [...] "a complex person who's made good and bad decisions", but allowed it {{to be open to}} interpretation. When auditioning for the role, Baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated Joel had [...] "few moral lines left to cross", which became the [...] "anchor point" [...] to the character for him. Baker found great difficulty in filming the game's prologue, which features scenes with Joel and his daughter Sarah, portrayed by Hana Hayes. Upon later viewing of the first day of footage from the scene, Druckmann felt that it could still be improved. When filming the scene again, Druckmann explained to Baker how to perform it, and felt that it was the best take upon doing so.

Ultimately, the narrative became an exploration of how willing a father is to save a child; initially, Joel is willing to sacrifice himself, before evolving where {{he is willing to}} sacrifice his friends, until finally feeling that he would sacrifice all of humanity in order to save Ellie.

Limited parenting research has addressed Asians originating from Hong Kong and Canton. The current study examined Chinese adolescents??? academic achievement in relation to parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian and permissive) in this specific ethnic group. The study also examined the differences between parenting styles of Chinese mothers and fathers. The study sample included 30 adolescents {{between the ages of}} 13 to 17 years and their parents of Chinese descent in Sacramento, California. Questionnaires, and demographic survey, in both English and Chinese were administered to assess parenting styles and adolescent grade point average (GPA). It was hypothesized that authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> positively related to GPA and authoritarian <b>parenting</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> inversely related to GPA.
