The Sydney inhomogeneous <b>piloted</b> <b>burner</b> is employed as the experimental platform with two main fuels, namely, compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. Various concentrations of five gases are used in the pilot stream, hydrogen, acetylene, oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, to enable a sufficient range in exploring the following parameters: pilot heat release, temperature, burnt gas velocity, equivalence ratio, and H/C ratio. The experimental results are mainly presented in the form of blow-off limits and supported by simple calculations, which simulate various conditions of the pilot–mixture interface. It is found that increasing the pilot adiabatic flame temperature benefits the flame stability and has an even greater influence than the heat release, which is also known to enhance the blow-off limits. Conversely, increasing the pilot burnt gas velocity reduces the blow-off velocity, except for the limiting case when the jet is fully non-premixed. The H/C ratio has negligible effects, while resorting to lean pilots significantly increases the stability of globally rich partially premixed and premixed jets. Such findings are consistent with trends obtained from laminar flame calculations for rich fuel/air mixtures issuing against hot combustion products to simulate the pilot stream...|$|R

Notwithstanding the lower temperature thresholds of 800 K imposed by the population of excitation species for the NTLAF method and of 1, 200 K imposed by the mechanism of releasing gas-phase indium from its salt, the comparisons of conditional and pseudo-unconditional means with thermocouple measurements performed {{in a range of}} turbulent spray flames are quite favourable. The NTLAF signal quality deteriorates on the jet centreline at upstream locations and on the lean side of the flame, the former being largely due to insufficient conversion of indium chloride to indium atoms and the latter potentially due to indium oxidation. Nevertheless, the signal-to-noise ratios obtained in the reaction zone regions are good and the results reveal the expected temperature trends in the turbulent spray flames tested here.

40|$|In {{line with}} the general theme of the International Workshop series on Turbulent Combustion of Sprays (TCS), this Chapter {{addresses}} relevant issues of turbulent flame structure, auto-ignition and atomization with reference to wellcharacterized burners that could be implemented by modelers with relative ease. The discussion of turbulent combustion is limited to dilute sprays stabilized on a simple <b>piloted</b> <b>burner.</b> Attention is shifted {{to the structure of}} the reaction zones and the challenges of computing chemical composition of flames of different fuels. Another section is dedicated to studying auto-ignition of turbulent dilute spray flames as observed in a hot vitiated co-flow. A common feature to all liquid fuels studied here is the presence of ignition kernels which grow (and sometimes extinguish) to induce flaming combustion further downstream. It is noted that this downstream region is responsible for the bulk of heat release and its local compositional structure depends on the parent fuel. The last section focuses on non-reacting dense sprays with a view to shed some light on the effects of turbulence on secondary atomization. Two configurations are discussed: one for droplets flowing in a pipe and the other uses dense sprays generated with an air assisted atomizer. The carrier velocity is changed in both configurations to induce turbulence which affects atomization as clearly demonstrated by the reported measurements. While this chapter is not necessarily a roadmap for the efforts of future TCS workshops, the topics addressed here form a logical progression that is somewhat commensurate with the increasing order of complexity generally sought for computations. 29 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is the formulation, {{development and implementation of}} Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to turbulent combustion problems, for the representation of reduced chemical kinetics. Although ANNs are general and robust tools for simulating dynamical systems within reasonable computational times, their employment in combustion has been limited. In previous studies, ANNs were trained with data collected from either the test case of interest or from a similar problem. To overcome this training drawback, in this work, ANNs are trained with samples generated from an abstract problem; the laminar flamelet equation, allowing the simulation {{of a wide range of}} problems. To achieve this, the first step is to reduce a detailed chemical mechanism to a manageable number of variables. This task is performed by the Rate-Controlled Constrained Equilibrium (RCCE) reduction method. The training data sets consist of the composition of points with random mixture fraction, recorded from flamelets with random strain rates. The training, testing and simulation of the ANNs is carried out via the Self-Organising Map - Multilayer Perceptrons (SOM-MLPs) approach. The SOM-MLPs combination takes advantage of a reference map and splits the chemical space into domains of chemical similarity, allowing the employment of a separate MLP for each sub-domain. The RCCE-ANNs tabulation is used to replace conventional chemistry integration methods in RANS computations and LES of real turbulent flames. In the context of RANS the interaction of turbulence and combustion is described by using a PDF method utilising stochastic Lagrangian particles. In LES the sub-grid PDF is represented by an ensemble of Eulerian stochastic fields. Test cases include non-premixed and partially premixed turbulent flames in both non-piloted and <b>piloted</b> <b>burner</b> configurations. The comparison between RCCE-ANNs, real-time RCCE and experimental measurements shows good overall agreement in reproducing the overall flame structure and a significant speed-up of CPU time by the RCCE-ANN method.

The furnace operates by allowing a short natural gas flame to burn over the face of a wall of porous fire brick on two sides of the furnace. Each firing wall uses two main burners and a <b>pilot</b> <b>burner</b> to heat the porous fire brick to a luminous glow. Regulators and orifice valves are used to provide a minimum gas pressure of 4 in. water column at a rate of approximately 1, 450 scf/h to the burners. The gas flow rate was calculated by determining the gas flow appropriate for the instrumentation in the gas line. Observed flame length and vendor literature were used to calculate <b>pilot</b> <b>burner</b> gas consumption. Air for combustion, purging, and cooling is supplied by a single blower. Rough calculations of the air-flow distribution in piping entering the furnace show that air flow to the burners approximately agrees with the calculated natural gas flow. A simple on/off control loop is used to maintain a temperature of 1, 000 F in the furnace chamber. Hoods and glove boxes provide contamination control during furnace loading and unloading and ash handling. Fan EF- 120 exhausts the hoods, glove boxes, and furnace through filters to Stack 33.

40|$|A {{new design}} for a <b>piloted</b> <b>burner</b> is {{introduced}} with capabilities to stabilize turbulent flames that span the entire mixture fraction range from fully premixed to non-premixed. The pilot annulus surrounds two concentric tubes, one for the fuel and another for the air. A key feature of the burner is that the central tube, carrying fuel or air, may be recessed upstream of the annular stream such that the mixture at the jet exit plane becomes partially premixed {{with a level of}} inhomogeneity or stratification that varies with the recessed distance. The stability limits of the burner are mapped and it is found that, as the central tube is gradually recessed, the flame stability is enhanced as compositionally inhomogeneous mixtures issue from the burner exit, before decreasing at large recession distances where the burner operates as a homogeneous partially premixed burner. CNG and methane flames with a fixed air-to-fuel ratio (2 : 1), varying levels of inhomogeneity and different departures from blow-off are studied here to reveal the mechanisms contributing to this enhanced stability. Mixture fraction at the burner exit is measured using the Rayleigh technique and laser Doppler velocimetery is used to measure the flow fields. A data base of scalar information gathered at Sandia’s Raman-Rayleigh-LIF line facility is presented along side high-speed laser induced florescence of the hydroxyl radical. Additionally, a novel approach is introduced to identify the presence of out-of-plane motion in planar measurements of reactive structures evolving in turbulent flames. The technique combines planar (P) and volume (V) cross imaging (V orthogonal to P) of laser induced fluorescence from the hydroxyl radical (P-V-XLIF-OH). Using turbulent piloted non-premixed flames of CNG as a test-bed, it is shown that reasonable estimates for the actual rates of flame sheet breakage and closure can be obtained exclusively from the planar images by applying sensible processing methods.

Measurements of soot formation were performed in laminar flat premixed flames and turbulent non-premixed jet flames at 1 atm pressure and in turbulent liquid spray flames under representative conditions for takeoff in a gas turbine engine. The laminar flames and open jet flames used both ethylene and a prevaporized JP- 8 surrogate fuel composed of n-dodecane and m-xylene. The pressurized turbulent jet flame measurements used the JP- 8 surrogate fuel and compared its combustion and sooting characteristics to a world-average JP- 8 fuel sample. The pressurized jet flame measurements demonstrated that the surrogate was representative of JP- 8, with a somewhat higher tendency to soot formation. The premixed flame measurements revealed that flame temperature has a strong impact on the rate of soot nucleation and particle coagulation, but little sensitivity in the overall trends was found with different fuels. An extensive array of non-intrusive optical and laser-based measurements was performed in turbulent non-premixed jet flames established on specially designed <b>piloted</b> <b>burners.</b> Soot concentration data was collected throughout the flames, together with instantaneous images showing the relationship between soot and the OH radical and soot and PAH.

The results show that oil and gas flames lead to significantly higher NOx formation than solid fuel flames. In general, the thermal formation route is shown to be an important contributor to NOx formation, i. e. also for the solid fuels...|$|R
40|$|Large eddy {{simulations}} of pulverised coal combustion (PCC-LES) stabilised on a laboratory-scale <b>piloted</b> jet <b>burner</b> are carried out. The joint simulation effort of three research groups at Freiberg University (FG), Imperial College (IC) and Stuttgart University (ST) is presented, {{and the details}} of the comprehensive coal combustion models and their numerical implementation in three different computer programs are discussed. The (standard) coal sub-models and parameters used by the different groups are unified wherever possible. Differences amongst the groups are a different code basis and an Eulerian treatment of the coal particles by IC, while FG and ST use the Lagrangian framework for particle transport. The flow modelling is first validated for the corresponding non-reacting case and all LES calculations accurately capture the experimental trends. Velocity field statistics for the PCC case are in good accordance with the experimental evidence, but scalar statistics illustrate the complexity of coal combustion modelling. The results show notable differences amongst the groups that cannot only be attributed to the different treatment of the particle phase, and they highlight the difficulty to assess and interpret the quality of specific modelling approaches, and a need for further work by the research community. The present study is the first to compare three originally independent transient coal simulations and a step towards comprehensive PCC-LES...|$|R
