5|$|The {{development}} of the RP-77 began in 1955. Similar in outline to Radioplane's earlier OQ-19, four prototypes of the RP-77 were constructed, two each of the RP-77, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> four-cylinder McCulloch piston engine, and of the RP-77A, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> six-cylinder Lycoming engine. Results of flight-testing were insufficient to interest the U.S. Army, however in 1957 a proposal for an improved RP-77D, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Boeing 502 turboprop, resulted in a contract {{for the construction of}} 20 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pump, itself <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> motorcycle starter motor. This {{was based on the}} principle of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E

5|$|A second {{demonstration}} ran between 15 December 2009 and February 2010 at the Waterways Visitor Centre in Dublin, and was streamed via Steorn's website. The demonstration was of {{a device}} <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rechargeable battery. Steorn said that the device produced more energy than it consumed and recharged the battery. No substantive details of the technology were revealed and no independent evidence of Steorn's claim was provided.|$|E
5|$|A {{specification}} {{was issued}} by the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) for a single-seat, carrier-based fighter <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Westinghouse 24C (later J34) axial turbojet on 5 September 1944. Chance Vought was awarded a contract for three V-340 (company designation) prototypes on 29 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|An {{active galaxy}} is a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.|$|E

5|$|Art Connections {{underwent}} a complete renovation in 2004. Most {{of the work}} went into installing new, high-tech activities, including a virtual canvas <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> laser-light paintbrush and a room that turns dancers' shadows into art on the wall.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
5|$|The AFVG {{was to be}} <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pair of SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley M45G turbofans, {{which were}} to be fed by Mirage-style half-shock cone inlets. The engine {{development}} programme contract was to be issued by the French government to a SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley joint venture company registered in France.|$|E
50|$|Go-Joe - The Go-Joe was Rupp's {{all-terrain}} vehicle {{produced in}} 1973. It too had a red fiberglass {{body and the}} same wheels as the Ruppster. It was <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> 8 HP engine. Rupp also produced a Mini Go-Joe in limited quantities which was <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> 3-1/2 HP engine.|$|R

5|$|The HSV W427 will {{be noted}} in TWR / HSV {{history as the}} only car to which Tom Walkinshaw 'personally' {{attached}} his name. It {{was not the first}} Holden Commodore-based vehicle to be <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 7.0L LS7 V8 engine as that honour went to the more affordable Corsa Specialised Vehicles GTS.|$|E
5|$|The P.1067 first {{flew from}} RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 6,500lbf (28.91kN) Rolls-Royce Avon 103 engine from an English Electric Canberra bomber. The second {{prototype}} was {{fitted with a}} 7,550lbf (33.58kN) Avon 107 turbojet. Hawker's third prototype was powered by an 8,000lbf (35.59kN) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101. Production Hunters were fitted with either the Avon or the Sapphire engine.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{were the}} side-loading paddle steamers Gordon, Duncan and Hutton, named after General Gordon of Khartoum, Colonel Francis Duncan MP and Professor Charles Hutton. Each was <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{condensing}} engine manufactured by John Peen & Son of Greenwich producing 100 nominal horsepower.|$|E

5|$|The {{grinding}} equipment is <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pair of overshot wheels, which transfer {{power to the}} crown wheel via a series of belts. This then drives the grinding stones and sack lift. There is a doorway {{on the first floor}} to allow material to be hoisted up the building.|$|E
5|$|The next models Leslie {{produced}} {{were the}} 21H and the 22H, {{which had a}} cabinet in a similar styling to the better known 122, with the same dimensions and louvres. They were <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 40 watt tube amplifier.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} types of torches {{designed}} for use on the relay: a standard solid fuel powered torch made of aluminium, a special butane gas torch used onboard HMS Whitesand Bay, and a final torch used to enter Empire Stadium that was made of stainless steel and <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> magnesium candle.|$|E

5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} {{who claimed}} to have invented a perpetual motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E
5|$|From the {{northern}} terminus, a tramway connected the canal to iron works at Aberdare and Hirwaun. This {{was built in}} 1803, and included an incline just north of Glynneath, which was <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> high-pressure Trevithick steam engine. The Tappenden brothers had bought into the iron industry in 1802, and built the tramway because of high tolls on the Glamorganshire Canal, but by 1814 they were bankrupt, and had no further connections with the canal.|$|E
5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and is <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that {{it could also be}} used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
