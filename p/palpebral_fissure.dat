25|$|Measurement of FAS facial {{features}} uses criteria {{developed by the}} University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide, a five-point Likert Scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). <b>Palpebral</b> <b>fissure</b> length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{clinical}} setting, the principal difficulties in differential diagnosis arise {{as a consequence}} of the very early age at which patients with this condition first present. The clinician must be persistent in examining abduction and adduction, and in looking for any associated <b>palpebral</b> <b>fissure</b> changes or head postures, when attempting to determine whether what often presents as a common childhood squint (note-"squint" [...] is a British term for two eyes not looking in the same direction) is in fact Duane syndrome. Fissure changes, and the other associated characteristics of Duane's such as up or down shoots and globe retraction, are also vital when deciding whether any abduction limitation is the result of Duane's and not a consequence of VI or abducens cranial nerve palsy.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a sister and brother born to healthy, double first cousin Iranian parents with a {{seemingly}} unique combination of signs and symptoms consisting of intellectual disability, congenital absent voice (aphonia), hearing loss, optic atrophy, retinal dystrophy, mildly broad thumbs, and duplicated halluces.

This phenotype {{does not meet the}} diagnostic criteria of any known entity. Because of parental consanguinity, absence of manifestations in parents, and occurrence in sibs of opposite sex, an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance is likely.
