40|$|Objectives: To {{address a}} {{shortfall}} in evidence {{with which to}} justify gambling-specific interventions for the Indigenous population, we analysed two surveys (2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey and General Social Survey) that contain information on reported <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> for the NT. Methods: Estimates of reported <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> are presented for each state and territory by remoteness for the Indigenous and total population for 2002. Factor {{analysis was used to}} identify the relationship between <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> and other negative life events for the NT Indigenous and total population. Results: High levels of reported <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> were apparent for the Indigenous population particularly in the remote parts of the NT and Queensland. <b>Gambling</b> <b>problems</b> were associated with other stressors relating to social transgressions. Among the NT Indigenous population, <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> were correlated with levels of crowding, community involvement, personal and community violence and self-assessed health status. Conclusions: The high levels of reported <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> suggest that <b>gambling</b> is causing significant problems for Indigenous people. The multivariable adjusted associations indicate that gambling-related problems are intimately connected to a range of community contexts.

The Delphi expert consensus method was used to develop guidelines for how a concerned family member, friend or member of the public can recognise the signs of <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> and support a person to change their gambling. METHODS: A systematic review of websites, books and journal articles was conducted to develop a questionnaire containing items about the knowledge, skills and actions needed for supporting a person with <b>gambling</b> <b>problems.</b> These items were rated over three rounds by two international expert panels comprising people with a lived experience of <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> and professionals who treat people with <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> or research <b>gambling</b> <b>problems.</b> RESULTS: A total of 66 experts (34 with lived experience and 32 professionals) rated 412 helping statements according to whether they thought the statements should be included in these guidelines.

This qualitative interpretive study explored the impacts of <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> on partners. In-depth interviews were conducted with 18 partners and ex-partners of people with <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> to understand their experiences of <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> from their perspectives. The findings showed that partners experienced a wide range of negative effects, especially on their financial security, their emotional, mental and physical health, and on their relationships. The financial impacts of <b>gambling</b> <b>problems</b> on partners were substantial and far-reaching. Some partners were forced to take up extra employment to cover household expenses and pay off gambling-related debts. Others lost their savings, homes, belongings and established ways of life. While these impacts were extensive, partners also experienced a range of emotional impacts that were equally devastating. Their gambling partner’s lies, dishonesty and concealment of <b>problems</b> and <b>gambling</b> behaviour created considerable distress, loss of trust and a sense of betrayal. These experiences undermined these partners’ sense of self-identity, and created additional conflicts within their relationships. Along with accumulating mental and physical health impacts, these challenges lead to separation and/or divorce for many participants. These findings point to the need for greater understanding of partners’ experiences and public health initiatives that protect partners and their families from the harmful effects of <b>gambling</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|R
