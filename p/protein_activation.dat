40|$|Protein C is an {{important}} regulatory mechanism of blood coagulation. Protein C functions as an anticoagulant when converted to the active serine protease form on the endothelial cell surface. Thrombomodulin (TM), an endothelial cell surface receptor specific for thrombin, {{has been identified as}} an essential component for <b>protein</b> C <b>activation.</b> Although <b>protein</b> C can be activated directly by the thrombin–TM complex, the conversion is known as a relatively low-affinity reaction. Therefore, <b>protein</b> C <b>activation</b> has been believed to occur only in microcirculation. On the other hand, we have identified and cloned a novel endothelial cell surface receptor (EPCR) that is capable of high-affinity binding of protein C and activated protein C. In this study, we demonstrate the constitutive, endothelial cell–specific expression of EPCR in vivo. Abundant expression was particularly detected in the aorta and large arteries. In vitro cultured, arterial endothelial cells were also found to express abundant EPCR and were capable of promoting significant levels of <b>protein</b> C <b>activation.</b> EPCR was found to greatly accelerate <b>protein</b> C <b>activation</b> by examining functional activity in transfected cell lines expressing EPCR and/or TM. EPCR decreased the dissociation constant and increased the maximum velocity for <b>protein</b> C <b>activation</b> mediated by the thrombin–TM complex. By these mechanisms, EPCR appears to enable significant levels of <b>protein</b> C <b>activation</b> in large vessels.

2500|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{depends on}} a second messenger cascade regulating gene transcription {{and changes in the}} levels of key proteins at synapses such as CaMKII and PKAII. Activation of the second messenger pathway leads to increased levels of CaMKII and PKAII within the dendritic spine. These protein kinases have been linked to growth in dendritic spine volume and LTP processes such as the addition of AMPA receptors to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of ion channels for enhanced permeability. Localization or compartmentalization of activated proteins occurs in the presence of their given stimulus which creates local effects in the dendritic spine. Calcium influx from NMDA receptors is necessary for the activation of CaMKII. This activation is localized to spines with focal stimulation and is inactivated before spreading to adjacent spines or the shaft, indicating an important mechanism of LTP in that particular changes in <b>protein</b> <b>activation</b> can be localized or compartmentalized to enhance the responsivity of single dendritic spines. Individual dendritic spines are capable of forming unique responses to presynaptic cells. This second mechanism can be triggered by protein phosphorylation but takes longer and lasts longer, providing the mechanism for long-lasting memory storage. [...] The duration of the LTP can be regulated by breakdown of these second messengers. [...] Phosphodiesterase, for example, breaks down the secondary messenger cAMP, which has been implicated in increased AMPA receptor synthesis in the post-synaptic neuron [...]|$|E
