50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage</b> of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths. Structures called chiasmata are {{the site of the}} exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.|$|E

At sequential times animals were killed and testicular histology examined. The initial and major site of damage following EGME treatment was restricted to the primary spermatocytes undergoing postzygotene meiotic maturation and division. EGEE produced damage of an identical nature, but a larger dose was required to elicit equivalent severity (500 mg EGEE/kg being approximately equivalent to 100 mg EGME/kg). Additionally, within the spermatocyte population, differential sensitivity was observed depending on the precise stage of meiotic maturation: dividing (stage XIV) and early <b>pachytene</b> (<b>stages</b> I-II) > late <b>pachytene</b> (<b>stages</b> VIII-XIII) > mid-pachytene (stages III-VII). Equivalent doses of methoxyacetic acid (MAA) and ethoxyacetic acid (EAA) gave injury similar to the corresponding glycol ether. When animals were pretreated with inhibitors of alcohol metabolism followed by a testicular toxic dose of EGME (500 mg/kg), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (pyrazole) offered complete protection. Pretreatment with the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors disulfiram or pargyline did not ameliorate the testicular toxicity of EGME. In mixed cultures of Sertoli-germ cells, MAA and not EGME produced effects on spermatocytes analogous to that seen in vivo, at concentrations approximately equivalent to steady-state plasma levels after a single oral dose of EGME (500 mg/kg). It would seem likely that a metabolite (MAA or possibly methoxyacetaldehyde) and not EGME is responsible for the production of testicular damage...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{relationships}} of acrocentric chromosomes were studied during prophase I of meiosis in human oocytes and spermatocytes by using cytogenetic techniques, electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During sperm iogenesis, histones are {{replaced}} by transition proteins, which in turn {{are replaced}} by protamines. The TNP 1 gene-encoding TP 1 (transition protein 1) protein contains a cAMPresponsive element (CRE) that serves as binding site for the CRE modulator (CREM). To gain further insight into the complex regulation of nucleoprotein exchanges in haploid spermatids and its potential role for spermatogenic impairment, we studied the gene expression of testis-specific histone Hit, CREM, and TNP 1 in testicular biopsies from men with normal spermatogenesis (n = 20) and with round spermatid maturation arrest (n = 16).

5000|$|Spermatocytes {{regularly}} overcome double-strand {{breaks and}} other DNA damages in the prophase stage of meiosis. These damages can arise by the programmed activity of Spo11, an enzyme employed in meiotic recombination, {{as well as}} by un-programmed breakages in DNA, such as those caused by oxidative free radicals produced as products of normal metabolism. These damages are repaired by homologous recombination pathways and utilize RAD1 and γH2AX, which recognize double strand breaks and modify chromatin, respectively. As a result, double strand breaks in meiotic cells, unlike mitotic cells, do not typically lead to apoptosis, or cell death.Homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of double-strand breaks occurs in mice during sequential stages of spermatogenesis but is most prominent in spermatocytes. [...] In spermatocytes, HRR events occur mainly in the <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage</b> of meiosis and the gene conversion type of HRR is predominant, whereas in other stages of spermatogenesis the reciprocal exchange type of HRR is more frequent. [...] During mouse spermatogenesis, the mutation frequencies of cells at the different stages, including pachytene spermatocytes, are 5 to 10-fold lower than the mutation frequencies in somatic cells. Because of their elevated DNA repair capability, spermatocytes likely {{play a central role in}} the maintenance of these lower mutation rates, and thus in the preservation of the genetic integrity of the male germ line.|$|E

40|$|Meiotic {{silencing}} of sex chromosomes {{may cause}} their depletion of meiosis-specific genes during evolution. Here, we challenge this hypothesis by reporting {{the identification of}} TEX 11 as the first X-encoded meiosis-specific factor in mice. TEX 11 forms discrete foci on synapsed regions of meiotic chromosomes {{and appears to be}} a novel constituent of meiotic nodules involved in recombination. Loss of TEX 11 function causes chromosomal asynapsis and reduced crossover formation, leading to elimination of spermatocytes, respectively, at the pachytene and anaphase I stages. Specifically, TEX 11 -deficient spermatocytes with asynapsed autosomes undergo apoptosis at the <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage,</b> while those with only asynapsed sex chromosomes progress. However, cells that survive the <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage</b> display chromosome nondisjunction at the first meiotic division, resulting in cell death and male infertility.

40|$|SummaryDNA {{damage to}} the {{germline}} genome must be accurately repaired to ensure transmission of intact genetic information to following generations. Meiosis presents challenges to the DNA damage response (DDR) because it universally requires changes to chromosome structure that can affect DNA repair outcomes. We report {{the existence of a}} meiotic DDR at chromosome axes that results in chromatin remodeling, synaptonemal complex disassembly, and axis separation in response to irradiation at late <b>pachytene</b> <b>stages</b> in C. elegans. The axis component HTP- 3 is required for germline acquisition of H 2 AacK 5, an axis-specific chromatin mark that is DNA damage responsive. Irradiated wild-types show reduction of H 2 AacK 5 and axis separation that are dependent on the acetyltransferase MYS- 1 /TIP 60. Restoration of H 2 AacK 5 levels requires ATM- 1 kinase and correlates with resynapsis. We propose that the meiotic DDR involves early chromatin remodeling at chromosome axes to dismantle structures promoting interhomolog recombination and facilitate efficient nonhomolog-based repair before pachytene exit...|$|R
40|$|Msh 4 (MutS homolog 4) is {{a member}} of the {{mammalian}} mismatch repair gene family whose members are involved in postreplicative DNA mismatch repair as well as in the control of meiotic recombination. In this report we show that MSH 4 has an essential role in the control of male and female meiosis. We demonstrate that MSH 4 is present in the nuclei of spermatocytes early in prophase I and that it forms discrete foci along meiotic chromosomes during the zygotene and <b>pachytene</b> <b>stages</b> of meiosis. Disruption of the Msh 4 gene in mice results in male and female sterility due to meiotic failure. Although meiosis is initiated in Msh 4 mutant male and female mice, as indicated by the chromosomal localization of RAD 51 and COR 1 during leptonema/zygonema, the chromosomes fail to undergo normal pairing.

40|$|Piwi-interacting RNAs are {{a diverse}} class of small non-coding RNAs {{implicated in the}} {{silencing}} of transposable elements and the safeguarding of genome integrity. In mammals, male germ cells express two genetically and developmentally distinct populations of piRNAs at the pre-pachytene and <b>pachytene</b> <b>stages</b> of meiosis, respectively. Pre-pachytene piRNAs are mostly derived from retrotransposons and required for their silencing. In contrast, pachytene piRNAs originate from ~ 3, 000 genomic clusters, and their biogenesis and function remain enigmatic. Here, we report that conditional inactivation of the putative RNA helicase MOV 10 L 1 in mouse spermatocytes produces a specific loss of pachytene piRNAs, significant accumulation of pachytene piRNA precursor transcripts, and unusual polar conglomeration of Piwi proteins with mitochondria. Pachytene piRNA-deficient spermatocytes progress through meiosis without derepression of LINE 1 retrotransposons, but become arrested at the post-meiotic round spermatid stage with massive DNA damage. Our results demonstrate that MOV 10 L 1 acts upstream of Piwi proteins in the primary processing of pachytene piRNAs and suggest that, distinct from pre-pachytene piRNAs, pachytene piRNAs fulfill a unique function in maintaining post-meiotic genome integrity...|$|R

This monofactorial, Mendelian, autosomic, semi-dominant mutation was thermosensitive {{between the}} beginning of the <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage</b> and that of the dialrine-tic stage. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated the lack of membranes between newly formed oocytes, and between these oocytes and the rachis. These cellular membranes appear again {{towards the end of the}} <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage.</b> They delimit anucleated or multinucleated cytoplasmic islets of varying sizes rather than a normal anucleated rachis. Beyond the ootestis loop, during cytoplasmic growth, oocytes are individualized but contain a large number of pseudo-pachytene nuclei.

40|$|Chromosome {{movements}} are a general feature of mid-prophase of meiosis. In budding yeast, meiotic chromosomes exhibit dynamic movements, led by nuclear envelope (NE) -associated telomeres, throughout the zygotene and <b>pachytene</b> <b>stages.</b> Zygotene motion underlies the global tendency for colocalization of NE-associated chromosome {{ends in a}} "bouquet. " In this study, we identify Csm 4 as a new molecular participant in these processes and show that, unlike the two previously identified components, Ndj 1 and Mps 3, Csm 4 is not required for meiosis-specific telomere/NE association. Instead, it acts to couple telomere/NE ensembles to a force generation mechanism. Mutants lacking Csm 4 and/or Ndj 1 display the following closely related phenotypes: (i) elevated crossover (CO) frequencies and decreased CO interference without abrogation of normal pathways; (ii) delayed progression of recombination, and recombination-coupled chromosome morphogenesis, with resulting delays in the MI division; and (iii) nondisjunction of homologs at the MI division for some reason other than absence of (the obligatory) CO(s).

METHODS: Primary spermatocytes were immunolabeled with SCP 3, BRCA 1 and gH 2 AX. We quantified the leptotene, zygotene and <b>pachytene</b> <b>stages,</b> and <b>pachytene</b> abnormalities: asynapsis and fragmented and dotted synaptonemal complexes (SCs). RESULTS: SCP 3 level {{was significantly higher}} in leptotene and zygotene (bouquet) stages in patients, suggesting AZFc may have a direct effect on early prophase. SCs were abnormal in 77. 3 % of pachy-tene nuclei of patients versus 30. 8 % of controls. The two groups differed significantly (P < 0. 001) in asynapsed nuclei, fragmented SC and dotted SCs. In patients, asynapsis were short and limited to a few bivalents. <b>Staging</b> of <b>pachytene</b> nuclei based on the morphology of the XY pair with BRCA 1 revealed a prevalence of early pachytene substages (70. 7 %) in patients.

40|$|Successful {{completion}} of meiosis requires the induction and faithful repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs can be repaired via homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), yet only repair via HR can generate the interhomolog crossovers (COs) needed for meiotic chromosome segregation. Here we identify COM- 1, the homolog of CtIP/Sae 2 /Ctp 1, {{as a crucial}} regulator of DSB repair pathway choice during Caenorhabditis elegans gametogenesis. COM- 1 – deficient germ cells repair meiotic DSBs via the error-prone pathway NHEJ, resulting in a lack of COs, extensive chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. In contrast to its yeast counterparts, COM- 1 is not required for Spo 11 removal and initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but instead promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting the NHEJ complex Ku. In fact, animals defective for both COM- 1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. Further genetic dissection revealed that COM- 1 acts parallel to the nuclease EXO- 1 to promote interhomolog HR at early <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage</b> of meiotic prophase and thereby safeguards timely CO formation. Both of these nucleases, however, are dispensable for RAD- 51 recruitment at late <b>pachytene</b> <b>stage,</b> when homolog-independent repair pathways predominate, suggesting further redundancy and/or temporal regulation of DNA end resection during meiotic prophase. Collectively, our results uncover the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identify a critical role for COM- 1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells...|$|E

The successful isolation of these prepuberal cell types was accomplished by: (a) defining distinctive morphological characteristics of the cells, (b) determining the temporal appearance of spermatogenic cells during prepuberal development, (c) isolating purified seminiferous cords, after dissociation of the testis with collagenase, (d) separating the trypsin-dispersed seminiferous cells by sedimentation velocity at unit gravity, and (e) assessing the identity and purity of the isolated cell types by microscopy. The seminiferous epithelium from day 6 animals contains only primitive type A spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. Type A and type B spermatogonia are present by day 8.

40|$|Platelet-activating factor (PAF) {{has been}} shown to affect sperm {{motility}} and acrosomal function, thereby altering fertility. PAF acetylhydrolase 1 b (PAFAH 1 B) hydrolyzes PAF and is composed of three subunits [the lissencephaly (LIS 1) protein and α 1 and α 2 subunits] and structurally resembles a GTP-hydrolyzing protein. Besides the brain, transcripts for Lis 1, α 1, and α 2 are localized to meiotic and early haploid germ cells. Here, we report disruptions of the α 2 (Pafah 1 b 2) and α 1 (Pafah 1 b 3) genes in mice. Male mice homozygous null for α 2 (α 2 -/-) are infertile, and spermatogenesis is disrupted at mid- or late <b>pachytene</b> <b>stages</b> of meiosis or early spermiogenesis. Whereas mice homozygous mutant for α 1 (α 1 -/-) have normal fertility and normal spermatogenesis, those with disruptions of both α 1 and α 2 (α 1 -/-α 2 -/-) manifest an earlier disturbance of spermatogenesis with an onset at preleptotene or leptotene stages of meiosis. Testicular Lis 1 protein levels are up-regulated in the α 2 -/- and α 1 -/-α 2 -/- mice. Lowering Lis 1 levels by inactivating one allele of Lis 1 in α 2 null or α 1 /α 2 null genetic backgrounds (i. e., α 2 -/-Lis 1 +/- or α 1 -/-α 2 -/-Lis 1 +/- mice) restored spermatogenesis and male fertility. Our data provide evidence for unique roles of the PAFAH 1 B complex and, particularly, the lissencephaly protein Lis 1 in spermatogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Meiotic progression, and {{the number}} of oocytes {{surviving}} to birth, determine the ovarian reserve, yet the control of prenatal oogenesis is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of genetic background and p 53 upon oogenesis in mice. Fetal and neonatal ovaries were analysed in B 6 CBf 1 and B 6 CBf 2 mice from 15. 5 to 21 days post-coitum (dpc) and p 53 (a tumour suppressor gene) knockout, heterozygous and wild-type mice from 15. 5 to 16 dpc. Oocytes in meiotic prophase I (MPI) were identified by labelling synaptonemal complex protein 3, and the specific stage of MPI was classified by the appearance of axial elements. Apoptosis and DNA breaks were assessed by cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP- 1) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL), respectively. The leptotene, zygotene and <b>pachytene</b> <b>stages</b> were earlier in f 1 than f 2 generations with significant differences at all stages (P <= 0. 002). The p 53 (-/-) oocyte populations and those with the presence of p 53 gene differed significantly in terms of: (i) the proportion of oocytes reaching specific stages of MPI on 15. 5 and 16 dpc and (ii) the proportion of oocytes having observed abnormalities in synaptonemal complexes (P < 0. 001). The absence of p 53 resulted in faster progression of oocytes and more with compressed and abnormal axial elements. We observed significant differences between p 53 (-/-), p 53 (+/-) and p 53 (+/+) mice in terms of cleaved PARP- 1 staining and TUNEL. Genotype has an important impact on prenatal meiosis and oocyte apoptosis. p 53 affects the speed of oocyte development and may influence the oocyte selection through apoptosis during MPI...|$|R
