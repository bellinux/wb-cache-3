25|$|In 2014, Bessonov et al. {{reported}} a flexible memristive device comprising a MoOx/MoS2 heterostructure sandwiched between silver electrodes on a <b>plastic</b> <b>foil.</b> The fabrication method is entirely based on printing and solution-processing technologies using two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The memristors are mechanically flexible, optically transparent and produced at low cost. The memristive behaviour of switches {{was found to}} be accompanied by a prominent memcapacitive effect. High switching performance, demonstrated synaptic plasticity and sustainability to mechanical deformations promise to emulate the appealing characteristics of biological neural systems in novel computing technologies.|$|E
2500|$|When Uruguayan Air Force (Fuerza Aérea Uruguaya) Flight 571's Fairchild Hiller FH-227D, T-571 {{crashed in}} the Argentine Andes on 13 October 1972, it begat {{a tale of}} amazing human {{survival}} for the 16 of the 45 on board who were rescued over two months later, after two passengers walked to civilization. The survivors' story was published in , a critically acclaimed book by Piers Paul Read, in 1974. When the story was filmed in 1992 as Alive, directed by Frank Marshall, a similar FH-227 was marked as the doomed aircraft for some shots while Industrial Light and Magic depicted the crash using an eight-foot breakaway model, designed to shear at mid-fuselage. The nose and tail were heavily reinforced while a non-reinforced midsection was built up of <b>plastic,</b> <b>foil,</b> wires and metals so that when it broke it would have the layered metal look of a real airframe breaking up. A cable system was rigged to fly the model, which was on an aligned track, into the miniature mountain, hitting the [...] "sweet spot" [...] on the fuselage, a weakened area barely three inches long.|$|E

50|$|The {{inner cover}} {{provides}} a barrier between the telescoping cover and the bees. In more temperate climates, a <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> {{may be used}} as an inner cover. <b>Plastic</b> <b>foil</b> should not be used to winter bees under, as trapped condensation would cause the hive to become wet, and bees can be lost due to freezing when temperatures fall during the night. In areas with a hot summer, a solid inner cover with a communication hole provides dead-air space for insulation against both heat and cold. This prevents the bees from gluing the top cover to the top bars of the super under it. When an inner cover is used, the top cover is more easily removed from the hive. Notches in the frame of the solid inner cover and telescoping cover can serve as an upper entrance for the bees. A communication hole in the middle allows bees to reach emergency food placed above by the beekeeper if it becomes required.|$|E
