50|$|The Polish defence of {{the post}} office was also sympathetically portrayed in Chapter 18 of The Tin Drum by Günter Grass, The Defence of the Polish Post Office. In the chapter, the protagonist Oskar Matzerath meets his <b>presumptive</b> <b>father</b> Jan Bronski as the latter heads home, trying to avoid {{fighting}} in the looming battle. Upon meeting Oskar, Jan returns to the post office, taking Oskar with him. Oskar is present during the siege, and portrays his <b>presumptive</b> <b>father</b> negatively to the SS, leading him to find himself guilty of Jan's execution. In the novel's penultimate chapter, Oskar and his friend Vittlar encounter a survivor of the siege in Düsseldorf, Viktor Weluhn, whom two men were preparing to execute for his actions at the siege. Viktor and his executioners disappear into the night later in the chapter, with Viktor's fate left unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Several days later, Sandy and the greasers — without Danny — {{are having}} a party in Jan's {{basement}} as Doody, on guitar, performs alongside Roger ("Rock 'N' Roll Party Queen"). Rizzo, who missed her period, suspects she is pregnant and tells the Pink Ladies that the father is a stranger who {{had sex with her}} with a cheap, broken condom. The Burger Palace Boys offer support, which Rizzo rejects. Rizzo is left alone with Sandy, who questions Rizzo on why she rejected her friends and deduces that Kenickie was the <b>presumptive</b> <b>father.</b> Rizzo responds by saying that she is a better person than others make her out to be and that showing weakness is the worst thing she knows ("There Are Worse Things I Could Do"). Rizzo leaves, and Sandy decides what she needs to do to fit in with the greasers ("Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee" [...] (Reprise)).|$|E
40|$|In {{diagnosis}} of paternity {{by means of}} polymorphic markers, the proportion of men excluded {{on the basis of}} the phenotypes of the mother and child is the best index for controlling information. Its expected value, the probability of exclusion of a male chosen at random with respect to a random child-mother couple, calculated from gene frequencies of every genetic system, may be modified by a close relationship between the mother, the real father, and the <b>presumptive</b> <b>father.</b> The father and even more the brother of the mother, if he is the father of the child, diminishes the probability of exclusion of an individual chosen at random in the population, and if he is falsely accused, he has a higher probability of being excluded. On the other hand, the brother of the real father chosen at random in the population has the least chance of being excluded. The two different rules of exclusion are involved in the calculations, the first one being the more reliable...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, {{judicial}} and extrajudicial {{requests for}} paternity testing {{have increased in}} recent years. A retrospective analysis of such private extrajudicial requests received by the legal medicine unit of the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health of Padua University was conducted to identify problem areas most helpful in determining whether to accept private parties’ requests for paternity testing. Such testing is most delicate when a <b>presumptive</b> <b>father</b> may be seeking to disown paternity and when testing is wanted {{without the consent of}} a member of the mother–child–father triangle. Tests that could establish paternity where none has been recognised are less problematic, as the child will not lose out. Legal and ethical–deontological aspects of consent, of the protection of minors and of children’s and parents’ need for follow-up interviews to deal with the outcome of such testing are carefully considered by the Padua University team when deciding whether to accept a request for testing. It is argued that because such issues are not dealt with by mail-order laboratories, the use of such services is inappropriate...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The marked social-class {{differences}} in physical growth of youth, {{as well as}} in a variety of health-related biological characteristics of adults, observed in many industrial societies are as a rule interpreted as non-genetic in nature and therefore as purely phenotypic manifestations of social inequalities in living standards. However, this tacitly adopted no genetics as-sumption has very seldom been subject to any empirical validation. The pres-ent study is an attempt to provide such validation for the population of Poland. The material was collected over the period from 1960 to 1990 and drawn from cases of disputed paternity. It comprises a total of 8861 adults of both sexes; roughly half of them are males, the <b>presumptive</b> <b>fathers.</b> It was found that throughout the period of several decades covered by this study no significant differences appeared between the various social strata in allele frequencies of any of the following 8 genetic loci: ABO, MN, Rh(D), Hp, Gm(a), AcP, PGM 1, EsD. Nor is there any suggestion of long-term trends in allele frequen-cies for any of the above loci. This pattern is {{in sharp contrast to the}} strikingly regular social gradients, and intense secular trends, observed in the population of post-war Poland in stature and age at menarche. It is postulated that the above findings are consonant with the no genetic component hypothesis. KEY WORDS social stratification, allele frequencies, secular trend...|$|R

500|$|Buster {{meanwhile}} {{joins the}} army, but escapes serving in Iraq when {{his hand is}} bitten off by a loose seal (a play on [...] "Lucille") Gob had mistakenly trained to develop a taste for mammal flesh. Buster is refitted with a sharp hook, which he copes with poorly and often brandishes dangerously in social situations. During Buster's long psychological recovery, he bonds with George Sr.'s stoner twin brother Oscar, who moves in with Lucille {{in an attempt to}} rekindle a past love affair. Uncle Oscar slowly reveals himself as Buster's <b>presumptive</b> biological <b>father.</b> Eventually, George Sr. takes revenge on the adulterous Oscar and Lucille by kidnapping Oscar, knocking him unconscious, exchanging appearances with him, and sending him to prison in his place.|$|R
50|$|Philip the Good died in 1467 and Mary's father assumed {{control of}} the duchy of Burgundy. Since her father had no living sons {{at the time of}} his accession, Mary became his heir <b>presumptive.</b> Her <b>father</b> {{controlled}} a vast and wealthy domain made up of the Duchy of Burgundy, the Free County of Burgundy, and the majority of the Low Countries. As a result, her hand in marriage was eagerly sought by a number of princes. The first proposal was received by her father when she was only five years old, in this case to marry the future King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Later she was approached by Charles, Duke of Berry, the younger brother of King Louis XI of France, who was intensely annoyed and attempted to prevent the necessary papal dispensation for consanguinity.|$|R
50|$|In 1131, Magnus had {{his cousin}} and {{potential}} rival for the Danish throne, Canute Lavard, murdered, {{in order to}} position himself as heir <b>presumptive</b> to his <b>father</b> King Niels. After this deed he {{had to return to}} Gothenland, where he was still recognised as king. Though he was eventually backed by Niels, Magnus found himself in a civil war against Lavard's half-brother Eric Emune. The civil war weakened Magnus's position in Sweden. The Swedes chose a landowner from Östergötland, Sverker I, to be their king. According to Saxo's chronology of events this happened around 1132.|$|R
50|$|Named as heir <b>presumptive</b> by her <b>father</b> Grand Duke William IV in 1907 {{to prevent}} a {{succession}} crisis due to his lack of a son, Marie-Adélaïde became Grand Duchess in 1912. She ruled through the First World War, and her perceived support for the German occupation forces led to great unpopularity in Luxembourg as well as neighbouring France and Belgium. In 1919, {{on the advice of}} Parliament and after enormous pressure from the Luxembourgish people, she abdicated on 14 January 1919 in favour of her younger sister Charlotte who managed to save the monarchy and the dynasty in a national referendum (28 September 1919).|$|R
50|$|Li Shouli's father, Li Xián, as {{the heir}} <b>presumptive</b> to his <b>father</b> Emperor Gaozong of Tang, was once created Crown Prince but failed {{in a power}} {{struggle}} with his ambitious mother Wu Zetian. He was deposed and exiled then later forced to commit suicide in 684. Li Shouli's two brothers Guangshun (李光顺) and Shouyi (李守义) both died afterwards as well. Shouli's only sister Lady Changxin (长信郡主) disappeared into history. From childhood, Li Shouli was put under house arrest with sons of Ruizong. It was not until Ruizong was recreated Prince of Xiang that Shouli and his cousins were allowed to live outside the palaces.|$|R
50|$|Muhammad Shah {{was not the}} son of his father's first wife, {{but since}} he was made the heir <b>presumptive</b> during his <b>father's</b> reign, Selangor dignitaries {{accepted}} him as the next Sultan of Selangor. Sultan Muhammad Shah was not as competent in governing the state {{and did not have}} total control over local rajas, village leaders or their districts. By the end of his rule, Selangor was separated into five individual territories, namely Bernam, Kuala Selangor, Kelang, Langat and Lukut. Each area was governed by different leaders and Muhammad Shah only controlled Kuala Selangor. Chinese settlers started mining for tin in the state during his time. The setting up of tin mines in Ampang brought business to the people and this was to be his only recognised success.|$|R
5000|$|Prince Dipangkorn is {{the heir}} <b>presumptive</b> to his <b>father</b> and {{first in line}} to the throne. However, because of Vajiralongkorn's December 2014 divorce from Srirasmi, Dipangkorn's {{position}} {{in the line of}} succession is uncertain. The 1924 Palace Law on Succession lists [...] "the order in the line of succession", following the first-born son of the king to be [...] "the first-born son of the said prince and his royal consort" [...] followed by [...] "younger sons, in order, of the said prince and his royal consort." [...] When Vajiralongkorn ended his relationship with his second wife, he disowned their four sons and said they had renounced their royal titles. However, the Royal Palace continued to recognize their right to use the style HSH, or His Serene Highness.|$|R
50|$|At birth George was {{the likely}} or {{possible}} heir {{to a large}} estate. Most definite was the property of his father's earldom, his mother's Ingoldsthorpe estates, and the more modest jointure of his parents. The latter two were by themselves sufficient to support a baron. He was also heir <b>presumptive</b> (after his <b>father)</b> to the Neville estates of his uncle, the Earl of Warwick. These were entailed to heirs male and the earl had only daughters. Finally, George was likely to inherit (after his mother and grandmother) a third share of the Tiptoft property held by his childless great-uncle the Earl of Worcester. These inheritances altogether would yield around 4,000 pounds a year, which compares favourably with the 4,500 pounds annual income of the Duke of Clarence, the greatest magnate of the time.|$|R

25|$|By all accounts, Eleanor's father {{ensured that}} she had the best {{possible}} education. Eleanor came to learn arithmetic, the constellations, and history. She also learned domestic skills such as household management and the needle arts of embroidery, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving. Eleanor developed skills in conversation, dancing, games such as backgammon, checkers, and chess, playing the harp, and singing. Although her native tongue was Poitevin, she was taught to read and speak Latin, was well versed in music and literature, and schooled in riding, hawking, and hunting. Eleanor was extroverted, lively, intelligent, and strong-willed. In the spring of 1130 her four-year-old brother William Aigret and their mother died at the castle of Talmont on Aquitaine's Atlantic coast. Eleanor became the heir <b>presumptive</b> to her <b>father's</b> domains. The Duchy of Aquitaine was the largest and richest province of France. Poitou, where Eleanor spent most of her childhood, and Aquitaine together were almost one-third the size of modern France. Eleanor had only one other legitimate sibling, a younger sister named Aelith, also called Petronilla. Her half brother Joscelin was acknowledged by WilliamX as a son, but not as his heir. That she had another half brother, William, has been discredited. Later, during the first four years of HenryII's reign, her siblings joined Eleanor's royal household.|$|R
