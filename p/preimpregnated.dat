Other manufacturers use variations on this technique, some including carbon and wood with fibreglass in an epoxy matrix. Other options include <b>preimpregnated</b> ("prepreg") fibreglass and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. Each of these options use a glass-fibre reinforced polymer composite constructed with differing complexity. Perhaps the largest issue with more simplistic, open-mould, wet systems are the emissions {{associated with the}} volatile organics released. <b>Preimpregnated</b> materials and resin infusion techniques avoid the release of volatiles by containing all VOCs. However, these contained processes have their own challenges, namely the production of thick laminates necessary for structural components becomes more difficult.

5000|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} CFRP parts is by layering sheets of carbon fiber cloth into a mold {{in the shape}} of the final product. The alignment and weave of the cloth fibers is chosen to optimize the strength and stiffness properties of the resulting material. The mold is then filled with epoxy and is heated or air-cured. The resulting part is very corrosion-resistant, stiff, and strong for its weight. Parts used in less critical areas are manufactured by draping cloth over a mold, with epoxy either <b>preimpregnated</b> into the fibers (also known as pre-preg) or [...] "painted" [...] over it. High-performance parts using single molds are often vacuum-bagged and/or autoclave-cured, because even small air bubbles in the material will reduce strength. An alternative to the autoclave method is to use internal pressure via inflatable air bladders or EPS foam inside the non-cured laid-up carbon fiber.|$|E

The {{objectives of the}} study were to measure the impact strength of maxillary complete dentures fabricated with high impact acrylic resin and to evaluate the effect of woven E-glass fiber and silane treated glass fiber reinforcement on the impact strength of the Maxillary complete dentures. Methods:One commercially available heat cured acrylic resin (Trevalon HI) was selected. <b>Preimpregnated</b> woven E-glass fibers (Stick Net) and Silane treated glass fibers were used to reinforce ten maxillary complete dentures each.
