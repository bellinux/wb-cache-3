25|$|<b>Pantoprazole</b> was {{identified}} after nearly {{seven years of}} research and registered for clinical use after a further seven years of development, and finally reached its first market in 1994 in Germany. During {{the course of the}} studies on <b>pantoprazole,</b> more than 650 PPIs had been synthesized and evaluated. <b>Pantoprazole</b> obtained high selection criteria in its development process—especially concerning the favorable low potential for interaction with other drugs. Good solubility of <b>pantoprazole</b> and a very high solution stability allowed it to become the first marketed PPI for intravenous use in critical care patients.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 <b>pantoprazole</b> sodium sesquihydrate was {{synthesized}} {{and from}} 1987 onwards {{the development of}} <b>pantoprazole</b> was switched to the sodium salt which is more stable and has better compatibility with other excipients used in the drug formulation.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{comparison}} of <b>pantoprazole</b> sodium with other anti-secretory drugs {{showed that it}} was significantly more effective than H2-receptor antagonists and either equivalent or better than other clinically used PPIs. Another study states rabeprazole undergoes activation over a greater pH range than omeprazole, lansoprazole, and <b>pantoprazole,</b> and converts to the sulphenamide form more rapidly than any of these three drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantoprazole</b> was {{the third}} PPI and was {{introduced}} to the German market in 1994.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantoprazole</b> sodium is {{available}} as gastroresistant or delayed release tablets and as lyophilized powder for intravenous use.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the drugs}} omeprazole, lansoprazole, <b>pantoprazole,</b> and {{rabeprazole}} share common structure and mode of action, each differs somewhat in its clinical pharmacology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantoprazole</b> {{was first}} {{prepared}} in April 1985 {{by a small}} group of scale-up chemists. It is a dimethoxy-substituted pyridine bound to a fluoroalkoxy substituted benzimidazole.|$|E
25|$|PPIs can {{be split}} into two groups based on their basic structure. Though all have a {{substituted}} pyridine part, one group has it linked to various benzimidazoles but the other has it linked to a substituted imidazopyridine. All marketed PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, <b>pantoprazole,</b> etc.) are in the benzimidazole group.|$|E
25|$|Lansoprazole, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Prevacid among others, is a {{medication}} which inhibits the stomach's production of acid. There {{is no evidence that}} its effectiveness is different from that of other PPIs. Lansoprazole, given through a nasogatric tube, effectively controls pH inside the stomach and is an alternative to intravenous <b>pantoprazole</b> in people who are unable to swallow solid-dose formulations.|$|E
25|$|When H. pylori {{infection}} is present, {{the most effective}} treatments are combinations of 2 antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole) and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), sometimes together with a bismuth compound. In complicated, treatment-resistant cases, 3 antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin + clarithromycin + metronidazole) may be used together with a PPI and sometimes with bismuth compound. An effective first-line therapy for uncomplicated cases would be amoxicillin + metronidazole + <b>pantoprazole</b> (a PPI).|$|E
25|$|Optimization of {{substituted}} benzimidazoles {{and their}} antisecretory effects were studied on the newly discovered proton pump to obtain higher pKa {{values of the}} pyridine, thereby facilitating accumulation within the parietal cell and increasing the rate of acid-mediated conversion to the active mediate. As {{a result of such}} optimization the first proton pump inhibiting drug was released on the market, omeprazole. Other PPIs like lansoprazole and <b>pantoprazole</b> would follow in its footsteps, claiming their share of a flourishing market, after their own course of development.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): The PPIs include {{omeprazole}} (Prilosec, Losec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), <b>pantoprazole</b> (Protonix, Pantoloc), and esomeprazole (Nexium). The reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by PPIs can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, but not supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid {{is needed to}} release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Reduced vitamin B12 levels may be more common with PPIs than with H2 antagonists, {{because they are more}} likely to produce achlorhydria (complete absence of gastric acid secretion). Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely, unless PPI therapy is prolonged (2 years or more) or dietary vitamin intake is low. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of PPIs for prolonged periods.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1975, {{timoprazole}} {{was found to}} inhibit acid secretion irrespective of stimulus, extracellular or intracellular. Studies on timoprazole revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inhibition of iodine uptake as well as atrophy of the thymus gland. A literature search showed that some substituted mercapto-benzimidazoles {{had no effect on}} iodine uptake and introduction of such substituents into timoprazole resulted in an elimination of the toxic effects, without reducing the antisecretory effect. A derivative of timoprazole, omeprazole, was discovered in 1979, and was the first of a new class of drug that control acid secretion in the stomach, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Addition of 5-methoxy-substitution to the benzimidazole moiety of omeprazole was also made and gave the compound much more stability at neutral pH. In 1980, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was filed and omeprazole was taken into Phase III human trials in 1982. A new approach for the treatment of acid-related diseases was introduced, and omeprazole was quickly shown to be clinically superior to the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and was launched in 1988 as Losec in Europe, and in 1990 as Prilosec in the United States. In 1996, Losec became the world's biggest ever selling pharmaceutical, and by 2004 over 800 million patients had been treated with the drug worldwide. During the 1980s, about 40 other companies entered the PPIs area, but few achieved market success: Takeda with lansoprazole, Byk Gulden (now Nycomed) with <b>pantoprazole,</b> and Eisai with rabeprazole, all of which were analogues of omeprazole.|$|E
500|$|Once H. pylori is {{detected}} {{in a person}} with a peptic ulcer, the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the ulcer to heal. The standard first-line therapy is a one-week [...] "triple therapy" [...] consisting of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Variations of the triple therapy have been developed over the years, such as using a different proton pump inhibitor, as with <b>pantoprazole</b> or rabeprazole, or replacing amoxicillin with metronidazole for people who are allergic to penicillin. In areas with higher rates of clarithromycin resistance, other options are recommended. Such a therapy has revolutionized the treatment of peptic ulcers and has made a cure to the disease possible. Previously, the only option was symptom control using antacids, H2-antagonists or proton pump inhibitors alone.|$|E

2500|$|A {{clear-cut}} {{design of}} active inhibitors {{was still not}} possible because in the complex multi-step chemistry {{the influence of a}} substituent on each step in the cascade could be different, and therefore not predictable for the overall rate of the prerequisite acid activation. Smith Kline and French, that entered into collaboration with Byk Gulden mid-1984, greatly assisted in determining criteria for further development. From 1985, the aim was to identify a compound with good stability at neutral pH, sustaining this higher level of stability down to pH 5 but being rapidly activateable at lower pHs, combined {{with a high level of}} H+/K+ ATPase inhibition., K+)-ATPase inhibiting 2-benzimidazoles. 4.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of <b>pantoprazole</b> is to inhibit the final step in gastric acid production. In the gastric parietal cell of the stomach, <b>pantoprazole</b> covalently binds to the H+/K+ ATP pump to inhibit gastric acid and basal acid secretion. The covalent binding prevents acid secretion of up to 24 hours and longer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pantoprazole</b> is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 system. Metabolism mainly consists of demethylation by CYP2C19 followed by sulfation. Another metabolic pathway is oxidation by CYP3A4. <b>Pantoprazole</b> metabolites are not thought to have any pharmacological significance. It is usually given with a prokinetic drug because of inactivity in the acidic environment of the stomach. <b>Pantoprazole</b> binds irreversibly to H+K+ATPase (proton pumps) to suppress the secretion of acid. Due to irreversible binding of the pumps, new pumps {{have to be made}} before acid production can be resumed. The drug's plasma half-life is about 2 hours.|$|E
