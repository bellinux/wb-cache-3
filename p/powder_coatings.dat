50|$|A {{wide range}} of organic {{coatings}} are in use for prepainted metal, developed {{in order to provide}} different levels of durability and performance, or to satisfy different aesthetic requirements. The most commonly applied coatings are based upon liquid paints, although films (also known as laminates) and <b>powder</b> <b>coatings</b> are used in smaller quantities. These are liquid paints (e.g. primers, finishes/backing coats, polyesters, plastisols, polyurethanes, polyvinylidene fluorides (PVDF), epoxies), <b>powder</b> <b>coatings</b> and laminate films.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wide range}} of {{specialty}} effects are easily accomplished using <b>powder</b> <b>coatings</b> that {{would be impossible to}} achieve with other coating processes.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>powder</b> <b>coatings</b> have a {{particle}} {{size in the}} range of 2 to 50 μ (Microns), a softening temperature Tg around 80 °C, a melting temperature around 150 °C, and are cured at around 200 °C. for minimum 10 minutes to 15 minutes (exact temperatures and times may depend on the thickness of the item being coated). [...] For such <b>powder</b> <b>coatings,</b> film build-ups of greater than 50 μ (Microns) may be required to obtain an acceptably smooth film. The surface texture which is considered desirable or acceptable depends on the end product. Many manufacturers actually prefer to have a certain degree of orange peel since it helps to hide metal defects that have occurred during manufacture, and the resulting coating is less prone to showing fingerprints.There are very specialized operations where <b>powder</b> <b>coatings</b> of less than 30 micrometres or with a Tg below 40 °C are used in order to produce smooth thin films. One variation of the dry powder coating process, the Powder Slurry process, combines the advantages of <b>powder</b> <b>coatings</b> and liquid coatings by dispersing very fine powders of 1-5 micrometre particle size into water, which then allows very smooth, low film thickness coatings to be produced.|$|E

Surprisingly, this composition has been poorly investigated in the past. Frequent use of commercial designations WC-'CrC'-Ni, WC-Cr 3 C 2 -Ni, and WC-NiCr indicates the insufficient knowledge about the phase compositions of these <b>powders</b> and <b>coatings.</b> The properties of these coatings differ significantly from those of WC-Co and WC-CoCr coatings.

40|$|ANi(3) Al coating was {{prepared}} by plasma spraying technique {{on the surface}} of titanium alloy. Ni-Al mixed <b>powders,</b> <b>coatings</b> and reaction products were investigated by scanning electron microscope, EDS, DSC and XRD. A tight bonding between the coating and the substrate was formed. The X-ray diffraction analysis of the patterns showed that the coating not only had Ni 3 Al phase, but also had NiO and Al 2 O 3 phase microcontent. Comparing Ni coated Al to Ni 3 Al at 900 degrees C, the diffusion was stronger and the diffusion layer was thicker. A minute pore structure was formed at 1200 degrees C in the front edge of solid-state reaction layer. So Ni 3 Al restrained the solid-state reaction of the coating with the substrate, and as a whole weakened the entry of oxygen atoms into the substrate and quenched the out-diffusion of titanium.

30|$|We {{studied the}} {{photocatalytic}} and electrochemical impedance properties {{of two different}} sub-stoichiometric titania powders deposited using plasma spraying. Two different commercial powders with markedly diverse mean size as well as size distribution were chosen. Thermal oxidation of these as-received powders was carried out to restore the O/Ti ratio to be 2.0. By this way, another two kinds of feedstock powders were obtained. Total of four kinds of feedstock powders {{were used in the}} experiments. All powders were sprayed using identical plasma spraying parameters. For some spraying runs, carbon steel served as the substrate, and for others, the previously sprayed titania coating from a different kind of feedstock. Combinations of single- and double-layer coatings were studied. Porosity, microstructure, phase composition, chemical composition, band gap based on reflectance measurement, and photocatalytic activity were examined. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated substantial differences between samples sprayed from the fine and coarse <b>powders.</b> <b>Coatings</b> from oxidized <b>powders</b> were slightly more photocatalytic. High spraying distance used for several of them was good for obtaining low band gap, whereas surface roughness and phase composition were not substantially different compared to standard spraying distance coatings.|$|R

Hard corundum (a-Al 2 O 3) is desirable in coatings, but other phases, unstable at elevated temperatures, also form as result {{of the complexity of}} the spraying processes. When chromia (Cr 2 O 3) is added to Al 2 O 3 a complex corundum type a-(Al,Cr) 2 O 3 phase forms in the deposits. Two types of Al 2 O 3 /Cr 2 O 3 powder feedstock with 2 %, 8 %, 33 % and 50 % Cr 2 O 3 were sprayed: fused materials and mixtures of Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 <b>powders.</b> <b>Coatings</b> were made by the water-stabilized plasma (WSP®) system and by commercial atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) and compared by various characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis.

40|$|The {{influence}} of spray parameters on the microstructure and flexural strength of plasma-sprayed alumina was investigated. Coatings were applied using a small-particle plasma spray (SPPS) method, {{which is a}} recently patented process that allows submicrometer-sized powders to be sprayed. Using identical starting <b>powders,</b> <b>coatings</b> that were produced using two distinctly different spray conditions exhibited significant differences in both microstructure and strength. Scanning electron microscopy investigations of single lamellae (or splats) revealed that, for one spray condition, melted alumina particles will splash when they contact the substrate. The morphology of the splats that comprised the subsequent layers of the coating also were highly fragmented and thinner than lamellae formed under “nonsplashing ” spray conditions. The surface roughness was strongly dependent on the morphology of the lamellae; increased roughness was noted for fragmented splats. Thick coatings that were comprised of splashed splats developed a unique microstructural feature that {{was responsible for the}} observed increase in roughness. These microstructural differences greatly influenced the flexure strength, which varied from 75 � 21 MPa for the nonsplashing spray condition to 17 � 2. 4 MPa for the “splashing ” condition. I...|$|R

The vanadium carbide in the WC- 10 VC-Co powders occurred in the solution as the double carbide (V,W) C and the carbides present in the WC- 10 VC-Co powders were WC and (V,W) C. None of the starting VC {{was left in the}} <b>powders.</b> <b>Coatings</b> were deposited using high pressure high velocity oxy-fuel (HP/HVOF) spraying systems, and characterized by determining the microstructures, the phase compositions and the carbide grain sizes, as had been done for the powders.

Thermal spraying lead to some WC decarburization to W 2 C and eta phase, and to the formation of amorphous binder. The W 2 C grains from the WC decarburization formed in the amorphous binder matrix of coatings. All the coatinge were porous, but the new WC- 10 VC-Co coatings were more porous than the commercial Wc-Co coatings because the spray parameters had only been optimized for the WC-Co coatings.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} {{martensitic stainless steel}} powder, called “powder A”, designed for surface coating with laser cladding and PTA cladding was characterized. The purpose with powder A is to achieve both good corrosion resistance and wear resistance in a stainless steel grade. The investigation of powder A was divided into cladding characterization, microstructural investigation and a property comparison to existing grades 316 HSi and 431 L. Powder A was successfully deposited with laser cladding, exhibiting a wide process window, and PTA cladding. In both cases no preheating was required and no cracks were formed. The microstructure examination indicates that powder A has a martensitic structure possibly containing small amounts of ferrite in the grain boundaries. Thermodynamic calculations in computer software Thermo-Calc 4. 1 supported this theory. The microstructure of powder A proved to be very stable {{over a wide range}} of cladding parameters. Powder A was significantly harder than 316 HSi and 431 L and had better corrosion resistance than 431 L in a chloride environment. Powder A had similar corrosion properties as 316 HSi in the experiments made. The wear performance of the <b>powder</b> A <b>coatings</b> was similar to 431 L.
