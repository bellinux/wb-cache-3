[...] Thompson explained that the disease had afflicted his family as well as millions of others and stated that [...] "there's no candidate in either party more prepared and more motivated to lead this effort than me." [...] He compared the announcement to President Kennedy's pledge to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> on the moon {{before the end of the}} 1960s. The plan consisted of increases in funding for cancer research, including a doubling of the National Institute of Health's budget and additional incentives for private medical professionals to find a cure. Furthermore, Thompson remarked that as part of the plan, he would travel the world to promote cures, improving the United States' international standing. David Miller of CBS News questioned whether the announcement was [...] "a desperate measure by a desperate candidate, or a well-thought out policy by a former Health and Human Services secretary."

The rocket technology in turn enabled both sides to develop Earth-orbiting satellites for communications, and gathering weather data and intelligence. Americans were shocked when the Soviet Union placed the first satellite into orbit in October 1957, leading to a growing fear that the U.S. was falling into a [...] "missile gap". A month later, the Soviets launched Sputnik 2, carrying a dog into orbit. Though the animal was not recovered alive, it was obvious their goal was manned spaceflight. Unable to disclose details of military space projects, President Eisenhower ordered the creation of a civilian space agency in charge of civilian and scientific space exploration.

2500|$|In The Cricketers of My Time, Yalden {{was briefly}} {{mentioned}} in somewhat unfavourable terms by John Nyren whose comments {{may have had}} some substance but, on the other hand, {{it is difficult to}} believe that the Hambledon players were all as perfect as Nyren portrayed them to be. The Hampshire teams promoted by the Hambledon Club were very competitive and so, evidently, were their opponents, among whom Yalden was a prominent member, sometimes as captain. Nyren describes Yalden as [...] "a thin, dark-looking man" [...] and as [...] "not a fine, but a very useful and steady batter". Nyren revered Hambledon's Tom Sueter and Yalden was Sueter's rival as both a wicketkeeper and a batsman, although they played together for Hampshire in 1772. They are the first two players in cricket history to be recognised as [...] "wicketkeeper/batsmen", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone. Nyren chose to denigrate Yalden in comparison with his hero Sueter saying that: [...] "I must place Sueter above Yalden" [...] (i.e., as a wicketkeeper) and that Yalden [...] "was in other respects an inferior man to Sueter". Nyren says that Yalden's [...] "word was not always to be depended on when he had <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> out" [...] as [...] "he would now and then shuffle (sic) and [...] "resort to trick". He goes on to assert that Sueter and the other Hambledon players would not do such things because of [...] "estimation", [...] "honour", [...] "trust" [...] and never questioning the decision of the umpire. Nyren's comments are seriously biased but some balance is provided by the editor's introduction to the modern version of the book when he states that [...] "Yalden – the England wicketkeeper and captain, no less – is dismissed in a few words" [...] while several other notable players are not mentioned at all. Elsewhere the editor discusses Nyren's undoubted plagiarism of an earlier work by William Lambert and it is widely agreed that Nyren's account of Hambledon's players is hagiographic, often at the expense of their opponents, and Yalden is one player who was not given a fair hearing in this book.|$|E
