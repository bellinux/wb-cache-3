50|$|Soil nailing is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by pumping grout down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often <b>pneumatically</b> <b>applied</b> concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated soil nail head plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|R

40|$|Factors {{influencing}} the bond strength between mortars and natural stones of different porosity, pore structure and surface roughness {{have been studied}} in laboratory weathering tests. <b>Applied</b> <b>mortar</b> materials (HGZ-type mortars) {{are based on a}} mixture of gypsum, slag sand and cement. The following natural stone were used: Harz dolomite, reed standstock, green sandstock and carbon sandstock. The hardening of the mortar can be hampered by a dewatering in the case of highly porous stones (reed standstock, green standstock). Long-term stability is reduced by different values of the elastic modulus of stone and mortar. The low-porous, fine structured Harz dolomite is characterized by a low surface roughness and consequently by a small adhesion area. Parameters affecting the bond strength mortar-Harz dolomite have been optimized, and the achieved high stability was demonstrated in weathering experiments.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of strengthening masonry with Textile Reinforced Mortar (TRM) by projecting it to save application time. Nineteen tests on masonry samples strengthened with TRM {{have been carried out}} to assess this new application method. Different mortars and fibre grids were considered for studying their influence and applicability with this new technique. Three points bending tests have been performed on the specimens to compare the flexural strength between cases with manually <b>applied</b> <b>mortar</b> (TRM) and sprayed application (TRSM) of the mortar layer. It was noticed that the strengthening mortar has a significant influence on the failure mode. Results show a remarkable (between 2 and 6 times more) productivity increase when using TRSM and a load-bearing capacity rise for the cases with larger grid spacing and projectable mortar when using TRSM instead of TRM. Greater ductility values were also observed for the TRSM cases in comparison with the analogue TRM cases (same grid and mortar). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} {{contributing}} to binder formation during {{the set of}} a lime mortar reflects the atmospheric 14 C content {{at the time of}} construction of a building. For this reason, the 14 C dating of mortars is used with increasing frequencies in archaeological and architectural research. Mortars, however, may also contain carbonaceous contaminants potentially affecting radiocarbon dating. The Centre for Isotopic Research on Cultural and Environmental heritage (CIRCE) of the Second University of Naples (SUN) has recently obtained some promising results in mortar radiocarbon dating thanks {{to the development of a}} procedure (i. e. CryoSoniC/Cryo 2 SoniC) aiming to eliminate exogenous C contamination that may occur in a mortar. The construction history of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Modena (Italy) is still controversial and represents a challenging case study for the application of absolute dating methodologies for different reasons. From the point of view of 14 C dating, for example, given the high percentage of carbonate aggregates composing these samples, Modena mortars represent an experimental test particularly indicative of exogenous carbon sources suppression ensuring methodology accuracy. In this paper several AMS Radiocarbon dates were carried out on lime lumps with the aim to: (i) verify procedure accuracy by a comparison of the results obtainable from lime lumps dated after different treatments (i. e. bulk lime lumps vs. CryoSoniC purified lime lumps); (ii) compare different building phases absolute chronology for the medieval UNESCO site of Modena, with that assumed by historical sources in order to assess preliminary the 14 C dating feasibility for of the site. Historical temporal constraints and mortar clustering, based on petrography, have been applied to define a temporal framework of the analyzed structure. Moreover, a detailed petrographic characterization of mortars was used both as a preliminary tool for the choice of samples and to infer about the lack of accuracy (when verified) of the <b>applied</b> <b>mortar</b> 14 C dating procedure...|$|R

When he is informed by Andrew that wet bricks bond better to mortar, the team simply continues to lay bricks, with wet bricks over dry ones (as opposed to starting over and having all wet bricks). Furthermore, {{there is very little}} <b>mortar</b> <b>applied,</b> and the <b>mortar</b> is <b>applied</b> after the bricks are in place (as opposed to buttering the brick with mortar before setting the bricks in place).

When the nominators arrive to see the contestants' progress, the nominators (Sheilla in particular) do not like the contestants' work so far in the challenge - in particular Jeff had not used a level at all in the challenge (needed to ensure that each row of bricks are applied to a uniform height). Despite Jaime's last-ditch attempt to level the brickwork using said level (only to stop when he realizes that it is a pointless endeavour with multiple layers of brick already installed), when the challenge is over (after 82 minutes) and the nominators are asked to give a thumbs-up thumbs-down rating, the fire pit received five emphatic thumbs-downs.|$|R
