40|$|The {{simulation}} of many-particle systems often requires the detailed knowledge of <b>proximity</b> <b>relations</b> to reduce computational complexity {{and to provide}} a basis for specific calculations.

40|$|A multiset is a {{collection}} of objects in which repetition of elements is essential. This paper is an attempt to explore the theoretical aspects of multiset by extending the notions of compact, <b>proximity</b> <b>relation</b> and proximal neighborhood to the multiset context.

40|$|For location-based {{services}} it {{is often}} essential to efficiently process proximity relations among mobile objects, such as to establish whether {{a group of friends}} or family members are within a given distance of each other. A severe limitation in accurately establishing such relations is the inaccuracy of dynamically obtained position data, the point in time, and the frequency with which the position data is collected. In this paper, we use the common model of interpreting the unknown position of an object by a probability distribution centered around the last know position of the object. While this approach is straight forward, it poses severe difficulties for establishing the truth or falsehood of the <b>proximity</b> <b>relation.</b> To address this problem, we analytically quantify the lower and upper bounds {{of the size of the}} smallest circle that covers the mobile objects involved in the <b>proximity</b> <b>relation.</b> Based on this result we propose two novel algorithms that closely monitor the relation at low location update cost. Furthermore, we develop a costeffective estimation technique to determine the probability of match for a given <b>proximity</b> <b>relation.</b> ...|$|E

Last, an example is provided to illustrate our proposal in the case of conjunctive queries. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem for}} many location-based applications is the continuous evaluation of <b>proximity</b> <b>relations</b> among moving objects. These relations express whether a given set of objects is in a spatial constellation or in a spatial constellation {{relative to a}} given point of demarcation in the environment. We represent <b>proximity</b> <b>relations</b> as location constraints, which resemble standing queries over continuously changing location position information. The challenge lies in the continuous processing {{of large numbers of}} location constraints as the location of objects and the constraint load change. In this paper, we propose an adaptive location constraint indexing approach which adapts as the constraint load and movement pattern of the objects change. The approach takes correlations between constraints into account to further reduce processing time. We also introduce a new location update policy that detects constraint matches with fewer location update requests. Our approach stabilizes system performance, avoids oscillation, reduces constraint matching time by 70 % for in-memory processing, and reduces secondary storage accesses by 80 % for I/O-incurring environments.

40|$|Proximity {{analyses}} have nowadays {{turned out}} to be a part of the toolbox of regional scientists and this notion recently became very popular in the position of politics, and private or public stakeholders. Proximity is an argument for selling food or financial products, as well as a good slogan for local networks or social devices or even for policymakers. In parallel, the notion of proximity spread in the academic literature and is now commonly used by scholars in regional science, geography or spatial economics. The use of the word proximity increased and grown in importance, in particular for authors interested in the question of milieus, districts, distance analyses, or in recent advances in economic geography or evolutionary geography. Interest is affecting now the works dedicated to innovation process, links between science and industry, relations between users and producers or sub-contractors, national systems of innovation, innovative milieus, about also local labour markets or urban policies. Indeed, the use of the concept of proximity, plural by nature by its spatial as well as non-spatial dimensions, is the key for overcoming the apparent opposition between the reaffirmation of the importance of the local and the death of distance and for escaping the sterile confinement in one or the other extreme positions. But despite the substantial literature on <b>proximity</b> processes and <b>relations,</b> only a few academic works have been devoted to studying the link between regional development and <b>proximity</b> <b>relations.</b> This paper intends to fill this gap and to pave the way for future research in this field. We consider that the integration of the notion of proximity into the framework of regional development analysis provides interesting input due to its plasticity and ability to draw connections between spatial, economic and social dimensions; but also suggests ways of possible changes for regional and territorial policies. The main outline is to try to assess the importance of <b>proximity</b> <b>relations</b> (or obstacles led by <b>proximity</b> <b>relations)</b> in regional development processes, and discuss approaches of different disciplines...|$|R

40|$|We generalize the Boolean power {{construction}} to {{the setting of}} compact Hausdorff spaces. This is done by replacing Boolean algebras with de Vries algebras (complete Boolean algebras enriched with proximity) and Stone duality with de Vries duality. For a compact Hausdorff space X and a totally ordered algebra A, we introduce {{the concept of a}} finitely valued normal function f:X→ A. We show that the operations of A lift to the set FN(X,A) of all finitely valued normal functions, {{and that there is a}} canonical <b>proximity</b> <b>relation</b> ≺ on FN(X,A). This gives rise to the de Vries power construction, which when restricted to Stone spaces, yields the Boolean power construction. We prove that de Vries powers of a totally ordered integral domain A are axiomatized as proximity Baer Specker A-algebras, those pairs (S,≺), where S is a torsion-free A-algebra generated by its idempotents that is a Baer ring, and ≺ is a <b>proximity</b> <b>relation</b> on S. We introduce the category of proximity Baer Specker A-algebras and proximity morphisms between them, and prove that this category is dually equivalent to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps. This provides an analogue of de Vries duality for proximity Baer Specker A-algebras. Comment: 34 page...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we discuss}} a {{recently}} proposed approach for supervised dimensionality reduction, the Supervised Distance Preserving Projection (SDPP) and, we investigate its applicability to monitoring material’s properties from spectroscopic observations. Motivated by continuity preservation, the SDPP is a linear projection method where the <b>proximity</b> <b>relations</b> between {{points in the}} low-dimensional subspace mimic the <b>proximity</b> <b>relations</b> between points in the response space. Such a projection facilitates the design of efficient regression models and it may also uncover useful information for visualisation.
