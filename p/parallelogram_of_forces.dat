Various proofs were developed (chiefly Duchayla's and Poisson's), and these also caused objections.

40|$|Why (according to {{classical}} physics) do forces compose {{according to the}} <b>parallelogram</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces?</b> This question has been controversial; it is one episode in a longstanding, fundamental dispute regarding which facts {{are not to be}} explained dynamically. If the parallelogram law is explained statically, then the laws of statics are separate from and (in an important sense) “transcend ” the laws of dynamics. Alternatively, if the parallelogram law is explained dynamically, then statical laws become mere corollaries to the dynamical laws. I shall attempt to trace the history of this controversy in order to identify what it would be for {{one or the other of}} these rival views to be correct. I shall argue that various familiar accounts of natural law (Lewis’s Best System Account, laws as contingent relations among universals, and scientific essentialism) not only make it difficult to see what the point of this dispute could have been, but also improperly foreclose some serious scientific options. I will sketch an alternative account of laws (including what their necessity amounts to and what it would be for certain laws to “transcend ” others) that helps us to understand what this dispute was all about. 1.

50|$|Gravity and <b>force</b> are {{examples}} <b>of</b> occult qualities. But {{they can be}} useful terms. Gravity can designate concrete bodies in motion and force can designate the concrete effort of resisting. However, {{they should not be}} used abstractly, separate from concrete, individual things. If no change occurs and there is no effect, then there is no force. Force, gravity, and attraction are mathematical, hypothetical abstractions and they are not found in nature as physical qualities. The <b>parallelogram</b> <b>of</b> composite <b>forces</b> is not a physical quality. It is mathematical. Attempts to explain the cause and origin of motion are abstract and obscure. They are not particular and determinate assertions. Such attempts try to explain the unknown by something that is even more unknown.|$|R
40|$|The {{capitalist}} {{state is}} supposed to create conditions for capitalist accumulation and maintain {{the unity of the}} society by pacifying the exploited classes. Yet, the state policies which have precisely these objectives fail. Why? I suggest that {{an important part of the}} answer lies in state form. I pursue this theme by looking at the land-reform policy of the Indian state. The land-reform policy happened to be one of the ways in which the postcolonial Indian state tried to create the conditions for capitalist development. But the democratic form of the state and the class alignment in the society set some limit within which the state had to work, and in particular, conditioned the form that the policy took. In short, the policy became bureaucratic as opposed to popular, and also entailed the mediation of market relation. This form of the policy was not what was struggled for by the lower classes. Yet, the state triumphed in imposing this form of the policy. To the extent that the policy failed to benefit the lower classes and to remove the fetters on capitalist development effectively, this was because of the form of the policy. However, the state has not failed equally everywhere. With a different <b>parallelogram</b> <b>of</b> class <b>forces</b> and thus a different context of the state action in particular States than that which generally existed at the national level and in most States, the outcome of the policy was, to some degree, different there. Statistical and qualitative analyses are presented to support this claim. ...|$|R
