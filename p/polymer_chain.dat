5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main <b>polymer</b> <b>chain.</b> The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

40|$|A kinetic Monte Carlo {{method was}} used to {{simulate}} the diffusion of reptating <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> across an interface. A time-resolved fluorescence technique {{in conjunction with a}} direct energy transfer method {{was used to}} measure the extent of diffusion of dye-labeled reptating <b>polymer</b> <b>chains.</b> The diffusion of donor- and acceptor-labeled <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> between adjacent compartments was randomly generated. The fluorescence decay profiles of donor molecules were simulated at several diffusion steps to produce mixing of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chains.</b> Mixing ratios of donor- and acceptor-labeled <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> in compartments were measured at various stages (snap-shots) of diffusion. It was observed that for a given molecular weight, the average interpenetration contour length was found to be proportional to the mixing ratio. Monte Carlo analysis showed that the curvilinear diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the weight of <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> during diffusion. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} a {{constitutive model}} for glassy polymers is developed. To incorporate {{the distribution of}} the <b>polymer</b> <b>chains,</b> a homogenization procedure involving a chain orientation distribution function is employed. During loading the <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> orient in a certain manner, leading to an evolution of the macroscopic anisotropic properties. This phenomenon is modeled by use of evolution equations for the <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> at the microscopic level...|$|R
30|$|It is {{believed}} <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> relax and extend in fresh water, resulting in high fluid viscosity. While concentration of monovalent ions increases, <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> begin to shrink and coil, leading to reduction in viscosity (Gao 2013).|$|R
25|$|An {{intramolecular}} cyclization {{reaction is}} where the growing <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> reacts with a vinyl functional group on its own chain, rather than with another growing chain in the reaction system. In this way the growing <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> covalently links to itself in a fashion {{similar to that of}} a knot in a piece of string. As such, single chain cyclized/knotted polymers consist of many of these links (intramolecularly cyclized), as opposed to other polymer architectures including branched and crosslinked polymers that are formed by two or more polymer chains in combination.|$|E
25|$|Ethene, however, has no {{permanent}} dipole. The attractive forces between polyethylene chains arise from weak van der Waals forces. Molecules {{can be thought}} of as being surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons. As two polymer chains approach, their electron clouds repel one another. This has the effect of lowering the electron density on one side of a <b>polymer</b> <b>chain,</b> creating a slight positive dipole on this side. This charge is enough to attract the second <b>polymer</b> <b>chain.</b> Van der Waals forces are quite weak, however, so polyethylene can have a lower melting temperature compared to other polymers.|$|E
25|$|Most {{plastics}} contain organic polymers. The {{vast majority}} of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, 'pure' or with the addition of: oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur.

40|$|Hydrogels are {{increasingly}} {{used in a}} variety of biomedical applications 1 - 3 owing to their many advantageous features. Physical properties of hydrogels formed from cross-linking between <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> are regulated with the cross-linking density, type of cross-linking molecules, and chemistry and molecular weight of <b>polymer</b> <b>chains.</b> It is believed that the spatial conformation and organization of <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> in gels are altered by these variables, 4 but this hypothesis has not been examined with gels formed with chemical cross-linking, {{because of the lack of}} analytical tools that allow the organization of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> to be quantified. Several scattering and microscopic techniques 5 have been used to analyze the nano- and microstructure of gels, but these tools do not analyze the spatial intra- and intermolecular arrangements of the single <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> in the gel.

The concept {{is similar to that of}} steric stabilization of colloids. <b>Polymer</b> <b>chains</b> are grafting to a surface via covalent bonding or adsorption.

25|$|In the low {{pressure}} process α-olefins (e.g. 1-butene or 1-hexene) may be added, which are {{incorporated in the}} <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> during polymerization. These copolymers introduce short side chains, thus crystallinity and density are reduced. As explained above, mechanical and thermal properties are changed thereby. In particular, PE-LLD is produced this way.|$|E
25|$|The {{convention}} for a {{nucleic acid}} sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5' end to the 3' end of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain,</b> where 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of carbons around the ribose ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.|$|E
25|$|The tensile {{strength}} of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the material will endure before failure. This {{is very important in}} applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For example, a rubber band with a higher {{tensile strength}} will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, tensile strength increases with <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> length and crosslinking of polymer chains.|$|E

25|$|Polymer {{degradation}} is {{a change}} in the properties—tensile strength, color, shape, or molecular weight—of a polymer or polymer-based product under the influence of one or more environmental factors, such as heat, light, chemicals and, in some cases, galvanic action. It is often due to the scission of <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> bonds via hydrolysis, leading to a decrease in the molecular mass of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|The space {{occupied}} by a polymer molecule is generally {{expressed in terms of}} radius of gyration, which is an average distance from the center of mass of the chain to the chain itself. Alternatively, it may be expressed in terms of pervaded volume, which is the volume of solution spanned by the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> and scales with the cube of the radius of gyration.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worthy}} {{to note that}} due to the {{multiple}} reactive sites of the multivinyl monomers, plenty of unreacted pendent vinyl groups are introduced to linear primary polymer chains. These pendent vinyl groups {{have the potential to}} react with propagating active centres either from their own <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> or others. Therefore, both of the intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular crosslinking might occur in this process.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe propose here to {{investigate}} the interaction between cis- 1, 4 polybutadiene <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> and a silica surface. We opt for mesoscopic simulations in order to simulate the <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> onto significant length and time scales. We develop realistic coarse-grained (CG) models {{for this kind of}} interaction by using a bottom-up approach consisting of developing these effective CG models from atomistic simulations. We investigate then the structural and dynamical properties of <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> adsorbing onto a silica surface at different separation distances. We complete this work by studying the adsorption of free <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> onto the grafted silica surface {{as a function of the}} grafting density.

40|$|Organic/inorganic nanohybrid {{materials}} have attracted particular {{scientific and technological}} interest because they combine {{the properties of the}} organic and the inorganic component. Inorganic nanoparticles exhibit interesting electrical, optical, magnetic and/or catalytic properties, which are related with their nano-scale dimensions. However, their high surface-to-volume ratio often induces agglomeration and leads to the loss of their attractive properties. Surface modification of the inorganic nano-objects with physically or chemically end-tethered <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> has been employed to overcome this problem. Covalent tethered <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> are realized by three different approaches: the “grafting to”, the “grafting from” and the “grafting through” method. This article reviews the synthesis of end-grafted <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> onto inorganic nanoparticles using “controlled/living” polymerization techniques, which allow control over the polymer characteristics and the grafting density of the end-tethered <b>polymer</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
25|$|Also, {{the growth}} (and composition) of {{copolymers}} may be modeled using Markov chains. Based on the reactivity ratios of the monomers {{that make up}} the growing <b>polymer</b> <b>chain,</b> the chain's composition may be calculated (e.g., whether monomers tend to add in alternating fashion or in long runs of the same monomer). Due to steric effects, second-order Markov effects may also {{play a role in the}} growth of some polymer chains.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and {{can be as simple as}} a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
25|$|TEMED (N, N, N, N-tetramethylethylenediamine) (C6H16N2; mW: 116.21) stabilizes free {{radicals}} and improves polymerization. The rate of polymerisation and {{the properties of}} the resulting gel depend on the concentrations of {{free radicals}}. Increasing the amount of free radicals results in a decrease in the average <b>polymer</b> <b>chain</b> length, an increase in gel turbidity and a decrease in gel elasticity. Decreasing the amount shows the reverse effect. The lowest catalytic concentrations that allow polymerisation in a reasonable period of time should be used. APS and TEMED are typically used at approximately equimolar concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 mM.|$|E

50|$|Cationic {{ring-opening}} polymerization {{follows the}} same mechanistic steps of initiation, propagation, and termination. However, in this polymerization reaction, the monomer units are cyclic {{in comparison to}} the resulting <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> which are linear. The linear polymers produced can have low ceiling temperatures, hence end-capping of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> is often necessary to prevent depolymerization.|$|R
25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain,</b> leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E
25|$|A Ziegler-Natta {{catalyst}} is able {{to restrict}} linking of monomer molecules to a specific regular orientation, either isotactic, when all methyl groups are positioned at the same side {{with respect to the}} backbone of the <b>polymer</b> <b>chain,</b> or syndiotactic, when the positions of the methyl groups alternate. Commercially available isotactic polypropylene is made with two types of Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The first group of the catalysts encompasses solid (mostly supported) catalysts and certain types of soluble metallocene catalysts. Such isotactic macromolecules coil into a helical shape; these helices then line up next to one another to form the crystals that give commercial isotactic polypropylene many of its desirable properties.|$|E
25|$|Polymerization of alkenes is a {{reaction}} that yields polymers of high industrial value at great economy, {{such as the}} plastics polyethylene and polypropylene. Polymers from alkene monomers are referred to {{in a general way}} as polyolefins or in rare instances as polyalkenes. A polymer from alpha-olefins is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-radical or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a single bond and forming single bonds to join the other monomers. Polymerization of conjugated dienes such as buta-1,3-diene or isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing <b>polymer</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E

30|$|Among {{cellulose}} fibres, cotton {{is still}} the most popular fibre because of its several advantages. Since cotton readily absorbs moisture, it is susceptible towards shrinkage. The moisture is absorbed in the amorphous region of cotton, water molecules then act as lubricant and helps in movement of internal <b>polymer</b> <b>chains.</b> The movement of internal <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> are facilitated by disrupting the hydrogen bonding among <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> in amorphous region. In order to relieve stress in a stressed cellulose fibre, the internal <b>polymer</b> <b>chains</b> of the amorphous areas move freely. The new hydrogen bonds are then formed in the swollen state of cellulose in new configuration in the amorphous region and are locked after drying. Therefore the wrinkled appearance of the cellulose fabric persists even after drying, in contrast to non swelling synthetic fibres (Lam et al. 2011) and also the fabric shrinks (Schindler and Hauser 2004).|$|R
