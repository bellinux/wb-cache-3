50|$|The Mix Controller was a {{collection}} of a Master and one or more I/O modules held in a custom frame. The modules could be arranged in any order in the frame. Each I/O module serviced four channels of audio.

5000|$|When the transbrake {{is engaged}} at the drag race track {{starting}} line (driver holding the pushbutton depressed), {{the car is}} held stationary regardless of how much engine power {{is applied to the}} drive line. The driver typically applies full throttle at this time, and the car remains stationary at the starting line under full engine power. When the driver sees the desired visual cue before him, the driver promptly releases his finger (or thumb) from the pushbutton. This button release opens the contacts within the <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switch</b> signaling the delay box and the delay box now begins an internal countdown. When the countdown timer reaches zero, the delay box stops current flowing to the solenoid in the transmission and that causes the spool valve to return to its normal position. With the spool valve in its normal position hydraulic fluid pressure in the transmission is removed from the reverse clutch pack (but maintained in the forward clutch pack), this causes the drag race car to [...] "launch" [...] (often with great thrust) from the starting line, accelerating rapidly forward toward the finish line.|$|E
5000|$|In most wired systems, {{a button}} on the outside next to the door, located around the height of the doorknob, {{activates}} a signaling device (usually a chime, bell, or buzzer) inside the building. Pressing the doorbell button, a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switch</b> momentarily closes the doorbell circuit. One terminal of this button is wired to a terminal on a transformer. A doorbell transformer steps down the 120 or 240-volt AC electrical power to a lower voltage, typically 10 to 20 volts. The transformer's other terminal connects to one of three terminals on the signaling device. Another terminal is connected to a wire that travels to the other terminal on the button. Some signaling devices have a third terminal, which produces a different sound. If there is another doorbell button (typically near a back door), it is connected between the transformer and the third terminal. The transformer primary winding, being energized continuously, does consume a small amount (about 1 to 2 W) of standby power constantly; systems with lighted pushbutton switches may consume a similar amount of power per switch. [...] The tradeoff is that the wiring to the button carries only safe, low voltage isolated from earth ground.|$|E

40|$|Apparatus for {{multiplexing}} switch state signals comprises {{a plurality}} of switches and parallel weighted resistors connected in series between circuit ground and a node at a utilization device. The resistors are weighted {{as a function of}} a power of the same base, such as the power of the base 2, for coding the multiplexed switch state signals. A constant current source connected between the node and circuit ground drives current over a single cable conductor through the resistor. Each switch may be independently closed to change the switch state voltage signals multiplexed to the node. An analog-to-digital converter connected between the node and circuit ground demultiplexes the switch state signals received at the node and provides a switch state signal at each analog-to-digital output corresponding to the state of the switches at the moment. A potentiometer may replace a resistor and bypass switch combination in a position where the potentiometer has a maximum value of the lowest power of the base in order to multiplex a true analog voltage signal while switch state signals are unambiguously coded and multiplexed. The potentiometer in the least significant position permits the analog value to be in the range from 0 to a maximum corresponding to the least significant position of the switch state encoding.

40|$|A {{portable}} pressure-application device {{has been}} designed and built for use in testing and calibrating piezoelectric pressure transducers in the field. The device generates pressure pulses of known amplitude. A pressure pulse (in contradistinction to a steady pressure) is needed because {{in the presence of}} a steady pressure, the electrical output of a piezoelectric pressure transducer decays rapidly with time. The device includes a stainless- steel compressed-air-storage cylinder of 500 cu cm volume. A manual hand pump with check valves and a pressure gauge are located at one end of the cylinder. A three-way solenoid valve that controls the release of pressurized air is located at the other end of the cylinder. Power for the device is provided by a 3. 7 -V cordless-telephone battery. The valve is controlled by means of a <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switch,</b> which activates a 5 V to +/- 15 V DC-to-DC converter that powers the solenoid. The outlet of the solenoid valve is connected to the pressure transducer to be tested. Before the solenoid is energized, the transducer to be tested is at atmospheric pressure. When the solenoid is actuated by the push button, pressurized air from inside the cylinder is applied to the transducer. Once the pushbutton is released, the cylinder pressure is removed from the transducer and the pressurized air applied to the transducer is vented, bringing the transducer back to atmospheric pressure. Before this device was used for actual calibration, its accuracy was checked with a NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable calibrator and commercially calibrated pressure transducers.

40|$|Abstract: This note {{discusses}} {{the effects on}} switches when used to connect loads. High currents through a switch degrade its quality when used as a power switch. Both mechanical switches and relays exhibit switch bounce during operation. The MAX 6816 /MAX 6817 /MAX 6818 provide switch debouncing and ± 15 kV ESD protection. Designing the external interface to an industrial or automotive application can be challenging for an uninitiated systems engineer. The bouncing of switch and relay contacts can produce arcs that threaten system reliability. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can also threaten reliability and uptime. The purpose of this discussion is to ease the task of designing an interface between the inputs of a microcontroller and a hostile industrial or automotive environment. Switch Bounce The ideal switch operation depicted in most textbooks—a single transition that occurs instantly on actuation, followed by zero on-resistance—has never existed! Real switches exhibit a finite resistance called "contact resistance, " that increases over time {{with the number of}} switch actuations. Contact resistance for a new switch ranges from less than 50 mΩ to 100 mΩ, depending on the contact material, power loading, environmental conditions, and switch usage. As a switch changes state, its contacts travel through several open-close cycles called "contact bounce " before coming to rest in the final state. In some cases, this rapid contact bounce produces a changing resistance as the moving contact wipes across the stationary contact. In Figure 1, a <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switch</b> supplies 24 V (a typical industrial-control voltage) to the resistor. Notice that at least four major switching transitions occur before the output comes to rest at 24 V. To a digital control system, these transitions could be interpreted as four separate contact closures. Figure 1. Switch contact bounce and test circuit. Contact bounce is not acceptable, because automotive- and industrial-control systems require accurate, realtime data in the form of definite state changes. (For more information on switch bounce and related issues, se...|$|E

Cobalt is also capable of six different levels of photorealistic rendering, from [...] "Raytrace Preview Render Off" [...] through [...] "Auto Full Render On, Antialias". Choosing less realistic modes for trial animations allows very quick rendering—even those with several hundred frames—because Cobalt fully exploits multi-core microprocessors during rendering. The click-to-play animation (upper right) shows two industrial <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switches</b> surrounded by a virtual [...] "photo studio" [...] in a Cobalt model.

To create fly-by animations, Cobalt prompts the designer to specify a path (a line or curve) for the [...] "camera eye" [...] to follow as well as a point at which the camera should point, and then renders the animation. A designer can specify such attributes as the angle for the camera's field of view and can turn on settings such as perspective, which gives rendered images a vanishing point.

40|$|Abstract: For {{applications}} that require {{less than a}} keyboard or numeric keypad, this simple circuit monitors multiple <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switches</b> using a single multi-channel 1 -wire addressable switch (DS 2408), and a few external components. A similar {{version of this article}} appeared in the September 9, 2010 issue of EDN magazine. Keyboards and numeric keypads often provide the user interface for electronic equipment, but many applications require {{only a small number of}} pushbuttons. For those, you can monitor multiple pushbuttons over a single pair of wires (Figure 1). Figure 1. Connected to a microcontroller, this circuit can monitor 8 pushbuttons using only two wires. The multichannel, 1 -Wire ® addressable switch (U 1, DS 2408) provides input/output ports P 0 –P 7, which in this application serve as inputs. The high-valued resistors (R PD) connect these ports to ground to ensure a defined logic state (0), and D 1 –C 1 forms a local power supply that steals energy from the 1 -Wire communication line. When you press a pushbutton, it connects the corresponding port to the local supply voltage, which is equivalent to logic 1. This change of state sets the port's activity latch (see data sheet). Conditional Search Polling As a 1 -Wire slave device, U 1 does not initiate communications. Instead, the master (typically a microcontroller) polls the 1 -Wire line. To minimize overhead, U 1 supports a 1 -Wire network function called "conditional search. " Before using that function, however, you must configure U 1 according to the needs of the application. That includes defining the qualifying input ports (channel selection), specifying the polarity of the qualifying ports (channel polarity selection), choosing between pin or activity latch for the port, an...|$|R

The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. This report documents the independent analysis results corresponding to the Orbiter Electrical Power Distribution and Control (EPD and C) hardware. The EPD and C hardware performs the functions of distributing, sensing, and controlling 28 volt DC power and of inverting, distributing, sensing, and controlling 117 volt 400 Hz AC power to all Orbiter subsystems from the three fuel cells in the Electrical Power Generation (EPG) subsystem. Each level of hardware was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticality was assigned based upon {{the severity of the}} effect for each failure mode.

The FTS, which is a project led by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, will be a telerobot used for Space Station construction, maintenance, and satellite repair. It will be directly controlled from workstations on the Orbiter and the Space Station and monitored from a ground workstation. The FTS will eventually evolve into a more autonomous system, but in the short-term the system will be manually operated (teleoperated) for many tasks. This emphasizes the importance of the human/telerobot interface on this system. This phase of the FTS workstation evaluation covers a preliminary study of programmable display pushbuttons (PDP's). The PDP is constructed of a matrix of directly addressable electroluminescent (EL) pixels which can be used to form dot-matrix characters. PDP's can be used to display more than one message and to control more than one function. Since the PDP's have these features, then a single PDP may possibly replace the use of many single-function <b>pushbuttons,</b> rotary <b>switches,</b> and toggle switches, thus using less panel space.

While the hardware front panel emulated those used by early mainframe and minicomputers, after a very short time interaction through a terminal was the preferred human/machine interface, and front panels became extinct.|$|R
