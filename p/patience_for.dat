5|$|Having {{grown up}} in a hospital, Meredith shows immense natural talent. She {{possesses}} a steadfast, calm ease during medical procedures and emergencies, and is a natural observer of people. She exhibits a knack for catching subtle hints and accurately determining difficult-to-catch diagnoses. Her placid, non-judgmental bedside manner often causes people to open up and trust her. Her surgical skills are solidly impressive and she shows a talent and <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> medical research trials and dealing with psychologically damaged patients.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E

In addition to starring in the series, Hutton directed four episodes and served as an executive producer.|$|E

25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} family in the summer of 1883, when a {{debilitating}} fever swept through the family. Johnny's half-sister Annie, 13, was the first to succumb; and his mother died shortly thereafter. By the time September 1883 had passed, three more McGraw children had died. The devastated family moved from their house in the country into a hotel in town. Johnny's father, understandably bitter, heaped even more responsibility on the young boy's shoulders, and had very little <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> his son's passion for baseball. He became abusive toward the boy; and later on in 1885 (still only 12 years old), Johnny ran away. From that day onward, young John was raised by a kindly neighbor, Mary Goddard, under whose care he did quite well.|$|E
25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E

25|$|Journalists {{were able}} to play The Last Guardian at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 and the 2016 Tokyo Game Show {{in the months before}} the game's release, and several {{expressed}} further concerns {{about the nature of the}} game's lengthy development period. Patrick Garrett, writing for VG247, found that the visuals felt flat and aged considering modern hardware capabilities, and expressed concern that while older gamers would readily purchase the title, The Last Guardian may not draw in enough newer gamers to be a commercial success. Philip Kollar for Polygon, though still impressed with the characters, graphics, and core gameplay, found controlling the character difficult and managing the game's camera tricky, elements that made the game feel like a PlayStation 2 title rather than something on modern hardware. Wireds Chris Kohler found much of the demo to require patient observation of Trico's movements and puzzle solving, which, he commented, some players would appreciate but were elements that have slowly been phased out of action games over the last console generation, and other players may not have the <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> these. Brian Ashcroft of Kotaku also noted that the demo's pace was often set by how fast Trico would respond or react, which may test the patience of players looking for a more action-based experience.|$|E
25|$|Salam {{very early}} {{established}} a reputation throughout the Punjab and {{later at the}} University of Cambridge for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation (entrance) examination at the Punjab University. He won a full scholarship to the Government College University of Lahore, Punjab State. Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in Urdu and English literature in which he excelled. But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration. Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on Srinivasa Ramanujan's problems in mathematics, and took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1944. His father wanted him to join Indian Civil Service. In those days, the Indian Civil Service was the highest aspiration for young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in the civil society. Respecting his father's wish, Salam tried for the Indian Railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests because he had worn spectacles since an early age. The results further concluded that Salam failed a mechanical test required by the railway engineers to gain a commission in Indian Railways, and moreover that Salam {{was too young to}} compete for the job. Therefore, Indian Railways rejected Abdus Salam's job application. While in Lahore, Abdus Salam went on to attend the graduate school of Government College University. He received his MA in Mathematics from the Government College University in 1946. That same year, he was awarded a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he completed a BA degree with Double First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Physics in 1949. In 1950, he received the Smith's Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to Physics. After finishing his degrees, Fred Hoyle advised Salam to spend another year in the Cavendish Laboratory to do research in experimental physics, but Salam had no <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> carrying out long experiments in the laboratory. Salam returned to Jhang, Punjab (now part of Pakistan) and renewed his scholarship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doctorate.|$|E

500|$|When not touring {{missions}} or {{presiding over}} weekend stake conferences, Kimball spent weekdays answering correspondence {{at his home}} or working {{in his office at}} LDS Church headquarters in Salt Lake City. Kimball was noted among the apostles for his willingness to meet with church members struggling with serious personal problems, particularly married couples considering divorce or individuals wishing to confess serious violations of the LDS Church's law of chastity, which prohibits sexual relations outside of marriage. During his time as an apostle, Kimball met with thousands of church members and full-time missionaries who, for various reasons, felt their own local church leaders could not help them. Kimball [...] "had no <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> sin [...] almost infinite <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> sinners" [...] and often spent long hours with individuals in greatest distress. In 1959, Kimball and fellow apostle Mark E. Petersen were assigned to counsel church members dealing with homosexuality, which Kimball believed could, [...] "like all other problems," [...] be overcome through [...] "consistent prayerful exercise of self-restraint." [...] Kimball's experiences impelled his writing of The Miracle of Forgiveness, first published in 1969, which dealt frankly with the serious nature of church standards on sexual morality and counseled church members on avoidance of such problems and repentance.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Writing for The Cincinnati Enquirer, John Kiesewetter criticized the show's use of improvised dialogue: [...] "The uneven plot and sophomoric bodily function jokes sound like {{these people were}} making it up as they went along. And they were." [...] Rob Owen, television critic for the Post-Gazette, paralleled Kiesewetter {{and said that the}} episode was a [...] "pitfall" [...] of the improvisation process: [...] "The half-hour seems like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive episode." [...] Owen called it [...] "so lackadaisical, it's hard to imagine UPN's most recently announced target audience - young males - having any <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> the program.

500|$|Larkin's {{public persona}} {{was that of}} the no-nonsense, solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> the trappings of the public {{literary}} life. The posthumous publication by Anthony Thwaite in 1992 of his letters triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by John Banville as hair-raising, but also in places hilarious. Lisa Jardine called him a [...] "casual, habitual racist, and an easy misogynist", but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that [...] "the worst that anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than what passes for mainstream entertainment". Despite the controversy Larkin was chosen in a 2003 Poetry Book Society survey, almost two decades after his death, as Britain's best-loved poet of the previous 50 years, and in 2008 The Times named him Britain's greatest post-war writer.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Elements {{of the opening}} scene were lauded. Matt Roush of TV Guide praised Spacey's self introduction as a Machiavellian politician in which he says [...] "I have no <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> useless things." [...] Boston Globe Matthew Gilbert noted that [...] "the first two episodes were expertly directed by David Fincher" [...] and Spacey's harmonious cadence such as those used in the first scene of this episode [...] "makes even his character’s mercy killing of an injured dog [...] which he does by hand [...] seem a little less brutal." [...] Not only is Underwood described as Machiavellian, one critic from The New York Times notes that {{his belief in the}} omnipresence of dirt expressed as [...] "Nobody’s a Boy Scout, not even a Boy Scout" [...] harkens back to Willie Stark in All the King's Men who said [...] "There's always something".|$|E

500|$|The game's four campaigns {{received}} {{criticism from}} reviewers. Simon Parkin from Eurogamer was divided over the campaigns, citing Leon's campaign as {{the strongest and}} [...] "the closest {{we get to the}} series' survival horror roots", along with Ada's as having [...] "diverse flavour". However, Parkin criticised the other two campaigns, stating that Jake's campaign [...] "rarely delights" [...] while citing that Chris' was a [...] "second-rate third-person sprint" [...] with [...] "idiotic" [...] cutscene dialogue. A reviewer from Edge also felt that the campaigns noticeably contrasted in quality more than others. Similarly, Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot concluded that the game's campaigns were the ultimate test of <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> [...] "even the most dedicated", while Destructoid cited Resident Evil 6 as not only a [...] "step back" [...] for the series due to the game's new and unconventional features, but a [...] "step back for commonplace, unassuming action-shooters".|$|E

500|$|Virtually {{nothing is}} known about Sviatoslav's {{childhood}} and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. Sviatoslav's father, Igor, was killed by the Drevlians around 945, and his mother, Olga, ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963). Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had little <b>patience</b> <b>for</b> administration. His life was spent with his druzhina (roughly, [...] "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor {{did he have a}} tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head, and all his retinue did likewise.|$|E
