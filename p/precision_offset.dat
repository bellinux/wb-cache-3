Pulse signals up to +/- 80 V peak can be measured. The device works together with an oscilloscope. The primary function of the measurement device is to provide a <b>precision</b> <b>offset,</b> such that variations in the flattop of the modulator voltage pulse can be accurately resolved. The oscilloscope records the difference between the pulse flattop and the reference for a series of waveforms. The scope math functions are utilized to calculate the rms variations over the series.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an industrial robot joint offset calibration method called the virtual line-based single-point constraint approach. Previous {{methods such as}} using CMM, laser trackers or cameras are limited by the cost or the resolution. The proposed method relies mainly upon a laser pointer attached on the end-effector and single position-sensitive detector (PSD) arbitrarily located on the workcell. The automated calibration procedure (about three minutes) involves aiming the laser lines loaded by the robot towards {{the center of the}} PSD surface from various robot positions and orientations. The intersections of each pair of laser lines eventually should converge to the same point after compensating the joint offsets. An optimization model and algorithm have been formulated to identify the robot offset. For the highly precise feedback, a segmented PSD with a position resolution of better than 0. 1 μm is employed. The mean accuracy of robot localization is up to 0. 02 mm, and the mean error of the parameter identification is less than 0. 08 degrees. Both simulations and experiments implemented on an ABB industrial robot verify the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed calibration system.

Automotive, set-top box, camera/camcorder, PC, and laptop computer applications are demanding IC vendors to supply an array of linear devices that operate on a single-supply rail, with the same performance of dual supply parts. Power consumption is now a key parameter for line or battery operated systems, and in some instances, more important than cost. This makes low-voltage/low supply current operation critical; at the same time, however, accuracy and precision requirements have forced IC manufacturers {{to meet the challenge}} of "doing more with less " in their amplifier designs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rapid pseudo-code {{is widely}} used in spread {{spectrum}} communication system, {{because it has a}} large data rate and a strong anti-jamming property. But it brings us large of difficulty to acquire it as its long period. A new method is proposed to solve this problem in this paper, which is based on the excellent correlation characteristics of the long pseudocode. The new method divides the local pn sequence into four subsequences, and then each of the sequence is overlapped and accumulated to form four new sequences. Through simple operation of addition, the four new sequences produce two combined sequences as the new reference sequences. At the same time, the received spread spectrum signal's sample rate is reduced to a quarter of the chip rate. Use the results to do correlation with the two new reference sequences to capture the synchronous pseudo-code.

However, the CERES scanning thermistor bolometer sensor zero-radiance offsets were found to vary as much as 1. 0 Wm (exp - 2) sr (exp - 1) with the scan angle measurement geometry due to gravitational forces and systematic electronic noise. To minimize the gravitational effects, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Spacecraft CERES sensors' offsets were derived on-orbit as functions of scan elevation and azimuth angles from the January 7 - 8, 1998 radiometric observations of deep cold space, representative of a 3 K blackbody. In this paper, the TRMM/CERES six orbit data base of on-orbit derived offsets is presented and analyzed to define the sampling requirements for the CERES sensors located on the Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) Terra Spacecraft and on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Afternoon (PM- 1) Spacecraft, scheduled for launches in 1999 and 2000, respectively.

40|$|Conservation buffers, such as filter {{strips and}} {{riparian}} forest buffers, are widely prescribed {{to improve and}} protect water quality in agricultural landscapes. These buffers intercept field runoff and retain some of its pollutant load before it reaches a waterway. A buffer typically is designed to have uniform width along a field margin and to intercept runoff that flows uniformly to it. However, spatial analysis of field conditions and runoff patterns indicate that more runoff is likely to flow to some locations along a field margin than to others which can substantially limit a buffer 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness.

40|$|The {{retrieval}} (estimation) of {{sea surface}} temperatures (SSTs) from space-based infrared observations is increasingly performed using retrieval coefficients derived from radiative transfer simulations of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures (BTs). Typically, {{an estimate of}} SST is formed from a weighted combination of BTs at a few wavelengths, plus an offset. This paper addresses two questions about the radiative transfer modeling approach to deriving these weighting and offset coefficients. How precisely specified do the coefficients {{need to be in}} order to obtain the required SST accuracy (e. g., scatter < 0. 3 K in week-average SST, bias < 0. 1 K) ? And how precisely is it actually possible to specify them using current forward models? The conclusions are that weighting coefficients can be obtained with adequate <b>precision,</b> while the <b>offset</b> coefficient will often require an empirical adjustment of the order of a few tenths of a kelvin against validation data. Thus, a rational approach to defining retrieval coefficients is one of radiative transfer modeling followed by offset adjustment.

A strategy is described for obtaining the required offset adjustment, and the paper highlights some of the subtler aspects involved with reference to the example of SST retrievals from the imager on the geostationary satellite GOES- 8...|$|R
40|$|Interferometric {{spacecraft}} tracking {{is accomplished}} at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) {{by comparing the}} arrival time of electromagnetic spacecraft signals to ground antennas separated by baselines {{on the order of}} 8000 km. Clock synchronization errors within and between DSN stations directly impact the attainable tracking accuracy, with a 0. 3 ns error in clock synchronization resulting in an 11 nrad angular position error. This level of synchronization is currently achieved by observing a quasar which is angularly close to the spacecraft just after the spacecraft observations. By determining the differential arrival times of the random quasar signal at the stations, clock synchronization and propagation delays within the atmosphere and within the DSN stations are calibrated. Recent developments in time transfer techniques may allow medium accuracy (50 - 100 nrad) spacecraft observations without near-simultaneous quasar-based calibrations. Solutions are presented for a global network of GPS receivers in which the formal errors in clock offset parameters are less than 0. 5 ns. Comparisons of clock rate offsets derived from GPS measurements and from very long baseline interferometry and the examination of clock closure suggest that these formal errors are a realistic measure of GPS-based clock <b>offset</b> <b>precision</b> and accuracy.

30|$|Through {{comparison}} with ground station, we can realize {{the measurement of}} clock offset, and in current aerospace application, the time reference is established on the ground. But such measurement has several shortcomings: short measurement time, low measurement precision, and others limitations resulting from short visual time between the ground station and satellite. Moreover, once the ground station is damaged, that measurement of clock offset cannot be conducted. After establishing inter-satellite link for the measurement of clock offset directly in the inter-satellite, we can obtain high-precision system time reference, get high-precision inter-satellite clock offset, and use the suitable algorithm processing. The satellite-ground two-way time synchronization {{is one of the}} methods to measure the high-precision clock offset between the satellite and ground station [10 – 12]. It can improve the measurement <b>precision</b> of clock <b>offset</b> because it can offset the influence of additional delay at atmospheric layer, as well as the time delay between the satellite and ground station. However, the satellite and ground are required to stay in a relative rest state when we use this method; otherwise, the inconsistent two-way time delay caused by the satellite motion will affect the accuracy. This paper used satellite-ground two-way time synchronization method for autonomous measurement of inter-satellite clock offset, and analyzed the specific influence of satellite motion on the measurement. Taking the satellite motion into consideration, this paper deduced the correction method of inter-satellite two-way clock offset measurement, and the correctness of the method was verified via satellite tool kit (STK) simulation.|$|R

For many years, the FAA has permitted simultaneous independent instrument approach operations only for those parallel runways with a minimum separation of 4300 feet. Nowadays, new criteria {{have been developed to}} increase the utilization on those runways, where the most recent procedures, called PRM/SOIA (<b>Precision</b> Runway Monitor/Simultaneous <b>Offset</b> Instrument Approach), make simultaneous approaches possible in systems of runways spaced as close as 750 feet.

This research analyzes these simultaneous approaches procedures in closely-spaced runways, addressing the potential benefits of the implementation of PRM/SOIA at São Paulo/Guarulhos Aeroporto Internacional Governador André Franco Montoro (GRU) with a computer simulation tool, and also the influence of this implementation at other airports inside the same terminal airspace.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to independently investigate and determine confirmatory calibration procedures for GNSS antennas. This paper focuses on the aspect of simplified techniques for confirming high <b>precision</b> GNSS antenna <b>offsets.</b> In the other words, the aim is to verify GNSS antenna offset parameters - results, which will be used to find the consequences on ground positions of orbital distortions caused by solar activity. It is well known that the computation of GNSS observations using high precision GNSS antennas requires knowledge of the relevant antenna phase centre offsets. These offsets are the distance in three dimensions from the antenna's physical centre to the point in space at which the antenna "measures" position. The calibration processes used by manufacturers appear to vary, and, where receivers of different models are to be used together, it is essential that the calibration parameters used are all produced using the same methods and by the same authoritative sources. Meanwhile, with the growth in the use of high precision GNSS systems, the likelihood of antennas being accidentally mishandled is possibly higher than previously. Finally, it is noted that it has long been the practise for surveyors to check their instruments to ensure that they are properly calibrated. In the modern electronic age, however, it seems that this practise has been allowed to lapse as far as GNSS instrumentation is concerned. With the above in mind, it has been decided to attempt to create a simplified procedure for calibrating high precision GNSS antennas. The aim is that it will be possible for the average surveyor to check his antenna without great effort or trouble. The objective can also be described as finding a simplified field procedure to determine whether a specific antenna's offset parameters are within reasonable agreement with published figures...|$|R
