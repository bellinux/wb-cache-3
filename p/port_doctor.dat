6000|$|... "'Tis the rulin' of the <b>port</b> <b>doctor.</b> No {{intercourse}} with the shore till {{the ship is}} passed.

60|$|As we sailed up the San Francisco water-front, {{the moment}} the <b>port</b> <b>doctors</b> passed us, the boarding-house runners were {{alongside}} in whitehall boats. They swarmed on board, each drumming for his own boarding-house, and each {{with a bottle of}} free whisky inside his shirt. But we waved them grandly and blasphemously away. We wanted none of their boarding-houses and none of their whisky. We were sober, thrifty sailormen, with better use for our money.|$|R
60|$|We {{went to the}} joiner's {{and ordered}} the coffin, and the doctor had a glass of whisky on it; the {{graveyard}} fees were paid, and the doctor sealed the engagement with a drop of brandy; the vicar's <b>port</b> completed the <b>doctor's</b> joviality, and we went home.|$|R
60|$|I {{was about}} to observe that even in England you will eat the most {{carefully}} ordered meal with an indifference which is an outrage to decency. Indeed, you pay less attention to it than here, because at all events you do notice that the meat is mouldy. But if any one gives you a good dinner, you notice nothing. I've given him priceless <b>port,</b> <b>Doctor,</b> and he drank it {{as though it were}} cooking sherry.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, for {{the engines}} clanked noisily as the screw turned astern; then the anchor splashed and the launch swung {{in to the}} gangway. The <b>port</b> <b>doctor</b> came on board and after him a man in tight-fitting American clothes. His wide black belt was spun from the finest silk and Marston noted his hat. Indians had woven the {{delicate}} material under running water; presidents and dictators wore hats like that, {{and none of the}} few produced were sent to Europe. It was obvious that Señor Larrinaga was now a man of importance.|$|E
60|$|Mossamedes steamed into Las Palmas harbour one evening, {{and as soon}} as she was moored Kit landed Don Erminio {{and filed}} the {{necessary}} documents at the Commandancia offices. He, however, said nothing about the struggle on the beach, and accounted for the captain's injuries by stating that he was washed under the boat. The sailors' hurts were not serious, and Kit had not allowed the <b>port</b> <b>doctor</b> to see the men. His visit was an embarrassment, but on the whole Kit and Macallister thought they had not excited his curiosity.|$|E
40|$|Based on records {{kept in the}} Singapore Mercantile Marine Office, {{the paper}} {{presents}} the results of a study on deaths due to disease of seafarers on board Singapore ships. Out of a total of 373 deaths, altogether 69 fatalities were attributed to diseases. More than 65 % (n= 45) of theses deaths were due to circulatory diseases commonly associated with life-style factors, but only 24 cases had a specific and 9 cases had an unspecific diagnosis confirmed by a medical, practitioner. A total of 32 seafarers (46. 4 %) died of a sudden death and were found dead by their shipmates whereas 17 seafarers (24. 6 %) died on board after a short illness. In only two cases was it reported that Radio Medical advice had been sought indicating either a lack of interest of the ship's management or a lack of knowledge or information on the availability of such services. Eight of the fatalities who died on board had seen a doctor and been declared fit to stay on board, pointing to deficiencies in the port medical services or pressures on <b>port</b> <b>doctors</b> to avoid a costly repatriation. The mean annual mortality rate for deaths due to all causes was 26. 5 per 10, 000 seafarers and due to disease was 4. 9 per 10, 000 seafarers. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

60|$|Twenty-seven {{days out}} from San Francisco {{we arrived at}} the island of Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. In the early morning we drifted around Diamond Head into full view of Honolulu; and then the ocean burst {{suddenly}} into life. Flying fish cleaved the air in glittering squadrons. In five minutes we saw more of them than during the whole voyage. Other fish, large ones, of various sorts, leaped into the air. There was life everywhere, on sea and shore. We could see the masts and funnels of the shipping in the harbour, the hotels and bathers along the beach at Waikiki, the smoke rising from the dwelling-houses high up on the volcanic slopes of the Punch Bowl and Tantalus. The custom-house tug was racing toward us and a big school of porpoises got under our bow and began cutting the most ridiculous capers. The <b>port</b> <b>doctor's</b> launch came charging out at us, and a big sea turtle broke the surface with his back and took a look at us. Never was there such a burgeoning of life. Strange faces were on our decks, strange voices were speaking, and copies of that very morning's newspaper, with cable reports from all the world, were thrust before our eyes. Incidentally, we read that the Snark and all hands had been lost at sea, and that she had been a very unseaworthy craft anyway. And while we read this information a wireless message was being received by the congressional party on the summit of Haleakala announcing the safe arrival of the Snark.|$|R
6000|$|The years passed, and, one sunny morning, the Snark {{poked her}} nose {{into a narrow}} opening in a reef that smoked with the {{crashing}} impact of the trade-wind swell, and beat slowly up Papeete harbour. Coming off to us was a boat, flying a yellow flag. We knew it contained the <b>port</b> <b>doctor.</b> But quite a distance off, in its wake, was a tiny out rigger canoe that puzzled us. It was flying a red flag. I studied it through the glasses, fearing that it marked some hidden danger to navigation, some recent wreck or some buoy or beacon that had been swept away. Then the doctor came on board. After he had examined {{the state of our}} health and been assured that we had no live rats hidden away in the Snark, I asked him the meaning of the red flag. [...] "Oh, that is Darling," [...] was the answer.|$|E
60|$|From {{the bridge}} of the Tryapsic, the high place he had gained in the {{competition}} of men, he stared at Dublin harbour opening out, at the town obscured by the dark sky of the dreary wind-driven day, and at the tangled tracery of spars and rigging of the harbour shipping. Back from twice around the world he was, and from interminable junketings up and down on far stretches, home-coming to the wife he had not seen in eight-and-twenty months, and to the child he had never seen and that was already walking and talking. He saw the watch below of stokers and trimmers bobbing out of the forecastle doors like rabbits from a warren and making their way aft over the rusty deck to the mustering of the <b>port</b> <b>doctor.</b> They were Chinese, with expressionless, Sphinx-like faces, and they walked in peculiar shambling fashion, dragging their feet as if the clumsy brogans were too heavy for their lean shanks.|$|E
6000|$|... "And in the {{meantime}} there was Armande at Papeete. Nobody called on her. She did, French fashion, make the initial calls on the Governor and the <b>port</b> <b>doctor.</b> They saw her, but neither of their hen-wives was at home to her nor returned the call. She was out of caste, without caste, though she had never dreamed it, {{and that was the}} gentle way they broke the information to her. There was a gay young lieutenant on the French cruiser. He lost his heart to her, but not his head. You can imagine the shock to this young woman, refined, beautiful, raised like an aristocrat, pampered with the best of old France that money could buy. And you can guess the end." [...] He shrugged his shoulders. [...] "There was a Japanese servant in the bungalow. He saw it. Said she did it with the proper spirit of the Samurai. Took a stiletto--no thrust, no drive, no wild rush for annihilation--took the stiletto, placed the point carefully against her heart, and with both hands, slowly and steadily, pressed home.|$|E

We hove {{over three}} {{hundred of them}} {{overboard}}, sir, along with both bosuns, most of the Lascar crew, and the captain, the mate, the third mate, and {{the first and third}} engineers. The second and one white oiler was all that was left below, and I was in command on deck, when we made <b>port.</b> The <b>doctors</b> wouldn't come aboard. They made me anchor in the outer roads and told me to heave out my dead. There was some tall buryin' about that time, Mr. Pathurst, and they went overboard without canvas, coal, or iron. They had to.

30|$|Among them, P 0 _ 0 is set {{as general}} I/O to {{directly}} collect DS 18 B 20 temperature value. P 0 _ 1 {{is set to}} the external interruption (rising edge trigger), and the heart rate value is calculated by reading the time {{difference between the two}} interrupts. The P 0 _ 6 pin is configured as an ADC input (the corresponding bit in the ADCCFG register is set to 1). The 6 th channel is selected with single-ended input mode and 14 -bit resolution. The 1.25  V reference voltage is internally generated. When the ADCCON 1.ST bit is set to 1, a conversion sequence is initiated and the analog ECG voltage signal is converted to a digital quantity. At the end of the conversion, the status bit ADCCON 1.ECO is set to high level. The conversion result is stored in ADCH and ADCL in the form of two complement to complete the ECG signal acquisition. There are mainly three types of nodes in the monitoring network, namely sensor nodes, routing nodes, and coordinator nodes. After the coordinator node is powered on, it is responsible for establishing and initializing the network, sending a network beacon, determining the network operating channel, and allocating a 16 -bit network address. After the routing node joins the network, it receives the data sent by the sensor node and forwards the data to the coordinator node. The sensor node only sends and receives the signal and does not have the forwarding function. After powering on, it automatically initiates a bind request. After the binding with the parent (routing) node is established, the collected body temperature, pulse, and ECG data are sent to the routing node. In addition, the coordinator node sends data to the PC through the serial <b>port.</b> <b>Doctors</b> can query and analyze data through the user management interface.|$|R
50|$|During the 1918 flu pandemic, the Huntsend {{departed}} Montreal on 26 September 1918 with 649 Canadian {{soldiers on}} board. Before {{the ship had}} left <b>port,</b> the ship's <b>doctor</b> had reported concerns about 15 of the passengers who were already sick with influenza and pneumonia. Despite his reported concerns, the ship sailed, and {{five percent of the}} 649 Canadians died before the ship disembarked on 11 October 1918. Some, if not all, of these men were buried at Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial a memorial site in France. Some of those infected died at a later date.|$|R
60|$|I don't {{know whether}} they are yaws or not--a {{physician}} in Fiji {{told me they were}}, and a missionary in the Solomons told me they were not; but at any rate I can vouch for {{the fact that they are}} most uncomfortable. It was my luck to ship in Tahiti a French-sailor, who, when we got to sea, proved to be afflicted with a vile skin disease. The Snark was too small and too much of a family party to permit retaining him on board; but perforce, until we could reach land and discharge him, it was up to me to doctor him. I read up the books and proceeded to treat him, taking care afterwards always to use a thorough antiseptic wash. When we reached Tutuila, far from getting rid of him, the <b>port</b> <b>doctor</b> declared a quarantine against him and refused to allow him ashore. But at Apia, Samoa, I managed to ship him off on a steamer to New Zealand. Here at Apia my ankles were badly bitten by mosquitoes, and I confess to having scratched the bites--as I had a thousand times before. By the time I reached the island of Savaii, a small sore had developed on the hollow of my instep. I thought it was due to chafe and to acid fumes from the hot lava over which I tramped. An application of salve would cure it--so I thought. The salve did heal it over, whereupon an astonishing inflammation set in, the new skin came off, and a larger sore was exposed. This was repeated many times. Each time new skin formed, an inflammation followed, and the circumference of the sore increased. I was puzzled and frightened. All my life my skin had been famous for its healing powers, yet here was something that would not heal. Instead, it was daily eating up more skin, while it had eaten down clear through the skin and was eating up the muscle itself.|$|E

50|$|Born in {{the town}} Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein, in 1966 Wodarg went, after his {{secondary}} school exams, on to study in medicine in Berlin and Hamburg. He got his physician's licence in 1973, and in 1974 he received his Dr. Med. doctorate degree from the University of Hamburg with a dissertation on the Mental Diseases of Seafarers - a study of suicide, alcoholism and other major psychiatric disorders. He subsequently began work as a ship's doctor, and following a research trip to South Africa he began {{in the position of}} <b>port</b> <b>doctor</b> in Hamburg.

Her obituaries in the Ann Arbor newspaper were headlined “Respected By Everyone,” and noted as well that her history of the University of Michigan had received much commendation for its accuracy.” In fact she had been a kind of “triple” pioneer. It was remarkable that she became the first female to be appointed by the Board of Regents to the Assistant Librarian positions only eight years after the first women were admitted to the University. At that time she would {{have been one of the}} highest ranking women on the campus. And she was the only woman to hold that position in the nineteenth century. She joined the socially pioneering women who came to the University of Michigan Medical School in its first fifteen years of co-education. And she was the first and - to date—only woman to write a general history of the University of Michigan.|$|R
50|$|When {{the project}} was {{introduced}} at Neath <b>Port</b> Talbot Hospital <b>doctors</b> found that 60% of patients who were referred with a photograph could avoid their first outpatient visit. So far more than 2,000 first appointments have been saved and by improving the efficiency of dermatology service the Trust hopes {{to be able to}} achieve their goal of dramatically reducing waiting lists. The project was funded as a joint venture between the Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot local health boards and the hospitals and is subject to regular performance review. The aim is to deliver increased efficiency and capacity without any effect {{on the quality of the}} service. So far there has not been a single adverse event or complaint from a GP or a patient.Using photographs to deal with difficult cases to avoid long journeys from rural areas is not a new concept. Teledermatology has been around in various guises for many years. However the screening approach employed by these dermatologists, whereby every patient has a photograph sent with their referral, is unique to South Wales. A local family <b>doctor</b> in <b>Port</b> Talbot, said: “The introduction of the cameras in primary care has been the single most important change in the local dermatology service in the 25 years I have been in practice.”The scheme won the Bro Morgannwg NHS Trust chief executive’s innovation award in December 2007 and the prize money is being used to set up a health psychology post at the Princess of Wales Hospital to provide counselling and support to those affected by their skin disease.|$|R
5000|$|In 1866, after a fatal {{outbreak}} of cholera from passengers embarked from the SS England on McNabs Island, {{the government of}} Nova Scotia passed an act to establish a quarantine station on Lawlor Island. The purchase {{was taken over by}} the new Canadian federal government in 1867 although difficulties in finding the island's absentee owners delayed the establishment of the station until 1870. Many local residents (most on the Eastern Passage side) protested against the idea of having infectious disease so close to their homes; some were concerned about germs that would blow across the fields and water into their homes. Many <b>port</b> officials and <b>doctors</b> also protested against the idea, being concerned that Lawlor's Island had no natural springs or fresh water, and also that the flow of ice during the winter would create difficulties in bringing boats in. An early quarantine officer was Dr William Wickwire, who assumed responsibility for quarantine duties after the indefinite suspension of Dr Gossip for incompetence. Dr. Norman McKay took control of these duties soon afterwards. By 1900, officials had the island fitted with a deep-water wharf, a shallow-water wharf (on the Eastern Passage side), two hospitals and a convalescent building, a disinfection autoclave, baths with needle showers, a bacteria diagnosis laboratory, a first, second and third-class detention hall, an ambulance building, many residences and staff housing; also, the building that was referred to as [...] "the long shed" [...] or [...] "German Hospital" [...] on McNabs Island was taken down and reassembled {{on the west side of}} the island.|$|R

Leaf 46 in c. 1 (leaf [35] in c. 2) is a port. of the actor Giovanni Gabrielli, called "il Sivello. " It is by Agostino Carracci after his own drawing, and is dated ca. 1599; see DeGrazia, Agostino 211. Leaf [43] ([37], c. 2) is a <b>port.</b> of <b>Doctor</b> Gabriele Faloppio, perhaps by Francesco Brizio (DeGrazia, Agostino R 38). The impression in c. 1 is DeGrazia's 2 nd state with retouching, that in c. 2 the 1 st state. According to Bartsch, the suite comprises the title leaf and 81 prints (far more than in the present copies). He describes two sequences, one numbered 1 - 36 and signed LC for Luca Ciamberlano, the other by Francesco Brizio. None of the present prints are numbered and most are not signed. Cimaberlano's role is confirmed, however, by a partly effaced monogram composed of C and L at the upper right of leaf [14], c. 2. The representation of 2 skulls at leaf [41] (leaf [15], c. 2) is signed: Lucas de Vrbino, i. e. Luca Ciamberlano.
