Three surrogate mixtures of n-decane, iso-octane and n-propylbenzene in different amounts were formulated to represent the above-mentioned commercial fuels based on their derived cetane numbers and threshold sooting indexes. Based on this mechanism, the impacts of fuel composition (ethylene vs. jet-A 1 fuel) and reaction progress (height above the burner) on the respective importance of benzene and naphthalene formation pathways were characterized.

The objective of the study is to provide {{a better understanding of the}} controlling mechanisms of smolder, both in microgravity and normal earth gravity. Experiments have been conducted aboard the NASA Space Shuttle in the Get Away Special Canister (GAS-CAN), an apparatus requiring completely remote operation. Future GAS-CAN experiments will utilize an ultrasound imaging system (UIS) which has been incorporated into the MSC experimental apparatus. Thermocouples are currently used to measure temperature and reaction front velocities. A less intrusive method is desirable, however, as smolder is a very weak reaction and it has been found that heat transfer along the thermocouple is sufficient to affect the smolder reaction. It is expected that the UIS system will eventually replace the existing array of thermocouples as a non-intrusive technique without compromising data acquisition. The UIS measures line of sight permeability, providing information about the reaction front position and extent. Additionally, the ignition sequence of the MSC experiments has been optimized from previous experiments to provide longer periods of self-supported smolder. An ignition protocol of a fixed power to the igniter for a fixed time is now implemented.

In this work, the octane numbers of various binary and ternary n-heptane/iso-octane/toluene blends, referred to as toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) mixtures, are correlated with a fundamental chemical kinetic parameter, specifically, homogeneous gas-phase fuel/air ignition delay time. Ignition delay times for stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures are calculated at various constant volume conditions (835 K and 20 atm, 825 K and 25 atm, 850 K and 50 atm (research octane number RON-like) and 980 K and 45 atm (motor octane number MON-like)), and for variable volume profiles calculated from cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine pressure and temperature simulations.

After the program {{was approved by the}} Department of Defense in early 1966, E-Systems of Greenville, Texas modified two C-123K Providers which were redesignated NC-123Ks, but were often referred to as AC-123Ks. The aircraft were equipped with a long, 57.75inch nose fairing that housed an X-band forward-looking radar. Below and aft of the extended radome was a turret with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Low-Level Light Television (LLLTV), and a laser range-finder/illuminator. Also, a low-level Doppler navigation radar and weapons release computer were installed. Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispensers (for CBU bomblets) were stacked within the fuselage. Each container housed 12 cells, each cell containing three Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2,664 and 6,372 one pound bomblets. The bomblets were released through 12 openings in the cargo floor that aligned with the cells in the weapons dispenser. The lower fuselage contained 12 inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the cargo floor, forming a chute. Bomblet release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward section of the fuselage. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually. The first aircraft, 54–691, was delivered to Eglin AFB in August 1967 and the second, 54–698, incorporating an AN/ASD-5 Black Crow direction finder set (engine <b>ignition</b> <b>sensor),</b> was delivered in February 1968.

This configuration corresponds to the DNS data from Sreedhara and Lakshmisha [Proc. Combust. Inst. 29 (2002) 2069]. The system can be described by the flamelet equations for the temperature and fuel mass fraction, where the scalar dissipation rate appears as a stochastic parameter. In a turbulent flow, fluctuations of this scalar have a strong impact on autoignition. Assuming a log normal distribution, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) can be derived for the scalar dissipation rate. The decay rate of the mean dissipation rate is taken from the DNS.

Chemical kinetic sub-models were put forth to describe the chemical reaction rate(s) and quantify the resultant heat release. The simplified model predicts pyrotechnic ignition when heat from the pyrotechnic reactions is accounted for. Effects of six key parameters on ignition were examined.

A wide range of equivalence ratios for ethylene/air mixtures were explored and a limited number of JP- 10 /air mixtures. The JP- 10 /air fuel mixtures were nearly impossible to ignite at characteristic velocities greater than 35 m/s until a porous ignition shield was installed. The porous shield, surrounding the Transient Plasma Ignition (TPI) electrode, demonstrated the successful ignition at characteristic velocities up to 100 m/s for C 2 H 4 /air and 55 m/s for JP- 10 /air mixtures. The ignition shield slowed down a portion of the fuel-air mixture to increase the local residence time, allowing for more reliable ignition. The resulting combustion products proceeded to ignite the remaining fuel-air mixture. The ignition shield design appears to locally prevent a complete purge of the previous cycle's products, and a transient plasma discharge was still required for subsequent ignition to occur.

Several fires of densified RDF occurred in silos storing this material, giving us an impetus for this study, with the present investigation focusing on measuring temperature profiles and mass loss of RDF samples. A specialised sample holder was constructed to accommodate four fine thermocouples (76 μm in diameter), which facilitated the measurement of the temperature profiles within RDF samples undergoing oxidation and pyrolysis. An additional thermocouple was positioned {{at the base of the}} sample to verify the assumption of heat transfer in semi-infinite slab, prior to ignition.

This study explores the effects of chemical composition on the fundamental ignition behavior of gasoline fuels. Two well-characterized, high-octane, non-oxygenated FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasolines, FACE F and FACE G, having similar antiknock indices but different octane sensitivities and chemical compositions are studied. Ignition experiments were conducted in shock tubes and a rapid compression machine (RCM) at nominal pressures of 20 and 40. atm, equivalence ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 0, and temperatures ranging from 650 to 1270. K. Results at temperatures above 900. K indicate that ignition delay time is similar for these fuels. However, RCM measurements below 900. K demonstrate a stronger negative temperature coefficient behavior for FACE F gasoline having lower octane sensitivity. In addition, RCM pressure <b>profiles</b> under two-stage <b>ignition</b> conditions illustrate that the magnitude of low-temperature heat release (LTHR) increases with decreasing fuel octane sensitivity. However, intermediate-temperature heat release is shown to increase as fuel octane sensitivity increases. Various surrogate fuel mixtures were formulated to conduct chemical kinetic modeling, and complex multicomponent surrogate mixtures were shown to reproduce experimentally observed trends better than simpler two- and three-component mixtures composed of n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene. Measurements in a Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) engine demonstrated that the multicomponent surrogates accurately captured the antiknock quality of the FACE gasolines.

The impetus behind this effort is the understanding of the ignition conditions and flammability properties of structural metals found in oxygen (O 2) systems for space applications. Since spacecraft are subjected to higher-than- 1 g loads during launch and reentry and to a zero-gravity environment while in orbit, the study of ignition and combustion of bulk metals at different gravitational accelerations is of great practical concern. From the scientific standpoint, studies conducted under low gravity conditions provide simplified boundary conditions, since buoyancy is removed, and make possible the identification of fundamental ignition and combustion mechanisms. This investigation is intended to provide experimental verification of the influence of natural convection on the burning behavior of metals. In addition, the study offers the first findings of the influence of gravity on ignition of bulk metals and on the combustion mechanism and structure of metal-oxygen, vapor-phase diffusion flames in a buoyancy-free environment. Titanium (Ti) and magnesium (Mg) metals were chosen because of their importance as elements of structural materials and their simple chemical composition-pure metals instead of multicomponent alloys to simplify chemical and spectroscopic analyses. In addition, these elements present the two different combustion modes observed in metals: heterogeneous or surface burning (for Ti) and homogeneous or gas-phase reaction (for Mg). Finally, Mg, Ti, and their oxides exhibit a wide range of thermophysical and chemical properties. Metal surface temperature <b>profiles,</b> critical and <b>ignition</b> temperatures, propagation rates, burning times, and spectroscopic measurements are obtained under normal and reduced gravity. Visual evidence of all phenomena is provided by high-speed photography...|$|R
40|$|As the {{regulations}} for engine-out emissions {{around the world}} are getting increasingly stringent, dual-fuel (DF) combustion involving natural gas or methane as primary fuel ignited by a very small diesel pilot can be an attractive alternative to diesel only combustion in heavy duty engines of both road as well as marine applications. Natural gas or methane have potential for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions because of their high hydrogen to carbon ratio compared to diesel fuel. Their highly premixed combustion also produces less NOx than diesel as the overall combustion temperature is lower. Furthermore, they have huge potential for exploitation at competitive prices in regions such as India, China and North America, thus helping to reduce dependency on conventional diesel and gasoline. In this thesis work, an attempt has been made to characterize the DF combustion of premixed methane and diesel pilot with the help of optical and thermodynamic measurements. DF combustion experiments were carried out in a single cylinder, optical research engine with electro hydraulic valve actuation system and custom made engine control program that enable research with great degree of parameter freedom. Crank angle resolved images of Natural Luminosity (NL) resulting from combustion were acquired using a high speed CMOS camera. NL signals showing the development of premixed flame fronts, cylinder pressure traces, heat release rate (HRR) <b>profiles</b> and <b>ignition</b> delays are considered as tools for characterizing the DF combustion in this thesis work. Influences of methane lambda (λCH 4), of pilot fuel ratio (PR) and of charge air temperature on dual-fuel combustion were investigated separately using three different case studies. From optical and thermodynamic investigations, it was observed that the ignition delay and shape of HRR in DF combustion strongly depend upon lambda of the gaseous fuel. With methane substitution rate ranging from 82 % to 88 %, when λCH 4 was varied from 1. 1 to 1. 9, it was observed that the periods of ignition delays were longer at both least as well as most lean case, with relatively shorter delays around the λCH 4 1. 5 region. The study of DF combustion as a function of PR revealed that the DF ignition delay decreased with increasing PR until a certain extent after which any increase in PR did not bring the ignition delay significantly forward. In the final case study, for both λCH 4 1. 1 and λCH 4 1. 8 cases, it was observed that higher intake temperatures shortened ignition delays, promoted second stage combustion and reduced cycle-to-cycle variations. However, at high intake temperatures, certain DF cycles also demonstrated excessive rates of pressure rise immediately after the onset of combustion. In summary, it is concluded that at high substitution rates (ca. 85 %) and light load conditions as experimented in this thesis, DF combustion is dominated by the premixed flame front propagation mode rather than by the characteristics of diesel diffusion combustion...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is carried out}} to understand the mechanism of using fuel stratification and Exhaust Gas Recycling (EGR) for knock mitigation on boosted Controlled Auto-Ignition (CAl) engines. Experiments were first conducted on Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) to <b>profile</b> the <b>ignition</b> characteristic of the specific fuel used, and to explain the dilution effects of air and inert gas. Then the effect of fuel stratification and EGR were systematically examined on a production engine (modified 1. 9 L Renault F 9 Q B 800 common rail diesel engine) based test bench. The engine performance was interpreted with the auto-ignition fundamentals {{to sort out the}} intrinsic links among CAI engine knock propensity, engine operational parameters, and fuel stratification as well as EGR dilution extent. The nature of CAI engine knock, the metric of the phenomenon, and the theoretical rationales behind using fuel stratification and EGR for heat release control are reviewed before the experiment results are reported. RCM tests show that the sensitivity of fuel ignition delay to equivalence ratio varies with the ignition temperature, and higher sensitivity in the NTC region is preferred to make fuel stratification useful. With fixed fuel concentration, air dilution slightly reduces the ignition delay, while inert gas dilution could increase the ignition delay by a factor of 5. Inert gas dilution was found slowing down the fast heat release effectively for ignition temperature around NTC region. This indicates strong effect of EGR for CAI combustion knock mitigation. Engine tests demonstrates that fuel stratification has high potential for CAI knock mitigation, but its effect heavily depends on the extent of fuel stratification, engine configuration, and in-cylinder conditions. While 80 % improvement on knock performance can be achieved with mid-compression stroke direct injection (DI), 400 % higher knock intensity could also occur for late Dl. EGR was found effective in retarding combustion phasing and reducing knock intensity, attribute to its effect on both in-cylinder temperature control and heat release curbing, yet misfire could happen with too much EGR. With dual injections, the ratio of premixed fuel to directly injected fuel decreases the effect of fuel stratification in all aspects. Higher intake temperature deteriorates the knock performance. Higher engine speed retards the combustion phasing and enhances the fuel stratification extent and effect. Analysis shows that CAI knock tendency is largely determined by the in-cylinder temperature governed by combustion phasing, and many factors directly or indirectly influences the results. The primary effect of fuel stratification is on combustion phasing, although the heat release rate is also affected at the same combustion phasing. To better take advantage of fuel stratification and EGR for CAI knock mitigation, the engine operating parameters {{have to be in the}} right range. This research work could serve as a reference for future development of CAI engines with capability of knock free high load operations. by Wen Sang. Thesis: Ph.
