40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{focuses on}} the ethical justifiability of <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> Genetically Modified (GM) crops. I argue {{that there are three}} {{distinguishing}} features of GM crops that make it unethical to grant <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> GM crops, even if we assume that the patent system is in general justified. The first half of the paper critiques David Resnikâ€™s recent arguments in favor of <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> GM crops. Resnik argues that we should take a consequentialist approach to the issue, and {{that the best way to}} do so is to apply the Precautionary Principle, and that the Precautionary Principle, in this case, supports <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> GM crops. I argue that his argument in favor of a consequentialist treatment is invalid; his Precautionary Principle in any case looks to be incompatible with consequentialism; and his conception of reasonable precautions is too ill-defined to have any argumentative purchase. In the second half of the paper I argue against GM crop <b>patents,</b> <b>on</b> three grounds. First, there is insufficient evidence to say whether allowing <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> GM crops will make research go faster than not having patents, whilst there is a good reason to think that, other things being equal, a society that allows <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> GM crops will be less just than one that does not. Second, even assuming that <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> GM crops will increase the pace of GM crop research, there is no social need to do so. Third, <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> GM crops will frequently have ethically unacceptable side effects...|$|R
5|$|In 1879, Karl Benz {{was granted}} the first <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> a {{reliable}} gasoline-powered engine in Germany. In 1885, he produced the first true gasoline automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen. The new invention was quickly refined and gained popularity in Germany and France, and interest {{grew in the}} United Kingdom and the United States. In 1902, Ransom Olds created the production line concept for mass-producing lower-cost automobiles. Henry Ford soon refined the concept so that by 1914, middle-class laborers could afford automobiles built by Ford Motor Company.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Bell {{applied for}} a <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> an {{invention}} which would improve fibre optic communication speeds and assist in transmitting long distances. Although yet to produce any fibre, Bell states his mathematical models show the velocity of light within the fiber can be improved to from 68% to 98% {{of the speed of}} light with lower optical loss and dispersion which would allow light pulses to be transmitted for longer distances without being smeared together over time and distance.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Cominco's president, Selwyn G. Blaylock, was cautious. There {{might be}} no post-war demand for heavy water, and the <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> {{the process was}} held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a {{profit-sharing}} agreement would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 for plant modifications. There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock {{had a meeting with}} the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided to find another source of heavy water. Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir Edward Beatty. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The heavy water project became known as the P-9 Project in October 1942.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided {{a good source of}} royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system â€” something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had long}} been an {{acquaintance}} of John Fitch, the first to build a steamboat in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans's lone attempt at building his own steamboat powered by a high-pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River Steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used low-pressure engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans {{about the possibility of}} using Evans's engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans's designs for Fulton's steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and low-pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans' engine for the purpose. High-pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans' <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> high-pressure engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans' designs for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|In 1595, the Stationers' Company fined Barley 40 shillings for illicitly {{publishing}} {{a number of}} works. Three years later, the organisation sued him and a fellow draper, Simon Stafford, for allegedly publishing privileged books. A raid on Barley's former premises found 4,000 copies of the Accidence, a Latin grammar book protected by monopoly. Despite pleading his innocence in court, Barley, along with Stafford, Edward Venge, and Thomas Pavier (who was Barley's apprentice), was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers' Company's control over the Elizabethan book trade. Stafford, Pavier, and other draper-booksellers joined the company {{within a few years}} so that they could continue their trade. Curiously, Barley did not join them until 1606. The reasons for the delay are debated among scholars. Bibliographer J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers' Company rejected Barley because he had no experience in the printing business. Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with Thomas Morley, who held a royal <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> music publishing, allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles. The Stationers' Company could not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant.|$|E
40|$|In India, <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> Bt cotton {{have given}} rise to an {{unproductive}} controversy.

Notwithstanding the ongoing controversy, the article argues that the central demand of the campaign against <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> Bt cotton (the abolishment of <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> plants and plant parts) is actually not in contradiction with the practices of the Bt cotton industry (which mainly uses <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> the Bt technology). Furthermore, the Indian courts do have the legal possibility to interpret the Indian Patent Act {{in such a way that}} it prohibits the patenting of plants and plant parts. Such an interpretation could potentially help to appease the ongoing controversy and to foster a deliberative debate on genetically modified crops and rural development. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|While Degesch {{owned the}} rights to the brand name Zyklon and the <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> the {{packaging}} system, the chemical formula was owned by Degussa. Schlempe GmbH, which was 52 per cent owned by Degussa, owned {{the rights to}} a process to extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of sugar beet processing. This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from Schering AG to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch. The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors: Heerdt-Linger GmbH (Heli) of Frankfurt and Tesch & Stabenow (Testa) of Hamburg. Their territory was split along the Elbe river, with Heli handling clients to the west and south, and Testa those to the east. Degesch owned 51 per cent of the shares of Heli, and until 1942 owned 55 per cent of Testa.|$|E
5|$|He {{applied for}} another <b>patent</b> <b>on</b> an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E
