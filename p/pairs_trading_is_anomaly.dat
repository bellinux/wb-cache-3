40|$|Objective of {{the study}} is to further {{investigate}} <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy on the U. S. equity markets and the possible explanations for the strategy profits. The main contribution {{of the study}} to the existing literature is to provide a thorough empirical study of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits and to examine the unexplored link between <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profit and short-term return reversals. In addition, this thesis studies <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits in different market conditions and the exposure of the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits to known market risk factors. The data used in the empirical study comprises of daily stock market return data for the S&P 500 equity index constituents from December 1967 to December 2009. The data set is extracted from Center for Research in Security Price (CRSP) database, consisting of observations for 10824 days and 1331 unique S&P 500 constituents. The main findings of the thesis show that the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy yields markedly higher risk adjusted returns compared to the S&P 500 benchmark index, which are comparable in size to the earlier studies on the topic. According to the return analysis, the strategy on average yields small but positive returns for majority of the periods, but the returns are at least to some extent driven by small number of high return periods. I also find that <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits persist over time, contrary to earlier studies, and profits to be dependent on the overall market conditions. Although the returns show some time variation, the returns persist also to this day. The <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits <b>are</b> highly exposed to funding liquidity risk as well as overall equity market volatility, which imply that arbitrageurs are constrained to enforce relative pricing discrepancies.
