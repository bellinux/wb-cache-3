5|$|Relative to {{most other}} elements, {{commercial}} applications for europium {{are few and}} rather specialized. Almost invariably, its <b>phosphorescence</b> is exploited, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause <b>phosphorescence</b> in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike <b>phosphorescence,</b> did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered bioluminescent organisms {{may be the}} dinoflagellates present in the surface layers of the sea, which {{are responsible for the}} sparkling <b>phosphorescence</b> sometimes seen at night in disturbed water. At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity. A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.|$|E
5|$|Europium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and {{is named after}} the continent of Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the <b>phosphorescence</b> of europium compounds. Europium {{is one of the}} least abundant elements in the universe; only about % of all matter in the universe is europium.|$|E
25|$|Since that time, {{phosphors}} and <b>phosphorescence</b> {{were used}} loosely to describe substances that shine {{in the dark}} without burning. Although the term <b>phosphorescence</b> is derived from phosphorus, the reaction that gives phosphorus its glow is properly called chemiluminescence (glowing due to a cold chemical reaction), not <b>phosphorescence</b> (re-emitting light that previously fell onto a substance and excited it).|$|E
25|$|Thermographic {{phosphors}} {{consist of}} ceramic host materials doped with rare-earth or transition metal ions, which exhibit <b>phosphorescence</b> {{when they are}} illuminated with UV-light. The decay time and the spectra of this <b>phosphorescence</b> are temperature sensitive and offer two different methods to measure temperature. The decay time method consists on the fitting of the <b>phosphorescence</b> decay to an exponential function and is normally used in point measurements, {{although it has been}} demonstrated in surface measurements. The intensity ratio between two different spectral lines of the <b>phosphorescence</b> emission, tracked using spectral filters, is also temperature-dependent and can be employed for surface measurements.|$|E

25|$|Drawing {{influence}} from Yamazaki and fellow playwright Hirata Oriza, he created his own theater company <b>Phosphorescence</b> Troupe (燐光群 Rinkōgun) in 1983. Along with his plays that reveal commentary on Japanese society, {{he was also}} active in the radical angura movement that flourished in the 1960s. The <b>Phosphorescence</b> Troupe focuses on performing mostly Sakate’s works and plays, {{and they have been}} met with positive reviews from outside Japan.|$|E
25|$|A pigment is a {{material}} {{that changes the}} color of reflected or transmitted light {{as the result of}} wavelength-selective absorption. This physical process differs from fluorescence, <b>phosphorescence,</b> and other forms of luminescence, in which {{a material}} emits light.|$|E
25|$|The use of thermographic {{phosphors}} {{offers some}} advantageous features including {{ability to survive}} in reactive and high temperature environments, chemical stability and insensitivity of their <b>phosphorescence</b> emission to pressure and gas composition. In addition, thermographic phosphors emit light at different wavelengths, allowing spectral discrimination against excitation light and background.|$|E
25|$|A {{molecule}} in S1 {{can relax}} by various competing pathways. It can undergo non-radiative relaxation {{in which the}} excitation energy is dissipated as heat (vibrations) to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a triplet state, which may subsequently relax via <b>phosphorescence,</b> or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.|$|E
25|$|A Tesla coil {{is a type}} of {{resonant}} transformer circuit {{invented by}} Nikola Tesla around 1891. Nikola Tesla used these coils to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, <b>phosphorescence,</b> x-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires for point-to-point telecommunications, broadcasting, and the transmission of electrical power.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{substances}} produce {{light when}} they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, {{a process known as}} fluorescence. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as <b>phosphorescence.</b> Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. Cathodoluminescence is one example. This mechanism is used in cathode ray tube television sets and computer monitors.|$|E
25|$|A {{light-emitting}} capacitor is {{made from}} a dielectric that uses <b>phosphorescence</b> to produce light. If one of the conductive plates is made with a transparent material, the light is visible. Light-emitting capacitors {{are used in the}} construction of electroluminescent panels, for applications such as backlighting for laptop computers. In this case, the entire panel is a capacitor used for the purpose of generating light.|$|E
25|$|Tesla {{used these}} {{circuits}} to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, <b>phosphorescence,</b> X-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and {{the transmission of}} electrical energy without wires. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s, and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today their main use is for entertainment and educational displays, although small coils are still used today as leak detectors for high vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|The micrometre-sized {{phosphor}} particles used in thermographic PIV are seeded {{into the}} flow as a tracer and, after illumination {{with a thin}} laser light sheet, {{the temperature of the}} particles can be measured from the <b>phosphorescence,</b> normally using an intensity ratio technique. It is important that the particles are of small size so that not only they follow the flow satisfactorily but also they rapidly assume its temperature. For a diameter of 2µm, the thermal slip between particle and gas is as small as the velocity slip.|$|E
25|$|Wilkins went to St John's College, Cambridge in 1935. He {{studied the}} Natural Sciences Tripos specialising in Physics, and {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts degree. Mark Oliphant {{who was one of}} Wilkins' instructors at St. John's had been appointed to the Chair of Physics at the University of Birmingham, and had appointed John Randall to his staff. Wilkins became a Ph.D. student of Randall at the University of Birmingham. In 1945, they published four papers in the Proceedings of the Royal Society on <b>phosphorescence</b> and electron traps. Wilkins received a PhD for this work in 1940.|$|E
25|$|As {{electrons}} and holes are fermions with half integer spin, an exciton may {{either be in}} a singlet state or a triplet state {{depending on how the}} spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet exciton. Decay from triplet states (<b>phosphorescence)</b> is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes make use of spin–orbit interactions to facilitate intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence is the {{emission}} of light by {{a substance that}} has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It {{is a form of}} luminescence. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can only be seen when exposed to UV light. Fluorescent materials cease to glow immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike <b>phosphorescence,</b> where it continues to emit light for some time after.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp {{is the combination}} of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the <b>phosphorescence</b> effect give a combined spectral distribution of light {{that is different from}} those produced by incandescent sources. The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its color rendering index (CRI).|$|E
25|$|Many {{transitions}} involving {{electromagnetic radiation}} are strictly forbidden under quantum mechanics. The allowed transitions are described by so-called selection rules, which describe {{the conditions under}} which a radiative transition is allowed. For instance, transitions are only allowed if ΔS=0, S being the total spin angular momentum of the system. In real materials other effects, such as interactions with the crystal lattice, intervene to circumvent the formal rules by providing alternate mechanisms. In these systems the forbidden transitions can occur, but usually at slower rates than allowed transitions. A classic example is <b>phosphorescence</b> where a material has a ground state with S=0, an excited state with S=0, and an intermediate state with S=1. The transition from the intermediate state to the ground state by emission of light is slow because of the selection rules. Thus emission may continue after the external illumination is removed. In contrast fluorescence in materials is characterized by emission which ceases when the external illumination is removed.|$|E
500|$|Although the GE {{stones and}} natural {{diamonds}} were chemically identical, their physical properties {{were not the}} same. The colorless stones produced strong fluorescence and <b>phosphorescence</b> under short-wavelength ultraviolet light, but were inert under long-wave UV. Among natural diamonds, only the rarer blue gems exhibit these properties. Unlike natural diamonds, all the GE stones showed strong yellow fluorescence under X-rays. The De Beers Diamond Research Laboratory has grown stones of up to [...] for research purposes. Stable HPHT conditions were kept for six weeks to grow high-quality diamonds of this size. For economic reasons, the growth of most synthetic diamonds is terminated when they reach a mass of [...] to [...]|$|E
500|$|On 5 June 1881 {{the mail}} ship Acadia ran aground {{on the island}} while {{returning}} from San Francisco, Peru after unloading its cargo. On the way to Queenstown or Falmouth for new orders, Master Stephen George calculated a route passing [...] {{to the east of}} Ducie. George left the first mate in command at 6am. Half an hour later, the first mate saw a white line, which he disregarded on the assumption that it was <b>phosphorescence</b> in the water. Later, realising that it was land, he manoeuvred to avoid running aground, but failed. The look-out excused himself by saying that he thought that the white land was a cloud. The crew made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the ship, after which the master sailed one of the ship's boats to Pitcairn Island. He was assisted there by the local inhabitants and returned aboard the Edward O'Brien, an American boat, to rescue the rest of the crew. The incident was later investigated in a court in Liverpool, where the ultimate cause of the wreck was left undetermined, though possible causes included a calculation error by the master or an unknown current that carried the ship to the island. The court declared the master not guilty of any wrongdoing. A stone marker with a memorial inscription is located at the landing point on Acadia Islet. It was unveiled to commemorate the recovery of the anchor in 1990. The wreck lies offshore from the memorial stone in about 10 metres of water.|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins [...] (15 December 1916 – 5 October 2004) was a New Zealand-born British {{physicist}} and molecular biologist, and Nobel laureate whose research {{contributed to the}} scientific understanding of <b>phosphorescence,</b> isotope separation, optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and {{to the development of}} radar. He {{is best known for his}} work at King's College London on the structure of DNA.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{studies with}} G [...] and solvatochromic dyes {{not to create}} a sensor, but to {{elucidate}} the chemistry behind the conformational change of [...] Examples of this include a study utilizing L255C with acrylodan and [...] Ruthenium at the at N-terminus revealing three conformational states closed and twisted, the fluorescence and <b>phosphorescence</b> of the tryptophan W183 under normal conditions , under high pressure and with or without calcium.|$|E
2500|$|Chemiluminescence {{differs from}} {{fluorescence}} or <b>phosphorescence</b> {{in that the}} electronic excited state {{is the product of}} a chemical reaction rather than of the absorption of a photon. [...] It is the antithesis of a photochemical reaction, in which light is used to drive an endothermic chemical reaction. [...] Here, light is generated from a chemically exothermic reaction. The chemiluminescence might be also induced by an electrochemical stimulus, in this case is called electrochemiluminescence.|$|E
2500|$|Classifying {{minerals}} {{ranges from}} simple to difficult. A mineral {{can be identified}} by several physical properties, some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation. In other cases, minerals can only be classified by more complex optical, chemical or X-ray diffraction analysis; these methods, however, can be costly and time-consuming. [...] Physical properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage and fracture, and specific gravity. Other less general tests include fluorescence, <b>phosphorescence,</b> magnetism, radioactivity, tenacity (response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form), piezoelectricity and reactivity to dilute acids.|$|E
2500|$|... is a {{contemporary}} Japanese playwright notable for his plays that frequently comment {{on social and}} political issues in Japan. His most prominent plays are The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002), Come Out (カムアウト Kamu auto, 1989), Tokyo Trial (トーキョー裁判 Tōkyō saiban, 1988), and Epitaph for the Whales (くじらの墓標 Kujira no bohyō, 1993). In his works, he focuses on dramatizing real-life events, and also depicts the historical past. In 1983, he founded his own theater company called the <b>Phosphorescence</b> Troupe (燐光群 Rinkōgun). Sakate is currently {{the president of the}} Japanese Playwrights Association, and the director of both the Japan Directors Association and Japanese Center of International Theater Institute.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, The Attic {{made its}} first American premiere in Manhattan, New York. In The New York Times, editor Ginia Bellafante {{describes}} Sakate’s language usage in the play as “economical [...] poignant”. In this play, Sakate focuses on the social phenomenon in Japan known as hikikomori, where young adults withdraw from society and isolate themselves typically in their homes. For the company’s 30th anniversary, the <b>Phosphorescence</b> Troupe presented four of Sakate’s original plays: Honchos’ Meeting in Cowra (カウラの班長会議 Kaura no hanchō kaigi, 2013), Return Home (帰還 Kikan), The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002), and his newest play, There Was A Cinema Here (ここには映画館があった Koko ni wa eigakan ga atta, 2013).|$|E
2500|$|The manual {{suggests}} instead [...] "a bicarbonate {{solution to}} neutralise phosphoric acid, which will then allow removal of visible white phosphorus. Particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them, or by their <b>phosphorescence</b> in the dark. In dark surroundings, fragments {{are seen as}} luminescent spots. Promptly debride the burn if the patient's condition will permit removal of bits of WP (white phosphorus) that might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning. DO NOT apply oily-based ointments until {{it is certain that}} all WP has been removed. Following complete removal of the particles, treat the lesions as thermal burns." [...] As white phosphorus readily mixes with oils, any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{chemical}} reaction, reactants collide {{to form a}} transition state, the enthalpic maximum in a reaction coordinate diagram, which proceeds to the product. [...] Normally, reactants form products of lesser chemical energy. [...] The difference in energy between reactants and products, represented as , is turned into heat, physically realized as excitations in the vibrational state of the normal modes of the product. [...] Since vibrational energy is generally {{much greater than the}} thermal agitation, it rapidly disperses in the solvent through molecular rotation. [...] This is how exothermic reactions make their solutions hotter. [...] In a chemiluminescent reaction, the direct product of the reaction is an excited electronic state. This state then decays into an electronic ground state and emits light through either an allowed transition (analogous to fluorescence) or a forbidden transition (analogous to <b>phosphorescence),</b> depending partly on the spin state of the electronic excited state formed.|$|E
2500|$|While {{generally}} considered {{invisible to the}} human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, in an experiment a short time after Röntgen's landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint [...] "blue-gray" [...] glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself. Upon hearing this, Röntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube {{on the opposite side}} of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the experiment was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with ionizing radiation. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of rhodopsin molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of <b>phosphorescence</b> in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.|$|E
2500|$|A {{light rain}} was falling and {{visibility}} was poor when, {{half an hour}} before morning twilight, Tunny began a radar approach. Rapidly shoaling water less than 20fathoms (37m) deep and land masses on two sides of the submarine limited her maneuverability. At , the extreme <b>phosphorescence</b> of the water illuminated her wake and betrayed her presence to the enemy ship, which began signaling the unidentified intruder with a blinker light. Despite her detection, Tunny continued the approach until she was only [...] from the target and then launched three torpedoes. The Japanese ship, now discernible as a loaded tanker, began to maneuver radically and opened fire on the submarine. Undeterred, Tunny submerged and continued the attack, firing a second volley from her stern tubes. One of these torpedoes hit the side of the tanker with a thud, but without explosion, and a small column of water erupted just forward of the tanker's bridge. Duds and prematures were a problem for American submarines early in 1943, and verification that this torpedo had indeed hit the tanker, but failed to detonate, was forthcoming when members of the tanker's crew dashed to the spot in question and began examining the impact area with flashlights. Despite continuous fire from the ship and the proximity of land, Tunny managed to stay within firing range of her target by traveling at full speed. After the tanker successfully evaded Tunnys third salvo, the submarine fired a last torpedo from [...] as the intended victim reached the passage into Hong Kong. Following this disappointing conclusion to her attack, Tunny dove in anticipation of search planes which appeared within two hours and continued their surveillance throughout the day.|$|E
