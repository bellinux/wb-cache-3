40|$|A {{computational}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to study the effect and mechanisms of the <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> of a supersonic flow over a rectangular two-dimensional cavity. The <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> was included {{through the use of}} a porous surface over a vent chamber in the floor of the cavity. The <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> effectively suppressed the low-frequency pressure oscillations for the open type cavity, (length-to-depth ratio = 6. 0). The mechanism for the suppression was observed to be the stabilization of the motion of the free shear layer. For the closed type cavity flow, (length-to-depth ratio = 17. 5), the <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> modified the flowfield to nearly that of an open type cavity flow; further the cavity drag was reduced by a factor of four. The computational results of both cases showed good agreement with the available experimental data and the predictions of a semiempirical formula.

The <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> method {{consists of a}} porous surface placed over a plenum. The purpose of the <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> method is to exploit the adverse pressure gradient present in afterbody flow {{in an attempt to}} reduce boundary layer separation and afterbody drag. Four different porous wall models are used to model the transpiration velocity in the region of <b>passive</b> <b>control.</b> A three-dimensional, time-dependent, Reynolds-averaged, simplified Navier-Stokes solver, PAB 3 D, is used to simulate afterbody flow with and without <b>passive</b> <b>control.</b> Three afterbody configurations with boat-tail angles of 10, 20, and 30 deg. are used to obtain two-dimensional solutions with a freestream Mach number of 0. 6 and nozzle pressure ratio of 6. The region of <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> was initially placed from 20 - 60 % of the nozzle length. The effect of the porous placement and porous extent is also studied. Baseline (no porosity) two-dimensional solutions are qualitatively similar to experimental data but under-predict the magnitude of the pressure recovery. Results for the subsonic solutions show losses in the pressure recovery for some cases with <b>passive</b> <b>control.</b> Three-dimensional effects are also investigated and seen to be very significant. Three-dimensional baseline solutions, for both sub- and super-critical freestream Mach numbers, compare very favorably with the experimental data in comparison to the two-dimensional solution.

30|$|This {{meta-analysis}} provides {{new information}} on the effectiveness and relevant application of flywheel training for athletes. However, {{it should be noted}} that this paper has some limitations. One limitation is the lack of <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> groups in 16 of the 20 included studies. The main reason for using such a design is probably due to the assumption that a control group would likely stay at baseline and flywheel training could, therefore, be compared to a theoretical control group. This supposition is supported by all the studies that used a <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> group [6, 15, 26, 34]. When the number of studies on flywheel training increases and more studies have included a <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> group, including only these studies in a future meta-analysis would provide more robust scientific evidence. Furthermore, one study presenting values for vertical and horizontal displacement was excluded due to lack of complete information [52].|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} of <b>passive</b> <b>controls</b> in asymmetrical street canyons to reduce personal exposure to air pollutants on footpaths. A <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> {{in the form of}} a low boundary wall (LBW) may act as a baffle within a street canyon, producing modified airflow patterns and increase pollutant dispersion at street level. This numerical modelling study assessed the spatial distribution of concentrations of a tracer pollutant in a street canyon. Concentrations were measured along the centre of both footpaths at breathing height to determine the percentage difference between pollutant concentrations in canyons with and without <b>passive</b> <b>controls.</b> The investigation assessed asymmetrical street canyons of different building height ratios (H 1 /H 2 ratio ranging from 0. 5 ? 1. 5 in 0. 1 intervals) in perpendicular wind conditions. The results indicated that the H 1 /H 2 ratio affects pollutant dispersion and the implementation of a <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> can reduce the pollutant concentration on the footpaths. The percentage difference in concentrations induced by the presence of footpath LBWs ranged from an increase of up to 19 % to a reduction of 30 % on the leeward footpath, with reductions between 26 % and 50 % on the windward footpath with varying H 1 /H 2 ratios. Comparing the results to a central LBW configuration identified the creation of two distinct vortices in the street canyon. The results also identified the effect of wind speed on the development of primary vortices. For urban planners, <b>passive</b> <b>controls</b> offer a method of increasing dispersion by modifying normal air flow patterns and potentially improve air quality in urban street canyons...|$|R

Finally, the effectiveness of PCT in reducing the seismic response of process plant components is proved by three representative case studies: a base isolated above-ground storage tank, a distillation column connected by elastoplastic dampers to the adjacent service frame and an application of non-conventional Tuned Mass Dampers to a support frame.
