5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E

According to WHO, malaria killed 627000 people in 2012, majority of them sub-Saharan African children under the age of 5.

40|$|Abstract. Malaria is a {{parasitic}} {{infectious disease}} {{caused by the}} Plasmodium species, seen especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Generally, the <b>Plasmodium</b> (P.) <b>vivax</b> species is seen within Turkey. However, the P. falciparum and P. malariae species may also be seen in patients {{with a history of}} travel abroad. Cases have been detected in the city of Van, and the patients were found to be individuals who had worked abroad. As this disease is not very common within Turkey, three patients diagnosed with malaria, who had formerly traveled to different countries of Africa for work but who normally live in Van, are presented in this study.

40|$|Malaria parasites, Plasmodium can infect a {{wide range}} of hosts {{including}} humans and rodents. There are two copies of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in Plasmodium, namely MAPK 1 and MAPK 2. The MAPKs have been studied extensively in the human Plasmodium, P. falciparum. However, the MAPKs from other Plasmodium species have not been characterized and it is therefore the premise of presented study to characterize the MAPKs from other <b>Plasmodium</b> species-P. <b>vivax,</b> P. knowlesi, P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelli using a series of publicly available bioinformatic tools.

Overall it accounts for 65% of malaria cases in Asia and South America. It is logical that <b>plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> is found there where humans and mosquito population are high. It is uncommon in cooler areas.|$|E
25|$|The Duffy antigen is {{a protein}} {{located on the}} surface of red blood cells, encoded by the FY (DARC) gene. The protein encoded by this gene is a {{non-specific}} receptor for several chemokines, and is the known entry-point for the human malarial parasites <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> and Plasmodium knowlesi.

25|$|<b>Plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> is a protozoal {{parasite}} and a human pathogen.

It is less virulent than Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of the five, but vivax malaria can lead to severe disease and death due to splenomegaly (a pathologically enlarged spleen). P. vivax is carried by the female Anopheles mosquito, since it is only the female of the species that bites.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} climate change on disease {{patterns}} is controversial. However, global burden of disease studies suggest that infectious diseases will contribute a proportionately smaller burden of disease over the next 2 decades as non-communicable diseases emerge as public health problems. However, infectious diseases contribute proportionately more in the poorest quintile of the population. Notwithstanding the different views {{of the impact of}} global warming on vector-borne infections this paper reviews the conditions which drive the changing epidemiology of these infections and suggests that such change is linked by common themes including interactions of generalist vectors and reservoir hosts at interfaces with humans, reduced biodiversity associated with anthropogenic environmental changes, increases in <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum:P. <b>vivax</b> ratios and well-described land use changes such as hydrological, urbanization, agricultural, mining and forest-associated impacts (extractive activities, road building, deforestation and migration) which are seen on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{remains an}} {{overwhelming}} {{problem in the}} tropical developing countries, with 300 to 500 million new cases and about a million deaths per year (Mishra et al., 2003).

However, clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy (such as liver flaps) are never seen unless there is presence of concomitant viral hepatitis (WHO, 2000). Our case is a 6 -year-old female child presented with fever, jaundice, and anasarca. Peripheral smear showed trophozoites and schizonts of <b>Plasmodium</b> (P.) <b>vivax</b> and trophozoites and gametocytes of P. falciparum. Viral markers for hepatitis were negative.

Prevalence of malaria was conducted from December 1995 to November, 1996 in human population of distract Karak (NWFP). The analysis showed that the overall incidence was higher (11. 81 %) among the population which reared cattle than among those which did not (6. 53 %). The overall incidence of the disease was higher in autumn in cattle keeping population. However, comparison of prevalence of both species of <b>Plasmodium</b> (P. <b>vivax</b> & P. falciparum) revealed {{a positive correlation between}} parasite rates and the proportion of families owing cattle. This finding supports the prediction of the Sota-Mogi theoretical model that domestic animals can enhance rather than reduce malaria transmission when vectors are zoophilic.

25|$|Two {{variants}} (G6PD A− and G6PD Mediterranean) are {{the most}} common in human populations. G6PD A− has an occurrence of 10% of Africans and African-Americans while G6PD Mediterranean is prevalent in the Middle East. The known distribution of the mutated allele is largely limited to people of Mediterranean origins (Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, Armenians, Sephardi Jews and other Semitic peoples). Both variants are believed to stem from a strongly protective effect against Plasmodium falciparum and <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> malaria. It is particularly frequent in the Kurdish population, wherein approximately 1 in 2 males have the condition and the same rate of females are carriers. It is also common in African American, Saudi Arabian, Sardinian males, some African populations, and Asian groups.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium {{was first}} {{identified}} when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran described parasites {{in the blood}} of malaria patients in 1880. He named the parasite Oscillaria malariae. The fact that several species may be involved in causing different forms of malaria was first recognized by Camillo Golgi in 1886. Soon thereafter, Giovanni Batista Grassi and Raimondo Filetti named the parasites causing two different types of human malaria <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> and Plasmodium malariae. In 1897, William Welch identified and named Plasmodium falciparum. This was followed by the recognition of the other two species of Plasmodium which infect humans: Plasmodium ovale (1922) and Plasmodium knowlesi (identified in long-tailed macaques in 1931; in humans in 1965). The contribution of insect hosts to the Plasmodium life cycle was described in 1897 by Ronald Ross and in 1899 by Giovanni Batista Grassi, Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in tropical countries, but is absent or rare in a large region in West and Central Africa, as recently confirmed by PCR species typing. This gap in distribution {{has been attributed to}} the lack of expression of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) on the red cells of many sub-Saharan Africans. Duffy negative individuals are homozygous for a DARC allele, carrying a single nucleotide mutation (DARC 46 T → C), which impairs promoter activity by disrupting a binding site for the hGATA1 erythroid lineage transcription factor. In widely cited in vitro and in vivo studies, Miller et al. reported that the Duffy blood group is the receptor for P. vivax and that the absence of the Duffy blood group on red cells is the resistance factor to P. vivax in persons of African descent. This has become a well-known example of innate resistance to an infectious agent because of the absence of a receptor for the agent on target cells.|$|E
40|$|<b>Plasmodium</b> (P.) <b>vivax</b> is the {{prevalent}} malarial species accounting for 70 % of malaria cases in Pakistan. However, baseline epidemiological data on P. vivax population structure and drug resistance are lacking from Pakistan. For population structure studies, molecular genetic markers, circumsporozoite protein (csp) and merozoite surface protein- 1 (msp- 1) are considered useful as these {{play an important}} role in P. vivax survival under immune and environmental pressure. Furthermore, these genes have also been identified as suitable candidates for vaccine development. While efforts for effective vaccine are underway, anti-malarial agents remain the mainstay for control. Evidence of resistance against commonly used anti-malarial agents, particularly Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) is threatening to make this form of control defunct. Therefore, studies on drug resistance are necessary so that anti-malarial treatment strategies can be structured and implemented accordingly by the Malaria Control Program, Pakistan. This review aims to provide information on genetic markers of P. vivax population structure and drug resistance and comment on their usefulness in molecular surveillance and control...|$|R

In 1886 Golgi described the morphological differences that are still used to distinguish two malaria parasite species <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>vivax</b> and Plasmodium malariae. Shortly after this Sakharov in 1889 and Marchiafava & Celli in 1890 independently identified Plasmodium falciparum as a species distinct from P. vivax and P. malariae. In 1890, Grassi and Feletti reviewed the available information and named both P. malariae and P. vivax (although within the genus Haemamoeba.) By 1890, Laveran's germ was generally accepted, but most of his initial ideas had been discarded {{in favor of the}} taxonomic work and clinical pathology of the Italian school. Marchiafava and Celli called the new microorganism Plasmodium.

A key feature of the method is the ability to enhance gene predictions by finding the best alignment between two syntenic sequences, while at the same time finding biologically meaningful alignments that preserve the correspondence between coding exons. Our probabilistic framework is the generalized pair hidden Markov model, a hybrid of (1) generalized hidden Markov models, which have been used previously for gene finding, and (2) pair hidden Markov models, which have applications to sequence alignment. We have built a gene finding and alignment program called SLAM, which aligns and identifies complete exon/intron structures of genes in two related but unannotated sequences of DNA. SLAM is able to reliably predict gene structures for any suitably related pair of organisms, most notably with fewer false-positive predictions compared to previous methods (examples are provided for Homo sapiens/Mus musculus and <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum/Plasmodium <b>vivax</b> comparisons).
