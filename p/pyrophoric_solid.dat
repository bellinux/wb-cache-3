50|$|<b>Pyrophoric</b> <b>solids</b> {{require the}} use of a sealed glove box flushed with inert gas. Glove boxes are {{expensive}} and require maintenance. Thus, many <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>solids</b> are sold as solutions, or dispersions in mineral oil or lighter hydrocarbon solvents. Mildly <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>solids</b> (such as lithium tetrahydridoaluminate (lithium aluminium hydride) and sodium hydride) can be handled in the air for brief periods of time, but the containers must be flushed with inert gas before storage.|$|R

40|$|The {{activation}} of the carbon-oxygen bonds in ethers and the carbon-hydrogen bonds in alkanes is accomplished by reaction at cryogenic temperatures with metal atoms. Calcium, strontium, and barium react with dimethyl ether to produce yellow-orange <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>solids.</b> Hydrolysis of these solids yields hydrocarbon products and the metal hydroxide. The cocondensation reactions of transition metals with dimethyl ether are also investigated. Chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel react to give hydrocarbons upon hydrolysis but copper and zinc fail to react. The photolytic insertions of metal atoms into the carbon-hydrogen bonds of methane are studied using infrared matrix isolation spectoscopy. The initial product is a methyl-metal hydride. The reaction takes place for the metals: manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, silver, gold, and zinc. No reaction was observed for calcium, titanium, chromium, or nickel...|$|R

Similar to lithium aluminium hydride, it is a salt consisting of separated sodium cations and tetrahedral AlH anions.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium triethylborohydride is an {{organoboron}} compound {{with the}} formula NaBH(C2H5)3. It is a colorless, <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>solid</b> that is commercially available in toluene solution, unlike the related LiBH(C2H5)3 which is typically {{sold as a}} THF solution. It is commonly used for the reductive activation of homogeneous catalysts, converting metal halides to hydrides. Sodium triethylborohydride has been prepared by treating a hot toluene slurry of sodium hydride with triethylborane.

25|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>pyrophoric</b> {{payloads}} {{are based}} on iron platelets coated with a porous aluminium layer. Based on the very high specific surface area of aluminium those platelets instantaneously oxidize upon contact with air. In contrast to triethylaluminium combustion, those platelets yield a temperature-dependent signature.|$|R
5000|$|A {{flammable}} solid {{is one that}} is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into • {{flammable solid}}s, • polymerizing substances and • self-reactive substances, i.e., thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing.Spontaneously combusting <b>solids</b> or <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>solids</b> are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.|$|R

40|$|Two new anionic, dimeric chromium(II) alkoxides, (PhO) 10 Cr 2 Li 6 (THF) 6 (3) and (2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3 O) 6 Cr 2 Li 2 (THF) 4 (4), {{have been}} {{prepared}} and characterized by X-ray structure determination. The two complexes possess similar Cr 2 (OR) 2 cores with a fairly long Cr-Cr distance [Cr [...] . Cr' = 3. 149 (2) and 3. 091 (1) angstrom for 3 and 4, respectively]. In complex 3, the unit Cr 2 (OPh) 2 is incorporated into two separated (PhO) 4 Li 3 (THF) 3 polyhedra, while in complex 4 the same core is attached to two (RO) Li(THF) 2 units with an overall linear arrangement of the Li-Cr-Cr-Li backbone. Replacement with TMEDA of the four THF molecules attached to lithium cleaved the dimeric structure of 3 and 4, forming the monomeric (RO) 4 CrLi 2 (TMEDA) 2 [R = Ph (5 a), 2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3 O (5 b) ]. Reaction of CrCl 2 (THF) 2 with 2 equiv of GuONa [GuO = (omicron-CH 3 O) C 6 H 4 O] {{led to the formation}} of the polymer [(GuO) 2 Cr]n, as an insoluble, <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>solid.</b> Further reaction with an excess of (GuO) Na formed the trinuclear (GuO) 14 Cr 3 Na 9 Cl (6). Treatment of 6 with 18 -crown- 6 led to the disruption of the trinuclear arrangement and formation of the polymeric [(GuO) 2 Cr]n species.

40|$|Pyrophoric {{reagents}} {{represent an}} important class of reactants {{because they can}} participate in {{many different types of}} reactions. They are very useful in organic synthesis and in industrial applications. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) define Pyrophorics as substances that will self-ignite in air at temperatures of 130 F (54. 4 C) or less. However, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) uses criteria different from the auto-ignition temperature criterion. The DOT defines a pyrophoric material as a liquid or solid that, even in small quantities and without an external ignition source, can ignite within five minutes after coming in contact with air when tested according to the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. The Environmental Protection Agency has adopted the DOT definition. Regardless of which definition is used, oxidation of the pyrophoric reagents by oxygen or exothermic reactions with moisture in the air (resulting in the generation of a flammable gas such as hydrogen) is so rapid that ignition occurs spontaneously. Due to the inherent nature of pyrophoric substances to ignite spontaneously upon exposure to air, special precautions must be taken to ensure their safe handling and use. Pyrophoric gases (such as diborane, dichloroborane, phosphine, etc.) are typically the easiest class of pyrophoric substances to handle since the gas can be plumbed directly to the application and used remotely. <b>Pyrophoric</b> <b>solids</b> and liquids, however, require the user to physically manipulate them when transferring them from one container to another. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could result in serious injury or unintended consequences to laboratory personnel. Because of this danger, pyrophorics should be handled only by experienced personnel. Users with limited experience must be trained on how to handle pyrophoric reagents and consult with a knowledgeable staff member prior to performing the experimental task. The {{purpose of this article is}} three fold: (1) to provide guidelines and general safety precautions to avoid accidents, (2) describe proper techniques on how to successfully handle, store, and dispose of <b>pyrophoric</b> liquids and <b>solids,</b> and (3) illustrate best practices for working with this class of reactants in a laboratory environment...|$|R
