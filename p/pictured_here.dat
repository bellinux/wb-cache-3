The Roman toilets were probably elevated to raise them above open sewers which were periodically [...] "flushed" [...] with flowing water, rather than elevated for sitting. Romans and Greeks also used chamber pots, which they brought to meals and drinking sessions. Johan J.

The urine was then collected by fullers." [...] (Fulling was a vital step in Textile manufacture.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Edward J. O’Donnell, S.J., before {{becoming}} president of Marquette University, led discussion classes at St. John’s College night school from 1945-1948, based on Pope Pius XI’s social encyclical Quadragesimo anno (1931). Class members included future political and People's United Party leaders George Cadle Price, Philip Goldson, Herman Jex, John Albert Smith, Leigh Richardson, and Nick Pollard Sr. Price, {{popularly known as}} the [...] "Father of the Nation," [...] led Belize through its independence movement, holding the top office {{in the country for}} a cumulative 27 years. Price’s authorized biographer observes that Price had great respect for the Jesuits, and his policies based on social justice are easily traced to Quadragesimo anno.

2500|$|The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV (1622–25), Rubens {{depicts the}} proxy {{marriage}} ceremony of the Florentine princess Marie de' Medici to the King of France, [...] Henry IV [...] {{which took place}} in the cathedral of Florence on October 5, 1600. Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini presides over the ritual. As was often the case with royal weddings, the bride's uncle, the Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany stood in the King's place and is <b>pictured</b> <b>here</b> slipping a ring on his niece's finger. All the surrounding figures are identifiable, including the artist himself. Although he was present at the actual event twenty years earlier, {{as a member of the}} Gonzaga household during his travels in Italy, Rubens appears youthful and stands behind the bride, holding a cross and gazing out at the viewer. It is highly unlikely that Rubens actually had such a pronounced presence in this scene when it took place. Those who attended the ceremony for Marie include Grand Duchess Cristina of Tuscany and Marie's sister Eleonora, Duchess of Mantua; and in entourage of Grand Duke are Roger de Bellegarde, Grand Esquire of France, and the Marquis de Sillery, who negotiated the marriage. As in other scenes in the Medici Cycle, Rubens includes a mythological element: the ancient god of marriage, Hymenaios [...] wearing a crown of roses, carries the bride's train in one hand and the nuptial torch in the other. The scene takes place below a marble statue, which depicts God the Father mourning over the dead body of Christ, alluding to the Pieta sculpture by Baccio Bandinelli (1493–1560).|$|E
