50|$|In other words, {{conventional}} {{roller chain}} drives suffer {{the potential for}} vibration, as the effective radius of action in a chain and sprocket combination constantly changes during revolution ("Chordal action"). If the chain moves at constant speed, then the shafts must accelerate and decelerate constantly. If one sprocket rotates at a constant speed, then the chain (and probably all other sprockets that it drives) must accelerate and decelerate constantly. This is usually not an issue with many drive systems; however, most motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to virtually eliminate this vibration issue. Toothed belt drives are designed to avoid this issue by operating at a constant <b>pitch</b> <b>radius.</b>|$|E

A proposed minimum-dynamic-margin constraint is shown to agree with the short-period-frequency requirements used in recent military specifications to an accuracy of about 2 %.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the development of current-driven (CD) kink instability through three-dimensional relativistic MHD simulations. A static force-free equilibrium helical magnetic configuration is considered in order to study {{the influence of the}} initial configuration on the linear and nonlinear evolution of the instability. We found that the initial configuration is strongly distorted but not disrupted by the kink instability. The instability develops as predicted by linear theory. In the non-linear regime the kink amplitude continues to increase up to the terminal simulation time, albeit at different rates, for all but one simulation. The growth rate and nonlinear evolution of the CD kink instability depends moderately on the density profile and strongly on the magnetic pitch profile. The growth rate of the kink mode is reduced in the linear regime by an increase in the magnetic <b>pitch</b> with <b>radius</b> and the non-linear regime is reached at a later time than for constant helical pitch.

For the odd-mode radiation, a canonical problem is then constructed and analytically solved by applying image theory. Based on that, a systematic approach to achieve the optimum suppression design is developed for the various geometry parameters of the shorting vias, including the <b>pitch,</b> <b>radius,</b> and distance to the board edge.

40|$|Design {{guidelines}} {{have been}} established to prevent catastrophic rim fracture failure modes when considering gear tooth bending fatigue. Analysis was performed using the finite element method with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted {{for a variety of}} gear tooth and rim configurations. The effects of rim and web thicknesses, initial crack locations, and gear tooth geometry factors such as diametral pitch, number of teeth, <b>pitch</b> <b>radius,</b> and tooth pressure angle were considered. Design maps of tooth/rim fracture modes including effects of gear geometry, applied load, crack size, and material properties were developed. The occurrence of rim fractures significantly increased as the backup ratio (rim thickness divided by tooth height) decreased. The occurrence of rim fractures also increased as the initial crack location was moved down the root of the tooth. Increased rim and web compliance increased the occurrence of rim fractures. For gears with constant pitch radii, coarser-pitch teeth increased the occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures. Also, 25 deg pressure angle teeth had an increased occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures when compared to 20 deg pressure angle teeth.

40|$|Dynamic {{stability}} {{requirements for}} manned aircraft {{have been in}} place for many years. However, we cannot expect stability constraints for UAVs to match those for manned aircraft; and dynamic stability requirements specific to UAVs have not been developed. The boundaries of controllability for both remotely-piloted and auto-piloted aircraft must be established before UAV technology can reach its full potential. The development of dynamic stability requirements specific to UAVs could improve flying qualities and facilitate more efficient UAV designs to meet specific mission requirements. As a first step to developing UAV stability requirements in general, test techniques must be established that will allow the stability characteristics of current UAVs to be quantified.

The procedures require determining only the maneuver margin and <b>pitch</b> <b>radius</b> of gyration and are simple enough to be used in an educational setting where resources are limited.

The study was limited to equal and opposite offset val-ues applied to the pinion and gear to maintain the stan-dard operating center distance. The analysis presented in this paper was performed using {{a new version of the}} NASA gear dynamics code DANST. The operating speed of the transmission has a signifi-cant influence on the amount of hob offset required to equalize the dynamic stresses in the pinion and gear. In the transmission studied, at low speeds, the optimum hob offset value was found to fluctuate. At higher speeds, the optimum value was constrained by the minimum allowed thickness at the tip of the pinion tooth. For gears that must operate over a range of speeds, an average offset value may be used. Spur gears designed with the proce-dure presented here can have significant improvements in load capacity.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the mooring system on the dynamic response of a point-absorber type ocean-wave energy converter (WEC) is investigated using a frequency-domain approach. In order {{to ensure the safety}} of WECs, careful consideration of the response and resonance frequencies in all motions must be evaluated, including the effects of the mooring system. In this study, a WEC floater with a closed, flat bottom is modeled as a rigid vertical cylinder tethered by elastic mooring lines. The WEC hydrodynamic added mass and damping are obtained using established potential-flow methods, with additional damping provided by the energy-extraction system. The results show that the response of the WEC, and the corresponding power takeoff, varies with the diameter-to-draft (D=T) ratio, mooring system stiffness, and mass distribution. For a given wave climate in Northern California, near San Francisco, the heave energy extraction is found to be best for a shallow WEC with a soft mooring system, compared to other systems that were examined. This result assumes a physical limit (cap) on the motion which is related to the significant wave height to draft ratio. Shallow draft designs, however, may experience excessive pitch motions and relatively larger viscous damping. In order to mitigate the pitch response, the <b>pitch</b> <b>radius</b> of gyration should be small and the center of mass should be low. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|E
