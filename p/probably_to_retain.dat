40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow {{measurements}} in {{the collateral}} arteries {{of patients with}} internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions may be important to estimate the risk of future stroke. Quantitative flow measurements in cerebropetal vessels can be reliably assessed by means of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). METHODS: Fifty-four patients with transient or minor ischemic neurological deficits and an angiographically proven ICA occlusion and 16 control subjects underwent two-dimensional phase-contrast MRA quantitative flow measurements through the common carotid arteries, basilar artery, ICAs, and middle cerebral arteries (MCA). RESULTS: Patients with a unilateral ICA occlusion and a 0 % to 69 % stenosis of the contralateral ICA had increased flow in the contralateral ICA (P <. 005) and in the basilar artery (P <. 005) compared with control subjects. Even patients with a 70 % to 99 % stenosis contralateral to the ICA occlusion had increased flow in the ICA (P <. 05) as well as increased flow in the basilar artery (P <. 001). Total cerebropetal flow was not significantly different between these patients and control subjects. Patients with bilateral ICA occlusions had an increased flow in the basilar artery (P <. 001), while the total cerebropetal flow was less than in control subjects (P <. 001). In all patients, flow was decreased in the ipsilateral MCA (P <. 001) and in the contralateral MCA (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The contralateral ICA is the main supplying artery in patients with an ICA occlusion. Total cerebropetal flow decreases only when both ICAs are occluded. In patients with symptomatic ICA occlusions, an open contralateral ICA is <b>probably</b> important <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> the cerebral blood flow within normal limits...|$|R
40|$|Most {{measurements}} for beef improvement in South Africa are per individual (weaning weight, calving interval, growth rate, etc.). A measurement that expresses performance per constant unit, e. g. kilogram calf weaned per Large Stock Unit (LSU) can eventually be translated to kilogram calf produced per kg CO 2 equivalent. A LSU {{is defined as}} a bovine requiring 75 MJ Metabolisable Energy (ME) per day. If more kilogram weaner calf can be produced per LSU (KgC/LSU), the carbon footprint of beef can be reduced. This study used breed average values to investigate the KgC/LSU for the 30 beef and dual purpose breeds in South Africa. The breeds were categorized in the following breed types: Sanga (indigenous to South Africa) Sanga derived, Zebu, Zebu derived, British and European. No relationship was found between cow weights and KgC/LSU, indicating that it is independent of cow weight between breeds. However, when the data is summarized into breed types, the Sanga and European breed types produce the least KgC/ LSU and Sanga derived breed types the most. This high value of the Sanga derived breeds is <b>probably</b> due <b>to</b> <b>retained</b> heterosis. Composite breeds are mostly intermediate to parental breeds for individual traits but superior for composite traits and KgC/LSU is a composite trait. These calculations were only done on breed averages. A genetic analysis on a breed level to estimate genetic parameters for this trait, and its genetic correlations with other traits now needs to be done before a decision can be taken whether selection for KgC/LSU will be feasible. The ultimate aim with a trait like this is to reduce the carbon footprint of weaner calf production since more kilogram calf will be produced per LSU (constant feed unit). </p...|$|R

This joint inflammation subsides after 2 weeks {{but it could}} be reactivated by systemic {{injection of}} SCW in a dose-dependent way. The primary arthritis as well as the flare-up reaction were more vehement in immunized than naive mice. Pretreatment with antilymphocyte serum of nonimmunized arthritic mice before systemic challenge completely inhibits the flare-up reaction, suggesting the involvement of lymphocytes in the reactivation. Dose-response studies showed that intravenous challenge with SCW amounts too small to induce a primary arthritis were able to reactivate a chronic arthritis, implying that an inflamed joint is in a hyperreactive state, <b>probably</b> due <b>to</b> locally <b>retained</b> lymphocytes. Arthritis as a result of injection with SCW can be reactivated by fragments of a nonrelated, gram negative endogenous bacterium, Escherichia coli.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a reliable method for initial storage and cryoprotectant treatment of liver cells that could be employed prior to the cryopreservation. Two bathing solutions were assessed for initial storage at 4 °C or 6 °C over a 48 hour storage period in chilling sensitivity studies. Medium C (lml L~ 15 supplemented with Hepes (5. 958 g 1 L), NaHC 03 (0. 42 g/L), Gentamycine (lOOmglL), Amphotericine B (2. 5 mgIL), Lglutamine (0. 374 g/L) and Fetal bovine serum (10 %)) and PBS were used as bathing solutions of the cells stored at 4 °C or 6 °C for up to 48 hours. Fluorescein diacetate propidium iodide staining was used to assess the viability after 12, 24 and 48 hours of storage. Four cryoprotectants (CPAs) were investigated at different concentrations-DMSO (lM), MeOH (2 M, 3 M and 4 M), PG (lM) and sucrose (0. 05 M and O. IM) and used to treat the cells for up to 30 minutes. Viability assessment was done using Trypan blue and Fluorescein diacetate - propidium iodide staining after 10, 20 or 30 minute exposure to CP As. Fresh and stored liver cells were frozen using slow cooling methods based on existing LIRANS procedures for cryopreservation of zebrafish blastomeres. The results indicated that exposure to 4 ·C PBS for 12, hours was an optimal condition for storage of liver cell prior to cryopreservation. In addition, results showed that cryopreservation at a slow freezing rate following 10 minute treatment of 2 M methanol, allowed the recovery of more than 50 % of the zebrafish liver cells...|$|R

This has necessitated the conversion of a post-graduate subject, already offered in a distance delivery format (primarily print-based), to one which will also take advantage of the opportunities offered through SBS (Special Broadcasting Services). The problem of 'conversion' of existing educational materials to another format is not unique to our situation (Aiton, 1994), but seems to have been given little attention by educational planners.

A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200children. By 1789, the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the Arkwrights, who actively influenced its structure and construction. Cromford was given a market place to act as a new focus for the village. Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend, gave annual prizes to those who attended most often. After Arkwright died in 1792 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath.

The family's attempts to make Cromford self-sustaining through establishing a market was successful, and the village expanded until about 1840.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to {{investigate}} the front-line delivery of veterinary services, and to assess the availability of manpower and the priority requirements for services in the future. The consultancy mission fielded by the project visited many farms and smallholdings, research institutes, universities and training centres, as well as all of the veterinary investigation centres; it also carried out a survey, in conjunction with the Tanzanian Veterinary Association, of the veterinary graduates working in the countryThe State Veterinary Service (SVS) would <b>probably</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> the main responsibility for the animal health delivery system, as {{the overwhelming majority of the}} cattle in Tanzania were owned by traditional farmers whose ability to pay for veterinary services was limited. The number of veterinary graduates should be adequate to meet the anticipated future needs. However, the SVS was unable to provide an adequate standard of animal health delivery service to farmers because of a lack of mobility and a shortage of equipment and drugs. It was essential, therefore, that adequate provision be made within the recurrent budget for transport costs and the purchase of equipment, drugs and all of the necessary suppliesSince the Government's budget was strictly limited, consideration needed to be given to increasing cost sharing and cost recovery for veterinary services. The project found that farmers were highly appreciative of veterinary services, and that those involved in commercial production were increasingly willing to pay for them. Consequently, a pilot scheme was proposed to encourage independent veterinarians to offer clinical services to dairy farmers in the Arusha/Kilimanjaro area: it was recommended that the loan capital required be provided on an individual basis by one of the credit banks. The project identified a number of options for recovering costs; it was recommended that the Government give serious consideration to introducing higher charges to farmers for certain services rendered, and to increasing the prices of drugs and vaccines. It was also recommended that steps be taken to improve the systems for the procurement, storage and distribution of drugs and vaccinesOn the basis of this preparatory review of the animal health delivery system, it was recommended that the Government consider the formulation and implementation of a clearly defined policy for the rehabilitation of animal health delivery services for both the commercial and traditional livestock sectors.
