500|$|For {{equitable}} tracing to be valid, {{several things}} must be demonstrated. First, the equitable title must exist; {{it can be}} brought into existence by the courts, such as in Constructive trusts. Secondly, {{there must be some}} kind of fiduciary relationship between the claimant and the defendant. If the property was transferred through breach of trust, it will not be necessary to establish such a relationship, because it already exists. In addition, property transferred through breach of trust may be traced to any third party (other than a <b>purchaser</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith),</b> even if they did not previously have a fiduciary relationship with the claimant. Historically, the courts have been willing to be [...] "generous in finding that the necessary fiduciary relationship existed", even {{going so far as to}} recognise relationships that did not exist at the time of the transfer.|$|E
50|$|Under a race/notice statute, a {{subsequent}} {{purchaser for value}} wins if (1) {{at the time of}} conveyance, that subsequent purchaser had no actual or constructive notice of the prior conveyance, and (2) the subsequent purchaser records before the prior purchaser. In short, {{a subsequent}} <b>purchaser</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> wins only if he records before the prior purchaser does. In this type of system, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land only if he was not aware of the prior sale to Al, and if Bob actually records his interest before Al does. In the hybrid race/notice statute, all grantees have a strong incentive to record early, thereby making the land records complete.|$|E

40|$|Copyright Â© Cambridge Law Journal and Contributors 2014. This article {{evaluates the}} {{established}} judicial proposition that {{an agreement to}} negotiate <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is antithetical {{to the principles of}} the common law. English courts are reluctant to enforce such agreements on the ground that they constitute unenforceable agreements to agree. Recently, courts have started to recognise an exception in cases where parties agree to negotiate over a term mandated by an existing agreement, such as to review a price clause or resolve a dispute by undertaking negotiations <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> The primary arguments against enforcing an independent agreement to negotiate <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> are threefold. First, parties engaged <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> negotiations are assumed to lack a serious legal intention to contract. Second, such an agreement is substantively uncertain in nature and does not promise to produce a contract. Third, the failure of parties to conclude their negotiations does not lead to an easily identifiable loss. In light of these considerations, this article considers the viability of enforcing an agreement to negotiate <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the absence of a pre-existing contract. It argues that the legal obstacles to recognising agreements to negotiate have been overstated. Given the commercial value of enforcing such agreements, it proposes that agreements to negotiate <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> should be recognised and given legal content by common law courts...|$|R
