30|$|The present work {{examined}} the effects of moisture content, piston speed, die length, and particle size on the density of biomass pellets. In this research, artificial neural network was used for modeling the effect of independent variables on the density of the pellet and results compared with results of RSM method. The results indicate that a properly trained neural network can be used to predict effect of input variable on pellet density. The ANN model was found to have higher predictive capability than the RSM model. Statistical analyses confirmed that the moisture content, speed of piston, and particle size significantly affected the pellet density while the influence of die length was negligible. The result of present research can be useful for designing and constructing a suitable <b>pelleting</b> <b>machine</b> for producing biomass pellets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} carry out the design of a <b>pelleting</b> <b>machine</b> with a {{capacity}} of 900 kg per hour for the Company X. Apparently the boilers at the plant are using wood chips, a by-product from the milling operations as their source of fuel but off late the plant has been experiencing a serious fuel shortage. The fuel crisis emanated from low plant availability caused by old and dilapidated machinery. Major breakdowns that brings the plant to a halt for long hours are abrupt and rampant and during that time no wood chips are produced resulting in a fuel shortage. Following this fuel shortage the boiler operators have resorted to rationing the fuel input into the boiler as it has to run continuously regardless of whether the plant is moving or not. This rationing has resulted in poor boiler performance and low efficiency which has in turn affected the timber drying kilns. The boilers are producing poor quality steam which has had the effect of doubling the timber drying cycles. As a result of doubled timber drying cycles half of the timber produced is sold as wet off sawn at a relatively low price which is a loss to the company. The management and the engineering team in a bid to do away with this problem proposed the use of sawdust as additional boiler fuel. After a consideration of the type of boiler fire grates at the plant it was found that raw sawdust cannot be used as it has a tendency of choking the grates blowing out combustion so it has to be pelletized. With this problem at hand this project zeroed in at the design and development of a <b>pelleting</b> <b>machine</b> that will specifically meet the pellets need at the wattle company. Literature review was done on several types of pelleting machines’ operating mechanisms and from this literature three possible concepts were generated. These concepts were evaluated and the best was chosen and developed into a finished design ready for fabrication with all working drawings available for each component. The machine was designed with a constraint budget of USD $ 10 000 and it will provide a backup and additional boiler fuel to the already being used wood chips...|$|E

30|$|Pellet {{manufacturing}} is {{an energy}} intensive process. Inside the <b>pelleting</b> <b>machine,</b> the pressure between the roller and the dye, forcing {{the raw material}} through the perforations, causes frictional heating (Battacharya et al. 1989). Tumuluru et al. (2011), reviewed that power consumption of commercial pellet mills falls {{within the range of}} 48.9 – 130.7  kJ t− 1 the 37 – 40  % of which is required to compress the material while the remaining energy is required to overcome friction during compression (Tumuluru et al. 2011). With reference to pellet specific energy consumption, Tabil and Sokhansanj (1996) assessed ranges of 19 – 90  kJ kg− 1 partly confirmed by Tumuluru et al. (2011), who reviewed specific energy consumption ranging 59 – 268.2  kJ t− 1 for pellet mills. At a given densification system, moisture content and other biomass properties (e.g. particle size distribution, biochemical composition) can significantly affect the specific energy requirements of the process (Nielsen et al. 2009; Tumuluru et al. 2011; Gadernejad et al. 2012): anyway, the high energy input required makes it uneconomical and not practical for farmers to directly purchase and operate a pellet mill. Commonly, pellet distribution is carried out with rotating spreaders, designed for granular formulations, whose performance and hence evenness of spread pattern depends both on machine engineering (Hofstee 1994, 1995; Kweon and Grift 2006; Parish 2006) and on fertilizer physical properties (Hofstee and Huisman 1990; Aphale et al. 2003; Grift et al. 2006; Suppadit and Panomsri 2010), which are also important to calculate the volume needed to store, transport, handle and calibrate fertilizer spreaders (Agnew and Leonard 2003; Campbell et al. 2010).|$|E

Analysis of moisture of raw materials and their calorific value were carried out according to binding norms. Moisture of compacted raw materials was within 10. 1 - 13. 3 %, where-as the calorific value was from 16. 1 to 17. 9 MJ. kg- 1. Pellets were produced in a <b>pelleting</b> <b>machine</b> with an immobile flat matrix and driven compressing rolls, whereas briquettes were produced in a screw briquetting machine with a heated compressing chamber. The following values of temperature of the compressing chamber of a briquetting machine were assumed: 200, 225 and 250 ºC. For meas-urement of energy consumption of the raw materials compression process power, time and electric energy converter Lumel 3000 was used.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that affect}} the quality of wooden fuel pellets, from raw {{materials}} to pellet production process. Among the factors, raw materials compositions, mechanical durability, moisture contents, and particle size distribution were studied. Experimental raw materials of different percent weights were introduced to industrial fuel pellet production, micro-chips in part- 1 experiment and peat in part- 2 experiment. Pellets made from these experimental raw material mixtures were tested for their mechanical strength (also known as durability) according to Swedish standards SS 187180 in Part 1 experiment, and European Technical Specification CEN/TS 15210 - 1 in Part 2 Experiment. Moisture contents of these pellets were also determined. In part- 1 experiment, particle size distributions of raw materials and final micro- chips pellets were analyzed. Mapping of pellet production process, bio-energy combine power and heating plant integrated with pellet production were illustrated along with descriptions on major processes. Selected process parameters (i. e. feed rate, drying temperature, milling temperature, <b>pellet</b> <b>machine</b> temperature) for Part 2 experiment were extracted from an industrial program, PGIM signal explorer, and combine with experiment results, thereafter analyzed with statistical methods and by use of SIMCA-P program. The results show that more fresh chips in raw material mixtures give better mechanical strength for micro-chips pellets. For pellets with 80 % fresh chips and 20 % mature chips in raw materials composition, high durability came from low drying temperature and low feed rate. For peat pellets with 20 % peat and 80 % fresh chips in raw materials composition, high durability came from high drying temperature, high feed rate, relatively higher pellet moisture content and slightly lower <b>pellet</b> <b>machine</b> temperature.

30|$|FTIR (Fourier {{transform}} infrared) spectroscopy is {{a powerful}} tool for the characterization of coal and its products as it signifies the comprehensive view about the structure/composition of the minerals in the coal matrix. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between the matter and electromagnetic field in the IR region. The probability of a particular IR frequency being absorbed depends on the actual interaction between the frequency and the molecule. Planck energy relation is used for calculating the energy of an infrared photon using, E = hν, where h (Planck’s constant)[*]=[*] 6.6 [*]×[*] 10 − 34  Js and ν[*]=[*]frequency of the photon (s− 1). The frequency (ν) and speed of light (c) are related to the relation, c = λν, where c[*]=[*] 3 [*]×[*] 108  m/s and λ[*]=[*]wavelength of the light. The c and E are correlated to a standard spectroscopic unit called wave number (ν̅ cm− 1), it is the reciprocal of the wavelength. E = hc/λ = hcν̅, both frequency and wave number are directly proportional to energy and this indicates higher the energy photons have higher the frequency (Sahoo et al. 2015). The presence of functional group and bonding characteristic of the raw and upgraded coals were determined through FTIR measurements using a Nicolet NEXUS- 670 FTIR instrument. In the presence of baking lamp, approximately 1  mg of ground coal sample was properly mixed with 100  mg of dried KBr powder then it ground and pestle with mortar to avoid moisture absorption.

The goal was to, immediately after producing the briquettes; send them through Aquila's current system to test the ability of the briquettes to flow through the system without requiring any equipment or process changes. (10) Although the above attempt failed, the plant is still interested in producing briquettes. (11) An economic analysis of investing in a production facility manufacturing such briquettes was conducted to determine the economic viability of the project. Such a project is estimated to have an internal rate of return of 14 % and net present value of about $ 400, 000. (12) An engineering independent study class (4 students) is now working on selecting a site near the power plant and determining the layout of the future plant that will produce briquettes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the effect}} of jute fiber’s thermal {{degradation}} on fiber strength and its polymer composite are investigated. First, a tensile strength test of a single jute fiber are conducted. Next, polyethylene and jute fibers were mixed by twin-screw extruder to make pellets. After making <b>pellets,</b> injection molding <b>machine</b> to make the test pieces are used. Tensile tests were conducted using injection molded sample. As a result, in the experiment of the single fibers, tensile strength of jute fiber monotonically decreased with increasing drying temperature. In case of composite, the tensile strength of molded sample increased with increasing control temperature in twin screw extruder in a range between 150 ℃ ~ 220 ℃. When the temperature of twin-screw extruder was controlled above 300 ℃, pellets were burned black by thermal degradation and couldn’t fabricate the test piece...|$|R
40|$|Manufacture of {{precision}} detonators requires the pelletizing of very fine, organic, crystalline explosive powders. Production of <b>pellets</b> in automatic <b>machines</b> within critical dimensional and weight tolerances {{requires that the}} powders pour uniformly into die cavities. The pellets {{must be able to}} be initiated with low energy and have a predictable energy output. Modifications to needle-like crystalline PETN explosive powders to make them pourable were introduced by the application of about 80 A thick polymeric coatings to the individual crystals, followed by a controlled agglomeration into a spherical prill. Microencapsulation techniques provided the key to achieving the result using less than 0. 5 wt. % coating (an order of magnitude less coating than in usual PBX systems). These coatings did not appreciably alter the energy required to initiate and significantly increased the strength of the pellets. A key point demonstrated, which may be translated to other applications, was that powders that exhibit performance based on physical characteristics could have their handling and strength properties tailored with little change in their primary function...|$|R
