These intracellular parasites utilize <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins</b> that disrupt host cell membranes to either traverse host cells while migrating through tissues or egress from the parasite-containing vacuole after replication. This review highlights recent insight gained from the newly available three-dimensional structures of several known or putative apicomplexan <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins</b> that contribute to cell traversal or egress. These new structural advances suggest that parasite <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins</b> use distinct mechanisms to disrupt host cell membranes at multiple steps in parasite life cycles.

Lysenin, a pore-forming toxin from the earthworm Eisenia fetida, specifically interacts with sphingomyelin (SM) and may confer innate immunity against parasites by attacking their membranes to form pores. SM has important roles in cell membranes and lysenin is a popular SM-labeling reagent. The structure of lysenin suggests common ancestry with other <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins</b> from a diverse set of eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

5000|$|The diarrhetic syndromes {{observed}} in patients {{are thought to}} stem from the three toxins: hemolysin BL (Hbl), nonhemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) and cytotoxin K (CytK). The nhe/hbl/cytK genes are located on the chromosome of the bacteria. Transcription of these genes is controlled by PlcR. These genes occur in the taxonomically related B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis, as well. These enterotoxins are all produced in the small intestine of the host, thus thwarting digestion by host endogenous enzymes. The Hbl and Nhe toxins are pore-forming toxins closely related to ClyA of E. coli. The proteins exhibit a conformation known as [...] "beta-barrel" [...] that can insert into cellular membranes due to a hydrophobic exterior, thus creating pores with hydrophilic interiors. The effect is loss of cellular membrane potential and eventually cell death. CytK is a <b>pore-forming</b> <b>protein</b> more related to other hemolysins.|$|E
40|$|In {{the fungus}} Podospora anserina, the [Het-s] prion induces {{programmed}} cell death by activating the HET-S <b>pore-forming</b> <b>protein.</b> The HET-s ß-solenoid prion fold serves as a template for converting the HET-S prion-forming domain into the same fold. This conversion, in turn, activates the HET-S pore-forming domain. The gene immediately adjacent to het-S encodes NWD 2, a Nod-like receptor (NLR) with an N-terminal motif similar to the elementary repeat unit of the ß-solenoid fold. NLRs are immune receptors controlling cell death and host defense processes in animals, plants and fungi. We have proposed that, analogously to [Het-s], NWD 2 can activate the HET-S <b>pore-forming</b> <b>protein</b> by converting its prion-forming region into the ß-solenoid fold. Here, we analyze the ability of NWD 2 to induce formation of the ß-solenoid prion fold. We show that artificial NWD 2 variants induce formation of the [Het-s] prion, specifically in presence of their cognate ligands. The N-terminal motif is responsible for this prion induction, and mutations predicted to affect the ß-solenoid fold abolish templating activity. In vitro, the N-terminal motif assembles into infectious prion amyloids that display a structure resembling the ß-solenoid fold. In vivo, the assembled form of the NWD 2 N-terminal region activates the HET-S <b>pore-forming</b> <b>protein.</b> This study documenting {{the role of the}} ß-solenoid fold in fungal NLR function further highlights the general importance of amyloid and prion-like signaling in immunity-related cell fate pathway...|$|E

40|$|Perfringolysin O (PFO) is {{a member}} of the cholesterol-dependent {{cytolysin}} (CDC) family of bacterial <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins,</b> which are highly efficient in delivering exogenous proteins to the cytoplasm. However, the indiscriminate and potent cytotoxicity of PFO limits its practical use as an intracellular delivery system. In this study, we describe the design and engineering of a bispecific, neutralizing antibody against PFO, which targets reversibly attenuated PFO to endocytic compartments via receptor-mediated internalization. This PFO-based system efficiently mediated the endosomal release of a co-targeted gelonin construct with high specificity and minimal toxicity in vitro. Consequently, the therapeutic window of PFO was improved by more than 5 orders of magnitude. Our results demonstrating that the activity of <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins</b> can be controlled by antibody-mediated neutralization present a novel strategy for utilizing these potent membrane-lytic agents as a safe and effective intracellular delivery vehicle.

40|$|Pore-forming cytolytic {{proteins}} {{distributed in}} a wide variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms have been intensively studied in terms of pathophysiological functions and molecular architecture of transmembrane pores.

However, how exocytosis leads to membrane resealing has remained obscure, particularly for stable lesions caused by <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins.</b> In this study, we show that Ca 2 +-dependent resealing after permeabilization with the bacterial toxin streptolysin O (SLO) requires endocytosis via a novel pathway that removes SLO-containing pores from the {{plasma membrane}}. We also find that endocytosis is similarly required to repair lesions formed in mechanically wounded cells. Inhibition of lesion endocytosis (by sterol depletion) inhibits repair, whereas enhancement of endocytosis through disruption of the actin cytoskeleton facilitates resealing. Thus, endocytosis promotes wound resealing by removing lesions from the plasma membrane. These findings provide an important new insight into how cells protect themselves not only from mechanical injury but also from microbial toxins and <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins</b> produced by the immune system...|$|R

The purified protein has a polypeptide molecular mass of 21 kDa and a pI of 6. 4. Tethya <b>pore-forming</b> <b>protein</b> (also called Tethya hemolysin) rapidly lysed erythrocytes from a variety of organisms. After binding to target membranes, the hemolysin resisted elution with EDTA, salt or solutions of low ionic strength and hence resembled an integral membrane protein. Erythrocytes could be protected from hemolysis induced by Tethya hemolysin by addition of 30 mM dextran 4 (4 - 6 kDa; equivalent hydrodynamic diffusion radius, 1. 75 - 2. 3 nm) to the extracellular medium, but not by addition of uncharged molecules of smaller size [sucrose, raffinose and poly(ethylene glycol) 1550; equivalent hydrodynamic diffusion radii, 0. 46, 0. 57 and 1. 2 nm, respectively]. This result indicates that hemolysin is able to form stable transmembrane pores with an effective diameter of about 2 - 3 nm. Treatment of osmotically protected erythrocytes with Tethya hemolysin caused a rapid efflux of intracellular K+ and ATP, and a rapid influx of extracellularly added Ca 2 + and sucrose.

40|$|MACPF/CDCs {{proteins}} are a huge {{family of}} <b>pore-forming</b> <b>proteins</b> present from the bacteria {{to the human}} genera. Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are a family of toxins that participate in bacterial infection pathway at the membrane level. Great interest in this family is due to their similarity, in structure and in pore-forming mechanism, with some human immune system proteins (MACPF).
