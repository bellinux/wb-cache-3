40|$|Based on a {{representative}} sample of over 3, 600 Italian employees, the paper assesses the existence and the characteristics of the educational mismatch in Italy. Results show that educational mismatch is a not negligible fact and the observed patterns reflect those already reported for other countries of continental Europe. Nonetheless, the Italian case is characterised by the prevalence of undereducation over overeducation and by consistently high levels of matching. The exam of the returns to educational mismatch confirms the relative <b>penalisation</b> <b>of</b> overeducation and the absolute <b>penalisation</b> <b>of</b> undereducation. Moreover, the inclusion of additional explanatory variables proves that the focus on the sole human capital masks the impact of other important factors such as gender, professional occupation, or industry. The patterns observed for the full sample significantly change with the age of the employees. The Job Competition Model shapes the wage equation of younger workers, while the Assignment model proves to be superior for other age groups. Younger workers on temporary contracts suffer from consistent wage penalisations, but gender gaps and occupational gaps tend to blur. Substitution effects between firm-specific experience and formal education only take place among older workers...|$|R
40|$|The {{obligation}} to criminalise online grooming, recently prescribed by the Council of Europe in the Treaty of Lanzarote, illustrates modern citizens' fears of external dangers, especially towards {{the sexual abuse}} of minors. The authorities' image of online grooming being unclear, the penalisatiom tends to be of a symbolic nature, implying false prophecies of legal protection. Moreover, the <b>penalisation</b> <b>of</b> online grooming indicates a precautionary use of the criminal law, so its justification lies within the perpertrators' objectionable motive, the latter violating basic assumptions of criminal law. Next to theoretical objections, practical issues are to be foreseen, as the criminal investigation of online grooming indicates the use of undercover tactics, which has a bearing on the procedural risk, e. g. the entrapment defence. Nevertheless, the British authorities {{have been able to}} penalise online grooming rather successfully. The Netherlands having recently (in July 2010) introduced a similar provision, this calls for a comparative analysis. Does the <b>penalisation</b> <b>of</b> online grooming have any added value, {{especially in light of the}} tendency towards a precautionary use of the criminal law, and what features are apparent in the British success...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} study of two stochastic models. The first one is an equilibrium model for a market involving risk-averse insider trading. In particular, the static information model is considered under new assumptions: a) the insider is risk-averse, b) the signal received by the insider is not necessarily Gaussian, and c) the price set by the market maker {{is a function of}} a weighted signal that is not necessarily Gaussian either. Conditions on the weighting and pricing functions ensuring the existence of equilibrium are discussed. Equilibrium pricing and weighting functions as well as the insider’s optimal trading strategy are derived. Furthermore, the influence of the risk aversion on the equilibrium outcome is investigated. The second model studied, we derive the explicit solution to an impulse control problem with non-linear <b>penalisation</b> <b>of</b> control expenditure. This solution has several features that are not present in impulse control problems with affine <b>penalisation</b> <b>of</b> control effort. The state dependence of the free-boundaries characterising the optimal strategy is the first one. The possibility for the so-called continuation region to not be an interval and the optimal strategy to involve multiple simultaneous jumps while the problem data is convex are further such aspects...|$|R

40|$|In 2010 - 2014, {{approximately}} 86 % <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> {{took place}} in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although abortion incidence varies minimally across geographical regions, it varies widely by subregion and within countries by subgroups <b>of</b> women. Differential <b>abortion</b> levels stem from variation {{in the level of}} unintended pregnancies and in the likelihood that women with unintended pregnancies obtain abortions. To examine the characteristics of women obtaining induced abortions in LMICs. We use data from official statistics, population-based surveys, and abortion patient surveys to examine variation in the percentage distribution <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> and abortion rates by age at abortion, marital status, parity, wealth, education, and residence. We analyze data from five countries in Africa, 13 in Asia, eight in Europe, and two in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Women across all sociodemographic subgroups obtain abortions. In most countries, women aged 20 - 29 obtained the highest proportion <b>of</b> <b>abortions,</b> and while adolescents obtained a substantial fraction <b>of</b> <b>abortions,</b> they do not make up a disproportionate share. Region-specific patterns were observed in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> by parity. In many countries, a higher fraction <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> occurred among women of high socioeconomic status, as measured by wealth status, educational attainment, and urban residence. Due to limited data on marital status, it is unknown whether married or unmarried women make up a larger share <b>of</b> <b>abortions.</b> These findings help to identify subgroups of women with disproportionate levels <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> and can inform policies and programs to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies; and in LMICs that have restrictive abortion laws, these findings can also inform policies to minimize the consequences <b>of</b> unsafe <b>abortion</b> and motivate liberalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> laws. Program planners, policymakers, and advocates can use this information to improve access to safe abortion services, postabortion care, and contraceptive services...|$|R

40|$|The {{legality}} <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> {{remains one}} <b>of</b> the mostly highly contested issues surrounded by debate and activism. The legalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> is best {{understood in the}} American context with the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade that has shaped the abortion debate in the U. S. ever since. The legality, cultural opinions, legitimacy, and prevalence <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> vary from country to country; views are never static, but are constantly adjusting to global and local conditions, as well as changing economic and social needs. Abortion politics are often essentialized to a dichotomy of proponents and opponents <b>of</b> legal <b>abortion.</b> Nevertheless, this essay is intended to complicate this simplification by considering the legalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in the U. S. {{as well as in}} India. Despite numerous studies <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> politics in the U. S. and India, scholars have failed to situate and explore the two in relation to one another. In doing so, the processes and social movements that preceded and followed the legalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in the American context and Indian context emerge as a complex puzzle, one with fascinating contradictions and implications. In the U. S., the women’s movement sought to end state regulation of abortion; in India, feminists of the women’s movement sought state regulation and restriction <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> Moreover...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This article {{examines}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> legalization on fertility rates in the United States.

RESULTS: States legalizing abortion experienced a 4 % decline in fertility relative to states where the legal status <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> was unchanged. The relative reductions in births to teens, women more than 35 years of age, non-White women, and unmarried women were considerably larger. If women did not travel between states to obtain an abortion, the estimated impact <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> legalization on birth rates would be about 11 %.
