5|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>control</b> {{was entirely}} through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|In November 1941, Schnaufer {{was posted}} to the II. Gruppe of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (II./NJG1—2nd {{group of the}} 1st Night Fighter Wing) at the time based at Stade near Hamburg. Here, Schnaufer was {{assigned}} to the 5. Staffel (5./NJG1—5th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing). The Bf 110's of II./NJG1 at the time were not equipped with airborne radar such as the Lichtenstein radar. Night fighter intercept tactics had matured since their early beginnings in July 1940, and II. Gruppe had already been credited with 397 victories. Missions against enemy bombers at the time were usually flown by means of ground-controlled interception, although the Luftwaffe was already experimenting with airborne radar. This air defence system, consisting of a series of radar stations with overlapping coverage, layered three deep, was conceived by Generalleutnant (lit. Lieutenant General; equivalent to Major General) Josef Kammhuber and was organised in the so-called Kammhuber Line. Conceptually, the system was based on a combination of ground-based radar stations, search lights and a Jägerleitoffizier (fighter <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> officer). The Jägerleitoffizier had to vector the airborne night fighter by means of radio communication to a point of visual interception of the illuminated bomber. These interception tactics were referred to as the Himmelbett (canopy bed) procedure.|$|E

25|$|Because the X-15 {{also had}} to be {{controlled}} {{in an environment where}} there was too little air for aerodynamic flight control surfaces, it had a reaction control system (RCS) that used rocket thrusters. There were two different X-15 <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> setups: one used three joysticks; the other, one joystick.|$|E
25|$|The K-MAX {{relies on}} two primary {{advantages}} of synchropters over conventional helicopters: The increased efficiency compared to conventional rotor-lift technology; and the synchropter's natural tendency to hover. This increases stability, especially for precision work in placing suspended loads. At the same time, the synchropter is {{more responsive to}} <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> inputs, {{making it possible to}} easily swing a load, or to scatter seed, chemicals, or water over a larger area.|$|E
25|$|In January 1942, {{trials of}} the Rotachute Mark I were {{conducted}} to assess the aerodynamic characteristics while mounted on the truck-mounted rig, with <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> of the aircraft in forward motion. On 11 February 1942, the prototype Rotachute was first manually flown from a wheeled trolley while under tow behind a Humber car at Ringway, after starting the rotor by hand. The pilot was Flt Lt I.M. Little, who had experience flying Avro/Cierva C.30 Rota autogiros on radar calibration duties; he was later awarded the Air Force Cross (UK). On that and on a subsequent trial, the machine rolled over after landing, sustaining damage to the blades {{but not to the}} pilot. A tethered test beneath a barrage balloon and a longer test flight at RAF Snaith were both more successful. The flexible tail section evidently offered inadequate directional stability, and the consequence was the Rotachute Mark II, that had a longer tail section braced with wooden formers, plus two landing wheels mounted below the centre of gravity.|$|E

25|$|Another {{critical}} addition {{was the use}} of a power-operated stabilator, {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely without a loss of <b>pilot</b> <b>control.</b> The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The Victor had fully {{duplicated}} powered controls; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. <b>Pilot</b> <b>control</b> movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of artificial feel to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, nose-wheel steering, and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|E

500|$|The Sukhoi Su-37 (-37; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-F) is a single-seat {{twin-engine aircraft}} {{designed by the}} Sukhoi Design Bureau {{that served as a}} technology demonstrator. It arose out of the need to enhance <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> of the Su-27M (later renamed Su-35), which was a further development of the Su-27. The sole aircraft had originally been built as the eleventh Su-27M (T10M-11) by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association before having its thrust-vectoring nozzles installed. In addition, it was modified with updated flight- and weapons-control systems. The aircraft made its maiden flight in April1996. Throughout the flight-test program, the Su-37 demonstrated its [...] "supermaneuverability" [...] at air shows, performing manoeuvres such as a 360-degree somersault. The aircraft crashed in December 2002 due to structural failure. The Su-37 did not enter production; despite a report in 1998 which claimed that Sukhoi had built a second Su-37 using the twelfth Su-27M airframe, T10M-11 remained the sole prototype. Sukhoi had instead applied the aircraft's systems to the design bureau's other fighter designs.|$|E
2500|$|Later in March 2016 the FAA {{accelerated}} {{the release of}} an airworthiness directive in response to reports indicating that in certain weather conditions [...] "erroneous low airspeed may be displayed ..."

40|$|A {{technique}} for measuring a <b>pilot's</b> <b>control</b> strategy was developed, evaluated, {{and applied to}} a joint FAA-NASA ground-based simulation of two competing concepts of head-up displays for use in conventional takeoff and landing aircraft.

NIPIP functions in realtime and uses a sliding time window to maintain freshness in the data; thus time-varying characteristics in the <b>pilot's</b> <b>control</b> strategy can be measured...|$|R
