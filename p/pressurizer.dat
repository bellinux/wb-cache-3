5000|$|The SCWR {{operates}} at supercritical pressure. The reactor outlet coolant is supercritical water. Light water {{is used as}} a neutron moderator and coolant. Above the critical point, steam and liquid become the same density and are indistinguishable, eliminating the need for <b>pressurizers</b> and steam generators (PWR), or jet/recirculation pumps, steam separators and dryers (BWR). Also by avoiding boiling, SCWR does not generate chaotic voids (bubbles) with less density and moderating effect. In a LWR this can affect heat transfer and water flow, and the feedback can make the reactor power harder to predict and control. Neutronic and thermal hydraulic coupled calculation is needed to predict the power distribution. SCWR's simplification should reduce construction costs and improve reliability and safety.A LWR type SCWR adopts water rods with thermal insulation and A CANDU type SCWR keeps water moderator in a Carandira tank. A fast reactor core of the LWR type SCWR adopts tight fuel rod lattice as a high conversion LWR. The fast neutron spectrum SCWR has advantages of a higher poｗer density, but needs plutonium and uranium mixed oxides fuel which will be available from reprocessing.|$|R

2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the <b>pressurizer</b> was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the <b>pressurizer.</b> Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the <b>pressurizer)</b> which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDissimilar metal {{welded joints}} {{are used in}} primary water systems of {{pressurized}} water reactor in nuclear power plant. They are mainly used to connect the ferritic steel pipe-nozzles of the pressure vessels such as reactor pressure vessels, steam generators and <b>pressurizers</b> with the austenitic stainless steel safe end. Thus, maintaining integrity of such joints is critical to ensure their safe service. As local wall thinning may probably appear at safe end to due to erosion and corrosion, assessment methods with local wall thinning are urgently needed. In this paper, three-dimensional finite element analysis models with and without considering local wall thinning were built for dissimilar metal welded joints connected the safe end to pipe-nozzle of the reactor pressure vessel. A detailed analysis {{has been carried out}} to the limit load research of this structure. Results show that the bending load is the main factor influencing the stress distribution change and limit load. According to finite element results, the depth of local wall thinning should be the most important factor influencing limit load solution, while circumferential local wall thinning shows very small variation. Based on the finite element results prediction equations of limit loads for safe end with local wall thinning have been proposed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhased array {{ultrasonic}} techniques (PAUT) {{are more}} and more used for inspection of the primary circuit of nuclear power plants in order to detect defects such as stress corrosion cracking (SCC) at the dissimilar metal welds (DMWs) between the main pipe lines and large components such as the pressure vessel, steam generators and <b>pressurizers.</b> Nevertheless, disturbances such as beam splitting and skewing may occur due to the anisotropic and inhomogeneous properties of the welding material. These disturbances affect the detection, localization and sizing of possible weld discontinuities. Simulation tools can help to understand these physical phenomena, optimize ultrasonic testing. Since strict safety requirements are leading to increased demands for the inspection of such components, a research task called MAPAID has been dedicated under the umbrella of “NUGENIA+” FP 7 project to model and validate PAUT techniques for inspection of DMWs of nuclear power plants. As a part of the task, this study presents the phased array ultrasonic inspections and ultrasonic simulations of steam generator DMW. The testing has been recently developed in the CIVA {{in order to determine the}} index distances regarding the given orientation artificial defect analysis and the incident angles for longitudinal and transversal tests. By comparing the experimental and simulation tests results, conclusions can be drawn to quantitatively assess the contribution of phased array techniques to improved NDE performances of such parts, as well as the ability of simulation to help for design, optimization and interpretation of such inspections...|$|R
40|$|Tokamak Cooling Water System (TCWS) drain tanks (DTs) serve two functions: normal {{operation}} and safety operation. Normal DTs {{are used for}} regular maintenance operations when draining is necessary. Safety DTs are used to receive the water leaked into the Vacuum Vessel (VV) after an in-vessel {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) event. The preliminary design of the DTs shall be based on the information provided by this document. The capacity of the normal DTs is estimated based on the internal volume of in-vessel components [e. g., First Wall/Blanket (FW/BLK) and Divertor (DIV) ]; Neutral Beam Injector (NBI) components; and TCWS piping, heat exchangers, electric heaters, pump casing, <b>pressurizers,</b> and valves. Water volumes have been updated based on 2004 -design information, changes adopted because of approved Project Change Requests (PCRs), and data verification by US ITER and AREVA Federal Services, the US ITER A and E Company. Two tanks will store water from normal draining operations of the FW/BLK and DIV Primary Heat Transfer Systems (PHTSs). One tank will store water from normal draining operations of the NBI PHTS. The capacity of the safety DTs is based on analysis of a design basis accident: a large leak from in-vessel components. There are two safety DTs that will receive water from a VV LOCA event and drainage from the VV, as needed. In addition, there is one sump tank for the DIV that will be used for collecting drain water from the draining and drying processes and specifically for draining the DIV system as the DIV cassette lines are at a lower elevation than the DT connection point. Information documented in this report must be refined and verified during the preliminary design of the DTs, and there are several aspects to be considered to complete the preliminary design. Input to these design considerations is discussed in this report and includes, but is not limited to, water inventory; operating procedures/maintenance; Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA); tank layout and dimensions, including design margin; classification under French Nuclear Pressure Directives, Equipements Sous Pression Nucleaires (ESPN); and adaptations for construction...|$|R

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this report to {{document}} the calculation of (1) the isotopic evolution and of (2) the 1 -group cross sections as a function of burnup of the reference Super Critical Water Reactor (SCWR), in a format suitable for the Fuel Cycle Option Campaign Transmutation Data Library. The reference SCWR design was chosen to be that described in [McDonald, 2005]. Super Critical Water Reactors (SCWR) are intended to operate with super-critical water (i. e. H 2 O at a pressure above 22 MPa and a temperature above 373 oC) as a cooling – and possibly also moderating – fluid. The main mission of the SCWR is to generate lower cost electricity, as compared to current standard Light Water Reactors (LWR). Because of the high operating pressure and temperature, SCWR feature a substantially higher thermal conversion efficiency than standard LWR – i. e. about 45 % versus 33 %, mostly due to an increase in the exit water temperature from ~ 300 oC to ~ 500 oC – potentially resulting in a lower cost of generated electricity. The coolant remains single phase throughout the reactor and the energy conversion system, thus eliminating the need for <b>pressurizers,</b> steam generators, steam separators and dryers, further potentially reducing the reactor construction capital cost. The SCWR concept presented here is based on existing LWR technology and on a large number of existing fossil-fired supercritical boilers. However, it was concluded in [McDonald, 2005], that: “Based on the results of this study, it appears that the reference SCWR design is not feasible. ” This conclusion appears based on the strong sensitivity of the design to small deviations in nominal conditions leading to small effects having a potentially large impact on the peak cladding temperature of some fuel rods. “This was considered a major feasibility issue for the SCWR” [McDonald, 2005]. After a description of the reference SCWR design, the Keno V 3 -D single assembly model used for this analysis, as well as the calculated results, are presented. Additionally, the follwing information, presented in the appendixes, is intended to provide enough guidance that a researcher repeating the same task in the future should be able to obtain a vector of nuclei and cross sections ready for insertion into the transmutation library without any need for further instructions: (1) Complete TRITON/KENO-V input used for the analysis; (2) Inputs and detailed description of the usage of the OPUS utility, used to postproces and to extract the nuclei concentrations for the transmutation library; (3) Inputs and detailed description of the usage of the XSECLIST utility, used to postproces and to extract the 1 -group cross sections for the transmutation library; (4) Details of an ad-hoc utility program developed to sort the nuclei and cross sections for the transmutation library...|$|R

50|$|Part of the <b>pressurizer</b> {{system is}} an {{over-pressure}} relief system. In {{the event that}} <b>pressurizer</b> pressure exceeds a certain maximum, there is a relief valve called the pilot-operated relief valve (PORV) {{on top of the}} <b>pressurizer</b> which opens to allow steam from the steam bubble to leave the <b>pressurizer</b> {{in order to reduce the}} pressure in the <b>pressurizer.</b> This steam is routed to a large tank (or tanks) in the reactor containment building where it is cooled back into liquid (condensed) and stored for later disposition.

5000|$|One is {{providing}} {{a place to}} monitor water level in the reactor coolant system. Since the reactor coolant system is completely flooded during normal operations, {{there is no point}} in monitoring coolant level in any of the other vessels. But early awareness of a reduction of coolant level (or a loss of coolant) is important to the safety of the reactor core. The <b>pressurizer</b> is deliberately located high in the reactor containment building such that, if the <b>pressurizer</b> has sufficient coolant in it, one can be reasonably certain that all the other vessels of the reactor coolant system (which are below it) are fully flooded with coolant. There is therefore, a coolant level monitoring system on the <b>pressurizer</b> and it is the one reactor coolant system vessel that is normally not full of coolant. The other secondary function is to provide a [...] "cushion" [...] for sudden pressure changes in the reactor coolant system. The upper portion of the <b>pressurizer</b> is specifically designed to NOT contain liquid coolant and a reading of full on the level instrumentation allows for that upper portion to not contain liquid coolant. Because the coolant in the <b>pressurizer</b> is quite hot during normal operations, the space above the liquid coolant is vaporized coolant (steam). This steam bubble provides a cushion for pressure changes in the reactor coolant system and the operators ensure that the <b>pressurizer</b> maintains this steam bubble at all times during operations. Allowing this steam bubble to disappear by filling the <b>pressurizer</b> to the top with liquid coolant is called letting the <b>pressurizer</b> [...] "go hard" [...] meaning there is no cushion and any sudden pressure change can provide a hammer effect to the entire reactor coolant system.

50|$|In a {{pressurized}} water reactor plant, the <b>pressurizer</b> is basically a cylindrical pressure vessel with hemispherical ends, mounted with the long axis vertical and directly connected by a single run of piping to the reactor coolant system. It is located inside the reactor containment building. Although {{the water in the}} <b>pressurizer</b> is the same reactor coolant as {{in the rest of the}} reactor coolant system, it is basically stagnant, i.e. reactor coolant does not flow through the <b>pressurizer</b> continuously as it does in the other parts of the reactor coolant system. Because of its innate incompressibility, water in a connected piping system adjusts equally to pressure changes anywhere in the connected system. The water in the system may not be at the same pressure at all points in the system due to differences in elevation but the pressure at all points responds equally to a pressure change in any one part of the system. From this phenomenon, it was recognized early on that the pressure in the entire reactor coolant system, including the reactor itself, could be controlled by controlling pressure in a small interconnected area of the system and this led to the design of the <b>pressurizer.</b> The <b>pressurizer</b> is a small vessel compared to the other two major vessels of the reactor coolant system, the reactor vessel itself and the steam generator(s).|$|E
