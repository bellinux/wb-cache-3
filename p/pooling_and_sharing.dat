40|$|Standard {{household}} economics {{assumes that}} couples <b>pool</b> their incomes <b>and</b> <b>share</b> the sum equally, {{which is a}} necessary prerequisite for computing equivalent incomes and hence all statements about the distribution of personal incomes and income poverty. However, since cohabitation without marriage {{is on the rise}} <b>and</b> since income <b>pooling</b> is less frequent among cohabiting couples, income is also <b>pooled</b> <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> less frequently. In conclusion, statements based on these two assumption are becoming increasingly invalid. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, I analyze the incidence and determinants of income <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> then proceed to determine whether couples who pool their incomes share the sum equally. In contrast to most existing studies, I use a holistic approach to identify sharing within households by analyzing data on financial satisfaction. Concerning the relation between income <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> income <b>pooling,</b> I account not only for the dominance of pooling over sharing, but also for the possibility of correlated error terms of the <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> the <b>sharing</b> equation. A further advancement of this paper is the use of panel data, which enables me to account for unobserved heterogeneity at the household level. The results indicate that the hypothesis of equal sharing even has to be rejected for couples who pool their incomes, which implies that a wide range of analyses of income poverty, for instance, may be misleading...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the policy {{implications of the}} <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> of forces and weapons as a feasible way to strengthen European military power {{in an era of}} scarcity. This thesis argues that <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> is likely to be successful only if states enhance their emphasis on collective defense by mutual aid and self help and reduce particularist and parochial interests of local gain. <b>Pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> could improve European military capabilities significantly and for the long term if differences in location factors are taken into account and all states concentrate on their respective strengths. Pooling of money in the form of common funding can set incentives, and is easier than pooling of established military structures.

40|$|International audienceThe {{proposed}} paper {{deals with}} the challenge of supporting costly modem defense systems (e. g. aircraft, tank, ship) and asks whether the European level could provide the adequate framework. In a technology-centric paradigm, in-service support (ISS) costs of such systems tend to rise. Indeed, technological breakthroughs increase weapons capabilities, but they are also characterized by higher costs and especially fixed costs. This trend results in two dimensions: a need to co-locate fleets and ISS means, since systems {{spend a lot of time}} in ISS, and a reduction of fleet size due to the rising unit cost of systems, which challenges the existing spatial organization of armed forces. In a difficult budgetary context and under constraint of military capabilities, nations both aim to develop modern defense systems and search for minimizing ISS costs. One solution might consist in sharing a number of costs between countries and ensuring economies of scale (<b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy). This option supposes shared ISS activities to be separable from the rest of military activities and raises the following question: can we separate Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) from core military activities? If so, for a given defense system such logics leads to consider ISS cost as a decreasing function of the number of countries involved in the <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy. However, this strategy necessarily leads to increase the number of partner countries, which in turn multiplies "distances" (e. g. geographical distance, cultural distance, operational distance). Such distances in managing defense systems generate other costs, potentially increasing with the number of partner countries. Then, for a given system, considering distance in the <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy introduces ambivalence in the relation between average cost of support and the number of partner countries. Distance complicates the management of defense systems and raises a question, though not new, which is important today: What is the optimal number of countries to involve in a <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy for the support of modern defense systems? Is it possible to design an optimal scheme when EDA and NATO have raised the question, thus questioning the traditional suggestions of the alliance theory in terms of alliance size or production technology?

40|$|Abstract: In this {{theoretical}} analysis, {{we try to}} {{find out}} what the implications are of <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> broadcast rights in a sports league. We concentrate on the impact on talent demand, competitive balance and ticket price, using a simplified 2 -club non-cooperative Nash equilibrium model with the hiring of talent as the only decision variable, as well as a more general competitive equilibrium model with a large number of teams in the league and with talent hiring and ticket price as decision variables. The main conclusion is that the case for <b>pooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> broadcast rights is not very strong if clubs are profit maximisers. Decentralised selling and performance-based distribution of the rights seems to be the most promising scenario to improve the competitive balance. If clubs are win maximisers, the sharing of broadcast money always improve the competitive balance, but the monopolisation of the broadcast rights by the league is not necessary for sharing...|$|E
