25|$|In a {{finished}} product, {{such a change}} is to be prevented or delayed. Failure of safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire {{in the case of}} cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines. Chlorine-induced cracking of acetal resin <b>plumbing</b> <b>joints</b> and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties, especially in the USA in the 1990s. Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked vulnerable polymers in the plastic plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded. Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a serious stress concentration.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of hydro-mechanical drain {{cleaners}} {{are their}} eco-friendliness (most use only tap water), {{their ability to}} dislodge and remove clogs like sand or cat litter that 'back-fill when using a conventional snake, and their friendliness to <b>plumbing</b> <b>joints.</b> Unlike air-burst cleaners, hydro-mechanical drain cleaners do not pressurize <b>plumbing</b> <b>joints.</b> On some models of hydro-mechanical drain cleaner both hot and cold water can be used, providing added cleaning power for fat, protein, or other easily melting drain clogs.|$|E
50|$|Wire brush, wire {{wool and}} emery cloth are {{commonly}} used to prepare <b>plumbing</b> <b>joints</b> for connection. Electronic joints are usually made between surfaces that have been tinned and rarely require mechanical cleaning, though tarnished component leads and copper traces with a dark layer of oxide passivation (due to aging), as on a new prototyping board that {{has been on the}} shelf for about a year or more, may need to be mechanically cleaned.|$|E

50|$|Some fluxes for {{electronics}} {{are designed}} to be stable and inactive when cool and {{do not need to be}} cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or bristle brushes to remove flux residue after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a <b>plumbing</b> <b>joint</b> before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.|$|R
25|$|Christmas Festival traditions {{include both}} music and dance, {{especially}} related to masquerades and iron bands. The highland fling {{is a common}} Christmas Festival dance, also played in the modern Carnival, performed by people wearing Scottish kilts, masks made of wire and bearing whips of cowhide. Dancers wearing banana leaves and animal horns {{took part in the}} John Bull, while carolers paraded with long poles covered in lanterns, called carol trees, singing with accompaniment by the concertina. Stilt dancers in robes, called the Moko jumbie, Jumpa-Ben or Long Ghosts, were also common, and were accompanied by kettle and bass drums, fife, triangle (cling-a-ching) and the boompipe, made from a <b>plumbing</b> <b>joint</b> one meter long.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parts involved, and the high {{activity}} and contaminating tendency of the flame, plumbing fluxes are typically much more chemically active, and often more acidic, than electronic fluxes. Because <b>plumbing</b> <b>joints</b> may be done at any angle, even upside down, plumbing fluxes are generally formulated as pastes which stay in place better than liquids. Flux should be applied to all surfaces of the joint, inside and out. Flux residues should be removed after the joint is complete or they can, eventually, erode through the copper substrates and cause failure of the joint.|$|E
50|$|For {{recreational}} {{vehicles with}} plumbing, a pressure regulator is a necessity. When camping, {{a source of}} water may have an enormous pressure level, particularly if {{it comes from a}} tank that is at a much higher elevation than the campground. Water pressure is dependent on how far the water must fall. Without a pressure regulator, the intense pressure encountered at some campgrounds in mountainous areas may be enough to burst the camper's water pipes or unseat the <b>plumbing</b> <b>joints,</b> causing flooding. Pressure regulators for this purpose are typically sold as small screw-on accessories that fit inline with the hoses used to connect an RV to the water supply, which are almost always screw-thread-compatible with the common garden hose.|$|E

Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting which is a serious stress concentration.Polymer oxidation has caused accidents involving medical devices. One of the oldest known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E
50|$|Wiped joints {{were used}} for centuries to install water <b>plumbing</b> and similar <b>joints</b> {{can be seen in}} Roman plumbing. As the wiping {{technique}} allowed a great deal of on-site flexibility for the style and dimensions of the work produced, this meant that plumbers needed few parts other than pipe, lead sheet and solder. Large and complex joints could all be made by the artisan's skill alone. With the development of copper plumbing, many different types and sizes of factory-made plumbing fitting were needed, which would be assembled on site rather than fabricated from raw materials.|$|R
5000|$|Silverman is a classically trained {{double bass}} player who {{attended}} the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and developed {{a career in the}} progressive jazz scene in the 1990s, performing live and as a studio musician. He started out in a funk, rockabilly, jazz band called [...] "The Fabulous Hedgehogs" [...] before he developed his own style of solo playing and gained a reputation as a one-man rhythm section, incorporating traditional and slap-bass playing with percussive elements using the body of the instrument. When he began to feel limited by his instrument and a heavy schedule of playing and recording for other people, he started to devise a new instrument that would allow him the range to create his own music. At first he sought out professional help in building his instrument, but decided to make it himself because of the projected cost. The end result was the Magic Pipe, a 7 ft collection of steel <b>plumbing</b> pipes and <b>joints,</b> orchestral bass strings, and electronics.|$|R
