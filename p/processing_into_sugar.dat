40|$|Abstrakt The Bachelor?s thesis {{deals with}} changes in {{technology}} of sugar beet growing and processing. Sugar beet is the only crop grown in Europe for production of sugar. It {{was known as a}} cultivated plant minimum 100 years BC. At first it was grown as fodder crops or vegetables and was imported to Sicily. Sugar was made from sugar cane {{as far back as the}} Ancient Times. The Greeks introduced sugar in Europe and called it ?sakcharon?. All the later European names were derived from this term through various sound changes; compare Russian expression ?sachar? or Czech term ?cukr?. Apart from the sugar cane, people tried to utilize the juice of other plants. In the area of the present Czech Republic, the sugar beet growing and sugar production has been a tradition for more than 200 years and they still belong to the important parts of agricultural and food production. The thesis describes the history and beginnings of sugar beet growing and its <b>processing</b> <b>into</b> <b>sugar.</b> It further presents the procedure of sugar beet processed into sugar and deals with establishing new sugar refineries as well. The thesis also focuses on sugar beet growing and processing in Czechoslovakia after the First World War, when sugar obtained the proud title of ?white gold?. The following part aims at the changes in sugar beet growing and sugar industry in the period before and after the Second World War. The text then records the period of changes after 1989 as well as the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, which brought the implementation of quota system. The thesis describes the changes of the EU Sugar Regime and impacts of such changes for CR. Next part deals with the use of sugar beet for bioalcohol production as an additive for fuel and lubricants...|$|E
40|$|Floyd Neckles, a Grenadian, is a {{livestock}} feed and farm management specialist {{and has been}} a consultant with regional and international agencies in the Caribbean. Since 1981 he has been Project Director of the Sugarcane Feeds Centre in Trinidad. 'Modern', developed agriculture reflects modern life in its high consumption of energy and natural resources. Waste products are produced that are at best an embarrassment or nuisance and at worst serious pollutants. Such systems of production are not sustainable in the long-term and it is possible to develop integrated systems where local inputs are optimized and recycled, with a reduction in external inputs. Soil, sun and water are the raw materials for agriculture and in most ACP countries they are abundant. In warmer, wetter regions the sugar-cane plant, a forage grass and fast-growing leguminous tree species can thrive together. The demand for cane sugar has declined dramatically in recent years and much cane land has gone out of production. Alternative crops have been successfully introduced in some countries but too often sugarcane cultivation has been replaced literally by nothing and agriculture has declined. Yet sugar-cane is a C 4 photosynthetic plant, one of the most efficient at converting the sun's energy into metabotisable carbohydrate, and there are more potential uses for sugarcane than <b>processing</b> <b>into</b> <b>sugar</b> for direct human consumption. The Sugarcane Feeds Centre (SFC) in Trinidad is an institution of applied research, development, demonstration and training whose objective is to investigate these uses in relation to animal production. Our facilities are on 60 hectares of poor quality, non-agricultural acid utisol land at Longdenville in central Trinidad, where we have got a fairly wide programme of alternative uses for our sugarcane. We experiment with, and demonstrate, feeding under an intensive management system using available products and byproducts of agriculture and industry. Some twelve different projects run concurrently at SFC. These include aquaculture, a small dairy herd and heifer replacement rearing unit, beef feedlot, sheep and goats, pigs, ducks, rabbits, an abattoir used semi-commercially and for training, and an offal processing facility, the energy for which is supplied by a small biogas plant. Crops grown are sugarcane, elephant grass (Pennisetum) and two forage tree species, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia mangum. Fresh whole cane yields in excess of 80 tonnes per hectare per year have been obtained when animal manure is recycled. Four or five cuttings of leucaena per year yields 15 - 20 tonnes fresh matter per hectare. Obviously few, if any, farmers would contemplate operating so many enterprises on a commercial scale. However, the system can be related to 'traditional', integrated farming of an earlier generation. 'Modern' agriculture, even in the tropics, has moved into specialization and monoculture (even of animals!). We envisage farmers typically choosing one or more additional enterprises to complement their present activity. For example, a broiler producer may have land not devoted to housing or other activities. He can grow not only crops of various kinds, but can also rear sheep, goats and/or cattle, using broiler litter as the basis of the feeding system, perhaps ending up with three, four or five integrated enterprises. What we highlight to visitors is that they may have more options open to them and that there are techniques for utilizing land intensively, yet on a sustainable basis. It is possible to reduce external inputs to a minimum and yet produce good quality milk, meat and fish for use or additional income. We also face the problem in Trinidad and Tobago, as do many ACP countries, that by-products which were dumped or given away by processors are offered to live-stock producers at high prices as soon as farmers begin to use them. Transportation costs have also been rising, which reinforces the need for as much input as possible to be farm-produced. There are two other important factors. The systems of animal production that were introduced {{in the early decades of}} agricultural modernization have tended to promote the use of imported feeds. Secondly, local production often has to compete with imports from developed agricultural countries that are produced and exported with high government subsidies. My interpretation of unfolding events is that the day will come, and it is not too far away, when these high subsidies will be removed. Increasing concern for the damaged environment will also result in less excess 'cheap' food being either available or cheap. We are then going to find it was a mistake for our farmers to depend on getting their animal feed needs from abroad. Even worse, as nations we would have failed to pursue the option of producing more of our basic food needs by working more consciously to develop our agricultural potential. With generally weakening currencies and difficulty in maintaining prices of our exports of any type, we will find it increasingly difficult to pay for imports. When that happens, I believe that farmers, consumers and governments will look increasingly to the integrated low-input, recycling systems such as those we demonstrate. We know we have the land resource and the people, we know we have the sun, soil, rain and water. We have the crops and, increasingly, the knowledge and ability to use them. We must set about doing more with our agricultural resources guided by policies that are forward looking. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA.

40|$|We {{considered}} {{a new technology}} for <b>processing</b> <b>sugar</b> beet <b>into</b> intermediate product for the food industry. Nowadays sugar beet is mainly used for <b>processing</b> <b>into</b> granulated <b>sugar.</b> In the granulated sugar obtaining sugar beet undergoes deep extraction of all nutrients: proteins, minerals, pectin, organic acids, preventing the crystallization process, and then the refined product (granulated sugar) with a mass fraction of sucrose not less than 99. 75 % is obtained. We developed a technology for producing a sugar beet paste, which allows to preserve both sucrose, and almost all useful for human food substances containing in beet. A sugar beet paste is a valuable food product. Carbohydrates, organic acids, minerals, proteins, dietary fibers and vitamins are found in it. The block diagram of a sugar beet paste is given in the article. Technology of obtaining a sugar beet paste was tested under production conditions at the cannery (Joint Stock Company "Sadovoye" Liskinsky district,. Storozhevoe village, Voronezh region).

40|$|Palm {{trees have}} proved to be {{efficient}} converters of solar energy into biomass in most agro-ecological zones of the tropical world. Most tapped palm trees gives a sap very rich in sugar (10 to 20 %). For several millennia, many species of palm trees (including coconut) have been used for sugar production. Highly sophisticated techniques of tapping were developed through the centuries in Asia, Africa and America. High yields of sugar were obtained from palms that could continue for up to a hundred years of production. One of the main constraints on production in recent times has been the increasing lack of fuel needed for <b>processing</b> palm sap <b>into</b> <b>sugar</b> and the price thereof. Nevertheless, since trials of feeding pigs with fresh sugar palm sap were successfully initiated in an FAO project in Cambodia, there has been renewed interest in tapping palm trees for sap to be used as feed. A thorough review of the literature has shown that intensive pig rearing based on palm sap has already been practised by the Indonesians for centuries and was found to be a very efficient system for intensifying agriculture in some highly populated islands. In today's economy, developing animal production using palm sap as the main source of energy in the diet looks very promising: the land could sustain higher population densities through the intensification of crop and animal production within sustainable integrated systems for small farmers...|$|R
