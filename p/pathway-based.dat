40|$|Motivation: Although {{numerous}} {{methods have}} been developed to better capture biological information from microarray data, commonly used single gene-based methods neglect interactions among genes and leave room for other novel approaches. For example, most classification and regression methods for microarray data are based on the whole set of genes and have not made use of pathway information. <b>Pathway-based</b> analysis in microarray studies may lead to more informative and relevant knowledge for biological researchers. Results: In this paper, we describe a <b>pathway-based</b> classification and regression method using Random Forests to analyze gene expression data. The proposed methods allow researchers to rank important pathways from externally available databases, discover important genes, find <b>pathway-based</b> outlying cases and make full use of a continuous outcome variable in the regression setting. We also compared Random Forests with other machine learning methods using several datasets and found that Random Forests classification error rates were either the lowest or the second-lowest.

40|$|In recent years, several {{association}} analysis methods for case-control {{studies have been}} developed. However, as we turn towards the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for prognosis, {{there is a need}} to develop methods for the identification of SNPs in high dimensional data with survival outcomes.

40|$|Abstract: As our {{understanding}} of biological pathways and the genes that regulate these pathways increases, consideration of these biological pathways has become an increasingly important part of genetic and molecular epidemiology. <b>Pathway-based</b> genetic association studies often involve genotyping of variants in genes acting in certain biological pathways. Such <b>pathway-based</b> genetic association studies can potentially capture the highly heterogeneous nature of many complex traits, with multiple causative loci and multiple alleles {{at some of the}} causative loci. In this paper, we develop two nonparametric test statistics that consider simultaneously the effects of multiple markers. Our approach, which is based on data-adaptive U-statistics, can handle both qualitative data such as case-control data and quantitative continuous phenotype data. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods are more powerful than standard methods, especially when there are multiple risk loci each with small genetic effects. When the number of disease-predisposing genes is small, the data-adaptive weighting of the U-statistics over all the markers produces similar power to commonly used single marker tests. We further illustrate the potential merits of our proposed tests in the analysis of a data set from a <b>pathway-based</b> candidate gene association study of breast cancer and hormone metabolism pathways. Finally, potential applications of the proposed tests to genome-wide association studies are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{have successfully}} identified single variants associated with diseases. To increase {{the power of}} GWAS, gene-based and <b>pathway-based</b> tests are commonly employed to detect more risk factors. However, the gene- and <b>pathway-based</b> association tests may be biased towards genes or pathways containing {{a large number of}} single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with small P-values caused by high linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlations. To address such bias, numerous <b>pathway-based</b> methods have been developed. Here we propose a novel method, DGAT-path, to divide all SNPs assigned to genes in each pathway into LD blocks, and to sum the chi-square statistics of LD blocks for assessing the significance of the pathway by permutation tests. The method was proven robust with the type I error rate > 1. 6 times lower than other methods. Meanwhile, the method displays a higher power and is not biased by the pathway size. The applications to the GWAS summary statistics for schizophrenia and breast cancer indicate that the detected top pathways contain more genes close to associated SNPs than other methods. As a result, the method identified 17 and 12 significant pathways containing 20 and 21 novel associated genes, respectively for two diseases. The method is available online by [URL] Tex...|$|E

40|$|Current GWAS have {{primarily}} {{focused on}} testing association of single SNPs. To only test for association of single SNPs has limited utility and {{is insufficient to}} dissect the complex genetic structure of many common diseases. To meet conceptual and technical challenges raised by GWAS, we suggest gene and <b>pathway-based</b> GWAS as complementary to the current single SNP-based GWAS. This publication develops three statistics for testing association of genes and pathways with disease: linear combination test, quadratic test and decorrelation test, which take correlations among SNPs within a gene or genes within a pathway into account.

Results: We have constructed a protein functional interaction network by extending curated pathways with non-curated sources of information, including protein-protein interactions, gene coexpression, protein domain interaction, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and text-mined protein interactions, which cover close to 50 % of the human proteome. By applying this network to two glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data sets and projecting cancer candidate genes onto the network, {{we found that the}} majority of GBM candidate genes form a cluster and are closer than expected by chance, and the majority of GBM samples have sequence-altered genes in two network modules, one mainly comprising genes whose products are localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and another comprising gene products in the nucleus. Both modules are highly enriched in known oncogenes, tumor suppressors and genes involved in signal transduction. Similar network patterns were also found in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Conclusions: We have built a highly reliable functional interaction network upon expert-curated pathways and applied this network to the analysis of two genome-wide GBM and several other cancer data sets.

To develop a molecular <b>pathway-based</b> prediction model of long term hepatocarcinogenicity using 90 -day gene expression data and to evaluate the performance of this model with respect to both intra-species, dose-dependent and cross-species predictions. Genome-wide hepatic mRNA expression was retrospectively measured in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice following subchronic exposure to twenty-six (26) chemicals (10 were positive, 2 equivocal and 14 negative for liver tumors) previously studied by the US National Toxicology Program.

Methods In this study, a <b>pathway-based</b> meta-analysis was applied to four independent gene expression oligonucleotide microarray data sets to identify gene expression signatures for SLE, and these data sets were confirmed by a fifth independent data set. Results Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in each data set by comparing expression microarray data from control samples and SLE samples. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, pathways associated with the DEGs were identified {{in each of the}} four data sets. Using the leave one data set out <b>pathway-based</b> meta-analysis approach, a 37 -gene metasignature was identified. This SLE metasignature clearly distinguished SLE patients from controls as observed by unsupervised learning methods. The final confirmation of the metasignature was achieved by applying the metasignature to a fifth independent data set.

Results and Discussion In SAMGSR, whether a gene is selected is mainly determined by its expression difference between the phenotypes, and partially by the number of pathways to which this gene belongs, but ignoring the topology information among pathways. In this study, we propose a weighted version of the SAMGSR algorithm by constructing weights based on the connectivity among genes and then incorporating these weights in the test statistic.

A pathway contains a set of functionally related genes, each of which includes multiple SNPs. Here we propose a <b>pathway-based</b> test that is adaptive at both the gene and SNP levels, thus maintaining high power across a wide range of situations with varying numbers of the genes and SNPs associated with a trait. The proposed method is applicable to both common variants and rare variants and can incorporate biological knowledge on SNPs and genes to boost statistical power. We use extensively simulated data and a WTCCC GWAS dataset to compare our proposal with several existing <b>pathway-based</b> and SNP-set-based tests, demonstrating its promising performance and its potential use in practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Molecular markers {{based on}} gene {{expression}} profiles {{have been used}} in experimental and clinical settings to distinguish cancerous tumors in stage, grade, survival time, metastasis, and drug sensitivity. However, most significant gene markers are unstable (not reproducible) among data sets. We introduce a standardized method for representing cancer markers as 2 -level hierarchical feature vectors, with a basic gene level as well as a second level of (more stable) pathway markers, for the purpose of discriminating cancer subtypes. This extends standard gene expression arrays with new pathway-level activation features obtained directly from off-the-shelf gene set enrichment algorithms such as GSEA. Such so-called <b>pathway-based</b> expression arrays are significantly more reproducible across datasets. Such reproducibility will be important for clinical usefulness of genomic markers, and augment currently accepted cancer classification protocols. Results The present method produced more stable (reproducible) <b>pathway-based</b> markers for discriminating breast cancer metastasis and ovarian cancer survival time. Between two datasets for breast cancer metastasis, the intersection of standard significant gene biomarkers totaled 7. 47 % of selected genes, compared to 17. 65 % using <b>pathway-based</b> markers; the corresponding percentages for ovarian cancer datasets were 20. 65 % and 33. 33 % respectively. Three pathways, consisting of Type_ 1 _diabetes mellitus, Cytokine-cytokine_receptor_interaction and Hedgehog_signaling (all previously implicated in cancer), are enriched in both the ovarian long survival and breast non-metastasis groups. In addition, integrating pathway and gene information, we identified five (ID 4, ANXA 4, CXCL 9, MYLK, FBXL 7) and six (SQLE, E 2 F 1, PTTG 1, TSTA 3, BUB 1 B, MAD 2 L 1) known cancer genes significant for ovarian and breast cancer respectively. Conclusions Standardizing the analysis of genomic data in the process of cancer staging, classification and analysis is important as it has implications for both pre-clinical as well as clinical studies. The paradigm of diagnosis and prediction using <b>pathway-based</b> biomarkers as features can be {{an important part of the}} process of biomarker-based cancer analysis, and the resulting canonical (clinically reproducible) biomarkers can be important in standardizing genomic data. We expect that identification of such canonical biomarkers will improve clinical utility of high-throughput datasets for diagnostic and prognostic applications.
