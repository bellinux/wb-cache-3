The paper received the Adam Malik Award in January 2009 for their reporting on foreign politics; the coverage was considered accurate and educated, with good analysis. The following year three reporters received the Adiwarta Award from Sampoerna for excellent photography in the fields of culture, law, and politics. Another journalist received the Adam Malik Award in 2014 for his writings which assisted the ministry to distribute information regarding foreign <b>policy</b> <b>implementation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though UCSC {{has been}} known for its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support <b>policy</b> <b>implementation,</b> and serve as a resource for the campus. Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper has}} two interrelated objectives. The {{first is to}} systematize and analyze the {{literature}} on analytical models for public <b>policies</b> <b>implementation.</b> We identified two main models. One is operated based on the evaluation of independent variables related to the organizational hierarchy, focusing on the formulation process. The other emphasizes variables related to the characteristics of local areas of implementation {{and the performance of}} the implementing bureaucracies. Both models emphasize the material conditions {{for the development of the}} implementation process. Starting from this observation, the second objective is to propose an analytical model for the process of <b>implementation</b> of public <b>policies</b> based on the integration between the central variables of those models and those linked to the ideas, the values and the worldviews of the actors. This is about discussing the analytical models for public <b>policies</b> <b>implementation</b> in the light of specific literature and empirical research conducted by the authors on health and education policies. We found that elements of the local action contexts such as representations and values of the actors influenced the <b>implementation</b> of public <b>policies,</b> shaping their understanding of the social problem and how to confront it. The discussion contributes to the integration of public <b>policies</b> <b>implementation</b> analytical models and to their operationalization...|$|R

25|$|Policy {{discourse}} in Singapore has largely overlooked {{the fact that}} the linguistic market consists of permeable boundaries and the value of linguistic capital for each language changes as internal and external factors interact together. The Ministry of Education was critiqued as failing to recognise that perceptions regarding linguistic capital can change, therefore Language <b>Policy</b> <b>implementation</b> (Bilingual Policy) need to consider the feelings and willingness of the recipients as this ultimately determines the final acceptance and success of the policy. Language Policy and implementations need to consider bottom up processes (Individuals and Unofficial Institutions), and not just designed from the top (Government and Official Agencies). The populationâ€™s perceptions regarding prestige and image of Ethnic Languages are important parameters that need to be established and analysed in accordance with the Governmentâ€™s Language Policies plans to account for a multicultural country like Singapore.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} his lifetime, Zhou {{was widely}} viewed as {{representing}} moderation and justice in Chinese popular culture. Since his death, Zhou Enlai has been regarded as a skilled negotiator, a master of <b>policy</b> <b>implementation,</b> a devoted revolutionary, and a pragmatic statesman with an unusual attentiveness to detail and nuance. He was also known for his tireless and dedicated work ethic, and his unusual charm and poise in public. He was reputedly the last Mandarin bureaucrat in the Confucian tradition. Zhou's political behaviour should be viewed in light of his political philosophy as well as his personality. To a large extent, Zhou epitomized the paradox inherent in a Communist politician with traditional Chinese upbringing: at once conservative and radical, pragmatic and ideological, possessed by a belief in order and harmony as well as a faith, which he developed very gradually over time, in the progressive power of rebellion and revolution.|$|E
