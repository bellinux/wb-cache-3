5|$|A {{major source}} of zircon (and hence hafnium) ores is heavy mineral sands ore deposits, pegmatites, <b>particularly</b> in Brazil and Malawi, and {{carbonatite}} intrusions, <b>particularly</b> the Crown Polymetallic Deposit at Mount Weld, Western Australia. A potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zircon-hafnium silicates eudialyte or armstrongite, at Dubbo in New South Wales, Australia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{publicly}} discussed {{aspect of}} Jackson's private life is his childhood, <b>particularly</b> {{his relationship with}} his father.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on Gould moved away from wedding punctuated {{equilibrium}} to allopatric speciation, <b>particularly</b> as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation. Gould was <b>particularly</b> attracted to Douglas Futuyma's work {{on the importance of}} reproductive isolating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Besides the <b>particularly</b> {{bright stars}} of Alpha and Beta Aurigae, the {{constellation}} has many dimmer stars.|$|E
5|$|Cement is not <b>particularly</b> {{environmentally}} friendly, {{since the}} manufacturing process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Cloth {{was made}} in many places in Wales, <b>particularly</b> the south west and the {{northern}} and southern borderlands.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, <b>particularly</b> when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some {{cockatoo}} {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, <b>particularly</b> from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Combinations {{of these}} gases, <b>particularly</b> the trinary {{mixtures}} of helium, nitrogen and oxygen known generically as Trimix.|$|E
5|$|Differentiation and {{integration}} of power series can be performed term by term and is hence <b>particularly</b> easy.|$|E
5|$|Egusi seed oil, {{from the}} seeds of Cucumeropsis mannii naudin, is <b>particularly</b> rich in {{linoleic}} acid.|$|E
5|$|Everett {{had decided}} {{as early as}} 1821 {{that he did not}} <b>particularly</b> like teaching.|$|E
5|$|First, Second and Third Creeks {{have been}} <b>particularly</b> heavily modified. Some {{sections}} have {{been converted to}} concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation has disappeared from the creeks, <b>particularly</b> those closest to the city. Introduced species including Olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora.|$|E
5|$|For Adam Baldwin, {{who grew}} up {{watching}} westerns, the role of Jayne Cobb was <b>particularly</b> resonant.|$|E
5|$|Fulling mills {{were later}} {{established}} elsewhere in Wales, <b>particularly</b> the north {{east and the}} Ceiriog valley.|$|E
5|$|Homer - Homer is {{the most}} {{balanced}} character in the game, but relies <b>particularly</b> on brawling.|$|E
5|$|In a {{subordinate}} clause, the auxiliary har is optional and often omitted, <b>particularly</b> in written Swedish.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Bristol is <b>particularly</b> {{strong in}} the field of social sciences, <b>particularly</b> in economics, finance and management, and was rated fourth in the 2008 Guardian University Guide for Business and Management Studies.|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, a <b>particularly</b> vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van Eyck was <b>particularly</b> {{influential}} on {{the development}} of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation (see Renaissance in the Netherlands). Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|Kimball's {{chest pains}} recurred {{occasionally}} throughout {{the next several}} years, <b>particularly</b> in times of greatest stress or fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Natural ice {{typically}} had to {{be moved}} several times between being harvested and used by the end customer. A wide range of methods were used, including wagons, railroads, ships and barges. Ships were <b>particularly</b> important to the ice trade, <b>particularly</b> in the early phase of the trade, when {{the focus of the}} trade was on international exports from the U.S. and railroad networks across the country were non-existent.|$|E
5|$|On {{days with}} <b>particularly</b> strong and {{widespread}} lift pilots can attain high average speeds by alternating periods of fast flight with pull-ups, merely slowing down {{in areas of}} lift without deviating from the course. This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until <b>particularly</b> strong lift is encountered when circling would be most effective.|$|E
5|$|Outside of comics, the Valérian {{series has}} been <b>particularly</b> {{influential}} on science fiction and fantasy film.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the results, and image, of the Games were <b>particularly</b> badly {{affected}} by retrospective doping positives. Following a Russian doping scandal in 2016, a large re-examination of samples took place, leading to {{significant numbers of}} disqualifications, <b>particularly</b> in Athletics and Weightlifting. On April 2017 after near 9 years, the Olympics has had the most (50) Olympic medals stripped for doping violations of any Games.|$|E
5|$|Rose hip seed oil, used {{primarily}} in skin care products, <b>particularly</b> for aging or damaged skin.|$|E
5|$|Sandman Sims, <b>particularly</b> in {{his role}} as Apollo Theater executioner, has been {{referenced}} frequently in African-American culture.|$|E
5|$|Several bus routes were renamed, <b>particularly</b> routes with Brooklyn ("B") designations that {{operated}} {{primarily in}} Queens.|$|E
5|$|Several schemes {{have been}} devised to rate the {{handling}} of bikes, <b>particularly</b> motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|Stout, {{a kind of}} porter beer, <b>particularly</b> Guinness, is {{typically}} associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, <b>particularly</b> Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, <b>particularly</b> with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|The Duke favoured the {{domestic}} revival style of architecture, and <b>particularly</b> insisted on red brick for dwelling houses.|$|E
5|$|The public {{backlash}} {{of scientists}} against such views, <b>particularly</b> in the 1990s, {{became known as}} the science wars.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} martial art of moraingy, <b>particularly</b> {{common among}} Sakalava communities, was historically common among the Sihanaka.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{immigration of}} mainlanders, <b>particularly</b> non-Gaelic speakers, {{has been a}} subject of controversy.|$|E
5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (<b>particularly</b> pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered <b>particularly</b> cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Used in {{veterinary}} {{practice to}} treat overcropping of an animal's claws, <b>particularly</b> when the overcropping results in bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, <b>particularly</b> during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an {{increased}} production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, <b>particularly</b> by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, <b>particularly</b> the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|After 1971, <b>particularly</b> {{after the}} release of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the {{workload}} of the band, who had not had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell. He started drinking, and relationships between him {{and the rest of the}} band became strained, <b>particularly</b> with Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a plane in Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E
