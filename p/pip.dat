5|$|During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed {{the push}} for a parkway along the New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with {{ultimate}} <b>PIP</b> planner, Robert Moses, to establish and design the parkway. The plan originally {{was to have the}} <b>PIP</b> stretch from the Garden State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current <b>PIP</b> in New York on April1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later. Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, but that did not stop the <b>PIP</b> from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August28, 1958, the final piece of the <b>PIP</b> was completed between exits5 and9 in southern Rockland County.|$|E
5|$|The <b>PIP</b> {{is known}} for its stone arch {{overpasses}} throughout its route and its several scenic overlooks in New Jersey. All sorts of unique trees and flowers can be seen along the route as well. In 1998, because of all the natural and constructed beauty, the <b>PIP</b> was designated as a national landmark by the National Park Service.|$|E
5|$|The Palisades Interstate Parkway {{begins at}} the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Passengers from the upper level of the GWB can {{directly}} get on the <b>PIP</b> northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through GWB Plaza on US9W before getting on the parkway. Passengers riding northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) must be in local lanes to directly get on the <b>PIP.</b> Once the <b>PIP</b> leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near {{the northern tip of}} the island of Manhattan at the Harlem River. After this, the <b>PIP</b> parallels US9W and the Hudson River for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US9W, or within mere feet of the route. The <b>PIP</b> leaves New Jersey into New York in the borough of Rockleigh.|$|E

50|$|Using {{the same}} {{coloring}} scheme {{of the traditional}} Chinese dice, every half-domino with 1 or 4 <b>pips</b> has those <b>pips</b> colored red (for example, the 4-5 domino has four red <b>pips</b> and five white <b>pips).</b> The only exception is the pair of 6-6 tiles. Half of the <b>pips</b> on the 6-6 domino are colored red to make them stand out as the top ranking tiles.|$|R
5000|$|Players then {{alternate}} bounds. At {{the start}} of each bound, the active player dices for [...] "PIPs". <b>PIPs</b> are the spots on a die. The number of <b>PIPs</b> rolled represents the player's level of control for the turn. Players spend their <b>PIPs</b> to move single elements or connected groups of elements on the game board. <b>PIPs</b> do not carry over from turn to turn. <b>PIPs</b> simulate (though not model) the difficulties of command and control during a battle, and players find that once battle is joined, they often need to spend all of their available <b>PIPs</b> shoring up their battle line, with few <b>PIPs</b> left over for maneuver of un-engaged elements.|$|R
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (<b>PIP)</b> intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the <b>PIP</b> kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The <b>PIP</b> kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E

5|$|The {{route is}} named for the New Jersey Palisades, a line of cliffs rising along {{the western side of}} the Hudson River. The <b>PIP</b> is designated, but not signed as Route445 in New Jersey and New York State Route987C (NY987C), an {{unsigned}} reference route, in New York. As with most parkways in the New York metropolitan area, commercial traffic is prohibited from using the <b>PIP.</b> The Palisades Interstate Parkway was built from 1947–1958, and fully opened to traffic on August28, 1958.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{elephants}} {{find the}} <b>PIPs</b> attractive for a dust bath. <b>PIPs</b> are also damaged by strong winds, dew and rain. Therefore, <b>PIPs</b> {{need to be}} regularly monitored and maintained.|$|R
50|$|The BBC {{does not}} allow the <b>pips</b> to be {{broadcast}} except as a time signal. Radio plays and comedies which have fictional news programmes use various methods to avoid playing the full six <b>pips,</b> ranging from simply fading in the <b>pips</b> to a version played on On the Hour in which the sound {{was made into a}} small tune between the <b>pips.</b> The News Quiz also featured a special Christmas pantomime edition where the <b>pips</b> went missing, and the problem was avoided there by only playing individual <b>pips</b> and not the whole set. The 2012 project Radio Reunited, however, did use the <b>pips</b> not as a time signal, but simply to commemorate 90 years of BBC Radio.|$|R
50|$|Dominoes use <b>pips</b> {{that are}} similar to dice. Each half of a domino tile can have {{anywhere}} from no <b>pips</b> {{all the way up to}} six or nine <b>pips</b> (depending on countries) arranged in the same manner to dice <b>pips.</b> Regardless of dominoes having up to six or up to nine <b>pips</b> on one half of the tile, the game is generally played for up to four players only, individually or in partners (pairs).|$|R

40|$|Normal sun-exposed skin {{contains}} numerous epidermal patches that stain {{positive for}} p 53 protein (p 53 immunopositive patches; <b>PIPs),</b> which are considered potential early precursors of skin cancer. Whilst the TP 53 gene is mutated in many <b>PIPs,</b> {{it is unclear}} whether <b>PIPs</b> contain any other cancer-related mutations. Here we report that <b>PIPs,</b> predominantly < 3, 000 p 53 immunopositive cells in size, within normal chronically exposed skin contain mutations in multiple genes which are mutated in cutaneous squamous cell cancers. These mutations in the <b>PIPs</b> were not detected within the non-PIP epidermis of corresponding normal chronically exposed skin. Although some of these genetic alterations are clonal in the <b>PIPs,</b> many of the mutations are subclonal within these lesions. Similar mutations are seen in later precancers (actinic keratoses and Bowen’s disease). Our results demonstrate that <b>PIPs</b> in chronically exposed skin contain multiple mutations in cancer-related genes. In addition, the results indicate that the clonal evolution of mutations which are seen within later precancerous lesions and in established malignancy can also occur in <b>PIPs</b> within normal human skin...|$|R
5|$|Every year on July 25, Puerto Rican Nationalists and {{independence}} activists gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario, {{as well as}} to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology. It is usually organized by the family of the victims, former members of nationalist groups, and by the Puerto Rican Independence Party (<b>PIP).</b> The mountain has also been christened by them as “El Cerro de los Mártires” (The Mountain of the Martyrs).|$|E
5|$|Just {{after its}} {{intersection}} with the <b>PIP,</b> the road intersects two former Rockland County Routes (CR106A & CR69). Also, {{at this point}} CR106 enters the village limits of Stony Point, and becomes a , highway with extra lanes in some places. The highway intersects CR108, CR47, and CR33 as Central Drive. CR106 {{comes to an end}} shortly after these intersections at US9W and US202 in downtown Stony Point, about a mile west from the Hudson River and the Stony Point Marina.|$|E
5|$|The entire New Jersey {{portion of}} the Palisades Interstate Parkway is within Bergen County. It is {{designated}} as a state scenic byway known as the Palisades Scenic Byway. The <b>PIP</b> and the New Jersey Turnpike are the only highways that use sequential exit numbering in New Jersey; all others in the state are based on mileage, except for the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector in Atlantic City, which uses lettered exits (no numerals).|$|E
25|$|Domino tiles, {{also known}} as bones, are {{twice as long as}} they are wide and usually have a line in the middle {{dividing}} them into two squares. The value of either side is the number of spots or <b>pips.</b> In the most common variant (double-six), the values range from blank or no <b>pips</b> to six. The sum of the two values, i.e. the total number of <b>pips,</b> may be referred to as the rank or weight of a tile, and a tile with more <b>pips</b> may be called heavier than a lighter tile with fewer <b>pips.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{systems as}} diverse as yeast, slime mold and animal cells, the levels and {{distribution}} of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (<b>PIPs)</b> must be strictly regulated for successful cell cleavage. The precise mechanism by which <b>PIPs</b> function in this process remains unknown. Recent experiments are beginning {{to shed light on}} the cellular pathways in which <b>PIPs</b> make key contributions during cytokinesis. In particular, <b>PIPs</b> promote proper actin cytoskeletal organization and direct membrane trafficking in dividing cells. Future research will uncover temporal and spatial regulation of the different <b>PIPs,</b> thus elucidating their role in cytoskeletal and membrane events that drive cell cleavage...|$|R

5|$|The {{standard}} squad {{automatic weapon}} in Afghanistan is the M249 with <b>PIP</b> kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun. Most M249s {{were given a}} collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.|$|E
5|$|Written by P.J. Hammond, {{the story}} was {{commissioned}} as End of Term on 10 February 1986 {{as a replacement for}} Pinacotheca for episodes 9 - 12. It involved the Doctor investigating the resort of Paradise Five, while Mel goes undercover as a hostess. When this script too failed, it was replaced in turn by <b>Pip</b> & Jane Baker's Terror of the Vervoids.

5000|$|The <b>pips</b> {{were used}} on Radio 1 during The Chris Moyles Show at 06:30 {{just after the}} news, 09:00 {{as part of the}} Tedious Link feature, 10 am (at the end of the show) and often before Newsbeat. As most {{stations}} only air the <b>pips</b> on the hour, The Chris Moyles Show was the only show where the <b>pips</b> were broadcast on the half-hour. Chris Moyles continues to use the <b>pips</b> {{at the beginning of his}} show on Radio X. Zane Lowe's Masterpieces, the playing of an album in its entirety, is begun with <b>pips,</b> and they also feature at 19:00 on Fridays to signify the start of the weekend and at 16:00 on Sundays to mark the start of The Official Chart Show.

5|$|The <b>PIP</b> and Para {{versions}} of the M249 {{have been used in}} the Iraq war since the invasion. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape. The lethality of the 5.56mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up and jam if they are not cleaned frequently.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} was resumed at 4.00 a.m. on 19 September after a {{night of}} heavy shelling. The operation involved the British 77th and 65th Brigades, the 2nd French Zouaves Regiment, along with the Serres and 14th Greek Divisions. Following five hours of intense fighting the Allies managed to overrun the town of Dojran, mount Kala Tepe and Teton Hill, with the <b>Pip</b> Ridge and mount Dub remaining in Bulgarian hands. In the aftermath of the engagement the Allied command found itself to be unable to make any further offensive operations on the Doiran sector as it no longer possessed an adequate reserve of manpower. Bulgaria lost a total of 518 dead, 998 wounded, and 1,210 captured. Greek casualties amounted to 503 killed, 2,286 injured and 615 missing,with the British suffering 3,871 dead and wounded.|$|E
