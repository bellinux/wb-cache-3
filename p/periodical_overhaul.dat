40|$|Indian Railways has 45 {{workshops}} for maintenance of its fleet of rolling stock {{and out of}} them two workshops catering to broad guage coach maintenance located in southern part of India have been studied {{for a period of}} five calendar years from 2007 till 2011 to analyse their output and the corresponding energy inputs. The various activities of the workshops viz. maintenance of coaches and other major works have been studied with respect to energy usage to arrive at a common unit of output for comparison. All the forms of energy input to these two workshops viz. Electricity supply from distribution companies, high speed diesel and LPG have been accounted for. The study finds that the energy requirement for undertaking the periodical overhauling activity per coach in both the workshops is showing a downward trend from a peak of 1110 kWh per coach during 2007 to less than 600 kWh as in 2011 which is gradual and consistent and correspondingly the total energy consumption and the power bill of both the workshops over the period have shown a declining trend. The study finds that both the workshops have introduced various measures to conserve energy which has contributed to the reduced energy intensity. The larger workshop due to effective electricity management consumes 553 kWh per equated non ac coach <b>periodical</b> <b>overhaul</b> when compared to 700 kWh consumed by the smaller one. This provides for an energy saving potential of 15 % per annum per workshop if better technologies are implemented and are managed properly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{undertakes}} {{study of}} two railway coach repair workshops located in South India involved in <b>periodical</b> <b>overhauling</b> of broad gauge passenger coaches. The study {{takes into account}} the various activities in terms of maintenance of coaches and production of components the energy input for Carriage Repair Workshop Hubli (UBLS) and Central workshop, Mysore (MYSS). The specific energy consumption of larger workshop i. e. UBLS is comparatively less than the smaller one i. e. MYSS due to introduction and successful maintenance of many a energy conservation measures. Hence extended study was undertaken to analyse the drivers for energy efficiency and 82 respondents out of 235 supervisors were interviewed separately and their opinion on the rating of drivers for energy conservation (EC) were sought. The entire workshop supervisors were divided into four groups based on their functions viz. Electrical supervisors, Carriage Maintenance Supervisors, Production shop supervisors and lastly the Maintenance Supervisors. The result analysis finds that all the four groups show the similar ranking wherein it was evident that dedication of the top management, supervisors and staff was the major driver for implementation and successful maintenance, sustenance of the energy efficiency measures. The driver “Awareness and adoption of latest technologies for EC ” is a close second in all the four groups under study. The major areas of concern in the workshops are the aged transformer welding plants and the centralized air distribution systems with earlier technology of reciprocating compressors...|$|R
40|$|Two {{major railway}} coach repair {{workshops}} involved in <b>periodical</b> <b>overhauling</b> of broad gauge passenger coaches located in south India has been undertaken {{for studying the}} drivers for energy conservation(EC). The study covers a period of six calendar years from 2007 to 2012 and {{takes into account the}} various activities in terms of maintenance of coaches and production of components the energy input for both the workshops. Carriage Repair Workshop Hubli (UBLS) Central Workshops Mysore (MYSS) have introduced many an EC measures yielding good results. The extended study was then undertaken to analyse the drivers for energy efficiency in both of these workshops. The main stakeholders in both the workshops viz. the officers and senior section engineers (SSE’s) were interviewed separately and their experience on the drivers for EC were sought. Totally seven drivers for EC were arrived at from the discussions with the stakeholders. To rank these seven drivers a questionnaire was devised to capture the data from both of these workshops and weighted average method adopted for ranking. The stakeholders were briefed of the questionnaire so as to make them accustomed to it. 82 respondents from UBLS and 41 respondents from MYSS filled up the forms in all respects which were used for analysis using weighted average method. Results show the similar first three ranking in both the workshops with total weighted average of greater than 0. 5. The top ranked driver of both the workshops was dedication of the top management, engineers and staff with a weighted average score of 0. 18 and 0. 19 respectively from MYSS and UBLS respectively. The driver “awareness and adoption of latest technologies for EC” is a close second with a weighted average of 0. 16 and 0. 17 respectively from MYSS and UBLS respectively. Capacity utilization is ranked third which again is common for both the workshops. It was found that due to better awareness about environment at MYSS, it was ranked fifth when compared to UBLS wherein it was ranked the last at seventh position. These results clearly indicate that Railways is mainly driven by the dedication of its personnel and its sustenance and improvements on the energy front continue to contribute mainly by them. Indian Railways has 45 such workshops which are major energy consumers catering to the preventive maintenance of its fleet and thus railways need to keep their human resource motivated to contribute towards EC and reduce its carbon footprint...|$|R
