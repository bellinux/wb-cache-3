5|$|Isopoda is {{an order}} of {{crustaceans}} that includes woodlice and their relatives. Isopods live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> antennae, seven <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> jointed limbs on the thorax, and five <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> branching appendages on the abdomen {{that are used in}} respiration. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax. Isopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are grazers, or filter feeders, a few are predators, and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fishes. Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water, but some more derived taxa can swim for a short distance. Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defence mechanism or to conserve moisture.|$|E

5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> points to <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E

50|$|Dodecacopter is a dodecarotor {{designed}} by FYAT, {{with a total}} of twelve rotors. Dodecacopter is similar to another multirotor developed by FYAT, the FYAT Intelligent Eagle. Common feature shared by both multirotor is that the fuselage is l shaped, {{with a total of}} six arms attached, three on each side. Each arm has a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> two-blade rotors attached to its end, one above the other. Dodecacopter differs from Intelligent Eagle in the arrangement <b>of</b> the last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms. For Intelligent Eagle, all arms are arranged in almost equal distance, the angles formed between the first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms with the central pair is almost equal to the angle formed between the last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms with the central pair. However, for dodecacopter, the angle formed between the last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms and the central <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms is much larger than the angle formed between the first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms and the central <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms, so the last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms of dodecacopter are much closer to each other.|$|R
