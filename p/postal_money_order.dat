40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology elaborated for forecasting {{the volume of}} postal services {{on the basis of}} statistical methods of regression analysis on the example of the Republic of Komi. The influence of internal and external factors on the market of <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> of the Republic is constructed and investigated using the statistical regression model of the market of <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> of the Komi Republic in the period of 2005 – 2010. The conceptual foresight of development of the regional market of <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> for 2011 – 2012 is presented. Regression models were analyzed not only for the dynamic sequence of data, but also for sequences of data on territories, which revealed independent correlated factors which are weakly changing and evolving over time. The presented results have important practical and methodological significance for predicting both the volume of <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> as well as other types of services...|$|R

50|$|Postal orders {{have been}} issued by the Canadian Post Office roughly since {{confederation}} (the timeline linked to below, for example, cites the <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>order</b> system as expanding to Manitoba in July 1873). Money orders were issue for values up to $100, while postal notes (introduced 4 August 1898) were for sending small sums between 10¢ and $5.|$|E
50|$|A {{postal order}} is a {{financial}} instrument usually intended for sending money through the mail. It is purchased at {{a post office}} and is payable at another post office to the named recipient. A small fee for the service, known as poundage, is paid by the purchaser. In the United States, {{this is known as}} a <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>order.</b> Postal orders are not legal tender, but a type of promissory note, similar to a cheque.|$|E

50|$|Other {{officers}} issue a Vehicle Check report which lists out {{the violations}} noticed {{on the driver}} or on the vehicle. The notice would contain the relevant sections in which the driver is charged and also a date to appear in court. The accused can plead guilty by sending a <b>Postal</b> <b>Money</b> <b>order</b> (MO) to the court indicating that he is pleading guilty. Otherwise he/she can appear in person in the court and contest the case. The police officers who prepared the check report and charge sheet {{would be in the}} court. The court which handles these cases are the Judicial First Class Magistrate Courts and the trial is a summary trial (which means if a person is found guilty, he/she cannot appeal to higher courts).|$|E

5000|$|In {{many nations}} <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> are a popular {{alternative}} to cashier's checks and are considered safer than personal bank checks.

5000|$|The apartments are {{a mix of}} {{efficiency}} and one-bedroom units, and all are on ground level. Units are leased {{on an annual basis}} and the rental rate includes water, sewer, trash removal, basic cable TV, interior/exterior maintenance, and use of the community's recreational facilities (but not electricity). Pets are not permitted. In addition to being NALC retirees in good standing, tenants must also be able to care for themselves and for housekeeping chores, as the community is not an assisted living facility and does not have an on-site physician. [...] Prospective tenants must pay the first month's rent and a security deposit. Previously, the only form of payment accepted was a <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> but now checks and all types of money orders are accepted.|$|E
5000|$|Another entry from 1933, R. M. Abrahams Diversions and Pastimes (still {{available}} in a Dover version) poses a slightly different approach with this problem from page 16 (problem 61). [...] "A traveller(sic) returning to New York found that he had only a ten dollar <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> and that his train fare was seven dollars. The ticket clerk {{refused to accept the}} money order, so the traveller went across the road to a pawn shop and pawned it for seven dollars. On {{his way back to the}} station he met a friend, who, to save the traveller the trouble of returning to redeem the money order, bought the pawn ticket from him for seven dollars. The traveller then bought his ticket and still had seven dollars when he got to New York. Who made the loss?" [...] David Darling in his The Universal book of Mathematics, credits this as an earlier version of the three men in a hotel version above.|$|E
5000|$|King, Sullivan and the Jacksons' father Joe Jackson (who {{no longer}} managed {{any of his}} sons by that point) {{came up with a}} way to {{generate}} additional revenue from ticket sales. Those wishing to attend would have to send a <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>order</b> for $120 ($ in modern dollars) along with a special form to a lottery to buy blocks of four tickets at $30 apiece (US$ in [...] dollars), ostensibly to curtail scalpers. Upon receipt the money was to be deposited into a standard money market account earning 7% annual interest; it would take six to eight weeks for the lottery to be held and money to be refunded to the unsuccessful purchasers. Since only one in ten purchasers would win the lottery and receive tickets, there would be more money in the bank for that time period than there were tickets to sell, and they expected to earn $10-12 million in interest.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Norton (1875), the Court {{held that}} the {{embezzlement}} of <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> was not an offense under the revenue laws. In United States v.

50|$|Wire {{transfers}} via Western Union and MoneyGram {{are ideal}} for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked.

50|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> {{provide a}} safe {{alternative}} to sending cash through the mail, and are available in any amount up to $1000. Like a bank cheque, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are cashable only by the recipient. Unlike a personal bank check, they are prepaid and therefore cannot be returned because of insufficient funds. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> are a declining business for the USPS, as companies like PayPal, PaidByCash and others are offering electronic replacements.|$|R
40|$|The {{domestic}} United States <b>Postal</b> <b>Money</b> <b>Order</b> System {{was established}} in 1864 to allow Union soldiers to send money home to their relatives and to reduce the risks of sending cash through the mails. By the late 1800 s, this system had become a major means of conveying smaller (less than $ 100) sums of money throughout the country. By 1890 {{the total value of}} money orders issued was over $ 110 million a year. In this paper we describe the development and basic structure of this system. The system performed a major function of a bank by providing a cheap, safe and highly reliable means of transferring funds to almost any place in the country where there was a post office. This system has gone unnoticed by previous writers on 19 th Century financial history. This paper is divided into two parts. The first is a description of the origin, operation and magnitude of the system. The second part uses a detailed record of money order activity in a small 19 th century New Hampshire town to show that records of the <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>order</b> system can provide unique windows into the economic activity at the local level. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMobile banking is the {{evolutionary}} step after Internet banking where the banks can collaborate with other entities {{to offer the}} latest in banking services in variety of business domains. The remittance of Indian <b>Postal</b> <b>Money</b> <b>Order</b> at present requires the person to visit nearest post office branch, fill up money order form for sending to recipient. The present <b>postal</b> <b>money</b> <b>order</b> lacks in efficiency due to slow delivery, high commission charges, and inconvenience to customers as they require visiting the post office during business hours on working days and many more. The India post had been the oldest and prime source of money transfer for the migrant people and serving personnel employed away from their homes such as migrant workers. This provides the opportunities for banks and India Post to utilize the existing setup and resources to integrate the money remittance through cost effective means of technology such as mobile banking. Although some initiative has been taken to start mobile money transfer services in India but their adoption has remained modest. This study examines the feasible model of mobile banking based money order by integrating India Post with banking sectors and find out the factors that drive and inhibit the demand potentials for such services. The study has identified certain factors for demand of mobile money order for deploying the mobile money order, which can {{provide an opportunity to}} Banks and India Post to accelerate business growth.
