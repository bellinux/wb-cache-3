25|$|The Iriomote cat (<b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> <b>iriomotensis)</b> is a {{subspecies}} of {{the leopard}} cat that lives {{exclusively on the}} Japanese island of Iriomote. It has been listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008, as the only population comprises fewer than 250 adult individuals and is considered declining. As of 2007, there were an estimated 100–109 individuals remaining.|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} survey of Iriomote cats (<b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> <b>iriomotensis)</b> {{was conducted to}} understand the prevalence and molecular characteristics of hemotropic mycoplasma (hemoplasma). A series of ecological surveys of Iriomote cats were performed between November 2003 and September 2010. During this period, 31 Iriomote cats were captured or found, and 39 blood samples were collected. Polymerase chain reaction screening for hemoplasmas and BLAST searches revealed that 4 of the 31 cats were positive for hemoplasma infection (n= 3, Mycoplasma haemofelis [Mhf]; n= 1, ‘Candidatus M. turicensis’ [CMt]). The 4 infected cats were captured or found in the northern area of the island of Iriomote. Phylogenetic analyses revealed close relationships between Mhf and CMt isolated from Iriomote cats compared with those from domestic cats and other wild felids. In our study, we identified two species of hemoplasma in Iriomote cats. The number and location of the hemoplasma-positive cats appeared to be limited; however, continuous surveillance of hemoplasma infection in Iriomote cats is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Movement {{pattern of}} the Iriomote cat <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> <b>iriomotensis</b> was studied on Iriomote Island, Japan by radio-tracking. The {{influence}} of sex and reproductive status of cats on their daily movement distance (DMD), straight-line distance (SLD), daily movement range (DMR) and other relative indices of movements was estimated. DMD was longest in males (3. 2 km) and shortest in females without kittens (1. 9 km). Also, males moved faster than either females with or without kittens (0. 34, 0. 25 and 0. 25 km/h, respectively). During the mating season, males moved faster and their DMRs were larger than {{during the rest of}} the year. The SLD/DMD ratio in males was similarly high in both seasons (0. 29 and 0. 33), which indicates that their daily routes were expanded over large areas year-round, possibly to maintain a continuous control over their home range. In contrast, SLD/DMD varied seasonally in breeding females. It was low (0. 09) during the lactating period, when females returned repeatedly to the den with kittens and it became high (0. 32) out of the breeding season. Breeding females moved equally long DMDs in both seasons, whereas non-breeding ones moved shorter distances during the breeding period. These differences may be related to seasonal changes of food abundance. Cats moved intensively, as indicated by long (812 - 1139 m) routes per km 2 of their home range, an...|$|R

30|$|There are 12 {{subspecies}} of {{the leopard}} cat <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis,</b> and they significantly differ in appearance and choice of habitat. <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> euptilurus {{is the only}} subspecies reported to live in Manchuria (China), eastern Russia, Tsushima (Japan), and Korea (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The leopard cat is listed and protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendices I and II; specifically, P. bengalensis in India, Bangladesh, and Thailand is listed in CITES Appendix I because of its low abundance, while P. bengalensis in other areas is listed in Appendix II (Nowak 1999). The subspecies P. bengalensis euptilurus is designated a class II endangered species, as it is almost extinct in Korea.|$|R
25|$|In 1792, Robert Kerr first {{described}} a leopard cat under the binominal Felis bengalensis in his translation of Carl von Linné's Systema Naturae as being native to southern Bengal. Between 1829 and 1922, different authors of 20 more descriptions classified the cat either as Felis or Leopardus. Owing {{to the individual}} variation in fur colour, leopard cats from British India were described as Felis nipalensis from Nepal, Leopardus ellioti from the area of Bombay, Felis wagati and Felis tenasserimensis from Tenasserim. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated them to the genus Prionailurus. The collection of the Natural History Museum in London comprised several skulls and large amounts of skins of leopard cats from various regions. Based on this broad variety of skins, he proposed to differentiate between a southern subspecies <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> bengalensis from warmer latitudes {{to the west and}} east of the Bay of Bengal, and a northern <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> horsfieldi from the Himalayas, having a fuller winter coat than the southern. His description of leopard cats from the areas of Gilgit and Karachi under the trinomen <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> trevelyani is based on seven skins that had longer, paler and more greyish fur than those from the Himalayas. He assumed that trevelyani inhabits more rocky, less forested habitats than bengalensis and horsfieldi.|$|R

40|$|The {{cytogenetics}} {{of eight}} Felidae species in Thailand were {{investigated by the}} colchicines-hypotonic fixation-air drying technique followed by a conventional technique. All species studied have an identical number of 38 diploid chromosomes, indicating a close genetic relationship among species. At a deep study level, the genetic relationships of eight Felidae species were accessed by the AFLP method. Blood samples were collected from sources locating in their original regions for DNA extraction. With ten successful primer combinations, a total of 4208 scorable bands were generated. Of these bands, 18. 91 % are polymorphic. Percentages of Polymorphic Bands (PPB) for each primer combination range from 15. 00 to 23. 59 %. The generating bands were used for dendrogram construction. The average genetic similarity values among all Felidae species are 68. 20 % (between Panthera tigris and Neofelis nebulosa) to 85. 53 % (between <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> and <b>Prionailurus</b> viverrinus). The dendrogram shows that the eight Felidae species were clustered together and the subfamily Pantherinae and Felinae with Neofelis nebulosa are distinguished. The Felinae, <b>Prionailurus</b> <b>bengalensis,</b> <b>Prionailurus</b> viverrinus, Catopuma temminckii, Felis chaus, Pardofelis marmorata and Neofelis nebulosa were clustered together with 91 % bootstrap support and the Pantherinae, Panthera pardus is clustered with Panthera tigris with 92 % bootstrap support. In summary, the ten successful primer combinations {{can be used to}} determine genetic differences among eight Thailand Felidae species...|$|R
