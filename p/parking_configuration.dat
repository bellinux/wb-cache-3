This study aims to determine the proper <b>parking</b> <b>configuration</b> {{that can be applied}} to every weighbridges in Indonesia, to support The Government Regulation Number 74, 2014. This study uses Tanjung Weighbridge and Toyoga Weighbridge as the location of the focus case. In this study, the main thing to be analyzed are the parking space requirement and the requirement of space for vehicles 2 ̆ 7 movements. The method used to analyze the parking space requirement is the calculation method by using the load inspection data provided by Dishubkominfo Jateng. Whilst the method used to analyze the requirement of space for vehicles 2 ̆ 7 movement is the simulation method, by using Vehicle Tracking software. The result is obtained from the calculations of the parking space requirement, with the result of 3 parking spaces for Medium Truck, 4 parking spaces for Big Truck, and 2 parking spaces for Coupled Truck and Semitrailer at Tanjung Weighbridge. For Toyoga Weighbridges, the required parking spaces are 2 parking spaces for Medium Truck, 4 parking spaces for Big Truck, and 3 parking spaces for Coupled Truck and Semitrailer. The result of the parking layout configuration concludes that those weighbridges don 2 ̆ 7 t have enough available space to accommodate the amount of the required parking spaces, so the area of those weighbridges need expansion, with the land expansion of 1576 m 2 for Tanjung Weighbridge and 1682 m 2 for Toyoga Weighbridge. After that, by using the result of <b>parking</b> <b>configuration</b> for those two weighbridges, the ideal <b>parking</b> <b>configuration</b> can be configured as the base of <b>parking</b> <b>configuration</b> for every weighbridges in Indonesia.

Analysis of the data used is simulation method of flow theory based on Greenshields, Greenberg, and Underwood models. The largest value of the correlation coefficient (R) among the three models is taken to determine the model used. Based on the results of the simulation can be compared to the smooth flow of traffic in the presence of on-street parking on the road with median and the road without median. The analysis showed that the model of Greenberg is a model that best fits the characteristics of KH. Agus Salim and Pandanaran Street.

40|$|To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the impact of parking spaces on traffic congestion, road infrastructure, time spent searching for parking and ultimately CO 2 emissions, several parking surveys have been undertaken. Traditionally these surveys were performed by individuals manually logging parking lot information, thus limiting spatial and temporal coverage due to high labor costs. As a result, the need for automating the data collection process for open parking spaces is paramount when one starts looking into using parking lot information in real-time applications and across a large area such as a city, state, or even an entire country. Some studies have been conducted looking into this automation process, such as using ultrasonic sensors, 2 D LIDARs, vision sensors, parking lot cameras and sensors for individual parking spots in a lot. Most of these methods generated promising results, but were either expensive or not suitable for real-time processing. This thesis describes an affordable method to detect parking spots in real-time by installing a low cost, off-the-shelf laser range sensors onto a probe car. Several algorithms will investigate the effect of having a stationary sensor and enabling a vertical motion of the sensor, with hopes of obtaining 3 D images of a parking lot. The experiments are conducted for different parking configurations, in normal and adverse weather conditions. The results were compared to onboard ground truth camera recordings of the experiments. Statistical analyses were also performed to determine how effective a laser range sensor is in mapping a parking lot in one run; and how many runs were necessary to map the parking lot with a certain confidence. Results show that the stationary laser range sensor maps parking spots with high accuracy, successfully generating a 2 D and 3 D layout of the <b>parking</b> <b>configuration.</b> Moreover, it has been shown that the sensor’s accuracy does not diminish for adverse weather conditions. The vertical motion of the sensor on the other hand helps with detecting some black cars, which are not as efficiently identified by the stable sensor. M. S...|$|E

A numerical model of a generic street canyon was developed using a large eddy simulation (LES) model to compare personal exposure on the footpath with and without the presence of <b>parked</b> cars. Three <b>configurations</b> of car <b>parking</b> systems were investigated (parallel, perpendicular & 45 o parking) {{in addition to the}} influence of wind speed, wind direction and car parking occupancy. A tracer gas (CO 2) was used as a representative pollutant from vehicular sources within the street canyon models. The results indicated that parked cars may act as a temporary baffle plate between traffic emissions and pedestrians on the footpath. Reductions in exposure of up to 35 % and 49 % were attained on the leeward and windward footpaths in perpendicular wind conditions, with parallel winds allowing up to 33 % pollutant reduction on both footpaths for parallel parking. The perpendicular and 45 o car <b>parking</b> <b>configurations</b> investigated proved less successful as passive controls on air pollution exposure and an increase in pollutant concentration occurred in some models. An investigation of parking space occupancy rates was carried out for parallel parked cars. The fraction of parked cars influenced the level of reduction of pollutants on the footpaths with steady reductions in perpendicular winds, yet reductions were only evident for occupancy rates greater than approximately 45 % in parallel wind conditions. One negative impact associated with the parked cars study was the increase of pollutant levels on the roadway as the parked cars acted as a baffle wall, which trapped pollutants in the road.

References for the research are the NREL’s UAE (Unsteady Aerodynamic Experiment) blade measurements which contain various pitch angles up till 90 degrees. As CFD code the commercial code FLUENT is used to calculate the flow configurations at wind tunnel velocity of 30 m/s and at pitch angels of 20 º, 45 º and 60 º, respectively. By keeping the turbulence model unchanged three different domain compositions varying in size, layout and meshing techniques could be analyzed and its influences on the pressure distributions along the blade span were charted. A similar analysis was carried out with respect to two turbulence models, the kω-Shear Stress Transport model (kω-SST) and the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) model. The results show that the computational domain and grid quality has a strong effect on the outcome for the configuration with massive flow separation occurring at the 45 degree pitch angle. The results also indicate that the DES model should be preferred over the kω-SST model in particular for fully separated flows.

The calculations retain all three spatial variables describing particles' trajectories, allowing to model any transport across the magnetic field. Large energy change is shown to occur for protons, due to the combined effect of standard adiabatic deceleration and a significant contribution from particle drift in the direction opposite to that of the solar wind electric field. The latter drift-induced deceleration is found to have a stronger effect for SEP energies than for galactic cosmic rays. The kinetic energy of protons injected at 1 MeV is found to be reduced by between 35 and 90 % after four days, and for protons injected at 100 MeV by between 20 and 55 %. The overall degree of deceleration is a weak function of the scattering mean free path, showing that, although adiabatic deceleration plays a role, a large contribution is due to particle drift.

The quantitative correlation of species richness and the park green cover indices (patch size, shape, etc.) were studied. The importance value index for plant species (trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species) of each park was calculated. The two-way indicator species analysis approach (TWINSPAN) was applied to classify the 24 parks into different groups based on their species assemblages. Two-hundred and eighty-eight species were recorded within the 24 study parks, belonging to 184 genera and 72 families dominated by Gramineae, Compositae, and Leguminosae. Among all the recorded species, 41 % are exotic. The species occurrence, abundance and diversity vary significantly among different parks. Besides the positive correlation (R= 0. 505, P < 0. 05) between herbaceous species abundance and the park green cover size, no other significant relations were found between the species abundance and other indices of <b>park</b> green cover <b>configuration.</b> Remarkably, the TWINSPAN classification resulted in a good discrimination between park functional types and the variation in their species assemblage.

The methodology adopted and results can be employed to improve baseline information on urban plant ecology and support the setting of priorities for future park management and vegetation protection...|$|R

40|$|Agent-based {{models have}} gained wide {{acceptance}} in transportation planning because with increasing computational power, large-scale people-centric mobility simulations are possible. Several modeling {{efforts have been}} reported in the literature on the demand side (with sophisticated activity-based models that focus on an individual’s day activity patterns) and on the supply side (with detailed representation of network dynamics through simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models). This paper proposes an extension to a state-of-the-art integrated agent-based demand and supply model—SimMobility—for the design and evaluation of autonomous vehicle systems. SimMobility integrates various mobility-sensitive behavioral models in a multiple time-scale structure comprising three simulation levels: (a) a long-term level that captures land use and economic activity, with special emphasis on accessibility; (b) a midterm level that handles agents’ activities and travel patterns; and (c) a short-term level that simulates movement of agents, operational systems, and decisions at a microscopic granularity. In that context, this paper proposes several extensions at the short-term and midterm levels to model and simulate autonomous vehicle systems and their effects on travel behavior. To showcase these features, the first-cut results of a hypothetical on-demand service with autonomous vehicles in a car-restricted zone of Singapore are presented. SimMobility was successfully used in an integrated manner to test and assess the performance of different autonomous vehicle fleet sizes and <b>parking</b> station <b>configurations</b> and to uncover changes in individual mobility patterns, specifically in regard to modal shares, routes, and destinations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM) is a {{game played}} on a graph realizing the {{dynamics}} implicit in the discrete Laplacian matrix of the graph. The purpose of this primer is to apply the theory of lattice ideals from al-gebraic geometry to the Laplacian matrix, drawing out connections with the ASM. An extended summary of the ASM and of the required algebraic ge-ometry is provided. New results include a characterization of graphs whose Laplacian lattice ideals are complete intersection ideals; a new construction of arithmetically Gorenstein ideals; a generalization to directed multigraphs of a duality theorem between elements of the sandpile group of a graph and the graph’s superstable <b>configurations</b> (<b>parking</b> functions); and a characterization of the top Betti number of the minimal free resolution of the Laplacian lat-tice ideal {{as the number of}} elements of the sandpile group of least degree. A characterization of all the Betti numbers is conjectured. 1...|$|R
