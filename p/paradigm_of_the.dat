5|$|Coronations {{are still}} {{observed}} in the United Kingdom, Tonga, and several Asian and African countries. In Europe, most monarchs {{are required to take}} a simple oath {{in the presence of the}} country's legislature. Besides a coronation, a monarch's accession may be marked in many ways: some nations may retain a religious dimension to their accession rituals while others have adopted simpler inauguration ceremonies, or even no ceremony at all. Some cultures use bathing or cleansing rites, the drinking of a sacred beverage, or other religious practices to achieve a comparable effect. Such acts symbolise the granting of divine favour to the monarch within the relevant spiritual-religious <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
5|$|The {{longevity}} of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world {{should not be}} overlooked as {{a key factor in}} its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the {{longevity of}} Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson was {{a proponent}} of the Greek and Roman {{architectural}} styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy by historical association. These were popular during the federal period across the United States. Each academic unit is designed with a two-story temple front facing the quadrangle, while the library is modeled on the Roman Pantheon. The ensemble of buildings surrounding the quad is a statement {{of the importance of}} secular public education, while the exclusion of religious structures reinforces the principal of separation of church and state. The campus planning and architectural treatment is considered a <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordering of man-made structures to express intellectual ideas and aspirations. A survey of members of the American Institute of Architects identified Jefferson's campus as the most significant work of architecture in America.|$|E
25|$|Mr and Mrs Andrews is an oil {{on canvas}} {{portrait}} of about 1750 by Thomas Gainsborough, now in the National Gallery, London. Today {{it is one of}} his most famous works, but it remained in the family of the sitters until 1960 and was very little known before it appeared in an exhibition in Ipswich in 1927, after which it was regularly requested for other exhibitions in Britain and abroad, and praised by critics for its charm and freshness. By the post-war years its iconic status was established, {{and it was one of}} four paintings chosen to represent British art in an exhibition in Paris celebrating the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Soon the painting began to receive hostile scrutiny as a <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paternalist and capitalist society of 18th-century England, but it remains a firm popular favourite.|$|E

While a majority of critics agree that the story acts as a <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human situation, they disagree as to its precise nature.

In 1893, the building was the only private house to be recorded in an article in The Builder, which gave an overview of the architecture of the previous fifty years. [...] It was referenced again a decade latter by Muthesius, who described it as, [...] "The most highly developed Gothic house to have been built in the 19th century (and) the last to be built in England". It was then largely ignored, James Stourton describing its early twentieth-century decline as [...] "a <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reputation of the Gothic Revival".|$|E
500|$|UC Berkeley law {{professor}} John Yoo responded in a matching {{article in the}} same publication, that the court's view provides interpretive guidance when a suspect says nothing for an extended period.

(See anti-terrorism legislation and Bush Doctrine) This perspective could influence terrorism cases, when the opponents were declared to be at war, since [...] "interrogation would seek actionable intelligence to stop attacks, not confessions for use in civilian trials". Yoo concluded that the court's [...] "new flexibility" [...] would perhaps allow it to [...] "ease the burden" [...] on military, intelligence and police" [...] and permit [...] "more [...] terrorism within the criminal-justice paradigm, though {{at the expense of}} weakening the civil rights of all Americans". The present ruling might clarify that Miranda was not relevant where information was not being collected for use at a trial. As such it might act in mitigation of [...] "weak anti-terrorism policies".|$|E

[...] Berthoff sees a contrast between Delano and Don Benito's [...] "awareness," [...] caused by the [...] "harrowingly different circumstances" [...] through which they come to meet each other.
