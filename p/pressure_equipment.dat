5000|$|The <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> Directive (PED) 2014/68/EU (formerly97/23/EC) [...] of the EU {{sets out}} the {{standards}} for the design and fabrication of <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment</b> ("pressure equipment" [...] means steam boilers, pressure vessels, piping, safety valves and other components and assemblies subject to pressure loading) generally over one litre in volume and having a maximum pressure more than 0.5 bar gauge. It also sets the administrative procedures requirements for the [...] "conformity assessment" [...] of <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment,</b> for the free placing on the European market without local legislative barriers. It has been mandatory throughout the EU since 30 May 2002, with 2014 revision fully effective as of 19 July 2016. [...] This is enacted in the UK as the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> Regulations (PER).The set out standards and regulations regarding pressure vessels and boilers safety is also {{very close to the}} US standards defined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). This enables most international inspection agencies to provide both verification and certification services to assess compliance to the different <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment</b> directives.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Firstly, {{a method}} is {{introduced}} which uses Volterra series deploying technique {{to construct a}} nonlinear model based on OFS model. Then an improved novel incremental mode multiple steps adaptive predictive control strategy is brought forward, which can import {{more information about the}} system’s dynamical characteristics. Experiments of constant water <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment’s</b> control prove that this proposed algorithm can effectively alleviate system’s oscillation when used to control a plant with severe nonlinearity, and that this algorithm shows good robustness for outer disturbances. So it is suitable to be generalized to the design of complex industrial process controller. ...|$|R
