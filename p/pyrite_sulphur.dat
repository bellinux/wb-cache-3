This is because the sediment is organic matter-rich, with total sulphur representing a variable mixture of pyrite sulphurs and organic sulphur. In addition, remobilisation of sulphur associated with post-depositional groundwater flow has modified depositional values. In the upper 20 cm of the bed, <b>pyrite</b> <b>sulphur</b> has been oxidised and largely removed. This sulphur was subsequently reprecipitated as later diagenic pyrite at about 40 - 60 cm in the bed under reducing conditions.

Investigations revealed the required application of sulphur is one half to one third the amount of nitrogen, and the ratio becomes narrower in mustard (Brassica juncea L.), followed by wheat and rice. The efficiency of an increased level of nitrogen required a proportionately higher amount of sulphur. A critical investigation on the effective utilization of applied vis-à-vis absorbed nitrogen in wheat and mustard envisaged accumulation of NO 3 -N in vegetative parts when sulphur remained proportionately low. Application of sulphur hastened the chemical reduction of absorbed NO 3 – for its effective utilization. The effect was more pronounced in mustard than in wheat.

40|$|The low-grade metasediments of lthe Cameros Basin, northem Spain, host {{a number}} of {{deposits}} of spectacular quality pyrite mineralization. These formed during regional metamorphism and the pyrite crystals exhibit {{a wide range of}} morphologies. On the basis of pyrite crystal habit, the deposits can be classified into two groups: Group 1 comprises deposits with cubic, elongated or platy crystals; Group 11 comprises deposits charactenzed by pyntohedra and cubo-pyritohedra with striated faces, along with blocky crystals and he-grained aggregates. Group 1 deposits are formed in sequences dorninated by meandriform fluviatile sediments, while Group 11 is hosted by deltaic plain and lacustrine metasediments. Temperature differences between deposits and As content are possible causes of the different ynte morphologies in the deposits, but no significant variation exists between the two groups for either factor. Comparison with experimentally grown pyrite crystals suggests that Group 1 deposits have morphologies indicative of lower degrees of pyrite supersaturation than pyrite crystals in Group 11 deposits. The sedimentary facies hosting Group 11 deposits provides a greater availability of sedimentary <b>sulphur</b> (<b>pyrite</b> and sulphates). Moreover, reactions involving sulphate during metamorphism may have modified fluid chernistry, which would also act to produce higher degrees of pynte saturation in fluids derived from the sulphate-rich deltaic plain and lacustrine metasediments osting the Group 11 deposits.

Their existence in catchment areas comprising groundwater bodies or lakes often imposes negative effects on the water quality. The European Union Water Framework Directive [EU-WFD, 2000. Directive 2000 / 60 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action {{in the field of}} water policy. The European Parliament and Council, L 327 / 1, p. 72] aims to achieve ‘good quality’ status for all water bodies across Europe by 2015. Consequently, predicting the development of ground and lake water quality is necessary and must be based on the geochemical composition of the mining dumps. Therefore, the dumps need to be quantified as pollutant sources. A method to calculate the amount of sulphate in mine dumps is presented. It is based on historic geological and geochemical data characterising the pre-mining situation. Additional information on the dump body, derived from the vertical extension of mining activities and the current Digital Elevation Model (DEM), allows the composition of the dump to be determined. This procedure is demonstrated for the Bärwalde site. An average total sulphur content of 0. 62 % (5. 9 million tonnes) was calculated for the Bärwalde dump. About 40 % of it is estimated to be <b>pyrite</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Applying an average pyrite oxidation rate for the whole dump body of 7 % led to an additional water-soluble mass of 0. 18 million tonnes of sulphate sulphur.

40|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) mass {{extinction}} event occurred 66 million years ago, {{the most recent}} of the ‘Big Five’ extinction crises of the last 540 million years. This event {{had a profound effect}} on both life and the broader Earth system, with the extinction of up to 75 % of life. Despite years of detailed research, debate continues as to the nature and timing of the extinction. Ideas for an abrupt crisis, triggered by bolide impact at Chicxulub in the Gulf of Mexico, contrast with those suggesting a more gradual extinction, involving volcanism from the Deccan Traps Large Igneous Province in India and/or climatic changes. Evidence from the high latitudes has been used to suggest that the fossil record from Antarctica is incompatible with models for a single, sudden event, and that extinction intensity declined at high latitudes. This thesis presents a detailed study of extensive fossil and sediment collections from the highest southern latitude onshore outcrop containing the K–Pg transition; the highly expanded and fossiliferous López de Bertodano Formation of Seymour Island, James Ross Basin, located at 65 °S today, and during the Cretaceous. New biostratigraphic and diversity data for the molluscan (bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods) faunas of the López de Bertodano Formation, and geochemical datasets (seawater sulphur and <b>pyrite</b> <b>sulphur</b> isotopes) are compared to published records, and evidence for palaeoenvironmental change. They suggest a single, rapid extinction event coincident with the K–Pg boundary, with no precursor decline. The magnitude of the extinction in Antarctica is also consistent with lower latitudes, suggestive of a global, catastrophic trigger for the K–Pg extinction, such as bolide impact. Sulphur isotope data suggest the K–Pg sulphur cycle was able to respond to rapid environmental changes before, and after the K–Pg {{mass extinction}}. A decoupling of the carbon and sulphur cycle occurred during the latest Cretaceous, but productivity collapse after the K–Pg extinction also affected the sulphur cycle. The recovery to pre-extinction values was achieved on the same timescale as carbon cycle and initial ecological recovery, suggesting close geosphere-biosphere links at this time...|$|E

Organic sulphur compounds (2 - methyl thiophene, 3 -methyl thiophene, 2 -ethyl thiophene and dibenzothiophene) were characterized from these coal samples {{in order to determine the}} quality of South African coal. Organic sulphur compounds were extracted from coal samples by means of ultrasonic bath. The extraction of organic sulphur compounds was first optimised by using various organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene and hexane followed by quantification using gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector. The extraction time was also optimized from 0 to 75 minutes while spiked standard concentrations were varied from 1700 to 17000 mg kg- 1 to control the process. Ultrasonic extracts were analyzed by GC equipped with SPB- 1 Sulphur column and flame ionisation detector. Microwave assisted extraction was used to extract various forms of sulphur in coal. During sequential extraction, sulphate and <b>pyrite</b> <b>sulphur</b> were extracted from coal samples using hydrochloric acid and nitric acid respectively. Total organic or total sulphur and selected metals in coal were extracted by means of a mixture of concentrated hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and boric acid.

The manganese layers of 2 to 10 cm-wide interbed with deep sea sedimentary rocks including reddish - reddish brown claystone, radiolarian chert, slate, marl as well as white and pinkish calcilutite of Nakfunu Formations. Stratigraphically, the rock formations are underlain by Bobonaro Formation. Two types of manganese ores found comprise manganese layers and manganese nodule. The manganese layers strongly deformed, lenticular, and segmented, are composed of manganite [MnO(OH) ], groutite [MnO(OH) ], pyrolusite (MnO 2), lithioporite (Al,Li) MnO 2 (OH) 2, and hollandite [Ba (Mn 4 +, Mn 2 +) 8 O 16] associated with gangue minerals including calcite, quartz, limonite [FeO(OH) ], hematite (Fe 2 O 3), and barite (BaSO 4). Whilst the nodule type is only composed of manganite and less limonite. Geochemically, the manganese layers have grade of 63 - 72 wt. % MnO, whereas the nodule one has grade of 63 - 69 wt. % MnO. Generally, iron in Mn ore is very low ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 54 wt. % Fe 2 O 3, averaged 0. 76 wt. %. Hence, Fe/Mn ratio which is very low (0. 003 - 0. 069), typically indicates a sedimentary origin, which is also supported by petrologic and petrographic data showing layering structure of manganite and lithioporite crystal/grain. Trace element geochemistry indicates that manganese ore was precipitated in a reduction condition. Rare earth element (REE) analysis of manganese ore shows an enrichment of cerium (Ce) suggesting that the ore is basically originated in a marine environment. The manganese nodule is interpreted to be formed by chemical concretion process of unsoluble metals (i. e. mangan, iron) in seawater (hydrogenous) and precipitated on deep sea bottom. On the other hand, the manganese layer is a detrital diagenetic deposit formed by Mn remobilization in seawater column, precipitated and sedimented on the deep sea bottom. Manganese layers have probably been influenced by ‘hydrothermal process’ of mud-volcano activities, proven {{by the presence of}} quartz and barite veinlets cutting the Mn layers, manganite recrystallization to be pyrolusite along veinlets cutting manganite and lithioporite layers, and the presence of <b>pyrite</b> and <b>sulphur</b> associated with Mn layers.

The closely spatial and genetic relationships between manganese layers and mud-volcanoes might also be an important guide for the exploration of Mn deposit in the region. </p...|$|R

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The Hillside deposit {{is located in}} the southern part of the Olympic Province on the Gawler Craton, South Australia. This area has a history of IOCG-U style deposits, including the world class Olympic Dam deposit. Several other deposits and prospects have also been identified within this Olympic Dam domain. The Hillside deposit was discovered in the 1800 s but recent work by Rex Minerals has expanded the mineralisation zone and have categorised this deposit as part of the IOCG-U family. A prominent characteristic of the Hillside IOCG mineralisation is the conversion of magnetite to hematite which in previous works on IOCG-U deposits was shown to be related to the mineralisation process. Two main mineralizing episodes can be distinguished, an earlier one was extremely Fe rich and allowed the formation of magnetite and pyrite. The second stage of mineralisation involved the injection of copper mineralizing fluids concurrent with the widespread replacement of magnetite by hematite. Analysis of the iron oxides was carried out using optical methods as well as trace element and rare earth element analysis by Electron Probe Micro Analysis and Laser Ablation ICP MS. The trace elements were used to identify compositional signature variations between the different iron oxide minerals. The rare earth element analysis showed a distinct overall enrichment in the hematite samples compared to the magnetite. The trace element analysis showed that several elements are distributed differently between the two oxides and sulphides. These elements include Cr, Zn, V, Ti, Ni, Pb and Co which show anomalies in both the oxides and sulphides. A variation between what elements are enriched is dependent on the mineral they are found within. This is suggested to reflect changes in composition of the mineralising fluid from the early magnetite-pyrite to the late hematite-chalcopyrite stage. The sulphides showed that chalcopyrite was enriched in several trace elements compared to <b>pyrite.</b> <b>Sulphur</b> isotope data were derived for pyrite and chalcopyrite also to characterise the source of the fluids. There was no systematic difference between chalcopyrite and pyrite. The data did show negative values between - 2. 6 δ 34 S and - 6. 6 δ 34 S which indicates that the source of the sulphur is most likely magmatic. This study gives an indication into the change in conditions that caused the replacement of magnetite by hematite and therefore the changes that caused mineralisation. An element signature was also collected to identify the difference between the iron oxides that will help in future works on this deposit. Thesis (B. Sc.

Selenium and tellur­ium contents of sulphides from both groups of deposits are similar. Vanadium was not found in any of the samples. The ores have been metamorphosed.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{constrain}} marine redox {{conditions for the}} sedimentary environments immediately preceding the rapid diversification of metazoans carbon and sulphur isotopes, as well as carbon, sulphur and iron abundances, were measured in shales, cherts, and carbonates from two Lower Cambrian (Nemakit-Daldynian to Atdabanian) sections belonging to a shallow shelf and deeper water basinal environment on the Yangtze Platform, South China. A largely anoxic and most probably sulphidic deeper water body {{for most of the}} Nemakit-Daldynian and lower Tommotian is supported by positive δ 34 S values for sulphide, as well as high degree of pyritization (DOP) and total organic carbon (TOC) values. Additionally, an isotope fractionation between organic and carbonate carbon of > 32 ‰ suggests that sulphate reducing and sulphide oxidizing bacteria flourished and added to the biomass. Furthermore a positive correlation between δ 34 S of sulphide and δ 13 C of organic and possibly inorganic carbon is observed. In the lower Tommotian, low δ 13 C values for organic and inorganic carbon together with lower δ 34 S values for pyrite, if compared to underlying and overlying samples, have been measured. This is indicative of bacterial sulphate reduction taking place not only in the interstitial waters but also in an anoxic, possibly euxinic water column, and thus leading together with chemoautotrophic bacteria to recycling of organic matter, superimposed on the temporal evolution of the global carbon cycle. In the upper Tommotian and Atdabanian, decreasing DOP and TOC and high δ 34 S values for <b>pyrite</b> and organic <b>sulphur</b> suggest that the water column became oxic and that bacterial sulphate reduction occurred primarily in the sediment, where sulphate limitation was soon established. Organic carbon and carbonate carbon isotope ratios increase, reflecting open marine conditions and oxic photosynthesis dominating carbon cycling in the shelf environment. In the basinal deeper water section, anoxic conditions were still present or re-established during the upper Tommotian. In the lower Atdabanian, δ 34 S is variable, but mostly high in the deeper section, with DOP indicating an oscillation between oxic and dysoxic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Siilinjärvi {{acid and}} {{fertilizer}} plant in Finland, belonging to Yara International has {{a requirement for}} pyrite as feed material. Due to forthcoming exhaustion of Pyhäsalmi mine and the current supply to the plant, the possibility of pyrite production and sale to Yara is being investigated. The Aitik copper mine is {{owned and operated by}} Boliden AB since the discovery of the Aitik- Salmijärvi sulphide mineralisation in 1930. In the Aitik concentrator, valuable metals is being separated from gangue through flotation. Rougher and cleaner circuits produces two tailing products, "high sulphur" and "low sulphur". The HS product was used as feed material for all laboratory tests due to its high pyrite content. Two methods is available to allow pyrite flotation, sulphuric acid and soda ash, both of which removes calcium ions existing on the particle surfaces that prevents it from becoming hydrophobic. Trisodium citrate have shown similar characteristics in other studies when separating Cu-Pb and was decided to be evaluated as a potential method for pyrite flotation. Results indicates the HS product in Aitik concentrator is suitable for flotation and that all methods tested, has potential to produce a high quality concentrate to meet eventual requirements. Using sodium citrate in the flotation process contributed to a dry froth and adding nasfroth was needed to make the method work. Applying the sodium citrate method at slightly acidic conditions, produced very high-quality pyrite concentrates in terms of grade and particularly <b>pyrite</b> recovery. Both <b>sulphur</b> analysis using Leco instruments by ALS and elementary analysis using X-Ray Fluorescence in Aitik concentrator, has shown questionable results. The calibration used for pyrite analysis in Aitik, is in need of additional pure pyrite concentrates to minimize standard deviation and increase its accuracy. Results provided by ALS showed sulphur grades exceeding the theoretical sulphur grade in pure pyrite quite extensively, and was thought not to be elementary sulphur due to its extent. The matter was discussed, but the grades remained the same in reanalysis and the true reason of the high sulphur content remains unknown. Validerat; 20160607 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The common sulphide mineral pyrite is abundant throughout sedimentary uranium systems at Pepegoona, Pepegoona West and Pannikan, South Australia. No in-depth geochemical and textural characterisation {{of this important}} mineral has previously been conducted. Multiple micro-analytical techniques have successfully constrained textural and chemical patterns within the pyrite. Results point to variation in fluid composition, sulphur source and precipitation conditions during a protracted mineralisation event. In-situ micron-scale sulphur isotope analysis of pyrite demonstrated broad-scale isotopic heterogeneity (delta 34 S= - 43. 9 to + 32. 4 ‰CDT), indicative of complex, multi-faceted <b>pyrite</b> evolution and <b>sulphur</b> derived from two or more sources. Preserved textures support this assertion and indicate a genetic model involving more than one phase of pyrite formation. Authigenic, pre-ore pyrite underwent prolonged evolution and recrystallisation, evidenced by a genetic relationship between archetypal framboidal aggregates and pyrite euhedra. Secondary hydrothermal pyrite commonly displayed hyperenrichment of several trace elements (Mn, Co, Ni, As, Se, Mo, Sb, W and Tl) in ore-bearing horizons. Hydrothermal fluids of magmatic and meteoric origin supplied metals to the system but the geochemical signature of pyrite suggests a dominant granitic source and influence of mafic lithologies. Irregular variation in  34 S, coupled with oscillatory trace element zonation in secondary pyrite, is interpreted in terms of continuous variations in fluid composition and possible cycles of diagenetic recrystallisation. A late-stage oxidising fluid, which mobilised selenium from pre-existing pyrite, caused ongoing pyrite re-crystallisation and precipitation of native selenium. These results provide the first qualitative constraints on the formation mechanisms of the uranium deposits at Beverley North. Insight into depositional conditions and sources of both sulphide and uranium mineralisation allow for a preliminary paragenetic scheme for the ore systems. This new understanding of pyrite geochemistry can also underpin an effective vector for uranium exploration, not only at Beverley North, but throughout the sedimentary systems of the Lake Eyre Basin.

40|$|We have {{determined}} (1) the abundance and isotopic composition of <b>pyrite,</b> monosulphide, elemental <b>sulphur,</b> organically bound sulphur, and dissolved sulphide; (2) {{the partition of}} ferric and ferrous iron; (3) the organic carbon contents of sediments recovered at two sites drilled on the Peru Margin during Leg 112 of the Ocean Drilling Program. Sediments at both sites are characterised by high levels of organically bound sulphur (OBS). OBS comprises up to 50 % of total sedimentary sulphur and up to 1 % of bulk sediment. The weight ratio of S to C in organic matter varies from 0. 03 to 0. 15 (mean = 0. 10). Such ratios are like those measured in lithologically similar, but more deeply buried petroleum source rocks of the Monterey and Sisquoc formations in California. The sulphur content of organic matter is not limited by the availability of porewater sulphide. Isotopic data suggest that sulphur is incorporated into organic matter within a metre of the sediment surface, at least partly by reaction with polysulphides. Most inorganic <b>Sulphur</b> occurs as <b>pyrite.</b> Pyrite formation occurred within surface sediments and was limited by the availability of reactive iron. But despite highly reducing sulphidic conditions, only 35 - 65 % of the total iron was converted to sulphide; 10 - 30 % of the total iron still occurs as Fe(III). In surface sediments, the isotopic composition of pyrite {{is similar to that}} of both iron monosulphide and dissolved sulphide. Either pyrite, like monosulphide, formed by direct reaction between dissolved sulphide and detrital iron, and/or the sulphur species responsible for converting FeS to FeS 2 is isotopically similar to dissolved sulphide. Likely stoichiometries for the reaction between ferric iron and excess sulphide imply a maximum resulting FeS 2 :FeS ratio of 1 : 1. Where pyrite dominates the pool of iron sulphides, at least some pyrite must have formed by reaction between monosulphide and elemental sulphur and/or polysulphide. Elemental sulphur (S°) is most abundant in surface sediments and probably formed by oxidation of sulphide diffusing across the sediment-water interface. In surface sediments, S° is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulphide, FeS and FeS 2 and is unlikely to have been involved in the conversion of FeS to FeS 2. Polysulphides are thus implicated as the link between FeS and FeS 2...|$|R
40|$|The Early Jurassic coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from CRA Exploration Pty Ltd. (CRAE), drilled in the Gairdner and Mintaja Blocks, Gairdner Range of the Hill River Area, northern Perth Basin, Western Australia. The area is located approximately 280 km north of Perth. The coal measures subcrop in a half- graben bounded by the Lesueur-Peron Fault in the west, and the Warradarge Fault in the east. The coal occurs within the shallow sequence of the Cattamarra Member which is also described as the Cattamarra Coal Measures of the Cockleshell Gully Formation. Six sub-seams of seam G, namely G 1 to G 6, from the six drill cores, were examined for petrological and geochemical investigation. The coal predominantly comprises of banded, dull banded, and dull lithotypes, with minor bright banded, bright and fusainous types. Based on maceral analyses, the dominant maceral groups are vitrinite and inertinite, whilst the exinite and mineral matter are in minor contents. The vitrinite content has a range between 47. 2 % to 73. 0 %, and it is composed mainly of telocollinite and desmocollinite. The inertinite is dominated by semifusinite, fusinite, and inertodetrinite, {{and it has a}} range from 10. 4 % to 24. 8 %. The exinite group varies between 7. 2 % to 20. 8 % in content, and it is represented by sporinite, cutinite, alginite and resinite. The mineral matter dominated by clays and pyrite, ranges between 4. 5 % to 20. 6 %. The microlithotype analyses shows that the vitrite plus clarite content varies from 47. 0 % to 70. 0 %, intermediates between 8. 0 % to 26. 0 %, whilst inertite plus durite content is relatively low, varying from 6. 55 % to 14. 0 %. The maximum reflectance of vitrinite has a value between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 %, which represents rank at sub-bituminous level based on the Australian rank values and corresponding to the sub-bituminous A and B rank of the ASTM classification and to the metalignitous type of the Pareek classification. On the basis of carbon and hydrogen content, the coal is categorised as per-hydrous meta- to ortho-lignitous type. The trace elements As, B, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, V, Y, Zn, and Zr, are spectrographically analysed in the coal ash. The B content in the coal supports the presence of marine influence during peat deposition in the basin. On the basis of lithotype, maceral, microlithotype, trace element distribution, <b>pyrite</b> and total <b>sulphur</b> in the coal, the depositional environment for coal and the coal measures, is interpreted as an upper to lower delta type within a regressive phase of marine transgression...|$|R
