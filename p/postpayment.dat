40|$|Objective Improving {{response}} rates, {{particularly among}} physicians, {{is important to}} minimize nonresponder bias and increase the effective sample size in epidemiologic research. We conducted a randomized trial to {{examine the impact of}} prepayment vs. <b>postpayment</b> incentives on response rates. Study design and setting Self-completion postal questionnaires were mailed to 949 physicians who were respondents to an earlier survey and representative of the general physician population in Hong Kong. These physicians were randomly allocated to receive a HK$ 20 cash prepayment incentive that accompanied the survey (n= 474) or a <b>postpayment</b> reward of the same amount on receipt of the completed questionnaire (n= 475). Results The final prepayment response rate was 82. 9 %, compared with 72. 5 % in the <b>postpayment</b> arm (P <. 001). Of the eight alternative incentive and follow-up strategies evaluated, three lie on the efficiency frontier (i. e., not dominated), including <b>postpayment</b> with three mailings at HK$ 42. 7, prepayment with three mailings at HK$ 66. 5 and prepayment with three mailings and telephone follow-up at HK$ 112. 1 per responder recruited (US$ 1 =HK$ 7. 8). Conclusion The findings demonstrate that prepayment cash incentives are superior to <b>postpayment</b> of the equivalent amount in improving response rates among a representative sample of Hong Kong physicians. Further research should concentrate on confirming the generalizability of these findings in other health care occupation groups and settings. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) contractors that conduct <b>postpayment</b> reviews on Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims were established by different legislative actions; are managed by different offices within CMS; and serve different functions in the program. These contractors include (1) Medicare Administrative Contractors that process and pay claims and are responsible for taking actions to reduce payment errors in their jurisdictions; (2) Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC) that investigate potential fraud, which can result in referrals to law enforcement or administrative actions; (3) Recovery Auditors (RA) tasked to identify improper payments on a <b>postpayment</b> basis; and (4) the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) contractor that reviews a sample of claims nationwide and related documentation to determine a national Medicare FFS improper payment rate. All four types of contractors conduct complex reviews, in which the contractor examines medical records and other documentation sent by providers {{to determine if the}} claims meet Medicare coverage and payment requirements. RAs are paid fees contingent on the amount of the claims that are found improper and recouped or adjusted, whereas the other contractors' reimbursement is not dependent on the amount of their claims reviews. The RAs conducted almost five times as many reviews as the other three contractors combined. Overall, compared to over one 1 billion claims processed in 2012, all four types of contractors combined reviewed less than one 1 percent of claims, about 1. 4 million reviews, for which providers might be contacted to send in medical records or other documentation. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the four states GAO reviewed are implementing processes to verify whether providers met the Medicare and Medicaid EHR programs requirements and, therefore, qualified to receive incentive payments {{in the first year}} of the EHR programs. To receive such payments, providers must meet both (1) eligibility requirements that specify the types of providers eligible to participate in the programs and (2) reporting requirements that specify the information providers must report to CMS or the states, including measures that demonstrate meaningful use of an EHR system and measures of clinical quality. For the Medicare EHR program, CMS has implemented prepayment processes to verify whether providers have met all of the eligibility requirements and one of the reporting requirements. Beginning in 2012, the agency also has plans to implement a risk-based audit strategy to verify on a <b>postpayment</b> basis that a sample of providers met the remaining reporting requirements. For the Medicaid EHR Program, the four states GAO reviewed have implemented primarily prepayment processes to verify whether providers met all eligibility requirements. To verify the reporting requirement, all four states implemented prepayment processes, <b>postpayment</b> processes, or both. CMS officials stated that the agency intends to evaluate how effectively its Medicare EHR program audit strategy reduces the risk of improper EHR incentive payments, though the agency has not yet established corresponding timelines for doing this work. Such an evaluation could help CMS determine whether it should revise its verification processes by, for example, implementing additional prepayment processes, which GAO has shown may reduce the risk of improper payments. In addition, CMS has opportunities to improve the efficiency of verification processes by, for example, collecting certain data on states behalf. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Medicaid Integrity Group's (MIG) hiring of separate review and audit contractors for its National Medicaid Audit Program (NMAP) was inefficient and led to duplication because key functions were performed by both entities. Review contractors analyze state claims data to identify aberrant claims or billing anomalies while audit contractors conduct <b>postpayment</b> audits to determine if payments to providers were improper. Because both types of contractors had to assess whether payments were improper under state Medicaid policies, having separate contractors doubled states' burden in ensuring that state policies were being correctly applied. Also, poor coordination and communication between {{the two types of}} contractors resulted in duplicative data analysis. In turn, these inefficiencies added to the length of audits, which on average took almost 23 months to complete. By contrast, the average duration of six audits using a more collaborative and coordinated approach was 16 months, and the amount of identified overpayments increased significantly. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that 24 million Americans have diabetes, many of whom are Medicare beneficiaries. These individuals carefully monitor their blood glucose levels primarily through the use of in-home blood glucose testing kits. Although the test is relatively simple, the cumulative expense of providing glucose test strips and lancets to patients is ever increasing, both to the Medicare program and to uninsured individuals who must pay out-of-pocket for these testing supplies. This article discusses the diabetes durable medical equipment (DME) coverage under Part B Medicare, the establishment and role of DME Medicare administrative contractors, and national and local coverage requirements for diabetes DME suppliers. This article also discusses the federal government’s ongoing concerns regarding the improper billing of diabetes testing supplies. To protect the Medicare Trust Fund, the federal government has contracted with multiple private entities to conduct reviews and audits of questionable Medicare claims. These private sector contractors have conducted unannounced site visits of DME supplier offices, interviewed patients and their families, placed suppliers on prepayment review, and conducted extensive <b>postpayment</b> audits of prior paid Medicare claims. In more egregious administrative cases, Medicare contractors have recommended that problematic providers and/or DME suppliers have their Medicare numbers suspended or, in some instances, revoked. More serious infractions can lead to civil o...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increasing {{attention}} {{is being paid}} to the affordability of medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LICs and MICs) where medicines are often highly priced in relation to income levels. The impoverishing effect of medicine purchases can be estimated by determining pre- and <b>postpayment</b> incomes, which are then compared to a poverty line. Here we estimate the impoverishing effects of four medicines in 16 LICs and MICs using the impoverishment method as a metric of affordability. Methods and Findings: Affordability was assessed {{in terms of the}} proportion of the population being pushed below US$ 1. 25 or US$ 2 per day poverty levels because of the purchase of medicines. The prices of salbutamol 100 mcg/dose inhaler, glibenclamide 5 mg cap/tab, atenolol 50 mg cap/tab, and amoxicillin 250 mg cap/tab were obtained from facilitybased surveys undertaken using a standard measurement methodology. The World Bank’s World Development Indicators provided household expenditure data and information on income distributions. In the countries studied, purchasing these medicines would impoverish large portions of the population (up to 86 %). Originator brand products were less affordable than the lowest-priced generic equivalents. In the Philippines, for example, originator brand atenolol would push an additional 22 % of the population below US$ 1. 25 per day, whereas for the lowest priced generic equivalent this demographic shift is 7 %. Given related prevalence figures, substantial numbers of people are affected by the unaffordabilit...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This letter responds to a Department of the Army request for our views on whether certain payment procedures included in the Defense Department's (DOD) proposed Families First Personal Property Program conform with relevant criteria in GAO's Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. Families First is a DOD initiative to reengineer its processes for transporting household goods and personal property for its service members and civilians. Army's request {{is in response to}} a Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) recommendation that DOD seek our views specifically on whether the proposed procedures for electronic billing and payment meet the supporting documentation requirements in Title VII of GAO's Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. While the General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for issuing federal regulations for transportation, including moves of household goods and personal property as well as agency prepayment and <b>postpayment</b> audit requirements for transportation payments, we are responsible for issuing fiscal guidance based on authorities in the U. S. Code. We considered DOD's proposed process of electronic billing and payment in light of our requirements established in Title VII for disbursements and related documentation. Our views are based on our understanding of DOD's planned implementation of the Families First program on a conceptual basis.
