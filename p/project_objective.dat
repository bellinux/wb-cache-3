5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas. The <b>project</b> <b>objective</b> {{is to learn}} the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E

40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>objectives</b> are a core concept {{within the}} field of project management. This paper reports {{research}} findings that attempts to identify understandings of the term „project objectives”. Firstly, a review is undertaken of key project management literature pertaining to the concept of <b>project</b> <b>objectives.</b> Secondly, a survey is conducted of 37 members of the project management community. The research highlights a myriad of definitions of the term „project objectives”. The most common definition is that <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> refers to the time and cost <b>objectives</b> of the <b>project.</b> However, there is some support for distinct alternative interpretations, namely that <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> refers to the deliverables of the project, or to the project 2 ̆ 7 s benefits. It is concluded that the project team needs to have a consistent understanding of <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> to avoid miscommunication. Alternatively, the term „project objectives‟ should be avoided and less ambiguous terms used, such as deliverables, benefits and time and cost objective...|$|R
30|$|A high {{percentage}} of projects fail to comply with <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> (Huff and Prybutok 2008; Shepherd and Cardon 2009; Whittaker 1999). Such deviations from the project management plan are predominantly caused by risks, i.e., uncertain events or conditions that, if they occur, have a positive or negative effect on a <b>project’s</b> <b>objectives</b> (Bryde and Volm 2009; PMI 2008). Thus, we concluded that occurrence probability of risks and their potential impact on <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> may be insufficiently reflected in anticipated project success, as otherwise, such deviations would not occur as frequently.|$|R

50|$|RIDE is {{a project}} that aims to provide a solid {{foundation}} for the action plans of eHealth Communication COM 356. It begun on 01/01/06 and ended on 31/12/07.

The lack of complete harmonisation between clinical practice, terminology and EHR systems have highlighted that there is an unrealistic expectation in developing a single universally clinical data model.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the DNV approach to project risk man-agement. It enhances {{most of the}} known approaches in two ways. First, it adds an initiation phase {{at the start of}} the process, before risk identica-tion is started, in which the <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> are dened. Knowing the <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> it is much easier to identify risks and link them to the <b>project</b> <b>objectives</b> they have an impact on. The second aspect is the pos-sibility of creating a risk model that includes all risks and their impact on various objectives, capturing their complex interaction. This way, the total risk picture of the project can be modelled and estimated, and un-certainties that aect more than one objective (often favourable against one objective, unfavourable against another) can be handled correctly. The presented (generic) ideas enhance and enrich currently available ap-proaches for software project risk mangement...|$|R
