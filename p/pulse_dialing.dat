25|$|The rotary dial is {{a device}} mounted on or in a {{telephone}} or switchboard {{that is designed to}} send electrical pulses, known as <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing,</b> corresponding to the number dialed. The early form of the rotary dial used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes. The rotary dial was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. Strowger filed U.S. patent#486,909 on December 21, 1891 that was later issued on November 29, 1892.|$|E
50|$|Historically, not all {{push-button}} telephones used DTMF dialing technology. Some manufacturers implemented <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> with push-button keypads {{and even}} Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional dial pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} telephone. Pulse-mode push-button keypads typically stored the dialed number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid dialing for the user. Some push button pulse dial phones allow for double-speed <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> These allow even faster <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> in exchanges that recognize double-speed <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|E
50|$|While a tone-to-pulse {{converter}} {{could be}} deployed to any existing mechanical office line using 1970s technology, its speed {{would be limited}} to <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> rates.The new central office switches were backward-compatible with rotary dialing.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} standard for telephone signaling utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more {{commonly known as}} touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower <b>pulse</b> <b>dial</b> system. The push-button format is also used for all cell phones, but with out-of-band signaling of the dialed number.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of TADs a special {{transmitter}} for DTMF tones (dual-tone multi-frequency signalling) was regionally required for remote control, since the formerly employed <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling</b> is not apt to convey appropriate signalling along an active connection, and the dual-tone multi-frequency signalling was implemented stepwise.|$|R
5000|$|By 1935, {{message routing}} {{was the last}} great barrier to full automation. Large {{telegraphy}} providers began to develop systems that used telephone-like rotary dialling to connect teletypewriters. These machines were called [...] "Telex" [...] (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling</b> for circuit switching, and then sent data by ITA2. This [...] "type A" [...] Telex routing functionally automated message routing.|$|R
50|$|It was {{recognized}} {{as early as the}} 1940s that faster, more accurate dialing could be done with push buttons, but this was too unreliable in customer trials until transistors transformed the industry. In 1963, the Bell System introduced to the public its dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology under the name Touch-Tone, which was a trademark in the U.S. until 1984. The Touch-Tone system used push-button telephones. In the decades after 1963, <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> was gradually phased out as the primary dialing method to the central office, but many systems still support rotary telephones today. Some keypad telephones have a switch for the selection of tone or <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing,</b> decadic dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|E
50|$|A rotary dial is a {{component}} of a telephone or a telephone switchboard that implements a signaling technology in telecommunications known as <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> It is used when initiating a telephone call to transmit the destination telephone number to a telephone exchange.|$|E
50|$|Although DTMF was {{the driving}} {{technology}} implemented in push-button telephones, some telephone manufacturers used push-button keypads to generate <b>pulse</b> <b>dial</b> signaling. Before {{the introduction of}} touch-tone telephone sets, the Bell System sometimes used the term push-button telephone to refer to key system telephones, which were rotary dial telephones that also had a set of push-buttons to select one of multiple telephone circuits, or to activate other features.|$|R

50|$|As {{telephone}} companies continued to levy surcharges for touch-tone service long after any technical justification ceased to exist, a push-button telephone with <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> capability represented {{a means for}} a user to obtain the convenience of push-button dialing without incurring the touch-tone surcharge.|$|E
50|$|The {{conductors}} {{other than}} the two central tip and ring conductors are in practice variously used {{for a second or}} third telephone line, a ground for selective ringers, low-voltage power for a dial light, or for anti-tinkle circuitry to prevent <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> phones from sounding the bell on other extensions.|$|E
5000|$|The Tandy 200 was {{introduced}} in 1984 as a more capable sister product of the Model 100. The Tandy 200 has a flip-up 16 line by 40 column display and came with 24 KB RAM which can be expanded to 72 KB (3 banks of 24 KB). Rather than the [...] "button" [...] style keys of the Model 100, its four arrow keys are a cluster of keys {{of the same size}} and shape as those comprising the keyboard, though the function and command [...] "keys" [...] are still of the button type. The Tandy 200 includes Multiplan, a spreadsheet application. It also added DTMF tone dialing for the internal modem, whereas the Model 100 only supports <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> On a phone line that doesn't support <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing,</b> users may dial manually using a touch-tone phone and then put the Model 100 online.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{their lack}} of modern features, rotary phones {{occasionally}} find special uses. For instance, the anti-drug Fairlawn Coalition of the Anacostia section of Washington, D.C., persuaded the phone company to reinstall rotary-dial pay phones in the 1980s to discourage loitering by drug purchasers, since the dials {{could not be used}} to call dealers' pagers. They are also retained for authenticity in historic properties such as the U.S. Route 66 Blue Swallow Motel which date from an era of named exchanges and <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Note: {{the tone}} signal after dialing [...] "8" [...] is {{compulsory}} on old analog (with <b>pulse</b> mode <b>dialing)</b> exchanges and optional on digital (tone mode dialing) exchanges.|$|R
50|$|The {{most complex}} {{internal}} part was the rotary dial mechanism, an assembly of gears, cams, springs, and electrical contacts which mechanically generated a timed train of line loop-break <b>pulses</b> when the <b>dial</b> finger wheel was released after rotation. During {{the period of}} dial rotation, the receiver was shunted to avoid hearing the <b>dialing</b> <b>pulses.</b>|$|R
50|$|As <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> is {{achieved}} by interruption of the local loop, it was in principle possible to dial a telephone number by rapidly tapping, i.e. depressing, the switch hook the corresponding number of times for each digit at approximately ten taps per second. However, many telephone makers implemented a slow switch hook release to prevent rapid switching.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> {{came into}} use for {{telephone}} exchanges, pen registers had obvious applications as diagnostic instruments for recording sequences of telephone dial pulses. With {{the passage of}} time, any instrument {{that could be used}} for this purpose came to be defined as a pen register. Title 18 of the United States Code defines a pen register as: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{contacts}} {{other than}} the two central tip and ring contacts are in practice used for various things such {{as a ground for}} selective ringers, low voltage power for a dial light, or for 'anti-tinkle' circuitry to prevent <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> phones from ringing the bell on other extensions. With tone dialing, anti-tinkle measures are not required.|$|E
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending <b>dial</b> <b>pulses,</b> equivalent to a rotary <b>dial's</b> <b>pulsing,</b> but sent over trunk circuits between switches.|$|R
5000|$|Low digits: in {{the days}} of rotary dial telephones, using only those digits that require the least dial {{rotation}} (1 and 2) permitted a dial lock in hole 3 to effectively disable unauthorised access to the telephone network without preventing access to the emergency number 112. The same choice also maximised dialling speed. Additionally, telephone systems used <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling</b> instead of later DTMF tones; briefly activating the hook once has the same effect as dialling [...] "1", so repeatedly pushing the hook might result in calling 1-1-1. For this reason, Germany's police emergency number was changed from 111 to 110. With numeric keypads, pressing only the first and second button on the keypad is marginally easier in a difficult situation than other keys.|$|R
40|$|The kit will detect DTMF tones from a {{telephone}} line or via an onboard microphone and display {{them on a}} 16 character, single line display. Up to 32 numbers can be displayed by scrolling the display left and right. There is also a serial output for sending the detected tones to a PC. The kit will not detect numbers <b>dialled</b> using <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling.</b> The kit is controlled by an Atmel 89 C 2051 microcontroller (source code not supplied nor available.) This kit replaces the old K 56 Tone Grabber kit. ASSEMBLY Check the components supplied in the kit against the parts list.

50|$|The {{communication}} circuits {{of the public}} switched telephone network continue to be modernized by advances in digital communications; however, other than improving sound quality, these changes have been mainly transparent to customers. In most cases, the function of the local loop presented to the customer for connection to telephone equipment is practically unchanged and remains compatible with <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> telephones.|$|E
50|$|Automation {{introduced}} <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing</b> {{between the}} telephone and the exchange, so that each subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected to the same exchange, but long distance calling across multiple exchanges required manual switching by operators. Later, more sophisticated address signaling, including multi-frequency signaling methods, enabled direct-dialed long distance calls by subscribers, culminating in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network that controlled calls between most exchanges {{by the end of}} the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|A ringer box {{consists}} of bells or gongs and an electromagnetically-driven clapper which strikes the gongs when actuated. The electromagnet of the clapper {{responds to the}} alternating current sent from a central office exchange or another phone via the telephone network wiring. The direct current required by the telephone's audio circuitry is blocked with a capacitor before entering the ringer to prevent the ringer from being triggered by circuit interruptions and <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing.</b> Typical ring voltages {{are in the range}} from 60 to over 100 Volts, and alternate at a frequency of 20-30 Hertz.|$|E
5000|$|... 111 was {{specifically}} {{chosen to be}} similar to Britain's 999 service. With <b>pulse</b> <b>dialling,</b> New Zealand telephones pulse in reverse to the UK - dialling 0 sent ten pulses, 1 sent nine, 2 sent eight, 3 sent seven, etc. in New Zealand, while in the UK, dialling 1 sent one pulse, 2 sent two, etc. In the early years of 111, the telephone equipment was based on British Post Office equipment, except for this unusual orientation. Therefore, dialling 111 on a New Zealand telephone sent three sets of nine pulses to the exchange, exactly the same as UK's 999. Number [...] "9" [...] in New Zealand (or [...] "1" [...] in Britain) was not used for the start of telephone numbers because of the likelihood of accidental false calls from open-wire lines tapping together etc.|$|R
5000|$|Many client {{software}} programs existed for BBS connections back then, but {{one in particular}} for C64 or Commodore64 was optimized just for DDial, call Eagleterm 6a. Written by Jungle Jim (Jj), aka Jim Sanders, and released as freeware and saw widespread use among Ddialers. EagleTerm6a took full advantage of Commodore 64 <b>pulse</b> <b>dial</b> modem technology, heavily optimized to find the max pulse speed of the user's local phone connection, and rapid fire re-dial back in to beat the other callers when reconnecting, easily beating the newer tone dial modems just coming to market. During peak times, the DDial system was jam packed with callers far exceeding the number of available lines, and a super fast dialer was a plus. Later versions of Eagleterm6a were protected against reverse engineering (not de-compilable using unBlitz.) ...|$|R
50|$|Most analog {{telephone}} adapters do not decode <b>dial</b> <b>pulses</b> generated by rotary dial telephones, supporting only touch-tone signaling, but pulse-to-tone converters are commercially available.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{service codes}} {{may also be}} {{considered}} as abbreviated dialing, though these prefix the special touch-tone characters * and # (or often 11 for <b>pulse</b> <b>dialing)</b> instead of using only numerals. Most are used to access calling features rather than a called party, and some are specific to each telephone company. Some are used only locally or regionally (such as *FHP (*347) to reach the Florida Highway Patrol); other codes as short as one numeral (like *1) are used to report breaking news or traffic to the newsrooms of local news radio or TV stations.|$|E

It used a DC signalling system comprising {{a number of}} rectifier diodes arranged in different polarity configuration according to the button pressed. The 726 also required an ground wire {{as well as the}} usual A and B wires. The irony was that the dial signal still had to be converted to pulses in the host PABX.|$|E
