5|$|The CAB Rating for {{the show}} was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening <b>programs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular {{established}} shows such as The Shadow and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes did not perform as well – but {{it was less than}} half of Texaco's Fire Chief, which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be because of the time slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners were listening to the radio at 7:00p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Jack Pearl's Baron Münchhausen, and Fire Chief all aired after 9:00p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and Five-Star Theater was not renewed for a second season.|$|E

5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion <b>programs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E

5|$|The Lions {{explosion}} {{becomes one}} of the major accidents in spaceflight history and sets Japan's spaceflight program back by over a decade. In the years following the accident, the public accuses those involved with the Lion program of negligence. Rumors also begin to circulate about the offshore outsourcing of the rocket's production despite the government's claims that it was developed domestically. To promote recovery from the tragedy, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology establishes the Tokyo National Space School in 2014 as a vocational high school dedicated to training a new generation of students in the space sciences. Japan's spaceflight program is finally reactivated ten years later with the admission of students into the academy's astronaut training program. In the same year, the last operating module of the International Space Station is retired and destroyed by atmospheric reentry following completion of the station's long-term mission. Subsequent development projects are to be completed by individual countries with active spaceflight <b>programs.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> students in the inaugural class of the astronaut training program, one is selected to join the crew of Japan's second manned mission in 2027. It is the final mission toward completing a space-based solar power satellite.|$|E
