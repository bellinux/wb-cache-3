5|$|At least 1,283 geysers have {{erupted in}} Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, {{and an average}} of 465 geysers are active there in a given year.

5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas.

5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} <b>plumbing</b> systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
