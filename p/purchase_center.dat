The refinery provides {{a host of}} very challenging problems in production/procurement planning. Two typical production/procurement planning problems are investigated, which are single item capacitated lot sizing problems oriented refineries, and multi-item procurement planning problems in distributed supply chain with multi-suppliers, multi-refineries and multi-customs. Due to the characters in petrochemical products, the total demands are always more than production capacities. On the other side, even the total demands are less than production capacities, since the rule of meeting demands may lead to excessive inventory holding costs in some periods, it is cheaper to permit lost sales {{in order to get}} maximum profit. Furthermore, by analyzing the practical production/procurement planning on special cases in a refinery, the production capacity is high enough, but the reorder quantities are restricted by inventory capacity instead of production capacity. A single item dynamic lot size model with inventory capacity and lost sales is formulated. Subsequently, we extend a single item inventory capacity economic lot sizing model with lost sales to more general cost functions, which are concave functions. Stockout and conservation models are considered as well. Zero Inventory Order property cannot be used anymore here. Two strongly polynomial algorithms are developed based on some new properties, respectively. Some theoretical analyses for algorithms are performed. The computational results show that proposed approaches could get a satisfactory solution and has potential to practical production applications. Finally, by analyzing the crude oil procurement planning for distributed supply chain with multi-suppliers and multi-refineries, a purchasing problem originating from the <b>purchase</b> <b>center</b> as buyer’s point of view is described. The refineries outsource their crude oil procurement to <b>purchase</b> <b>center</b> for scale economies. A multi-objective procurement planning model is established, which not only minimizes supply chain cycle time, the total costs of earliness and tardiness penalties, production costs and transportation costs, but also considers quality and delivery on time. Through model transformation, the objective function can be solved by the general mathematical programming methods. The numerical computations demonstrates that the approach proposed is efficient and applicable, which can not only make effective procurement planning, minimize the cycle time of the supply chain，but also can choose the suppliers reasonably and optimize the configuration of resources...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the kind of relationship between Cause Related Marketing (CRM) campaigns, brand perceptual dimensions and cultural traits as possible antecedents of consumer purchase intentions in the country of Iran. An initial conceptualization was developed from mainstream literature to be validated through empirical research. The conceptualization was then tested with quantitative survey data collected from about 384 consumers studying in different <b>purchase</b> <b>centers</b> in Esfahan. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the hypothesis derived from literature. The findings indicate that consumer purchase intentions are influenced by the cause related marketing campaigns. Furthermore it was observed that the perceptual brand equity dimensions and cultural values partially mediate the impact of CRM campaigns on consumer purchase intentions. The data was gathered from <b>purchase</b> <b>centers</b> in Esfahan only. Hence, future research could extend these findings to other cities in Iran to test their generalizing ability. This research has key implications for companies, charities and academic to effective use of cause related marketing campaigns in Iran. The study contributes to cause related marketing literature by indicating a mediating role of perceptual brand equity and cultural values on CRM campaigns and consumer purchase intentions. The mediating role of culture and perceived quality was ignored in previous studies. Moreover, it contributes to close the gap of empirica...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} marketing process {{and structure of}} raisin in North Khorasan Province. Survey {{data were collected from}} 187 producers, 12 middleman, 2 processing factories and one rural cooperative society in 2003. The results showed that the share of producer, marketing margin and marketing cost in export price in main channel of marketing (producer, middleman, manufactory, export) are 55. 3, 44. 6 and 26. 9 %, respectively. Also, the marketing efficiency of main channel (with high market share) is less than the second channel (producer, cooperative, manufactory, export). Regard to results, establishment rural <b>purchasing</b> <b>center</b> with guarantee price, improving efficiency of extension service, training for better processing so as to improve quality of product, constructing marketing data banks as well as undertaking marketing research can increase total profit and social welfare through reducing marketing costs...|$|R
