50|$|When Sarmanian {{launched}} the company, most computer and electronics manufacturers were fabricating their own boards. Independent suppliers, however, became increasingly efficient and were proving a more cost-effective solution {{for a broad}} range of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board applications. Likewise, computer and electronics manufacturers became more comfortable using suppliers for key electronic components, including <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards. Reductions in time to market, engineering/prototyping costs, and manufacturing ramp-up costs were being demonstrated by these suppliers to win business. In 1979, 40% of all rigid <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board fabrication was being outsourced to suppliers like PCC. By 1989, that figure was about 60%, and by 1995, 80%. By 2001, 98% of all <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board production was going to external suppliers.

Owing to the diversity of materials and components, the separation process is difficult, which results in complex and expensive recovery of precious materials and electronic components from waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards.

As an example, the maturity of desoldering technology is analysed with a technology maturity mapping system model. What is more, desoldering methods in different stages are analysed and compared. According to the analysis, the technological evolution trends are predicted to be 'the law of energy conductivity' and 'increasing the degree of idealisation'.
