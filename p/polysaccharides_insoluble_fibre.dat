The defatted passion fruit seed (PFS) contained {{a high level}} of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> (similar to 90 %, w/w) of desirable characteristics and physicochemical properties. Cellulose, pectic substances and hemicellulose were the major structural polysaccharides of the PFS <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre.</b> In this study, the influence of the PFS <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> on the activities of ileum mucosal enzymes and colonic bacterial enzymes was investigated. It was found that the incorporation of the PFS <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> into a fibre-free diet at 5 % level significantly (p < 0. 05) enhanced the intestinal amylase activity (137 %), reduced the caecal pH (6. 22), decreased the caecal ammonia content (- 38. 6 %) and faecal ammonia output (- 21. 2 %), and also decreased the activities of beta-D-glucosidase (- 37. 4 %), beta-D-glucuronidase (- 52. 9 %), mucinase (- 35. 5 %) and urease (- 91. 4 %) in faeces. Our results suggested that PFS <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> might exert favourable effects on intestinal health. The fact that PFS <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> was more effective than cellulose in improving intestinal health suggested it could be exploited as a new functional ingredient to promote intestinal function and health.

A redistribution of <b>fibre</b> components from <b>insoluble</b> to soluble fractions was observed. The treatments, especially the high-pressure micronisation, effectively (P < 0. 05) increased the physicochemical properties (e. g. water-holding capacity, swelling capacity, oil-holding capacity, cation-exchange capacity and glucose-adsorption capacity) and also the inhibitory activity towards alpha-amylase and pancreatic lipase of the <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> to different extent (from several up to c. fifteenfold).

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a growing trend to find new sources of dietary fibre (DF), such as marine algae {{by-products}} that have traditionally been undervalued. In this respect, the aim of the present investigation was firstly to compare two methods of dietary fibre quantification (Englyst and Prosky) and secondly to determine the chemical composition and some of the functional properties of total and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> extracted in accordance with the Englyst method. The dietary fibres of dried Ulva lactuca collected from the Tunisian littoral were determined by the Prosky (gravimetric method) and Englyst (enzymatic-chemical method) methods. The two extraction methods (Englyst–Prosky) provided approximately the same values in total fibres (~ 54 %). However, they had different <b>insoluble</b> and soluble <b>fibre</b> contents. U. lactuca contained 20. 53 % and 31. 55 % of soluble fibres and 34. 37 % and 21. 54 % of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> using the Prosky and Englyst methods, respectively. The fractionation of the <b>insoluble</b> dietary <b>fibre</b> concentrate revealed that hemicellulose was the most abundant fraction (32. 49 %), followed by cellulose (16. 59 %) and “lignin-like” compounds (1. 53 %). For both fibre concentrates, the main neutral sugar was glucose (20. 70 %– 27. 59 %), which corresponded to hemicellulose and cellulose. The water holding capacity of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> concentrate was relatively high. It varied between 9. 32 g and 10. 3 g of water/g of dry fibre at 25 °C and 80 °C, respectively. Nevertheless, the oil holding capacity of the <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> concentrate was not affected by temperature. It was about 1. 08 and 1. 01 g of oil/g of dry fibre at 25 °C and 80 °C. Despite the significant functional properties of fibre concentrate, the presence of lead limits its use as an ingredient in the food industry. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{findings}} {{demonstrated that}} {{particle size reduction}} of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> materials (i. e. starfruit insoluble fibre-rich fraction and cellulose) to micro-sizes effectively enhanced their physicochemical properties, which provided clues to their physiological functions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of particle size reduction of these <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> by micron technology on indices of bowel health. RESULTS: Feeding of the micronised fibres (9. 68 - 14. 3 mu m), especially those prepared by high-pressure micronisation, effectively (P < 0. 05) improved various caecal and faecal indices, such as decreasing the caecal ammonia concentration (by 20. 0 - 30. 0 %), increasing the faecal output (135 - 150 %) and moisture content (143 - 1571 / 0) and lowering the activities of undesired beta-D-glucosidase (by 39. 2 - 43. 6 %) and P-D-glucuronidase (by 71. 4 - 77. 5 %) in faeces of hamsters. Relationships between physicochemical properties and physiological functions of the micronised fibres were considered. The results also demonstrated that the type, processing and related particle size of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> were important factors affecting their physicochemical properties and physiological functions. CONCLUSION: The consumption of micronised <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> at 5 % level might exert a favourable effect on improving various caecal and faecal indices.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the effect of incorporating <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> in UHT treated beverages {{in order to improve}} the nutritional profile of these product concepts. A variety of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> are used including orange fibre, kibbled wheat fibre and oat fibre, whose particle size distribution ranges over an order of magnitude from 372 to 35 µm. The work demonstrates that the overall acceptability of UHT beverages is significantly affected by the particle size distribution and level of fibre addition varying from 0. 5 to 5 % w/w in formulations. The colour appearance of the UHT beverages is also influenced by the incorporation of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> where preparations with wheat fibre appear darker than their counterparts. Results indicate a positive relationship between fibre characteristics and beverage consistency, with increasing concentration or size distribution in particles yielding higher steady-shear viscosity. Further, extended storage over 12 weeks at 22 °C exhibits increasing viscosity at a given concentration and type of fibre, whereas storage at 30 °C results in increasing flow, which is an interesting outcome for the commercialisation of the industrially based formulations...|$|R

Aim: To conduct a systematic review of the efficacy of soluble and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> supplementation in CIC. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fibre with placebo or no therapy in adult CIC patients. Studies had to report dichotomous data assessing response to therapy, or continuous data examining either effect of therapy on mean number of stools per week, or mean symptom scores. Adverse events data were extracted where reported. Results: Six RCTs were eligible. Four used soluble <b>fibre</b> and two <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre.</b> Formal meta-analysis was not undertaken due to concerns about methodological quality of identified studies. Compared with placebo, soluble fibre led to improvements in global symptoms (86. 5 % versus 47. 4 %), straining (55. 6 % versus 28. 6 %), pain on defaecation, and stool consistency, {{an increase in the}} mean number of stools per week (3. 8 stools per week after therapy compared with 2. 9 stools per week at baseline), and a {{reduction in the number of}} days between stools. Evidence for any benefit of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> was conflicting. Adverse events data were limited, with no RCT reporting total numbers. Conclusions: Soluble fibre may be of benefit in CIC, but data for <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> are conflicting.

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a common}} chronic gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain/discomfort, altered bowel habits and abdominal bloating/distension. This review aimed at presenting the recent developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, {{and there is no}} evidence that gluten causes the debated new diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre.</b> On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production, abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain. However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> diet in combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for IBS patients...|$|R
40|$|Experimental design {{methodology}} {{was used to}} determine significant factors affecting the extraction yield of soluble and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> from Agave americana L. and in second time to find optimum conditions leading to the highest yield.

Ionic strength affected significantly soluble fibre extraction yield and was the most important factor among nonsignificant ones influencing <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres</b> extraction yield. Then, a Box-Behnken design was carried out to maximise fibres extraction.

40|$|Partly {{replacing}} malt with unmalted barley is a {{trend in}} brewing. The use of unmalted barley, however, leads to issues such as haze and high mash viscosity, due to its higher content of undesired components. Pearling, an abrasive method to remove the outer layers of the barley kernels {{has been shown to}} reduce the content of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre,</b> ash, protein and polyphenols; the ß-amylase activity and starch content of the remaining kernel were hardly affected. Removing the outer 5 % of the kernel, for example, results in a 15 % reduction of insoluble arabinoxylans, 23 % of the <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> content and 25 % of the water holding capacity of the non-starch components. It also reduces the ash content by 19 % and the polyphenol content by 11 %, but only 0. 20 % of the starch is pearled off. A relation was found between the <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> content and the water holding capacity of a fraction. Lower fibre content reduces the water holding capacity and thus the volume of the spent grains, which implies that less wort and sugar are lost during filtration. In addition, that the bran fraction remains dry, implies a reduction in energy required to dry the spent grains...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stroke risk is {{modifiable}} {{through many}} risk factors, one being healthy dietary habits. Fibre intake {{was associated with}} a reduced stroke risk in recent meta-analyses; however, data were contributed by relatively few studies, and few examined different stroke types. METHODS: A total of 27 373 disease-free women were followed up for 14. 4 years. Diet was assessed with a 217 -item food frequency questionnaire and stroke cases were identified using English Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality records. Survival analysis was applied to assess the risk of total, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke in relation to fibre intake. RESULTS: A total of 135 haemorrhagic and 184 ischaemic stroke cases were identified in addition to 138 cases where the stroke type was unknown or not recorded. Greater intake of total fibre, higher fibre density and greater soluble <b>fibre,</b> <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> and fibre from cereals were associated with a significantly lower risk for total stroke. For total stroke, the hazard ratio per 6 g/day total fibre intake was 0. 89 (95 % confidence intervals: 0. 81 – 0. 99). Different findings were observed for haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke in healthy-weight or overweight women.

Without fasting, rabbits were carried to a slaughterhouse and processed following standard techniques. Rabbits fed a high fibrous diet in the last week of the fattening period (56 - 63 d) maintained their growth rate when NDF dietary level increased from high commercial levels (41 %) up to near 50 %. However, when this diet was fed to rabbits following a moderate NDF (33 %) diet in the growing period, feed intake increased greatly, but not enough to maintain growth rate. Dietary treatments did not significantly influence live weight before and after transport. Full gastrointestinal weight decreased by feeding the highest fibrous diet (49 % NDF) in the last week of the fattening period if a high fibre diet (41 % NDF) was also fed in the growing period, but th...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{diseases}} {{have been}} linked to a common pathogenic process called amyloidosis, whereby proteins or peptides clump together in the brain or body to form toxic soluble oligomers and/or <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibres.</b> An attractive strategy to develop therapies for these diseases is therefore to inhibit or reverse protein/peptide aggregation. A diverse range of small organic ligands have been found to act as aggregation inhibitors. Alternatively, the wild-type peptide can be derivatised so that it still binds to the amyloid target, but prevents further aggregation. This can be achieved by adding a bulky group or charged amino acid to either end of the peptide, or by incorporating proline residues or N-methylated amide groups...|$|R
40|$|The results {{indicate}} that ARBOCEL® can promote equal weight gain of mink in different using amounts. Results show that ARBOCEL® is suitable ingredient in mink feed during production period. The effect {{on the quality of}} the skins was positive. It is recommended to use maximum 2 % of ARBOCEL® in fur animal feed according to the period (Rekilä 2003). The use of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fibre</b> in feed is recommended especially when a) feed consistency or energy content of the diet has to be modified, b) water intake should be ensured or c) if high doses of fat is used as an ingredient of the feed. ...|$|R
