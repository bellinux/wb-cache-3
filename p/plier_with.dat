50|$|A single {{spun yarn}} may be crochet as is, or braided or <b>plied</b> <b>with</b> another. In <b>plying,</b> {{two or more}} yarns are spun together, almost always in the {{opposite}} sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually <b>plied</b> <b>with</b> an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|R

40|$|For {{composite}} laminates thickness optimisation, {{this article}} {{is focused on the}} thickness variation problems in laminates manufactured <b>with</b> <b>plies</b> drop-offs. The ends of plies within the laminates infer three-dimensional stresses and singularities. Some tests were achieved on specific test pieces for 9 to 5 <b>plies</b> transitions. <b>With</b> optical investigations, these tests showed non-stationary delamination for a particular strength. Some radiographies were done to watch the extent of delaminated areas, and a finite element model enabled us to define an initiation criterion in the ends of the <b>plies</b> <b>with</b> the energy restitution rates and to determine the characteristics of delaminations growing, as analogy to singularities of geometrical accidents...|$|R

50|$|Camco drum shells {{during the}} Oak Lawn and Chanute periods {{tended to be}} either three or four <b>ply</b> <b>with</b> glue rings. When they moved to Los Angeles, the company changed shell {{manufacturers}} and opted for a six <b>ply</b> <b>with</b> glue ring construction. Though quite different in sound, both periods have their fans. Most collectors tend to favour the Oak Lawn period, simply because these were the original drums (and to an extent Chanute, which used the same shells as when the company was in Oak Lawn). Pre-LA the drums would have white-painted interiors {{if there was a}} plastic wrapped exterior and a clear lacquered interior if the outer was also a lacquer finish. LA shells always had clear lacquered interiors regardless of their exterior finish.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a feasibility study for steering delaminations through {{the thickness of}} composite laminates. The mechanism relies {{on the fact that}} delaminations tend not to migrate through <b>plies</b> <b>with</b> fibres oriented in the propagation direction. In this study, <b>plies</b> <b>with</b> fibres oriented in the propagation direction are angled through the thickness in order to steer delamination migration. Both static tests (mode I) and fatigue tests (skin-stiffener debond specimen) have shown the feasibility of this mechanism. Tensile and flexural tests have been performed in order to quantify the effect of this architecture on the global mechanical properties. A significant knockdown in longitudinal tensile strength has been observed, while, the effect on stiffness and flexural properties seems to be less significant...|$|R
