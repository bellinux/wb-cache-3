This {{contribution}} {{will focus}} on the core question if, how and to what extent the EU <b>procurement</b> rules and <b>principles</b> (may) affect the national health care systems. We start our analysis by summarizing the applicable EU public <b>procurement</b> legislation, <b>principles</b> and soft law and its exact scope in relation to health care. (section 2). Subsequently, we turn to the parties in a contract, subject to procurement rules in the field of health care, addressing both the definition of contracting authorities and relevant case law (section 3). This will then lead to an analysis of possible justifications for not holding a tender procedure in the field of health care (section 4). Finally, we illustrate the impact of EU public procurement rules on health care by analysing a Dutch case study, in which the question whether public hospitals in the Netherlands qualify as contracting authorities in terms of the Public Sector Directive stood central (section 5).

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{experiences}} in software development processes between a public sector organisation and several software vendors over a decade-long period are described and interpreted. Three information systems histories {{are presented as}} case examples and their analysis is based on detailed insider observations. A social process model is {{used to describe the}} relationships between key actors within the client organisation while a transaction cost framework is used to explain the joint forms of the relationships between the client and the vendors. The resulting model depicts in a concise way how the relationships have evolved and stabilised over time. In this model, major encounters between the actors are those which have at least the potential to change the relationship state between the parties. The relatively stable passages between consecutive encounters are labelled episodes. By perceiving systems development as a series of encounters and episodes, it is possible to identify the critical turning points of development work and to display the dynamics of a software development trajectory. While our findings support the well-known basic software <b>procurement</b> <b>principle,</b> this is only after the trajectories have stabilised. Two of the three trajectories exhibit major changes in software procurement strategies before reaching a steady state.

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} analyses {{the procurement}} rules of international organisations or agencies performing collaborative defence procurement in the European Union (EU). In collaborative defence procurement, States agree to procure equipment or services for their {{armed forces in}} common, thereby sharing development costs and looking for economies of scale. The management of collaborative defence procurement programmes is often entrusted to an international organisation or agency {{acting on behalf of}} the participating States. After setting out the political, economic and legal context of collaborative defence procurement in the EU, we analyse the applicability of domestic and EU law to international organisations, in particular public procurement law in the field of defence. The conclusion of this first part is that, whilst domestic and EU law apply in general terms to international organisations or agencies, this is subject to the substantive provisions of the relevant laws and to international law, such as the privileges and immunities of the organisations. Specifically, international organisations or agencies in the EU most likely would not have to comply with domestic procurement law or with the EU public procurement directives, but they would still have to comply with the <b>procurement</b> <b>principles</b> flowing from the EU Treaties, except if non-EU Member States control their decision-making. We then move on to an analysis of the procurement rules of three international organisations or agencies performing collaborative defence procurement in the EU: the Joint Organisation for Armaments Cooperation (OCCAR), the NATO Maintenance and Supply Organisation (NAMSO) and the European Defence Agency (EDA). For these organisations we analyse to what extent their procurement rules should comply with EU law, to what extent they are an efficient set of rules, and what measures could be taken to remedy any detrimental issue or incoherence identified. We conclude with recommendations aiming to improve the applicable law...|$|E
40|$|Construction sector {{policy makers}} have the {{opportunity}} to create improvements and develop economic, social and environmental sustainability through supply chain economics. The idea of the supply chain concept to improve firm behaviour and industry performance is not new. However there has been limited application and little or no measurement to monitor successful implementation. Often purchasing policies have been developed with sound strategic <b>procurement</b> <b>principles</b> but even these have had limited penetration in to the processes and practices of infrastructure agencies. The research reported in this paper documents an action research study currently being undertaken in the Australian construction sector which aims to explore supply chain economic policy implementation for sectoral change by two government agencies. The theory which informs this study is the emerging area of construction supply chain economics. There are five stages to the project including; demand analysis, chain analysis, government agency organizational audit, supplier strategy and strategic alignment. The overall objective is towards the development of a Supplier Group Strategy Map for two public sector agencies. Two construction subsectors are examined in detail; construction and demolition waste and precast concrete. Both of these subsectors are critical to the economic and environmental sustainability performance of the construction sector and {{the community as a whole}} in the particular jurisdictions. The local and state government agencies who are at the core of the case studies rely individually on the performance of these sectors. The study is set within the context of a sound state purchasing policy that has however, had limited application by the two agencies. Partial results of the study are presented and early findings indicate that the standard risk versus expenditure procurement model does not capture the complexities of project, owner and government risk considerations. A new model is proposed in this paper, which incorporates the added dimension of time. The research results have numerous stakeholders; they will hold particular value for those interested in regional construction sector economics, government agencies who develop and implement policy and who have a large construction purchasing imprint and the players involved in the two subsectors. Even though this is a study in Australia it has widespread applicability as previous research indicates that procurement reform is of international significance and policy implementation is problematic...|$|E

This paper provides recommendations as a result of the analysis carried out by this team. FOR DECISION: The Alliance and Fund Boards are requested to consider and decide upon the following recommendations: 4. 1 To adopt new procurement objectives found on page 5 and 24. 4. 2 To decide on the composition of a reference group to report to the GAVI Secretariat, to oversee supply and procurement issues and work closely with the procurement agent (page 6 and 24).

40|$|MBA - WBSThe {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to discover the determinants of Procurement Service Provider (PSP) design and utilisation within a South African context. The first stage was to identify these constructs from both the literature and from a panel of experts utilising the Delphi technique, and then to build a model that took all of the inter-relationships of these constructs into account. Whilst the majority of the constructs unearthed could be applied universally, the one key area of differentiation within the South African procurement environment is Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE), and the proposed Preferential Procurement (PP) legislation in particular. The experts were questioned on their perception {{of the impact of the}} proposed legislation on procurement, with the aim of determining whether or not the design of a South African PSP would need to differ substantially from those in the United States and Europe. The feedback from the experts painted a rather pessimistic view of the effects of Preferential Procurement legislation on companies attempting to develop world-class procurement operations. They overwhelmingly agreed in Round One that costs would increase as would procurement and sourcing cycle times, and that there would be a reduction in control over cost, quality and delivery. With further analysis and clarity, Round Two’s results showed that the experts largely agreed on several other effects of the proposed BBBEE legislation. They felt that sustainable cost control, speed to market, risk reduction and reduced administrative and transactional costs would all be negatively affected. However, other results emerged from the Delphi panel that considerably affected the overall impact of the legislation. The experts agreed that the legislation was complex to understand and implement, and that due to the III importance of compliance, companies would be encouraged to centralise their procurement decision making. Top management would have to become aware of the increasing commercial impact of procurement and elevate the strategic status of the function to not only attain compliance to the BBBEE legislation, but to derive competitive advantage out of it. Having populated the Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) model with all the constructs from the literature as well as the BBBEE legislation construct, with all of their inter-relationships drawn from the literature and the panel of experts, {{the research}}er ran the model. In many cases the results were opposite to what the experts had stated. The strength of the model is that it has the ability to take all of the inter-relationships of every construct in the model with every other construct into account. The experts were viewing the impact of the proposed BBBEE legislation on each construct individually. What this did was ignore the spiralling affect that is created by the myriad of factors other than BBBEE legislation that impact procurement. Having seen the outcome of the model 85 percent of the expert panel accepted that they had underestimated the impact of the increased strategic focus on procurement by top management and the powerful chain reaction it creates within procurement and the business. They agreed that BBBEE legislation was the catalyst that initiated this transformation of procurement from back-office function to strategic player and that it needed to be embraced. Rather than constraining procurement in South Africa, the legislation may be the spark that will force top management to elevate the strategic status of procurement. By doing this they will allocate adequate resources and funding for the tools required to implement world-class principles. What is required to achieve competitive advantage locally is an understanding and embracing of the new legislation in conjunction with universal world-class <b>procurement</b> <b>principles.</b> IV “This legislation may well prove to be the best thing that every happened to procurement in South Africa…” (van Niekerk, 2006, personal conversation) So what are the determinants of PSP design and utilisation in South Africa?

The determinants are not altered or made redundant when applied locally, even in response to the challenges and opportunities imposed by the proposed BBBEE legislatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{normative}} {{meaning of}} collaboration implies all things good, and many organisations {{claim that they}} are working collaboratively with others to achieve the attendant benefits. This thesis assesses 'strategic' collaboration in the Australian Government‘s ICT outsourcing programme to explore the wider research topic on whether the public sector is seeking beneficial outcomes in {{its relationship with the}} private sector, above those obtained through traditional government procurement practices. Based on the limited study, the thesis concluded that strategic collaboration was being sought, at least as portrayed in the Australian Government ICT outsourcing environment, and on this basis, the findings support the wider position that the public sector is seeking benefits above those achieved through government procurement practices. In this thesis, 'organisational relationships' are distinguished from the underlying 'structural (contractual) arrangement', and it is argued that all outcomes from organisational relationships are collaborative, varying in their achievement of 'tactical' through to 'strategic' outcomes. Traditional government <b>procurement</b> practices and <b>principles</b> such as competitive tendering and value for money, are only regarded as achieving tactical outcomes since they are procedurally based, and their scope and benefits are one-sided. The thesis analyses relationship outcomes using an empirically developed public-private relationship model, and against a benchmark of strategic collaboration, defined as a voluntary amalgamation of organisations for mutual opportunity creation. The findings have implications for researchers on collaboration, and for the public and private sector practitioners who manage these relationships on a daily basis. Of most significance to both groups are the contributions of: a differentiation between an 'organisational relationship' and the underlying 'structural arrangement'; a description of the collaborative outcomes of organisational relationships, ranging from tactical to strategic; an empirically developed public-private relationship model; and a generic relationship framework. Researchers on collaboration will particularly benefit from the generic relationship framework developed in the thesis, as it provides a robust foundation from which to base research on collaboration in specific sectors—as this thesis did into collaboration in public-private ICT outsourcing. The framework departs from the traditional view of describing a relationship only at a high level, and instead, explores the detail of the 'constructs of the relationship'. This is a more robust approach since the impact of individual elements of the relationship can be investigated, which leads to a more thorough understanding of the interaction between the organisations. The framework also establishes the notion of a two-dimensional model encompassing the relationship constructs, but also the relationship outcomes—recognising that collaboration is not a single outcome. For those practitioners who manage the day-to-day public-private relationships in the Australian Government ICT outsourcing environment, this thesis provides practical guidance on an approach to progressing and managing the relationships. It informs the practitioners on seven specific areas of a relationship where focus is best directed. Furthermore, it also describes what the performance characteristics of the participating organisations would need to be, to meet particular levels of collaborative outcome...|$|R
40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, overriding reasons of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts awarded by private entities outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to declare certain aids compatible with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary <b>procurement</b> law <b>principles.</b> Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the <b>principles</b> of primary <b>procurement</b> law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market mechanismes is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution tariffs due to decisions of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market mechanismes mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the <b>principles</b> of primary <b>procurement</b> law stated by the Court of Justice (advertising requirements, award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|R
