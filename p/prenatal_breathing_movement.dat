40|$|<b>Breathing</b> <b>movements</b> in {{the sheep}} fetus have been {{observed}} from a gestational age of about 40 days. From 95 to 115 days fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> are almost continuous, interrupted by apnoea rarely exceeding 2 min. From 115 days until term (about 147 days) <b>breathing</b> and <b>movements</b> of the trunk and limbs are episodic. Breathing normally occurs only during rapid-eye-movement sleep as identified by low-voltage cortical electrical activity. Active movements of the neck muscles occur predominantly in high-voltage electrocortical activity. Hypercapnia or acid cerebrospinal fluid perfusion cause {{an increase in the}} regularity and depth of breathing when present, and recruit intercostal and laryngeal abductor activity. Isocapnic hypoxia, however, in contrast to the hyperventilation seen postnatally, causes arrest of fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements.</b> This effect is due to a central inhibition. Section of the brain stem, from the caudal hypothalamus rostrally, causes dissociation of fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> and electrocortical activity into independent rhythms. Section of the brain stem caudally, in the upper pons or at the inferior colliculus, also causes a dissociation of electrocortical activity from <b>breathing</b> <b>movements,</b> which become almost continuous. Isocapnic hypoxia causes an increase in the rate and depth of <b>breathing</b> <b>movements.</b> It is concluded that the arrest of breathing in intact fetal lambs is not due to a direct effect on the respiratory centre in the medulla. The lumbar polysynaptic flexor reflex response becomes episodic after 115 days gestation but, in contrast to fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements,</b> is enhanced during high-voltage electrocortical activity. Isocapnic hypoxia arrests movements of the fetal limbs and trunk and inhibits the lumbar flexor reflex. This inhibition of the reflex is prevented by section of the spinal cord at T 12, but persists after section of the brain stem in the upper pons. It is attributed to an action on the medulla, independent of the systemic arterial chemoreceptors. Small doses of pentobarbitone (5 mg/kg) cause arrest of fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> by a suprapontine mechanism, abolished by brain stem transection, and inhibition of the lumbar flexor reflex by an action on the spinal cord, persisting after transection at T 12. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthetase (indomethacin, meclofenamate or aspirin) induce continuous fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements,</b> while prostaglandin E 2 arrests fetal breathing. The site of action is on the medulla, as shown by section of the brain stem and of afferents from the systemic arterial chemoreceptors. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|In 17 fetuses with {{intrauterine growth}} {{retardation}} (IUGR), we studied {{the quantity of}} general <b>movements</b> and fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In IUGR fetuses, cross-sectional comparisons were made between the quantity of fetal movements and (1) the fetal clinical condition and (2) the quality of general movements. In addition, the quantity of fetal movements in IUGR was compared with that in uncomplicated pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated by premature rupture of the amniotic membranes. In IUGR, the quantity of general movements declined from 25 weeks gestation onwards, whereas the quantity of fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> increased. Longitudinal assessment of these parameters was obtained in four cases and showed a decline of general movements. No relationship between prenatal longitudinal data and neonatal outcome could be observed. Relating the quantity of general <b>movements</b> and <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> to the fetal condition, growth retarded fetuses were divided into three groups according to fetal deterioration. 1. Normal amount of amniotic fluid and normal fetal heart rate patterns. 2. Reduced amount of amniotic fluid. 3. Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. The quantity of general movements {{as well as that}} of <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> was low in group 3, compared to group 1. In group 2 only the quantity of <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> and not of general movements was low. A similar pattern was found in the relation with the quality of general movements observed during fetal deterioration. Cross-sectional analysis of median values (28 - 31 weeks gestation) did not reveal differences in the quantity of general movements when IUGR, normal pregnancies and premature rupture of the membranes (with or without oligohydramnios) were compared. The quantity of fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> was significantly lower in pregnancies complicated by IUGR and by premature rupture of the membranes with oligohydramnios compared to those of normal pregnancies and premature rupture of the membranes without oligohydramnios.

Similar to the quality of general movements, the quantitative variables were related to the fetal condition. However, in contrast to the quality of general movements, the quantity of general <b>movements</b> and <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> showed a high inter- and intraindividual variation.

However, there are no standardized reference values of <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> available for use in clinical practice. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the 3 -dimensional distances of observational points on the thorax and abdomen during breathing in healthy subjects and to assess the effects of age, posture, and sex on <b>breathing</b> <b>movements.</b> METHODS: We studied the 3 -dimensional <b>breathing</b> <b>movement</b> distances of the thorax and abdomen in 100 healthy subjects (50 males, 50 females). <b>Breathing</b> <b>movements</b> were measured with a 3 -dimensional motion system during quiet and deep breathing with subjects in supine and sitting positions. Thirteen reflective markers were placed on the upper (the clavicles, 3 rd ribs, and sternal angle) and lower thorax (the 8 th ribs, 10 th ribs, and xiphoid process) and the abdomen (upper abdomen and lateral abdomen). Range of <b>movement</b> in both <b>breathing</b> conditions was measured as the 3 -dimensional distance at half respiratory cycle. Respiratory rates were calculated based on the <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> ana-lyzed. One-way analysis of variance, t tests, and multiple regression were used for statistical anal-ysis. RESULTS: The average marker distances for the thorax and abdomen during quiet breathing were less than one third of those during deep <b>breathing.</b> Upper thoracic <b>movement</b> was significantly decreased with age. There was less abdominal movement in females than in males, except during quiet breathing in the supine position. The distances between the thoracic markers were greater and those of the abdomen were less during quiet and deep breathing in the sitting position, compared with those in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the observed breathing move-ments were related to the effects of age, sex, and posture. These findings are in agreement with those reported in previous studies.

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: Fetal medicine unit at the Charite University Hospital in Berlin. METHODS: Assessment of tracheal fluid flow was attempted in 340 healthy fetuses (GA 20 - 40 weeks) in which fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> were seen by B-mode scan. Colour Doppler was applied to visualise the tracheal fluid flow, followed by spectral Doppler to record the velocity waveforms. The records of 53 fetuses divided into five gestational age groups (20 - 23, 24 - 27, 28 - 31, 32 - 35 and 36 - 40 weeks of gestation) containing 40 or more continuous breathing cycles (inspiration and expiration) were considered for analysis. Only regular breathing phases were examined and the volume obtained by integration of the tracheal fluid flow displaced during fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> was calculated. RESULTS: The intra-tracheal flow volume moved during inspiration (Vi) and expiration (Ve) increased until 36 weeks of gestation after which there was a flattening until term.

These responses also occurred during isocapnic hypoxia, though the stimulation of breathing was less than in normoxic lambs. Apomorphine had no consistent effects on the blood gases, pH, heart rate or blood pressure. In fetal lambs with the carotid nerves and vago-sympathetic trunks sectioned, apomorphine had the same effects as in intact lambs, except {{that there was a}} small fall in arterial O 2 pressure (Pa,O 2). Haloperidol (0. 5 - 1 mg I. V.) had no effect on spontaneous <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> or electrocortical activity, but blocked all responses to apomorphine for several hours.

In addition, a longitudinal analysis of the trends in preterm labour in the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford between 1973 and 1981 has been performed. Finally, an attempt has been made to clarify the relationship between prostaglandin E 2 and fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements.</b> The analysis of the trends in preterm labour in Oxford has shown that the incidence of preterm delivery remains unaltered. Of these patients, however, those eligible for tocolytic therapy (unexplained spontaneous preterm labour) form a small proportion. The incidence of extreme prematurity in this group is very low and the neonatal outcome is good. The presence or absence of Fetal <b>Breathing</b> <b>Movements</b> (FBM) by defined criteria is shown to be a highly sensitive index of whether the preterm labour is going to progress to delivery or not in singleton pregnancies with intact membranes. Its significance is lost when the membranes are ruptured and in multiple pregnancies. In pregnancies complicated by antepartum haemorrhage {{the presence or absence of}} Fetal <b>Breathing</b> <b>Movements</b> does not predict further haemorrhage leading to delivery. Fetal <b>Breathing</b> <b>Movement</b> status on admission bears no relationship to neonatal outcome and gives no indication of the presence of intrauterine infection. Silent chorioamnionitis has been highlighted as an important cause of "unexplained" preterm labour. Gross Fetal Body Movements (FM) are shown to give no early indication of impending preterm delivery. Evidence is presented to suggest that significant diminution in Fetal Movements is related to poor neonatal outcome. Ultrasonic measurement of the uterine cervix has been found to be technically feasible but of no benefit in the diagnosis of ongoing preterm labour. The relationship between prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and the cessation of fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movement</b> has been approached by elucidating the maternal absorption of PGE 2 from a vaginal pessary. This then enabled me to sample fetal blood at the time of maximal maternal concentrations (the time we expect the fetal concentration to be greatest). This was performed by fetoscopy and demonstrated that a significant rise in fetal bicycleprostaglandin-E-metabolite (bicyclo-PGEM) occurs following maternal vaginal administration of PGE 2. Using this information FBM has been assessed two and a half hours following the vaginal administration of PGE 2. Although inconclusive, no reduction in FBM was demonstrated. as the bicyclo-PGE metabolite is used to assess PGE levels, this evidence decreases the probability that PGE mediates the reduction in FBM with the onset of labour...|$|R

Oligohydramnios reduces the intrathoracic cavity size, thus disrupting fetal lung growth and leading to pulmonary hypoplasia. The exact mechanism by which oligohydramnios alters the respiratory system structure and the effect of oligohydramnios on long-term respiratory outcomes remain unknown. In this review, we summarize the effects of oligohydramnios on lung development, discuss the mechanisms of oligohydramnios-induced pulmonary hypoplasia identified in various animal studies, and describe the long-term respiratory outcomes in childhood of oligohydramnios-exposed fetuses reported by a population-based study...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of oligohydramnios-related pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) is not understood, but {{is known to}} involve chronic loss of lung liquid. In order to investigate the recent suggestion that fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> are absent or diminished in oligohydramnios-related PH, we made continuous recordings of fetal <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> (FBM) during chronic lung drainage in tracheostomized fetal sheep. FBM remained present throughout the drainage period. There {{was no significant difference}} in the number or duration of FBM epochs in tracheostomized fetuses compared to controls, although there was a slight reduction in incidence between 126 and 133 days (P = 0. 02). PH in the fetuses undergoing chronic lung liquid drainage was confirmed by significant reductions in lung weight, volume, DNA, and total airspace, and in altered maturation. This study is consistent with other data suggesting that inhibition of FBM is not the primary {{mechanism of}} oligohydramnios-related pulmonary hypoplasia...|$|R
40|$|Technical {{advances}} {{during the}} last several decades have greatly facilitated research into fetal physiology and behavior, specifically fetal <b>breathing</b> (FB). <b>Breathing</b> <b>movements</b> have been demonstrated in the fetuses of every mammalian species investigated and appear to be part of normal fetal devel-opment. In this review we focus on the methods of measuring FB and on some of the problems associated with these measurements and their inter-pretation. We also review fetal behavior, the role of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors in spontaneous FB, the fetal respiratory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, and the transition to continuous breathing at birth. It is clear that in many ways the control of <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> in utero differs from that after birth. In particular, inhibitory influences are much more prominent before than after birth. Possibly {{this is due to the}} unique fetal situation, in which conservation of energy may be more impor-tant than any advantage breathing activity imparts to the fetus. carotid body; peripheral chemoreceptor; central chemoreceptor; birt...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} aspects of fetal behaviour were studied in nine healthy nulliparae {{during the second}} half of pregnancy. Continuous real-time ultrasound observations of 60 min duration were carried-out at four-weekly intervals from 20 to 36 weeks of gestation, using two dynamically focussed linear array transducers positioned lengthwise allowing viewing of saggital sections through the entire fetus. Various movement patterns were classified according to de Vries et al. (de Vries, J. I. P., Visser, G. H. A. and Prechtl, H. F. R (1982) : The emergence of fetal behaviour I. Qualitative aspects. Early Hum. Dev., 7, 301 - 22). The reproducibility as expressed by the mean standard deviation in the analysis of the percentage incidence of the different movement patterns was good (1. 6 - 2. 2 %). Both the incidence and percentage of observation time in which general movements were present decreased with advancing gestational age. <b>Breathing</b> <b>movements</b> frequently occurred as an isolated phenomenon; occasionally they were associated with jaw movements, swallowing, hiccups or general movements. The incidence of <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> as well as the percentage of observation time in which <b>breathing</b> <b>movements</b> were present, demonstrated an increase up to 32 weeks with a drop at 36 weeks of gestation. Hiccups occurred episodically, following each other in regular succession. Both the incidence and the percentage of observation time in which hiccups were present fluctuated widely. Stretches and startles displayed a decrease in incidence with advancing gestational age, whilst eye movements showed an increase. Rythmical jaw movements were often followed by swallowing...|$|R
