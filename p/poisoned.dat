5|$|Warfarin has {{traditionally}} been used to kill rodents, but many populations have developed resistance to this anticoagulant, and difenacoum is often substituted. These are cumulative poisons, requiring bait stations to be topped up regularly. <b>Poisoned</b> meat {{has been used for}} centuries to kill animals such as wolves and birds of prey. <b>Poisoned</b> carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders, not only the targeted species. Raptors in Israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests.|$|E

50|$|The splash-back <b>poison</b> frog (Ranitomeya variabilis), also {{referred}} to as the variable <b>poison</b> frog or Zimmermann's <b>poison</b> frog, is a small species of <b>poison</b> dart frog known from the upper Huallaga River drainage of San Martín Region, Peru. It is semi-arboreal, living in the forest understory and canopy. Like other <b>poison</b> frogs, it contains alkaloid <b>poisons.</b> The mimic <b>poison</b> frog is a Müllerian mimic of this species.|$|R
50|$|The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog, {{while not}} the most toxic <b>poison</b> dart frog, is still a highly toxic animal. The very small amount of <b>poison</b> the frog {{possesses}} {{is enough to make}} a human heart stop beating. However, like most <b>poison</b> dart frogs, the green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog only releases its <b>poison</b> if it feels threatened, and wild specimens can be handled provided the human holding it is calm and relaxed. The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog, as with all <b>poison</b> dart frogs, loses its toxicity in captivity due to a change in diet. This has led some scientists to believe that the green-and-black <b>poison</b> frog actually takes its <b>poison</b> from the mites and other insects on which it feeds.|$|R

5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was <b>poisoned,</b> resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were <b>poisoned,</b> including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{propensity}} of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned {{the theory that}} Alexander was <b>poisoned.</b> Justin stated that Alexander {{was the victim of}} a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, {{as the head of the}} alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be <b>poisoned</b> by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.|$|E

25|$|Acute <b>poisoning</b> is {{exposure}} to a <b>poison</b> on one occasion or during {{a short period of}} time. Symptoms develop in close relation to the exposure.

In some circumstances, many of these materials can potentially induce <b>poisoning.</b> In excessive amounts, chemicals that are usually harmless, even apparently safe drugs can cause <b>poisoning.</b> To reduce the morbidity and mortality and overall burden of <b>poisoning</b> in the community, consideration {{should be given to}} developing education program as an effective tool and establishing <b>poison</b> information centers...|$|R
