We focused on the bidding behavior <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> and the contract price of exhibits. First, we proposed a relational framework among exhibits, number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> and the contract price. Next, we utilized a neural network model to estimate the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> and the contract price. Subsequently, we investigated {{the relationship between the}} number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> and the contact price, and evaluated our method through an analysis that employed verifying data. Lastly, we listed our suggestions for bidding in auction markets...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} managerial {{question is}} {{the choice of the}} pricing rule. We study whether this choice depends on the uncertainty about the number <b>of</b> participating <b>bidders</b> by comparing expected revenues under discriminatory and uniform pricing within an auction model with affiliated values, stochastic number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> and linear bidding strategies. We show that if uncertainty about the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> is substantial, then the discriminatory pricing generates higher expected revenues than the uniform pricing. In particular, the first-price auction might generate higher revenues than the second-price auction. Therefore, uncertainty about the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> is an important factor to consider when choosing the pricing rule. We also study whether eliminating this uncertainty, i. e., revealing the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> is in the seller's interests, and discuss the existence of an increasing symmetric equilibrium. discriminatory pricing, uniform pricing, auctions, demand uncertainty, stochastic number <b>of</b> <b>bidders...</b>|$|R

We found that increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> increases {{the first and the}} second-unit bids in a 2 -unit setting and the third and the fourth-unit bids in a 4 -unit setting. Increasing the number of units increases the first and the second-unit bids when the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> is lower than the number of units but decreases them when there are more bidders than units. Also, we found that increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> provides significantly higher revenues than those obtained when increasing the number of units...|$|R

40|$|The paper reports {{experimental}} {{data on the}} behavior in the first-price sealed-bid auction for a varying number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> when values and bids are private information. This feedback-free design is proposed for the experimental test of the one-shot game situation. We consider both within-subjects and between-subjects variations. In line with the qualitative risk neutral Nash equilibrium prediction, {{the data show that}} bids increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders.</b> However, in auctions involving a small number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> average bids are above, and in auctions involving a larger number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> average bids are below the risk neutral equilibrium prediction. The quartile analysis reveals that bidding behavior is not constant across the full value range for a given number <b>of</b> <b>bidders.</b> On the high value quartiles, however, the average bid–value ratio is not different from the risk neutral prediction. The behavior is different when the winning bid is revealed after each repetition...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} auction design {{examines}} how various factors {{affect the outcome}} of an auction. Most of the existing literature focuses on how varying {{the amount of information}} available to each bidder affects the bid-taker's expected revenue when all other factors remain constant. This paper studies how the bid-taker's expected revenue varies with changes in the auction format when such changes affect the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> and, in turn, the bidders' maximum value for the object being sold. Specifically, we examine how varying the reservation price or screening level affects the bid-taker's expected revenue though its effect on the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders.</b> For two simple examples, the losses associated with a reduced number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> outweighs any benefits that nontrivial reservation prices might have had in models with an exogonously set number <b>of</b> <b>bidders.</b> auctions, competitive bidding, decision analysis, value of information...|$|R

Using competitive bidding model adapted from previous research this study tries to analyze the effect of competition in terms of number, distance and net assets <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> and project size on construction cost.

Linear regression is used to analyze the individual effect of each variable on construction cost. Analysis of varians (ANOVA) is used to test the simultaneous hypothesis that all those variables simultaneously effect construction cost. The analysis proves that under competitive e-tenderring process number and net assets <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> and project size negatively effect construction cost.

40|$|Based on eBay auctions {{of classic}} comic books, we explore what attracts bidders to {{individual}} online auctions. Seventy {{percent of the}} variation in the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> across auctions is predictable based on characteristics of the item for sale, the seller, and the auction design. Not surprisingly, high minimum bids discourage bidders while longer auctions attract slightly more. We also find that the presence of a secret reserve price sharply reduces the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> while third party certification attracts more. Seller reputation as measured by feedback ratings has a statistically significant impact on the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders.</b> Overall, our results support the hypotheses that bidding is fairly costly and that bidders value transparency. Holding issue, seller, and auction characteristics constant, an additional bidder is associated with a price increase of between 2. 3 % and 4. 3 %. While secret reserve prices sharply reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> they have little impact on what individual bidders are willing to bid while third party certification of the auctioned item increases both the number and level of bids. On the other hand, the condition of the item being auctioned has a relatively minor impact on the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> but strongly impacts their bids. 1 What Attracts Bidders to Online Auctions and What is Their Price Impact? 1...|$|R

40|$|We study a common-value, 8 ̆ 5 rst-price {{auction in}} which the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> is endogenous: the seller (auctioneer) knows the value and solicits bid-ders at a cost. The number <b>of</b> <b>bidders,</b> which is unobservable to them, may thus depend on the true value, giving rise to a {{solicitation}} e¤ect being so-licited already conveys information. The solicitation e¤ect is a key di¤erence from standard common value auctions. In contrast to standard auctions, the equilibrium bid distribution may exhibit atoms. We also discuss information aggregation in the case <b>of</b> small <b>bidder</b> solicitation cost. We {{show that there is}} a type of equilibrium that aggregates information well when the most favorable signals are informative. However, there may also be an equilibrium that fails to aggregate any information. This paper considers a single good, common values, 8 ̆ 5 rst-price auction {{in which the}} number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> is endogenous: the seller (auctioneer) knows the value and solicits bidders at a constant cost per sampled bidder. The bidders do not know the value and do not observe the number <b>of</b> solicited <b>bidders.</b> Each bidder only learns that he was summoned to the auction and observes a private noisy signal of the true value. In equilibrium, bidders bid optimally given their signals, the bidding strategies of others, and the solicitation strategy of the seller. The seller chooses optimally how many bidders to solicit given the true value and the biddersstrategies. The novel feature is the endogenous solicitation <b>of</b> the <b>bidders</b> by the informed seller.

40|$|Auctions were legally {{required}} in New Orleans estate sales during the 1800 s. Since records of slave transactions were carefully documented, we are afforded {{the opportunity to}} test whether the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> increased or decreased during this period using well-developed empirical methods.

If the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> decreased, the only remaining argument would be that slaves were simply becoming more valuable assets. We find that the number <b>of</b> <b>bidders</b> decreased over the period, so we can argue that slaves were becoming more valuable and that the increase in price was not merely a frontier effect that could not be sustained.
