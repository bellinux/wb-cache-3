Changes in professional staffing, technology and locations of services {{are just a few}} actions underway to create operationally efficient, more cost-effective institutions. Facility planning and design is equally challenged to present new facility models for these retooled medical centres. In 2025, American hospitals may bear little resemblance to the imposing medical structures which form this country's historical health facility reference points. This presentation will focus on the use of <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations</b> to improve innovation of health facility planning and design. We will discuss the use of <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations</b> to analyze the functional and environmental aspects of operational departmental areas, and the utilization of research conclusions to improve innovation and creativity in the design of new facilities. Ms. Saslaw, a health care administrator and planner, and Mr. Thomas, a health care architect and planner, will introduce the process issues of POE in design, and then present case studies and facility plans which demonstrate the value to new innovative environments. Specifically, individuals attending this session will: (i) understand the contemporary use of <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations</b> in facility planning and design, (ii) review several cases and discuss alternative facility responses derived from use of <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations</b> (iii) discuss the “Patient Focus Carei trend and the architects/planners response in improving health facility design...|$|R

50|$|Marcus advocates <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluation</b> as a {{research}} method for studying public and semi-public open spaces. In her studies of Easter Hill Village in Richmond, California and St. Francis Square in San Francisco, she saw that semi-public open spaces in cluster housing foster a sense of community. She found these spaces to be well-used by residents, particularly by children. Her articles and book (with Wendy Sarkissian) Housing as if People Mattered: Site Design Guidelines for Medium-Density Family Housing published by the University of California Press in 1986 showed how medium density, low-rise cluster housing is supportive of families with children and a catalyst in building social networks. Marcus expanded her studies on open spaces in housing to other types—neighborhood and city parks, plazas, and campus open spaces in her edited volume (with Carolyn Francis) People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space first published by Van Nostrand Reinhold in 1990. She translated her findings in performance guidelines that would aid the designer and {{bridge the gap between}} research and practice.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between students’ activities, space choice patterns and satisfaction with campus space provision {{with the aim of}} establishing rational space utilization strategies. Many universities attempt to achieve their sustainability goals and address the constraints of space restrictions by implementing no-net growth policies and rational space utilization strategies. However, architects or facility managers often experience difficulties in keeping their commitment to such initiatives because they lack empirical data that explain the relationships in action between students and campus space. This paper demonstrates these relationships by analysing empirical data obtained from a university campus. University students completed 330 student-day time-use surveys and relevant <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations</b> for regular days at university. Three major space-choice-rejection patterns were found: (1) spaces for 56 % of activities were chosen by students themselves; (2) students often struggled to find an appropriate space for their group activities; (3) students’ space choice behaviour was both common and influential on campus. A campus sustainability model of space choice-rejection was theorized based on the students’ <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations,</b> comprising anticipated space choice and intended space rejection. Three categories of relationships were established: space-oriented relationships with space environmental performance and spatial form; user-oriented relationships with user capacity and locational accessibility and equipment-oriented relationships with equipment adequacy and equipment condition.

50|$|ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 {{was first}} {{published}} in 1966. It was revised in 1974, 1981, 1992, 2004, 2010, and 2013. Starting in 2004, it is now updated based on ASHRAE’s standard maintenance procedures. These periodic revisions are based on publicly reviewed addenda to the previous version available on ASHRAE’s website. In 1992 the standard was updated with more extensive information on measurement protocols and an expanded definitions section. In 2004 the standard underwent significant changes with the addition of two thermal comfort models: the PMV/PPD model and the adaptive comfort model. In 2010 the standard included the following changes. It re-introduced the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) as a method to calculate the cooling effect of air movement. It also added a general satisfaction survey to section 7 intended to evaluate general thermal comfort in an occupied space, bringing the standard in line with current survey-based <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluation</b> (POE) practices. In 2013 the body of the standard was rewritten in mandatory language, with informative language moved from the body of the standard to informative appendices. The applicability of the cooling effect of air movement was expanded to apply to naturally conditioned spaces. Section 7 underwent major revisions for measuring thermal comfort in existing spaces including procedures for physical measurements and survey methods, and how to evaluate and report results. The last major change concerns measuring air speed and air temperature experienced by the occupant, which now must be an average across three heights and over a period of time.|$|E

40|$|<b>Post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{represent}} an important missed opportunity. While POEs {{are often used}} to inform design guides, and to support facility management, they are seldom used to support design decision-making. While there are several technical, methodological, and cultural impediments to the ongoing use of POE results in design, characteristics of POE data and data structure is an important, and often overlooked, impediment. Some evaluators have attempted to resolve this problem by involving actively as consultants in design teams or involving users, such as Placemaking or Process Architecture. Recent advances in conceptual data modeling provide another strategy to interface POE findings and design decision-making. This thesis uses EXPRESS modeling language to develop a conceptual data structure for POE data, and integrate POE data with as-built building descriptions. While this effort {{has the potential to}} develop an improved way to structure POE data and make it more useful, it is also an extension of ISO-STEP. This study develops a data structure based on <b>post-occupancy</b> <b>evaluations</b> of state and federal trial courtrooms conducted by the researcher. Thirty-one courtrooms were evaluated, resulting in usable data from 93 courtroom users in 26 courtrooms. An EXPRESS-G schema was developed and was translated into a relational database for holding data and running queries. The investigator illustrated a range of query-generated outcomes to support decision-making during design and design review. Such outcomes include exploring existing courtrooms, comprehending the types of design decisions implemented across federal and state courtrooms, identifying design decisions that have been rated favorably or otherwise by courtroom users, rating design decisions based on evaluation data from existing courtrooms, and predicting a designed environments supportiveness to task performance.

40|$|Government {{intervention}} in housing development is lauded in many countries, but inappropriate {{perception of the}} end-users has made many of such schemes largely unsuccessful. In Nigeria, many researchers have argued that inadequate knowledge of the nature, scope and dimension of housing problems coupled with myopic concept of the people's needs are responsible for public housing failures.
