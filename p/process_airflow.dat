For these reasons, a test facility has been located in Benevento (Southern Italy), to carry out an experimental analysis on a silica-gel desiccant wheel inserted in an air handling unit which treats outside air only. For this wheel, the regeneration temperature can be as low as 65 °C, obtainable using the thermal wastes from a small scale cogenerator. The objective of this paper is the presentation of the main latest results of the experimental investigation on the desiccant wheel.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{epidemiological study}} of {{the early stages of}} the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was performed on London working men. The findings showed that forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) falls gradually over a lifetime, but in most non-smokers and many smokers clinically significant airflow obstruction never develops. In susceptible people, however, smoking causes irreversible obstructive changes. If a susceptible smoker stops smoking he will not recover his lung function, but the average further rates of loss of FEV 1 will revert to normal. Therefore, severe or fatal obstructive lung disease could be prevented by screening smokers' lung function in early middle age if those with reduced function could be induced to stop smoking.

40|$|AbstractThe cement {{industry}} {{is generally considered}} responsible for upwards of 5 % of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This {{is a result of}} the high energy intensity of the process, significant CO 2 release from the raw materials used, and large global consumption. It is also a high growth sector as emerging economies develop their infrastructure. This paper outlines an investigation into day-to-day performance variation that, if scaled to the global level, represents a potential for improvement of up to 100  Mt CO 2 equivalent per year. Optimising this operational variation is not included in current roadmaps for reduction of {{cement industry}} CO 2 emissions, and has the potential to be cost neutral, or even save money for cement producing companies. The paper analyses a case study of a plant in the UK, operating a pre-calciner type kiln commissioned in 1986. Production data was analysed to examine the day-to-day variation in the fuel-derived CO 2 emissions, in order to estimate the potential for operational improvement. Various factors were then analysed to determine what drives this potential improvement, including fuel mix, rate of production, and <b>process</b> <b>airflow.</b> The day-to-day performance of the plant, as measured by the fuel-derived CO 2 emissions per tonne of clinker produced, varied significantly. (Clinker is the material ground and mixed with ∼ 3 % gypsum to produce cement). Improvement of the plant to 10 th percentile best observed performance levels would represent a 10 % drop in CO 2 emissions and a 7 % drop in energy consumption, with associated cost savings. Two mathematical models were used, first to examine the energy balance of the plant and then to predict CO 2 emissions from given input conditions. The largest source of energy consumption was the dissociation energy required to form clinker, however, the variation in this was small. Airflow and fuel type were found to dominate the variation of performance. Optimising the factors affecting performance was predicted to reduce energy consumption by 8. 5 % and CO 2 emissions by 19. 5 %. The paper concludes that there exists significant opportunity to reduce the emissions from cement plants by operational means, and that fuel mix and excess air ratio should be the focus of future research...|$|E

For the complex field of Under hood Thermal Management, CFD has become a very important tool to engineer the cooling <b>airflow</b> <b>process</b> in the engine bay of vehicles. To model the cooling <b>airflow</b> <b>process</b> accurately in CFD, it is of utmost importance to model all components in the cooling airflow path accurately.

This paper presents CFD simulations together with correlating measurements of a cooling airflow system placed in a test rig. The system contains a heavy duty truck louvered fin radiator core, fan shroud, fan ring and fan. Behind the cooling module and fan a 1 D engine silhouette is placed to mimic the blockage done by a truck engine behind the fan.

The temperature at the top of the liquefier body, where a low temperature is desirable for the correct preservation of the 3 D printer components, is analyzed to assess the results for the different printing conditions.

This mathematical model was then validated with experimental data registered with four thermocouples fixed on the tested extruder. The data was taken for different airflows, finding a relation between printing parameters and resulting tem- perature profile. The liquefier used for experimental data acquisition was the BCNozzle model, designed by the BCN 3 D Technologies of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Determining the correct working parameters is necessary to optimize the fused filament fabrication process on which 3 D printing is based, ensuring a suitable temperature distribution along the liquefier body.

5000|$|As a swept-wing {{aircraft}} slows {{toward the}} stall {{speed of the}} wing, {{the angle of the}} leading edge forces some of the airflow sidewise, toward the wing tip. This <b>process</b> is progressive, <b>airflow</b> near the middle of the wing is affected not only by the leading edge angle, but also the spanwise airflow from the wing root. At the wing tip the airflow can end up being almost all spanwise, as opposed to front-to-back over the wing, meaning that the effective airspeed drops well below the stall. Because the geometry of swept wings typically places the wingtips of an aircraft aft of its center of gravity, lift generated at the wingtips tends to create a nose-down pitching moment. When the wingtips stall, both the lift and the associated nose-down pitching moment rapidly diminish. The loss of the nose-down pitching moment leaves the previously balanced aircraft with a net nose-up pitching moment. This forces the nose of the aircraft up, increasing the angle of attack and leading to stall over a greater portion of the wing. The result is a rapid and powerful pitch-up followed by a complete stall, a difficult situation for a pilot to recover from.

The majority of the existing studies on DSF are based on air-conditioned models under temperate climate conditions, where most DSFs are implemented. However, developments in warmer climate countries such as Brazil are also considering the application of this technology as a solution to improve thermal performance in buildings. Therefore, investigations to understand the DSF thermal and <b>airflow</b> <b>processes</b> and implication of its use in naturally ventilated buildings under such climates are needed. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the thermal performance of office buildings with DSF under Brazilian climate conditions.

Using an office building as a reference model, computational thermal dynamic simulations are performed to demonstrate the influence of each individual key parameter on the building‘s thermal behaviour. From the findings of the parametric analysis, optimized models that utilise a combination of solutions to maximize the building thermal performance are developed and analysed.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of 3 D printing systems as mechatronic devices able to localize manufacturing activities has {{attracted the attention}} in academic and professional labs worldwide. However, little is known from a formal {{point of view about}} the actual possibilities of optimization in terms of hardware and software. This paper proposes alternative geometrical designs of RepRap 3 D printer liquefiers, and offers an evaluation of their thermal performance by analyzing the temperature profiles derived from their functioning in a steady state regime. For that purpose, finite element calculation and experimental techniques are combined and compared. A detachable model of liquefier, used in numerous RepRap 3 D printers, has been taken as a reference to design and manufacture two new variations. As the objective of the liquefier is to heat the plastic material while limiting the temperature at its top, heat conduction must be prevented by means of a refrigerating fan faced at the liquefier body. The effect of that fan has been introduced in the system of study, by evaluating the influence of five different fan velocities on the final temperature profile. All combinations of fan speed and liquefier geometry have been calculated through a finite elements model. Then, they have been reproduced experimentally, measuring discrete temperatures at different heights of the liquefier by a group of thermocouples installed {{on the surface of the}} fins composing the liquefier heat sink. Results showed that the defined FEM model reproduces acceptably the final temperature profiles obtained by experimental measures. Furthermore, the new proposed design provided with thick fins shows its good performance when the 3 D printing process is performed with a fan speed higher than 10 % (defined according to a PWM function programmed at the 3 D printer's firmware), while its design presents a much lower manufacturing time with regards to the present available design. It is also concluded that refrigerating the liquefier during a standard 3 D printing <b>process</b> with an <b>airflow</b> higher than PWM¿=¿ 20 % is not recommended, due to a fall in efficiency and not remarkable refrigerating effect obtained through it.
