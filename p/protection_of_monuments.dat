2500|$|Mr. Willis Fautre's (from Human Rights Without Frontiers) model, two {{overlapping}} {{forms of}} federalism are envisioned. First, {{the nation would}} have separate administrative [...] "regions", {{each with its own}} parliament; a form of territorial federalism. Each community (Assyrians, Turkmen, Arabs, and Kurds) would also have their own parliament representing their communities throughout the country; a form of community federalism. The community parliament would have full autonomy in religion, culture, schools, agriculture, energy, and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>monuments.</b> The unity of the federal government would be guaranteed by a bicameral system with a House of Representatives elected directly by the people and a Senate appointed by the various communities. For legislation affecting linguistic, cultural, or religious rights, both houses of parliament would have to pass the bill. In addition, though, in the community-based Senate, a super-majority (e.g. 2/3) vote would be needed in addition to a simple majority of every represented community. [...] In such a way, each community would enjoy virtual veto power in matters of language, culture, and religion.|$|E
