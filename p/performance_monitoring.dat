25|$|Mario Cardullo's device, {{patented}} on January 23, 1973, was {{the first}} true ancestor of modern RFID, {{as it was a}} passive radio transponder with memory. The initial device was passive, powered by the interrogating signal, and was demonstrated in 1971 to the New York Port Authority and other potential users and consisted of a transponder with 16 bit memory for use as a toll device. The basic Cardullo patent covers the use of RF, sound and light as transmission media. The original business plan presented to investors in 1969 showed uses in transportation (automotive vehicle identification, automatic toll system, electronic license plate, electronic manifest, vehicle routing, vehicle <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring),</b> banking (electronic check book, electronic credit card), security (personnel identification, automatic gates, surveillance) and medical (identification, patient history).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{integration}} of the SpAtioTemporal Uncertainty ReasoNing (SATURN) system being developed in our group with the Virtual GIS (VGIS) system in order to improve its performance and scalability to complex dynamic environments as well as to enhance its functionality as a collaborative planning tool. To achieve this we added three new components to VGIS: a spatiotemporal object manager, a <b>performance</b> <b>monitor,</b> and a task database. The spatio-temporal object manager uses SATURN techniques for indexing dynamic multidimensional (spatio-temporal) objects to support effective and efficient object traversal during visualization. The <b>performance</b> <b>monitor</b> adjusts the resource allocation between VGIS components and adaptively adjusts image quality to guarantee bounded visualization performance. The task database extends VGIS as a tool for collaborative planning.

40|$|Modern Java programs, such as {{middleware}} {{and application}} servers, include many complex software components. Improving {{the performance of}} these Java applications requires {{a better understanding of}} the interactions between the application, virtual machine, operating system, and architecture. Hardware <b>performance</b> <b>monitors,</b> which are available on most modern processors, provide facilities to obtain detailed performance measurements of long-running applications in real time. However, interpreting the data collected using hardware <b>performance</b> <b>monitors</b> is difficult because of the low-level nature of the data. We have developed a system, consisting of two components, to alleviate the difficulty of interpreting results obtained using hardware <b>performance</b> <b>monitors.</b> The first component is an enhanced VM that generates traces of hardware <b>performance</b> <b>monitor</b> values while executing Java programs. This enhanced VM generates a separate trace for each Java thread and CPU combination and thus provides accurate results in a multithreaded and multiprocessor environment. The second component is a tool that allows users to interactively explore the traces using a graphical interface. We implemented our tools in the context of Jikes RVM, an open source Java VM, and evaluated it on a POWER 4 multiprocessor. We demonstrate that our system is effective in uncovering as yet unknown performance characteristics and is a first step in exploring the reasons behind observed behavior of a Java program. ...|$|R

Calls scientific method [...] "generally well described and readily repeatable", but says [...] "articular attention is needed to the methodology for randomly selecting the location(s) of cluster(s) within governorates. Roberts and colleagues describe this rather too succinctly". Suggests additional information be included so that more precise multipliers (to obtain the final estimate) can be applied. Discusses an example hypothetical circumstance incorporating said information, regarding airstrike deaths and collateral damage, under which over-counting could occur due to population density variances among cluster representations.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{institution}} directly {{subordinate to}} the MWI is the [...] <b>Performance</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Unit (PMU), previously called Programme Management Unit. It {{is in charge of}} projects with private sector participation. It has also carried out major investment projects such as the water loss reduction program in Amman and has regulated the private operator in Amman from 1999 to 2006. The PMU was supposed to be an embryonic unit for a future semi-autonomous water regulatory agency for the entire country, to be established by law outside of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. As a step in that direction, a Water Sector Audit Unit (WSAU) was established in the PMU in May 2008. The unit has set up a benchmarking system using performance indicators that have initially been applied to the Aqaba Water Company and Miyahuna. Due to the absence of a regulatory agency, tariff setting {{is the responsibility of the}} Cabinet, after proposal from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{objective}} {{production method}} consists of direct, but limited, {{measures such as}} sales figures, production numbers, the electronic <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> of data entry workers, etc. [...] The measures used to appraise performance {{would depend on the}} job and its duties. [...] Although these measures deal with unambiguous criteria, they are usually incomplete because of criterion contamination and criterion deficiency. [...] Criterion contamination refers to the part of the actual criteria that is unrelated to the conceptual criteria. [...] In other words, the variability in performance can be due to factors outside of the employee’s control. [...] Criterion deficiency refers to the part of the conceptual criteria that is not measured by the actual criteria. [...] In other words, the quantity of production does not necessarily indicate the quality of the products. [...] Both types of criterion inadequacies result in reduced validity of the measure. [...] Regardless of the fact that objective production data is not a complete reflection upon job performance, such data is relevant to job performance.|$|E

The distribution of vector lengths is not well-predicted by hardware <b>performance</b> <b>monitor</b> averages. Scalar programs also exhibit some clumping of memory references but have less temporal regularity than the vectorized programs. While overall port utilization is surprisingly low, there is considerable cyclic variation, and all of the ports tend to experience their maximal loading at the same time.
