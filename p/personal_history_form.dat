40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{learning and}} teaching principle involves drawing upon prior knowledge. This may encompass reflecting upon a past experience and using it to make learning 'connections' with new information. One strategy to assist in making those connections in the curriculum area of social studies is to reflect on one's <b>personal</b> <b>history.</b> By doing so, social studies can become more meaningful for students. Social studies is not only about content knowledge but the development of life skills enabling students to confidently participate in society. This research used an evaluative case study approach, to establish how writing a <b>personal</b> <b>history</b> could assist students to learn about social studies in a teacher education context. Through the analysis of questionnaire responses, focus group discussions and document analysis of student assignments, themes emerged relating to how <b>personal</b> <b>histories</b> supported their learning. These themes suggested that <b>personal</b> <b>histories</b> had allowed students to realise the personal and social significance of their past and the social studies curriculum. <b>Personal</b> <b>histories</b> had also supported {{the development of the}} student/teacher relationship, which had a positive effect on learning. In addition, the use of <b>personal</b> <b>history</b> supported emerging teacher identity, and the role student teachers play in children's learning. The effectiveness of this learning process was derived from a social constructivist theory of learning. The use of <b>personal</b> <b>histories</b> as a <b>form</b> of assessment is recommended for developing knowledge of social studies and its participative pedagogy...|$|R
40|$|The National Youth Sports Program (NYSP) is {{an annual}} event {{sponsored}} by the National Collegiate Athletic Association that provides structured sports and enrichment programs to youth of low socioeconomic status. As part of the program, youths undergo a free medical examination that uses a physical examination checklist but does not include a section on medical history. To determine what additional information a medical history would provide, a <b>history</b> <b>form</b> was {{used in conjunction with}} the regular preparticipation examination for participants in the 1996 NYSP at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. The <b>history</b> <b>form</b> provided information such as family history of sudden death, <b>personal</b> <b>history</b> of asthma or bone injury, and whether participants took medications or used corrective lenses. Seventy-nine percent of the completed <b>history</b> <b>forms</b> documented a positive response to at least one question. Of these, only 5 % had physical findings on examination. Conversely, 15 % of participants had physical findings that were not reported on the <b>history</b> <b>form.</b> Because much of what is discovered by a medical history often is not found on physical examination and because history information can be used to prevent the occurrence of an accident or illness, this study suggests that the use of such a form is beneficial in providing a more comprehensive screening...|$|R

The rationale was （ 1 ）Support for getting a job, internships and consultations for foreign students {{were based on the}} national policy "Plan for 300, 000 Exchange Students" which was launched in 2008. （ 2 ）The number of foreign students aiming at getting a job in a Japanese company has been increasing, and we needed job hunting support for them with a different content to that offered to Japanese students. The following were included in business Japanese-language education. （ 1 ）self analysis methodology, the knowledge necessary to job hunt, mental attitude and the ways of industry with enterprise and job category study. （ 2 ）Respectful business language used on the telephone, business manners and how to fill out documents. （ 3 ） How to fill out a <b>personal</b> <b>history</b> <b>form</b> "entry seat" and dealing with a group interview. （ 4 ）Hearing about the experiences of job hunting from a former foreign student. （ 5 ）An enterprise tour and other field visits. In this report, I introduce the results of the class questionnaire which was deployed to and targeted at foreign students who attended lectures in the previous fiscal year. It considered the future form of "Business Japanese-language education"...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the possible influence of particular television imageries of African-Americans on the self-perceptions of selected young adult African-Americans, ages eighteen to twenty-five. The focus of the study was on specific aspects of self that are addressed by particular television imageries of African-Americans and the possible influences that particular television imageries have on self-perceptions of selected young adult African-Americans. ^ For the design of the study, a qualitative methodology was deemed most useful. Three African-American judges participated in the study: a social psychologist, an anthropologist, and a psychiatrist. The judges were asked to identify and analyze the positive and/or negative imageries that they thought may influence the self-concept of African-American young adults. Thus, the judges provided data for the study. ^ Additionally, in-depth interviewing was determined to be the most useful method for gathering data from ten young adult African-Americans. The interview sessions included the viewing of nineteen episodes of a popular television show featuring African-American actors/actresses. Afterwards, the interviewees were asked to express their perceptions of the African-American television imageries. ^ Profiles of the interviewees were established from a <b>personal</b> <b>history</b> <b>form,</b> and data from the interviews were analyzed. ^ The judges 2 ̆ 7 data explain that the television images are likely to have negative influences on self-perceptions of the young African-American viewers. Moreover, the judges overwhelmingly agreed that degrading stereotypes are the major likely influences on self. ^ Thirty hours of interviews with ten African-American adults revealed that the subjects differed in their perceptions of the possible influence of the television programming on their self-perceptions. Although differences in perceptions existed, only one respondent perceived all television episodes to have negative influences, except for the hybrids. Many of the episodes were viewed as having the potential for positive and negative influences. The judges perceived the television imageries to be negative. Yet the young African-Americans who were interviewed tended to see the same imagery as being positive. This difference in perception among different generations of African-Americans may be attributed to thoughts about humor and ridicule. Also, the limited life experiences of those being interviewed may influence their critical consciousness and thus contribute to the tendency to be more tolerant of the possible negative impact the images may have on their views of themselves. ^ The television industry must join the effort to make education a more positive and powerful means for equality in our democracy. ...|$|E
