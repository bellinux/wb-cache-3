The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the <b>programme</b> <b>requirements,</b> to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015–16. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there was a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed [...] "Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16", while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at €2.5bn (being required to be covered by additional austerity measures). As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November, to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December. The Eurogroup was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December (to be published on the same day), and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 2015–16. There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015–16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) issued by the European Stability Mechanism. The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that it help calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors.|$|E

The subsequent programme designed to meet these requirements, the MFI ( [...] , , Mnogofunksionalni Frontovoy Istrebitel, [...] "Multifunctional Frontline Fighter"), resulted in Mikoyan's selection to develop the MiG 1.44. Though not a participant in the MFI, Sukhoi started its own programme in the early 1990s to develop technologies for a next-generation fighter aircraft, resulting in the S-37, later designated Su-47. Due to a lack of funds {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, the MiG 1.44 programme was repeatedly delayed and the first flight of the prototype did not occur until 2000, nine years behind schedule.

As part of the review of the bailout programme, the outgoing ND led government had proposed to the Troika, immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015-16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) (funds in excess from the part of the bailout programme under the guidance of the eurozone), along with establishment of the precautionary ECCL.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the effects that a steps/day {{programme}} may have on body mass index (BMI) among primary education students (11. 37 ± 0. 48 years). A six-week controlled trial with a follow-up was completed with an experimental group (N= 66, pedometer + steps/day programme + reinforcement programme in their physical education (PE) marks + weekly follow-up in PE), and a control group (N= 76). Omron HJ- 152 -E 2 pedometers were used. Normoweight students complied with <b>programme</b> <b>requirements</b> to a greater extent than their overweight counterparts (72. 7 vs 59. 1 %). The programmed minimum number of 12, 000 steps/day for boys and 10, 000 for girls was exceeded by 83 % of boys and 60 % of girls. The differences in the number of steps/day between boys (14, 274) and girls (10, 626) were significant across all the measured periods (p<. 05). The results show that the teenagers who complied with the <b>programme</b> <b>requirements</b> reduced their BMI significantly after the intervention (p<. 001) and this reduction persisted for six weeks after the programme (p<. 001). In conclusion, the six-week programme of 12, 000 steps/day for boys and 10, 000 for girls, jointly with a reinforcement programme in their PE marks and weekly follow-up by their PE teacher, reduces BMI significantly in 11 - 12 -year-old schoolchildren. Monitored steps/day programmes in the PE curriculum increase out-of-school physical activity and reduce BMI in 11 - 12 -year-old schoolchildren...|$|E
