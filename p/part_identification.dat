40|$|Sketching is {{ubiquitous}} in medicine. Physicians commonly use sketches {{as part of}} their note taking in patient records and to help convey diagnoses and treatments to patients. Medical students frequently use sketches to help them think through clinical problems in individual and group problem solving. Applications ranging from automated patient records to medical education software could benefit greatly from the richer and more natural interfaces that would be enabled by the ability to understand sketches. In this paper we take the first steps toward developing a system that can understand anatomical sketches. Understanding an anatomical sketch requires the ability to recognize what anatomical structure has been sketched and from what view (e. g. parietal view of the brain), as well as to identify the anatomical parts and their locations in the sketch (e. g. parts of the brain), even if they have not been explicitly drawn. We present novel algorithms for sketch recognition and for <b>part</b> <b>identification.</b> We evaluate the accuracy of the recognition algorithm on sketches obtained from medical students. We evaluate the <b>part</b> <b>identification</b> algorithm by comparing its results to the judgment of an experienced physician...|$|E

40|$|The {{numbering}} {{and identification}} of parts within a manufacturing organization is of immense importance, for {{it serves as}} a major means of communicating information throughout the organization. The oldest, and still most prominent method of <b>part</b> <b>identification</b> is the use of meaningful, alpha/numeric part numbers. With the transition to computer assisted manufacturing systems, however, many of the weaknesses of this type of system have come to light. A newer approach to part numbering, the use of all numeric, nonsignificant part numbers as a vehicle for identifying parts and accessing the required information about each, may be a major contributor to improve communications in the computer age. This paper explores both approaches to <b>part</b> <b>identification,</b> addressing the advantages and drawbacks of each. It is concluded that the use of nonsignificant numbering, is indeed, the best approach to a flexible, simple, and standardized identification system, allowing access to all pertinent part information without incorporating that information in to the part number. Two case studies, one of a leading compressor manufacturer, and the other a producer of greeting cards, are presented, demonstrating the feasibility of a conversion from significant to nonsignificant systems and the benefits obtainable. The problem of reducing data entry errors and maintaining data integrity with non-significant part numbers is analyzed and a proposed algorithm presented. Finally routines are demonstrated for both generating and then vetting and validating nonsignificant numbers...|$|E

40|$|Prior to the Space Shuttle Program, space-borne {{vehicles}} {{launched into}} space were expended; consequently their part identifiers were applied using marking processes {{designed for use}} in ground operations. With the advent of reusable space transportation vehicles and retrievable satellites, NASA needed to rethink how <b>part</b> <b>identification</b> markings are applied to their space borne vehicles. Markings applied to reusable spacecraft need to survive the extreme environments encountered in space. To support this new requirement, NASA approached RVSI (now Siemens) to assist with a marking program to certify marking(s) for use in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). An experiment was designed to identify <b>part</b> <b>identification</b> methods and techniques that might survive the rigors of space. The experiment was to be designed to expose both human and machine-readable markings to LEO environments. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, vacuum, solar UV radiation, micrometeoroids and space debris, atomic oxygen (AO) and deep thermal cycles. Two specimen packages were assembled. The first package was incorporated into MISSE 1 and 2 (one year orbital experiments) and consisted of currently approved marking processes and number of newly developed Laser Additive marking techniques deemed safe for use in safety critical applications. The second package contained a series of more robust intrusive marking technique that utilized higher-powered laser markers. These specimens were incorporated in MISSE 3 and 4, which was scheduled to fly in orbit for three years. This report describes the results of the MISSE 1 and 2 marking experiments...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Finger agnosia is a {{well-known}} consequence of particularly left inferior parietal lesions. Studies of finger agnosia have shown that patients are impaired {{on a range of}} tasks, assessing explicit identification of individual fingers, but also implicit knowledge concerning finger differentiation (Ettlinger, 1963; Kinsbourne & Warrington, 1962). It is established that several perceptual deficits can also be observed as a developmental disorder. This is also the case for developmental Gerstmann syndrome, of which finger agnosia is a constituent part (Kinsbourne & Warrington, 1963). However, finger agnosia as separate entity has received little attention in a healthy adult population. The current study aimed to assess possible deficits in finger recognition in healthy individuals. Methodology. Various finger gnosis tasks that have previously been used to identify finger agnosia in neurological patients were applied (Kinsbourne & Warrington, 1962; Anema, et al., 2008). Moreover, performance on the finger identification tasks was related to body <b>part</b> <b>identification</b> and to left-right orientation, the latter being another component of Gerstmann syndrome. Sixty healthy adult participants were assessed. Results. Cronbach‟s alpha showed sufficient internal consistency between various subtests of finger gnosis, allowing construction of an overall measure of finger gnosis. 5 individuals (8, 3 %) performed outside the normal range (≤ 2 SD) on this measure. Moreover, finger gnosis correlated significantly with left-right orientation and body <b>part</b> <b>identification.</b> Conclusions. Finger gnosis problems in healthy adults may be more common than originally considered. It seems that these problems may be associated with reduced performance on left-right discrimination tasks...|$|E

40|$|Objects can be seen, at an {{abstract}} level, as information tokens made of two parts: an <b>identification</b> <b>part</b> and state, or value <b>part.</b> The <b>identification</b> <b>part</b> contains an object identifier {{different from that}} of any other object. The state part contains instead a structured value denoting the collective value of the attributes of the object. While the identifier assigned to an object remains fixed, the state is allowed to change, i. e. different values {{can be found in the}} state part of the object at different times. An object model with identifiers abstracts the formal properties of identity achieving a neat separation between object identification and object representation. Object identification becomes therefore a formal property preserved by the system. Traditional approaches in data and knowledge representation use instead some aspects of individuals´ state, which only occasionally satisfy the uniqueness and continuity properties of identity. The problem is that identificative attributes chosen at a given time, may carry different values or may not be unique as the context changes; in general, identification is conceptually different from representation. The paper proposes an ontological foundation for the concept of object state and identity, showing formally the equivalence with the infinite properties which are inherent in the cognition of real world distinct entities (Leibniz´ principle) ...|$|R
