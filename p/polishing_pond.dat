40|$|This work {{assessed}} the behaviour of nine pharmaceuticals and/or endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in demo-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB reactors) coupled to distinct simplified post-treatment units (submerged bed, <b>polishing</b> <b>ponds,</b> and trickling filters) fed on raw sewage {{taken from a}} municipality in Brazil. The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The UASB reactors demonstrated {{that they were not}} appropriate for efficiently removing the assessed compounds from the sewage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was an important parameter for the removal of the hydrophilic and less biodegradable compounds, such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The post-treatment units substantially increased the removal of most target micropollutants present in the anaerobic effluents, with a greater removal of micropollutants in simplified systems that require a large construction area, such as the submerged bed and <b>polishing</b> <b>ponds,</b> probably because of the higher HRT employed. Alternatively, compact post-treatment systems, such as trickling filters, tended to be less effective at removing most of the micropollutants studied, and the type of packing proved to be crucial for determining the fate of such compounds using trickling filters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present work {{details the}} results of a {{comprehensive}} study dealing with the fate of several families of micropollutants (with various physicochemical properties) through tertiary treatment processes of water and through sludge treatments. Powerful and sensitive analytical techniques were used: 16 metals and 39 organics (pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylphenols, pesticides) were analysed in wastewaters; 14 metals and 62 organic hydrophobic micropollutants were measured in sludge (estrogenic hormones, polychlorinated byphenyl, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylphenols and other organics). We studied treatment processes adapted for rural areas involving low energy-consumption: trench system, <b>polishing</b> <b>pond,</b> horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands with various adsorbing materials (i. e. expanded clay, zeolite, activated carbon, apatite, gravels) running at tertiary stage of water treatment; and sludge drying reed-bed operated at two different resting periods. Our results show that the trench system was not efficient for additional removal of refractory micropollutants. The <b>polishing</b> <b>pond</b> had higher removal efficiencies (between 30 and 70 %) for some pharmaceuticals due to indirect photodegradation. The horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW) built with activated carbon showed almost full-removal during more than 330 days for pharmaceuticals, pesticides, several metals and nonylphenoxyacetic acid. For the HSSF-CWs built with expanded clay or zeolite, we obtained removal efficiencies of 70 % for half of studied pharmaceuticals and alkylphenols mono- and di-ethoxylates. The removal efficiencies of other substances were much lower than the ones measured with activated carbon, but they were still higher than the ones measured with gravel (filter designed for denitrification) or apatite (designed for phosphorus removal). Due to better oxygen conditions, the sludge drying reed-bed with low frequency of sludge input resulted in better removal for organic micropollutants than the sludge drying reed-bed with high frequency of sludge input...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{stabilization}} ponds {{are widely}} applied for domestic sewage treatment in Brazil. The main objective of conventional waste stabilisation ponds (WSP's) is, nomen est omen, {{to remove the}} organic material from wastewater. To achieve this objective, a quite long liquid retention time (R h) is required: even under the favourable conditions of the tropics (high temperature, sunshine) a minimum liquid retention time of 20 to 30 days is necessary. It is well established that the optimal ponds configuration for domestic sewage treatment consists of a serial system composed of an anaerobic pond, followed by a partially aerobic (facultative) and one or more predominantly aerobic (maturation) ponds. By substituting the anaerobic pond by an efficient high rate anaerobic reactor like the Up Flow Anaerobic Sludge Bed (UASB) reactor, the pond receiving the effluent of this reactor - an <b>polishing</b> <b>pond</b> - will receive a relatively very low organic load and therefore the design criteria for this pond are very similar to those for maturation ponds, that is the <b>polishing</b> <b>pond</b> is designed for pathogen and/or nutrient removal. In semi-arid regions, like the North-East of Brazil, the use of treated sewage for irrigation water is an ecologically sound solution if precautions are taken to avoid contamination of the workers and of the consumers of the produced crops. According to the very sticky World Health Organization (WHO) standards for unrestricted irrigation, the helminth concentration must be less than 1 per litre and the faecal coliform (FC) concentration less than 10 3 colony forming unit (CFU) per 100 ml. On the other hand, other important fact in design of pond systems is the evaporation from the pond needs to be minimal, and consequently the pond area must be as small as possible. When UASB effluent (with low organic material and suspended solids concentrations) is post-treated in polishing ponds, these systems can be designed specifically for FC removal. For that reason, their surface area can be kept smaller than that of conventional ponds, designed for organic material removal. For reducing the liquid retention time (and surface area) of a <b>polishing</b> <b>pond</b> it is necessary to minimize the degree of mixing as much as possible, so that the hydraulic regime approaches a plug flow regime. This thesis deals with aspects of design, performance and operation of sewage treatment systems consisting of an UASB reactor followed by a <b>polishing</b> <b>pond.</b> The thesis is directed to an experimental pilot plant investigation for assessing design and operation parameters with respect to the performance of the UASB reactor followed by post-treatment in different configurations of polishing ponds. With such a treatment system it was possible to produce an effluent that can be well used for unrestricted irrigation. The advantage of the system is that it allows a substantial reduction in the required surface area compared to the area required in conventional waste stabilization pond systems. As far as UASB reactor design concerned, it was shown that the phase separator design is of paramount importance to the performance of the system. The addition of parallel plates to the conventional phase separator could double the treatment capacity of the UASB reactor. The experimental investigation also showed that the sludge age and not the liquid retention time is the fundamental operational parameter of the UASB reactor: UASB reactors with different liquid retention times but the same sludge age will tend to have the same efficiency. An important aspect of UASB operation is the discharge of excess sludge. In this thesis a method was developed to estimate the frequency of excess sludge discharge as well as the optimal fraction of the total that can be discharged. It was shown that discharges of less than 50 % of the sludge mass had a small and transitory effect on the UASB performance. Polishing ponds were operated both with a continuous and sequential batch feeding. Based on the experimental results of the investigations, relevant operational and conceptual aspects were elucidated and elements for dimensioning and designing polishing ponds could be provided. It was shown that the required liquid retention time for reduction of the BOD 5 and TSS concentrations to a virtually constant value only amounts to about 3 days, which is very short i. e. a factor 7 to 10 times shorter than the liquid retention time (25 - 30 days) in conventional WSP's. In this investigation the FC concentration in the digested sewage was of the order of 10 7 per 100 ml, so that the required removal efficiency for unrestricted irrigation (FC 99. 99 %) of FC was obtained in {{a very short period of}} 4 to 5 days, as foreseen by theory for the experimental decay constant of 2. 0 to 2. 2 day - 1. During this period complete elimination of helminth eggs also occurred. In addition, due to the efficient pre-treatment, an aerobic environment prevailed in the sequential batch (SB) ponds and a substantial further reduction of the BOD 5 and TSS concentrations took place. Thus a final effluent was produced in ponds with a liquid retention time of only 4 to 5 days with a quality that complies with WHO standards for unrestricted irrigation. The liquid retention time required in a SB pond was only about half of the value for a flow-through <b>polishing</b> <b>pond,</b> so that its application leads to a reduction of the required pond area by a factor of 2. In conventional waste stabilisation pond systems the R h time under tropical climate conditions is of the order of 25 days, which is a factor 5 to 6 times greater than in polishing ponds operated in sequential batch mode for the production of an effluent for unrestricted irrigation. Other important finding of the investigations was that the rate of bottom sludge accumulation in polishing ponds remained much smaller than the values reported for conventional waste stabilization ponds, even though no sludge was discharged from the UASB reactor. The reduced bottom sludge accumulation has an important practical advantage: the frequency of desludging operation will be much lower than in anaerobic ponds and this operation may be unnecessary during the useful life span of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pond.</b> </font...|$|E

40|$|PFCs {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{industrial}} and commercial applications for more than 50 years. Among variation of PFCs, Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (CF 3 (CF 2) 7 SO 3 -) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (CF 3 (CF 2) 6 COO-) are the most dominant PFCs. In May 2009, PFOS, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (PFOSF) are designated as new Persistent Organic Compounds (POPs) which are resistant, bio-accumulating, and having potential of causing adverse effects to humans and environment (IISD, 2009). However, products containing PFCs are still being manufactured and used, which could be the main reason why they are still observed in the environment and biota (Berger et al., 2004; Saito et al., 2003; Sinclair et al., 2004). The study is focused on the PFCs contamination in water and industrial wastewater around the Central and Eastern Thailand, where is one of the major industrialized areas in the country. The samplings were conducted in major rivers, Chao Phraya, Bangpakong and Tachin River. PFCs were contaminated in all rivers. The average total PFCs were 15. 10 ng/L, 18. 29 ng/L and 7. 40 ng/L in Chao Phraya, Bangpakong and Tachin River, respectively. PFOS and PFOA were the predominant PFCs in all samples. The total of 118. 6 g/d PFOS and 323. 6 g/d PFOA were released from the three rivers to the Gulf of Thailand. The survey was also conducted in small rivers, reservoirs, and coastal water around Eastern Thailand, where many industrial zones (IZ) are located. The geometric mean (GM) concentration of each PFC was ranged from 2. 3 to 107. 7 ng/L in small rivers, 2. 2 to 212. 2 ng/L in reservoirs, and 0. 8 to 41. 1 ng/L in coastal water samples. The higher PFCs contaminations were detected in the surface water around the industrial zones, where might be the sources of these compounds. Field surveys were also conducted in ten industrial zones (IZ 1 – IZ 10) to identify the occurrences of PFCs from in industries. The recovery rates of PFCs in the samples indicated that the matrix interference or enhancement was an important problem in PFCs analysis. The elevated concentrations were detected in electronics, textile, chemicals and glass making industries. Total PFCs concentrations in the influent of WWTP were ranged from 39. 6 to 3, 344. 1 ng/L. Ten industrial zones released 188. 41 g/d of PFCs. All of the treatment processes inside industrial zones were biological processes, which were reported that they were not effective to remove PFCs. The influence of industrial discharges was affected not only the rivers and reservoirs but also in the coastal water. The PFCs in rivers and reservoirs were discharged to the Gulf of Thailand, which is the important food source for Thai people and exports. Due to the problems in industrial wastewater analysis, several optimizing options were applied in PFCs analytical method especially in Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) procedure. The combination of PresepC-Agri and Oasis®HLB was the better option for analyzing PFCs in water samples. The optimum flow rate for loading the samples was 5 mL/min. Methanol (2 mL) plus Acetronitrile (2 mL) was the effective way to elute PFCs from the cartridges. The specific solvent percentages to elute each PFCs were identified for both water and industrial wastewater samples. The matrix removal methods by using Envi-Carb and Ultrafilter were effective for different types of industrial wastewater samples. PFCs were detected in surface waters, which are the sources of tap and drinking water for the people in Central and Eastern Thailand. The surveys were conducted in Bangkok city. Samples were collected from water treatment plants (WTPs), tap water, and drinking water. PFCs were detected in all tap water and drinking water samples. PFOS and PFOA concentrations in raw water of WTP were found 4. 29 ng/L and 16. 54 ng/L, respectively. The average PFOS and PFOA concentrations in tap water were detected 0. 17 and 3. 58 ng/L, respectively. The tap water results also showed that PFOS and PFOA concentrations were not similarly detected in all area in the city. PFOA were detected higher in the western area, while PFOS concentration was quite similar in all areas. Overall, it can be concluded that the current treatment processes were not completely remove PFCs. Nevertheless, PFCs in particulate phase were effectively removed by the primary sedimentation and rapid sand filtration. Elevated PFCs were found in the industrial zones (IZ 2 and IZ 5). To understand the distribution and fate of PFCs during industrial wastewater process, PFCs mass flows were studied. Higher PFCs in adsorbed phase were detected only in activated sludge and some influent samples. In IZ 2, PFOA loading in the dissolved phase increased after activated sludge process by 5 %. There was no degradation of PFOA inside the <b>polishing</b> <b>pond.</b> The highest loading to the treatment plant was PFOS with the loading of 2, 382 mg/d and 1, 529 mg/d in dissolved and adsorbed phase, respectively. Unlike PFCAs that showed no removal in the treatment process, PFOS were decreased during the treatment processes with 36 % in the activated sludge process and 36 % in the <b>polishing</b> <b>pond.</b> The predominant in this IZ 5 was PFOS. The increasing of PFOS was also found in this treatment plant dissimilar to IZ 2. PFOS was increasing by 45 % in dissolved phase and 47 % in adsorbed phase. All of PFCs in this industrial zone were detected higher in the effluent, indicated that PFCs’ precursors should be the major effects of this contamination.

40|$|Paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} India-wide survey of natural treatment systems (NTSs) for wastewater treatment and reuse. The quality of treated wastewater from different types of NTSs was analyzed for various physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters, and needs for post-treatment were identified. Currently, about 1838 million liters per day (MLD) of wastewater is being treated using NTSs, of which the contributions of <b>polishing</b> <b>ponds,</b> waste stabilization ponds, duckweed ponds, constructed wetlands, and Karnal technology {{were found to be}} 53. 39, 45. 15, 0. 13, 0. 55, and 0. 78 %, respectively. Among the NTSs studied, constructed wetland was found most efficient in removal of pollutants including nitrogen, phosphorus, total coliform, and fecal coliform in the range of 76, 61, 99. 956, and 99. 923 %, respectively. Of all types of NTSs, only constructed wetland was found to meet the total coliform count requirements (< 1000 per 100 ml). Of all the 108 NTSs in operation, 23 systems are producing treated effluents for irrigation; effluents from 48 systems are being discharged into river or lake, and remaining 38 systems have not found any designated use of treated effluent. The chlorination was the only post-treatment, which is being practiced at only three wastewater treatment facilities. During post-treatment, 1 - 2 ppm of chlorine is applied to the secondary effluent irrespective of its quality. The treated effluents from different NTSs contain fecal bacteria in the magnitude of 103 to 105, which may cause the severe health impacts through contamination of groundwater as well as surface water resources...|$|R
40|$|Embora o uso de lagoas de tratamento seja uma tecnologia amplamente conhecida e utilizada para resíduos orgânicos, no caso específico dos resíduos líquidos da industrialização da mandioca, as experiências são reduzidas. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi de avaliar a eficiência na redução da carga poluidora de lagoas de tratamento de resíduos líquidos de fecularia. Para tanto, foram coletadas amostras na entrada do sistema e em cada uma das sete lagoas da Fecularia Horizonte, em Marechal Cândido Rondon - PR, no período de maio a setembro de 2004. Os seguintes parâmetros foram avaliados: Demanda Bioquímica de Oxigênio (DBO), Demanda Química de Oxigênio (DQO), Sólidos Totais (ST), Sólidos Fixos (SF), Sólidos Voláteis (SV), N-NH 4 +, Condutividade Elétrica (CE), Fósforo (P), Cloretos (CL-) e pH. O sistema promoveu redução de 96, 3 % de DQO e 96, 4 % de DBO, e fósforo e sólidos apresentaram comportamento semelhante. Já N-NH 4 +, CL- e CE oscilaram durante o sistema com redução, sobretudo nas lagoas de polimento.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the recently completed India-wide survey of 108 wastewater treatment facilities based on natural treatment systems (NTSs) engaged in wastewater treatment and reuse. During assessment of NTSs, a questionnaire survey was administered for collection of vital data on the shortlisted 41 treatment facilities - especially to obtain insights about the technical, economical and social issues influencing the success and failure of the given facility. Further, five case studies based on the most commonly practiced NTSs were selected for in-depth evaluation and the critical issues including effectiveness of technology and the socioeconomic aspects were studied. The treatment performance of these systems was assessed for one year by collecting primary data during January, June and August corresponding to the three seasons viz. winter, summer and monsoon. The effectiveness of the facilities was assessed in terms of percentage removals as well as the mass removal rate for commonly used parameters. As of today, the total load of sewges including sullages serviced by NTSs in India adds up to be around 1838 million liters a day. The most commonly practiced NTS in India has been the waste stabilization ponds (74 facilities) when compared with the phyto-remediation based systems (19 facilities) followed by the <b>polishing</b> <b>ponds</b> (15 facilities). Among the 41 facilities, nearly 75 % facilities were compliant and managed to produce treated sewages suitable for irrigation, discharged into wastewater canals or percolated in the riparian zone of the river. All the five systems that were selected for in-depth evaluation were found compliant during assessment. Also, two facilities (Sewage-fed Aquaculture Karnal and Duckweed Pond Ludhiana) were found to be operating on the public private partnership model and generating revenue for operation and maintenance along with ample benefits to the operating agencies. The study also reveals the associated socioeconomic benefits of various practiced NTSs. Finally, strategies for achieving improved performance of NTSs were articulated - especially focusing the potential for recycling and reusing of treated wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and CIP (carbon in pulp) {{extraction}} process. Ore {{is extracted}} via a blast hole process and moved via {{a series of}} scoop-trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers, either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of <b>polishing</b> <b>ponds</b> and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft. Additional power as required or {{in the event of an}} outage is provided by a series of large diesel generators on site.|$|R
