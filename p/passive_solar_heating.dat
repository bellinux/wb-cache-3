25|$|The basic {{requirement}} for <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> {{is that the}} solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the Northern Hemisphere, north in the Southern Hemisphere), and the building must incorporate thermal mass to keep it warm in the night.|$|E
50|$|Optimal {{placement}} of building elements (e.g. windows, doors, heaters) {{can play a}} significant role in insulation by considering the impact of solar radiation on the building and the prevailing breezes.

50|$|Van der Ryn has {{reported}} he has noticed, while driving around the United States, that many builders seem to {{pay no attention}} to one of the cheapest ways to save on energy bills: positioning the house on its site to maximize <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with the international housing exhibition Bo 01 in Malmo, Sweden in 2001, several residential units were built. To get building permission, all developers had to present calculations proving that their buildings would use in total less than 105 kWh/(m(2.) year) bought energy. Measurements show {{that none of the}} buildings fulfilled the demand concerning energy use. According to the calculations executed by the developers, <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain represents a large portion in the energy balances for the buildings. It is not likely that such a large portion of <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain can be used. However, large glazed areas facing south and west, which is the case in these buildings, might lead to major <b>heat</b> contribution through <b>solar</b> radiation and there is a risk of having too high indoor temperatures. Measurements have been done to investigate what effect <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> has on energy use and indoor temperature...|$|R
25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> can heat most {{buildings}} {{in even the}} mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can {{be as little as}} 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.|$|E
25|$|A Trombe {{wall is a}} <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> and {{ventilation}} system consisting of an air channel sandwiched between a window and a sun-facing thermal mass. During the ventilation cycle, sunlight stores heat in the thermal mass and warms the air channel causing circulation through vents {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall. During the heating cycle the Trombe wall radiates stored heat.|$|E
25|$|Architects promote {{double glazing}} in {{residential}} houses, which avoids the inefficient {{convection of heat}} across the relatively narrow gap between the panes, but the tower exploits this effect. The shafts pull warm {{air out of the}} building during the summer and warm the building in the winter using <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heating.</b> The shafts also allow sunlight to pass through the building, making the work environment more pleasing, and keeping the lighting costs down.|$|E

50|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> {{building}} design and energy-efficient landscaping support the Passive house energy conservation and can integrate {{them into a}} neighborhood and environment. Following <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> building techniques, where possible buildings are compact in shape to reduce their surface area, with principal windows oriented towards the equator - south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere - to maximize <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> gain. However, the use of solar gain, especially in temperate climate regions, is secondary to minimizing the overall house energy requirements. In climates and regions needing to reduce excessive summer <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain, whether from direct or reflected sources, Brise soleil, trees, attached pergolas with vines, vertical gardens, green roofs, and other techniques are implemented.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{cost-effective}} {{steps toward}} {{a reduction in}} a building's energy consumption usually occur during the design process. [...] To achieve efficient energy use, zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice. Successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested <b>passive</b> <b>solar,</b> or artificial/fake conditioning, principles that work with the on-site assets. Sunlight and <b>solar</b> <b>heat,</b> prevailing breezes, and {{the cool of the}} earth below a building, can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means. ZEBs are normally optimized to use <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> gain and shading, combined with thermal mass to stabilize diurnal temperature variations throughout the day, and in most climates are superinsulated. All the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available off-the-shelf today.|$|R
2500|$|The {{proposed}} {{development was}} described as a business centre and [...] "media hub" [...] with offices, community meeting facilities, a café, roof terrace and gardens. The developers stated that it would support about 170 jobs, encourage regeneration of the London Road/Valley Gardens area and provide the focus for a [...] "creative café culture". Units aimed at startup companies would be included. Conran and Partners incorporated energy-saving schemes such as <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> and rainwater harvesting into their design. English Heritage agreed with the surveyor that the building's historic interest had been reduced and that its dilapidated condition had made renovation unviable; restoration would have cost £3.5m according to the developer's estimates. Local community groups agreed with the proposal because of concerns that squatters would occupy the building if it continued to stand empty.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{convection}} causing rising {{warm air}} and falling cooler air {{can result in}} an uneven stratification of heat.

Natural human cooling by perspiration and evaporation may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans, but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers {{at the top of a}} room, and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic, or through nearby windows.
