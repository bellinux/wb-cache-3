5|$|Scholars {{believe that}} stichometry became {{established}} in Athens {{sometime during the}} 5th century BCE when copying prose works became common. Stichometry is mentioned briefly in Plato's Laws (c. 347 BCE), several times in Isocrates (early to mid-4th century), and in Theopompus (late 4th to early 3rd century), but these casual references suggest the practice was already routine. The same standard line was used for stichometry among the Greeks and Romans for about a thousand years until stichometry apparently fell out of use among the Byzantine Greeks in the Middle Ages as <b>page</b> <b>numbers</b> became more common.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual <b>page</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E

40|$|Let S {{denote the}} set of (possibly noncanonical) base pairs {i, j} of an RNA {{tertiary}} structure; i. e. {i, j} ∈ S {{if there is a}} hydrogen bond between the ith and jth nucleotide. The <b>page</b> <b>number</b> of S, denoted π(S), is the minimum number k such that S can be decomposed into a disjoint union of k secondary structures. Here, we show that computing the <b>page</b> <b>number</b> is NP-complete; we describe an exact computation of <b>page</b> <b>number,</b> using constraint programming, and determine the <b>page</b> <b>number</b> of a collection of RNA tertiary structures, for which the topological genus is known. We describe two greedy algorithms, and show by an example that neither is optimal. We describe an algorithm running in time O(n log n) that produces a decomposition of an RNA structure S on n bases into at most ω(S) ·log n disjoint secondary structures, where ω(S) denotes the maximum number of base pairs that may cross a given base pair. It follows that ω(S) ≤ π(S) ≤ ω(S) · log n, where π(S) denotes the <b>page</b> <b>number</b> of S. We give an O(n 3 / 2) time algorithm for finding a 2 -page decomposition of bisecondary structures for RNA sequences of size n, and we provide bounds on the expected <b>page</b> <b>number</b> of random structures having pseudoknots...|$|R
