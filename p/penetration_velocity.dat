High-speed, diffused back-illuminated long- distance microscopy {{was used}} to resolve the spray structure in the near-nozzle field. The effect of in- jection and ambient pressures, as well as fuel temperature and composition have been studied through measurements of the spray penetration rates, hydraulic delays and spreading angles. Additional infor- mation such as transient flow velocities have been extracted from the measurements and compared to a control-volume spray model. The analysis demonstrated the influence of outlet flow on spray devel- opment with lower <b>penetration</b> <b>velocities</b> and wider spreading angles during the transients (start and end of injection) than during the quasi-steady period of the injection. The effect of fuel composition on penetration was limited, while spreading angle measurements showed wider sprays for ethanol.

40|$|Exposure to {{hazardous}} {{noise levels}} emitted by pneumatic nailing devices contributes significantly to risk of hearing damage among the construction workers throughout the world. This health problem {{comes from the}} lack of appropriate technology such as low noise devices which in turn results {{from the lack of}} scientific knowledge about designing reduced noise devices. This study contributes to the design improvement of pneumatic nailing devices through identifying the noise sources and developing the simulation tool required to redesign the pneumatic nailing device. To identify the noise sources, the study uses a combination of two complementary experimental approaches. The first makes use of time-synchronized data analysis of several variables during the machine operation. This strategy allows identifying the physical processes and provides a detailed separation of the noise generation mechanisms in successive time sequences. However, since multiple noise sources radiate at the same time, this observation approach is not sufficient for noise source identification and ranking. Thus, it is completed by a selective wrapping and muffler procedure. This technique provides overall generated noise associated with each process, as well as ranking of the three major sources: (1) exhaust noise, (2) machine body vibrations, and (3) workpiece vibrations. A special investigation is conducted on this third one with two cases: a workpiece/worktable setup representative of the actual field usage of a nailing device and a workpiece/sandbox setup used in a standardized laboratory test. The study evaluates the efficiency of the workpiece/sandbox setup in reducing the workpiece radiation and obtains a typical workpiece contribution on an actual worksite. To provide a simulation tool, a dynamic model of the pneumatic nailing device needs to be developed. Dynamic modeling of the nailing device requires mathematical modeling of the physical processes involved in its operation. All of these processes can be described through already existing mathematical relations, except for the penetration resistance force (PRF) imposed on the nails when penetrating the wood. The PRF depends on various factors. This study follows two approaches in parallel to develop an empirical prediction law for the PRF: quasi-static and high-speed. The quasi-static approach provides a rapid and precise representation of the law at quasistatic <b>penetration</b> <b>velocities.</b> The law covers the entire displacement range, various nail geometries and sizes, and wood types. The high-speed approach aims to provide a law which covers a much wider range of <b>penetration</b> <b>velocities.</b> The approach is complicated since it requires a sophisticated test machine to conduct the nail driving tests at high <b>penetration</b> <b>velocities.</b> The study designs and fabricates an advanced test machine to later extend the prediction range of the PRF law. The last part of this study develops the dynamic model of a nail gun while integrating the quasi-static PRF law. The model includes dynamics of all the air chambers and the moving parts, and interactions and impacts/contacts between different parts. The study integrates a comprehensive experimental validation of the model. Future improvements in the dynamic model precision will be possible by using the extended version of the PRF law...|$|R

PCA will help find and accentuate differences within the tile, making it easier to find differences. First, the thru-transmission ultrasound data was analyzed. As the ultrasound transducer moves along the surface of the tile, the signal from the sound wave is measured as it reaches the receiver, giving a time signal at each tile location. The information from this time signal is dissected into ten equal segments, and the maximum peak is measured within each segment, or gate. This gives ten measurements at each tile location that correspond to tile depth An image can be made for each of the ten gate measurements. PCA was applied to this data for all of the tile samples, and a performance measure was developed from the loading information.

40|$|Sand is a {{granular}} material, {{and therefore}} it consists of individual grains arranged in a packing. The pores in-between the grains are usually filled with a fluid, in this case air. Now, is this interstitial air able to influence {{the behavior of the}} sand bed as a whole? When a ball impacts on fine, very loose sand, the interstitial air causes a pronounced change. If the bed is loose enough the ball is able to penetrate the sand and surprisingly, the final depth decreases if there is less air present in-between the grains. While the ball penetrates the bed, sand around the ball is compactified and the air in this region is compressed. Since air needs a finite amount of time to flow away it is temporarily trapped and will locally increase the pressure. If an object moves through the bed very slowly, air has ample time to move out of this compactified region and this quasi-static situation should be similar to that without air. The drag force experienced by the object for very low <b>penetration</b> <b>velocities</b> is indeed equal to the measured force at reduced ambient pressure, and much larger than the force needed to push the ball at higher velocities.

Certain periods of this mission would require the spacecraft to remain stationary relative to the NEO, in an environment characterized by very low gravity levels; such situations require an anchoring mechanism that is compact, easy to deploy, and upon mission completion, easy to remove. The design philosophy used in this task relies on the simulation capability of a high-performance multibody dynamics physics engine. On Earth, {{it is difficult to}} create low-gravity conditions, and testing in low-gravity environments, whether artificial or in space, can be costly and very difficult to achieve. Through simulation, the effect of gravity can be controlled with great accuracy, making it ideally suited to analyze the problem at hand. Using Chrono::Engine, a simulation pack age capable of utilizing massively parallel Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) hardware, several validation experiments were performed. Modeling of the regolith interaction has been carried out, after which the anchor penetration tests were performed and analyzed. The regolith was modeled by a granular medium composed of very large numbers of convex three-dimensional rigid bodies, subject to microgravity levels and interacting with each other with contact, friction, and cohesional forces. The multibody dynamics simulation approach used for simulating anchors penetrating a soil uses a differential variational inequality (DVI) methodology to solve the contact problem posed as a linear complementarity method (LCP). Implemented within a GPU processing environment, collision detection is greatly accelerated compared to traditional CPU (central processing unit) - based collision detection. Hence, systems of millions of particles interacting with complex dynamic systems can be efficiently analyzed, and design recommendations can be made in a much shorter time.

In order to quantify Cs- 137 migration in soils, we compiled and modelled depth-distributed data documented in the literature published before 2013.
