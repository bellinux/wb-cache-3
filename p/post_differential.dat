40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{macroeconomic}} effects of peso problems by simulating numerically a small-scale rational expectations macromodel. The {{model is a}} conventional IS-LM-AS model of an open economy under floating exchange rates. The peso problem has been incorporated in the model by assuming that the money supply process entails a small but nonzero probability of a sizable discrete shift in the money supply. In addition, the severity of a peso problem can vary over time. The procedure used in solving our model {{is more complicated than}} the standard solution methods for rational expectation models in that there are two dates at which expectations are formed. Both deterministic and stochastic simulations were used in the analysis. Results from the deterministic simulations suggest that the presence of the peso problem leads to an overvalued real exchange rate and a higher ex ante real interest rate, which results in output losses. In the stochastic simulations, the values of the IS, AS and monetary disturbances vary along with the severity of the peso problem. The simulations show that the presence of a variable peso problem affects the correlations between macroeconomic variables, especially between the ex <b>post</b> yield <b>differential</b> and either the real exchange rate or the output gap. In the case of conventional (non-autocorrelated) IS, AS and monetary disturbances, these correlation coefficients are equal to zero. The inclusion of a variable peso problem in the simulation model changes these results: the ex <b>post</b> yield <b>differential</b> is now correlated with the real exchange rate and the output gap.

M., "How US Antitrust Can Go Astray: The Brand Name Prescription Drug Litigation", International Journal of Business and Economics, 1997, 4, 3, 000 - 000) is incomplete because it presumes the optimality of marginal cost pricing, ignoring the sunk costs of R&D. Pharmaceutical R&D is a global joint cost of serving all consumers worldwide; it accounts for roughly 30 % of total costs. Ramsey pricing principles imply that differential pricing related to inverse demand elasticities is the second best optimal strategy to cover the joint costs. Actual price differentials to managed care customers in the US should roughly approximate Ramsey optimal differentials, {{in the absence of}} legal constraints. In the European Union (EU), traditional price differentials between countries are being undermined by parallel trade and regulation based on foreign prices. This break down of market segmentation leads manufacturers to adopt uniform prices EU-wide. Efficiency and distributive effects of such policies are probably negative.

Most important are the imperfectly subtracted seeing halos of neighboring stars, residual image distortions and unrecognized confusion of the target source with fainter sources in the background. Further contributors to the error budget are the uncertainty in estimating the point spread function, the signal-to-noise ratio induced statistical uncertainty, coordinate transformation errors, the chromaticity of refraction in Earth's atmosphere, the <b>post</b> adaptive optics <b>differential</b> tilt jitter and anisoplanatism. For stars as bright as mK= 14, residual image distortions limit the astrometry, for fainter stars the limitation is set by the seeing halos of the surrounding stars.

No excavation is required and only a small diameter hole is drilled on the existing slab foundation before injection of PU. Performance of this method is compared against lightweight concrete slab using finite element analysis called PLAXIS 2 D.

To better understand the differences previously found between M and HM runners, we studied 11 non-asthmatic amateur athletes (HM n= 6, M n= 5, age: 44. 5 ± 6. 7 yrs, race time: HM 101 ± 18 min, M 218 ± 35 min) participating to the 2012 Palermo Marathon.

40|$|Background: The {{basidiomycete}} Moniliophthora roreri is {{the causal}} agent of Frosty pod rot (FPR) disease of cacao (Theobroma cacao), {{the source of}} chocolate, and FPR {{is one of the}} most destructive diseases of this important perennial crop in the Americas. This hemibiotroph infects only cacao pods and has an extended biotrophic phase lasting up to sixty days, culminating in plant necrosis and sporulation of the fungus without the formation of a basidiocarp. Results: We sequenced and assembled 52. 3 Mb into 3, 298 contigs that represent the M. roreri genome. Of the 17, 920 predicted open reading frames (OFRs), 13, 760 were validated by RNA-Seq. Using read count data from RNA sequencing of cacao pods at 30 and 60 days <b>post</b> infection, <b>differential</b> gene expression was estimated for the biotrophic and necrotrophic phases of this plant-pathogen interaction. The sequencing data were used to develop a genome based secretome for the infected pods. Of the 1, 535 genes encoding putative secreted proteins, 1, 355 were expressed in the biotrophic and necrotrophic phases. Analysis of the data revealed secretome gene expression that correlated with infection and intercellular growth in the biotrophic phase and invasive growth and plant cellular death in the necrotrophic phase. Conclusions: Genome sequencing and RNA-Seq was used to determine and validate the Moniliophthora roreri genome and secretome. High sequence identity between Moniliophthora roreri genes and Moniliophthora perniciosa genes supports the taxonomic relationship with Moniliophthora perniciosa and the relatedness of this fungus to other basidiomycetes. Analysis of RNA-Seq data from infected plant tissues revealed differentially expressed genes in the biotrophic and necrotrophic phases. The secreted protein genes that were upregulated in the biotrophic phase are primarily associated with breakdown of the intercellular matrix and modification of the fungal mycelia, possibly to mask the fungus from plant defenses. Based on the transcriptome data, the upregulated secreted proteins in the necrotrophic phase are hypothesized to be actively attacking the plant cell walls and plant cellular components resulting in necrosis. These genes are being used to develop a new understanding of how this disease interaction progresses and to identify potential targets to reduce the impact of this devastating disease. © 2014 Meinhardt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

Better vaccines are therefore required and influenza challenge studies {{can be used to}} test the efficacy of new vaccines. However, this requires the accurate post-challenge classification of subjects by outcome, which is limited in current methods that use artificial thresholds to assign 'symptomatic' and 'asymptomatic' phenotypes. We present data from an influenza challenge study in which 22 healthy adults (11 vaccinated) were inoculated with H 3 N 2 influenza (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005). We generated genome-wide gene expression data from peripheral blood taken immediately before the challenge and at 12, 24 and 48 h post-challenge. Variation in symptomatic scoring was found amongst those with laboratory confirmed influenza. By combining the dynamic transcriptomic data with the clinical parameters this variability can be reduced. We identified four subjects with severe laboratory confirmed influenza that show differential gene expression in 1103 probes 48 h post-challenge compared to the remaining subjects.

Burkard traps sampled atmospheric pollen {{for six years}} from multiple sites in Tucson, Arizona. Tauber and soil samples were collected for two years at Tumamoc Hill (Tucson). Morus, Ambrosia, Gramineae, and Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthus characterize Tucson's airborne pollen. Artemisia, Garrya and summer Pinus pollen are transported from the mountains. Annual pollen capture is similar between Burkard and Tauber samplers. Atmospheric pollen is seasonally variable; annual variability is low. Spatial variability among sites is low. Pollen concentrations vary widely among sites, but taxonomic composition remains constant. Reentrained soil pollen comprises 11 % of the airborne pollen. Gramineae and Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthus pollen comprise 90 % of the reentrained pollen. Pollen reentrainment varies seasonally. High maximum and minimum temperatures, low dew point and moderate wind speeds are associated with maximum atmospheric pollen concentrations. Winds preceding summer storms cause increased pollen concentrations. Deterioration characterizes pollen from soils. Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthus, Ambrosia, Other Compositae and Graminear are commonly found; Morus is rarely found. Pinus, Sphaeralcea, Boerhaavia and Kallstroemia are present in low numbers. These taxa have thick pollen walls, and they resist destruction. Seasonally collected soil samples have similar pollen spectra. Seasonal airborne pollen variability {{does not affect the}} soil pollen spectra. Inoculated soil pollen is well preserved, but pollen is lost rapidly. After one year, pollen concentrations approached background levels for seven of the eight pollen taxa tested. Solidago remained an order of magnitude higher. Pollen morphology {{may play a role in}} differential pollen loss. Pollen from the inoculated plots is lost through post-mortem transport. Pollen in soils is time-averaged and exhibits little temporal variability. The average airborne pollen spectra differs from the pollen in the soil. Soil pollen was degraded; inoculated plot pollen was well preserved. I conclude airborne pollen contributes little to the soil pollen of Tumamoc Hill. The soil pollen spectra is affected by selective- or non-deposition of airborne pollen (e. g. Morus), differential pollen destruction, and <b>differential</b> <b>post</b> mortem transport...|$|R
40|$|Imaging mass {{spectrometry}} (IMS) in microscope mode allows the spatially resolved molecular constitution {{of a large}} sample section to be analysed in a single experiment. If performed in a linear mass spectrometer, the applicability of microscope IMS is limited {{by a number of}} factors: the low mass resolving power of the employed ion optics; the time resolution afforded by the scintillator screen based particle detector and the multi-hit capability, per pixel, of the employed imaging sensor. To overcome these limitations, this thesis concerns the construction of an advanced ion optic employing a pulsed extraction method to gain a higher ToF resolution, the development of a bright scintillator screen with short emission lifetime, and the application of the Pixel Imaging Mass Spectrometry (PImMS) sensor with multi-mass imaging and time stamping capabilities. Initial experimental results employing a three electrode ion optic to spatially map ions emitted from a sample surface are presented. By applying a static electric potential a time-of-flight resolution of t / 2 Δ t = 54 and a spatial resolution of 20 μm are determined across a field-of-view of 4 mm diameter. While the moderate time-of-flight resolution only allows particles separated by a few Dalton to be distinguished, the instrument is used to demonstrate the multi-mass imaging capabilities of the PImMS sensor when being applied to image grid structures or tissue samples. An improved time-of-flight resolution is achieved by <b>post</b> extraction <b>differential</b> acceleration of a selected range of ions (up to 100 Da) using a newly developed five electrode ion optic. This modification is shown to correct the initial velocity spread of the ions coming off the sample surface, which yields an enhanced time-of-flight resolution of t / 2 Δ t = 2000. The spatial resolution of the instrument is found to be 20 μm across a field-of-view of 4 mm. Adjusting the extraction field strength applied to the ion optic of the constructed mass spectrometer allows the optimised mass range to be tuned to any mass of interest. Ion images are recorded for various samples with comparable spatial and ToF resolution. Hence, studies on tissue sections and multi sample arrays become accessible with the improved design and operational principle of the microscope mode IMS instrument. A fast and efficient conversion of impinging ions into detectable flashes of light, which can consequently be recorded by a fast imaging sensor, is essential to maintain the achievable time-of-flight and spatial resolution of the IMS instrument constructed. In order to find a suitable fast and bright scintillator to be applied in a microchannel based particle detector, various inorganic and organic substances are characterised in terms of their emission properties following electron excitation. Poly-para-phenylene laser dye screens are found to show an outstanding performance among all substances analysed. An emission life time of below 4 ns and a brightness exceeding that of a P 47 screen (industry standard) by a factor 2 × is determined. No signal degradation is observed over an extended period, and the spatial resolution is found to be comparable to commercial imaging detectors. Hence, these scintillator screens are fully compatible with any ion imaging application requiring a high time resolution. In a further series of mass spectrometric experiments, ions are accelerated onto a scintillator mounted in front of a multi pixel photon counter. The charged particle impact stimulated the emission of a few photons, which are collected by the fast photon counter. Poly- para -phenylene laser dyes again show an outstanding efficiency for the conversion of ions into photons, resulting in a signal enhancement of up to 5 × in comparison to previous experiments, which employed an inorganic LYSO scintillator.

40|$|CBP (CREB Binding Protein) is global {{transcriptional}} co-activator and histone acetyltransferase. CBP {{is involved}} in the modulation of the transcription of many genes via histone acetylation at the promoter regions of the target genes. Also, non-histone proteins and transcription factors can be acetylated by CBP to promote their transcriptional activation. In addition to its transcription co-activator role, CBP {{is involved in}} many other pathological and physiological cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation, cell transformation and development, response to stress, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. CBP and its paralogue p 300, play double-edged roles in the regulation of p 53, a well characterized tumor suppressor protein, via ubiquitination and acetylation activities. Prior work has shown that CBP and p 300 contribute to the maintenance of physiologic p 53 levels in unstressed cells via a cytoplasmic but not nuclear, p 53 -directed E 4 polyubiquitin ligase activity, subsequently leading to p 53 proteasomal degradation. Our previous work also revealed that CBP and p 300 possess intrinsic cytoplasmic but not nuclear E 3 autoubiquitination activity in the absence of cellular stress. The mechanism of the compartmentalized CBP/p 300 ubiquitin ligase activities was not studied. In this thesis, I present insights gained from efforts to determine the regulation of CBP ubiquitin ligase activities in the cytoplasm versus nucleus, in the absence and presence of DNA damage stress. Chapter two discusses the effect of DNA damage on CBP E 3 autoubiquitination activity and also addresses the <b>differential</b> <b>post</b> translational modifications between cytoplasmic and nuclear CBP, in the absence and presence of DNA damage. Aspects of the regulation of the compartmentalized CBP ubiquitin ligase activities in the absence of cellular stress were covered in chapter three. We employed Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) and mass spectrometry analysis of purified cytoplasmic and nuclear CBP to identify nuclear and cytoplasmic CBP interacting proteins. MudPIT analysis revealed that Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Regulator protein (CCAR 2), also known as Deleted in Breast Cancer 1 protein (DBC 1), is a novel CBP-interacting protein, in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Functional analysis suggested that DBC 1 directly regulates cellular compartmentalization of CBP E 3 and p 53 -directed E 4 ubiquitination activities. This work identifies the different regulatory mechanisms of differential CBP ubiquitin ligase activities in the absence and presence of DNA damage. Remarkably, DBC 1 was identified as a novel binding partner of CBP and a critical regulator of CBP ubiquitination activities towards p 53. This work may provide novel strategies for the development of cancer therapeutics against tumors maintaining wild type p 53, which have deleted DBC 1...|$|R

Whey protein has numerous nutritional, {{physiological and}} functional benefits. It {{is therefore a}} perfect candidate for high protein beverage applications. Whey protein beverages are gaining popularity among athletes, bodybuilders and health conscientious individuals. In spite of the reasonable solubility of whey proteins in acidic beverages (pH 3. 4 - 4. 5), thermal processing and prolonged ambient storage can result in protein aggregation via hydrophobic and disulfide molecular interactions between denatured proteins, especially at relatively high protein concentration (> 4. 2 %, w/v). Currently, whey protein acidic beverages available in the market contain at most 4 % whey protein. To better deliver the nutritional quality and expand the commercial value, it is desirable to develop shelf stable high whey protein acidic beverages (> 4. 2 % protein). It is also desirable to produce a less acidic beverage, to reduce undesirable sourness and astringency. We hypothesized that glycosylation of whey protein via early stage Maillard reaction results in higher net charge, enhanced thermal stability, increased structural rigidity, and reduced buffering capacity. Partially glycosylated whey protein (PGWP) can thus be used to produce high protein acidic beverages that are shelf stable with acceptable sensory quality. Therefore, our long term goal was to produce a partially glycosylated whey protein with enhanced solubility and thermal stability over a wide pH range, while maintaining nutritional and sensory quality. Glycosylation conditions were optimized to promote glycosylation of whey protein, while minimizing browning and maintaining nutritional quality. Unreacted dextran was removed using liquid chromatography, and the protein fractions, both non-reacted protein and glycosylated protein were collected and labeled as PGWP. Extent of glycosylation, browning, % lysine blockage, % loss in free amine, and in-vitro digestibility were monitored. Solubility and thermal stability of PGWP were compared to whey protein isolate (WPI), at 5 - 10 % (w/v) protein concentration, pH 3. 4, 4. 5, 5. 5 and/or 7. 0, and pre and <b>post</b> thermal treatments. <b>Differential</b> scanning calorimetry (DSC) and SDS-PAGE were employed to monitor onset of denaturation and polymerization, respectively. Exposure of sulfhydryl groups and surface hydrophobicity were monitored during heat treatment of 5 % protein solutions at 75 °C for 60 min. The pI of PGWP was as well. For structural characterization mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) were used. The glycosylation site was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MS (MALDI-TOF MS). Solutions (5 % protein, w/v) of WPI and PGWP were analyzed by SERS to determine secondary and tertiary structural changes of the protein as affected by glycosylation, pH and heating. The sourness and astringency of protein acidic solutions/beverages formulated with PGWP and WPI at 5 % protein and at different pHs were determined. The storage stability of the formulated solutions/beverages over 6 - 8 weeks was determined, by measuring solubility, turbidity, and protein aggregation using capillary electrophoresis (EC). Overall, results proved that the solubility and thermal stability of whey protein, at relative high protein concentrations, can be enhanced over {{a broad range of}} pH upon partial and limited Maillard-induced glycosylation. The enhanced solubility and thermal stability of PGWP was attributed to structural rigidity, unique glycosylation sites, resistance to denaturation, and shift to a more acidic pI, all of which contributed to reduced protein/protein interactions. The nutritional quality was maintained and advanced stages of Maillard reaction were not detected. Partial glycosylation of whey protein reduced its buffering capacity, and consequently less amount of acid was required to reach the targeted pH of the protein fortified solution/beverage. The reduced acidity of the PGWP fortified beverages, especially at pH 4, resulted in lower perceived sourness and astringency compared to the WPI fortified beverages. In addition, the solubility and turbidity of PGWP solution prepared at pH 4. 5 were maintained fairly well during storage at or below 25 °C. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of using PGWP in the production of shelf stable high protein acidic beverages (> 4. 2 % protein) that can be less sour and astringent than what is currently present in the market. Our results also provided information that is essential to understand the structure/function relationship upon Maillard-induced glycosylation of whey proteins. This basic information is useful for directed structural modification research aiming at improving whey protein functionality...|$|R
