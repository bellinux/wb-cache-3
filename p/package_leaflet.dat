Aims: to identify and study the structure of different types of imprints, and discuss potential problems related to their structure/format. Method: 531 Portuguese <b>package</b> <b>leaflets</b> (PLs) were manually inspected to confirm and collect the description of the imprints. The number of letters, symbols or mixtures of both was quantified in each imprint. An electronic tool was used to evaluate the linguistic characteristics.

40|$|Background: The <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> {{included}} in the packaging of all medicinal products {{plays an important role}} in the transmission of medicine-related information to patients. Therefore, in 2009, the European Commission published readability guidelines to try to ensure that the information contained in the <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> is understood by patients. Objective: The main objective of this study was to calculate and compare the readability levels and length (number of words) of the package leaflets for biological medicines in 2007, 2010, and 2013. Methods: Thesampleofthisstudyincluded 36 biologicalmedicinepackageleafletsthatweredownloadedfromtheEuropean Medicines Agency website in three different years: 2007, 2010, and 2013. The readability of the selected package leaflets was obtained using the following readability formulas: SMOG grade, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, and Szigriszt's perspicuity index. The length (number of words) of the package leaflets was also measured. Afterwards, the relationship between these quantitative variables (three readability indexes and length) and categorical (or qualitative) variables were analyzed. The categorical variables were the year when the <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> was downloaded, the <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> section, type of medicine, year of authorization of biological medicine, and marketing authorization holder. Results: The readability values of all the package leaflets exceeded the sixth-grade reading level, which is the recommended value for health-related written materials. No statistically significant differences were found between the three years of study in the readability indexes, although differences were observed in the case of the length (P=. 002), which increased over the study period. When the relationship between readability indexes and length and the other variables was analyzed, statistically significant differences were found between <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> sections (P<. 001) and between the groups of medicine only with regard to the length over the three studied years (P=. 002 in 2007, P=. 007 in 2010, P=. 009 in 2013). Linear correlation was observed between the readability indexes (SMOG grade and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r 2 =. 92; SMOG grade and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 81; Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 95), but not between the readability indexes and the length (length and SMOG grade: r 2 =. 05; length and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r 2 =. 03; length and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 02). Conclusions: There was no improvement in the readability of the package leaflets studied between 2007 and 2013 despite the European Commission's 2009 guideline on the readability of package leaflets. The results obtained from the different readability formulas coincided from a qualitative point of view. Efforts to improve the readability of package leaflets for biological medicines are required to promote the understandability and accessibility of this online health information by patients and thereby contribute to the appropriate use of medicines and medicine safety...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: All {{medicines}} {{for human}} use are marketed with a <b>package</b> <b>leaflet.</b> Every <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> must contain an initial list mentioning all {{sections of the}} document in accordance to the European template Quality Review of Documents, being not to extensive, i. e. comprising approximately 1500 words. The so-called mixed leaflets contain information about medicines {{with more than one}} strength/pharmaceutical form, and only exceptionally are authorized. In this context, the objectives of the present study comprised the identification of issues in all package leaflets of Portuguese non-generic medicines: 1. to confirm the presence of an initial list, 2. to quantify the number of mixed leaflets, and 3. to evaluate their length (in number of pages). Material and Methods: Consultation of the leaflets, in a public database (Infomed), according to the classification of the National Prescribing Guide (1 st trimester 2012). The data collected was subject to quality control and statistical analysis. Results: Identification of 2729 package leaflets, representing 3080 medicines. A total of 2042 leaflets were evaluated, with 181 (8. 9 %) missing the initial list and 351 (17. 2 %) being mixed. The average number of pages was 6. 9 (SD= 2. 6), the minimum = 2 and the maximum = 26. Discussion: In some cases, readability and comprehension of some Portuguese leaflets might be compromised since: 1) some leaflets did not contain an initial list, 2) were classified as mixed leaflets, and/or 3) were classified as too extensive. Conclusion: Regulatory authorities and marketing authorization holders might need to take into consideration these issues during the development and approval of package leaflets...|$|E

Aims To quantify the opinion of users of medicines on PLs {{through the application of}} a self-administered Likert scale, taking into consideration subjects’ sociodemographic data. Methods Participants were enrolled from two Portuguese regions: urban/littoral (Lisbon) and rural/interior (Centre). 503 participants were included: 53 per cent males, 45 per cent 12 years of schooling). A questionnaire was used to collect the sociodemographic data. A Likert scale was self-administered to rate the characteristics of 12 randomized PLs (6 from prescription medicines and 6 from over-the-counter medicines) (August-December 2014). An invitation was send to several institutions (e. g., municipal councils). The inclusion criteria were: agreeing, be capable of reading/writing, and be more than 17 years old. Results In the Likert scores obtained, {{no significant differences were found}} related to region, sex, marital status, age group (≥ 65 years and other), and employment status of participants. By contrast, significant differences were found related to education ( 2 = 42. 747; p 12 years of schooling, more regular reading habits (2 or more books/year), higher income and less frequent medicines use, showed a more negative global opinion on PLs. Conclusion Sociodemographic data are important to understand users’ opinion on PLs. It seems that more educated subjects are more demanding. A lower socio-economic status positively influenced the participants’ opinion, with subjects’ poorer education being a relevant factor in this population.

As long as the consumers cannot retrieve the SVHC information by such alternative means, the maximum time limit for the answer should be reduced from the given time of 45 – 10  days. The experiences {{in the present study}} show that the majority of suppliers sent their answers already today in less than 10  days. Up to now, it is unclear whether missing answers should be interpreted as ‘the article contains less than 0.1 % of any SVHC’ or whether the information request was ignored in the company. Therefore, the consumer should receive a confirmation of receipt of a request and suppliers should be liable to answer consumer requests in all cases.|$|E
30|$|A self-developed {{questionnaire}} was prepared; it included respondents’ demographic information, such as gender and age, the purchase and utilization of OTCs, {{and the following}} questions: (1) Among the information providers below, which do you usually use to obtain information on OTCs? (2) Among the information channels below, which do you usually use to obtain information on OTCs? and (3) Among the information characteristics below, which do you consider valuable for information on OTCs? In this questionnaire, “information” was particularly limited to the efficacy and safety of OTCs. Thirteen information sources and 10 information channels were investigated. The information sources were OTC manufacturers, public organizations (e.g. MHLW, local health authorities), ordinary users of OTCs, family or friends using OTCs, mass communications, OTC experts, people of learning and experience (e.g. professors, academic researchers), medical doctors, pharmacists, registered distributors, nurses, public health nurses, and salespersons. The information channels were customer services of OTC manufacturers, consultation services of public organizations, consultation at pharmacies, the Internet, consultation at medical institutions, TV or radio, newspapers or advertising inserts, books or magazines, <b>packages</b> or <b>package</b> <b>leaflets,</b> and family or friends. For information characteristics, 6 properties were defined: “specialty” (specialized information about OTCs, including scientific knowledge such as action mechanisms of active ingredients), “objectivity” (fact-based scientific and objective information furnished by non-stakeholders), “concreteness” (concrete features of OTCs based on users’ real-life experience), “comprehensiveness” (information that covers {{a wide range of}} knowledge of every OTC product), “individuality” (information tailored to consumers’ individual conditions, constitution, lifestyles and so on), and “availability” (information easily obtained at any time and place).|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{internet}} is widely and increasingly used {{to search for}} health information.

Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the internet as a source of MI compared to other sources of MI; to identify those who use the internet as a source of MI; and to describe patterns of use of the internet as a source of MI. Methods: A cross-sectional design employed a web-based questionnaire posted by patients' and other organizations as well as pharmacies on their websites during six weeks in the beginning of 2014. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations of background variables to the use of different MI sources. Results: The most frequently used MI sources among respondents (n = 2489) were <b>package</b> <b>leaflets</b> (90 %), pharmacists (83 %), physicians (72 %), and the internet (68 %). According to a multivariate analysis, internet use for MI was associated with female gender, age < 65 years, higher education, daily use of the internet, and continuous use of vitamins or herbals. MI was most commonly searched from a Finnish health portal (56 %) and websites of pharmacies (41 %). Of the respondents, nearly half (43 %) used search engines to find information from the internet.

The commonest method used for discovering previously unknown safety risks is spontaneous notifications. In this study we examine the use of data mining algorithms to identify signals from adverse events reported in a phase IIIb/IV clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of several Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in African children. We used paediatric safety data from a multi-site, multi-country clinical study conducted in seven African countries (Burkina Faso, Gabon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Mozambique). Each site compared three out of four ACTs, namely amodiaquine-artesunate (ASAQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or chlorproguanil/dapsone and artesunate (CD+A). We examine two pharmacovigilance signal detection methods, namely proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network on the clinical safety dataset. Among the 4, 116 children (6 - 59 months old) enrolled and followed up for 28 days post treatment, a total of 6, 238 adverse events were reported resulting into 346 drug-event combinations. Nine signals were generated both by proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network. A review of the manufacturer <b>package</b> <b>leaflets,</b> an online Multi-Drug Symptom/Interaction Checker (DoubleCheckMD) and further by therapeutic area experts reduced the number of signals to five. The ranking of some drug-adverse reaction pairs on the basis of their signal index differed between the two methods.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review {{studies on}} the {{readability}} of package leaflets of medicinal products for human use. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review between 2008 and 2013 using the keywords “Readability and Package Leaflet” and “Readability and Package Insert” in the academic search engine Biblioteca do Conhecimento Online, comprising different bibliographic resources/databases. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses criteria were applied to prepare the draft of the report. Quantitative and qualitative original studies were included. Opinion or review studies not written in English, Portuguese, Italian, French, or Spanish were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 202 studies, of which 180 were excluded and 22 were enrolled [two enrolling healthcare professionals, 10 enrolling other type of participants (including patients), three focused on adverse reactions, and 7 descriptive studies]. The package leaflets presented various readability problems, such as complex and difficult to understand texts, small font size, or few illustrations. The main methods to assess the readability of the <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> were usability tests or legibility formulae. Limitations with these methods included reduced number of participants; lack of readability formulas specifically validated for specific languages (e. g., Portuguese); and absence of an assessment on patients literacy, health knowledge, cognitive skills, levels of satisfaction, and opinions.

40|$|Medical {{decisions}} are paradigmatically uncertain. Awareness of this uncertainty at the policy level {{has produced a}} strict regulation of the information exchange related to medical issues, e. g. {{by means of the}} institute of the informed consent or through tight administrative norms regulating the pharmaceutical communication towards the public. As a special support of such sort of information, also the drug <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> has been object of thorough legal regulation, especially developed in the European and German legislation. However, precisely in Germany, recent court decisions concerning damage compensation for information faults have delivered contradictory judgments in relation to <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> information and the patient’s contributory negligence. Court argumentations in these cases range from the appeal to the patient’s duty of taking notice of the PL’s content to general observations concerning the irreplaceable role of doctor’s information. These observations are also backed by considerations regarding PLs’ information design and layout, which, in despite of great changes {{in the course of their}} history, are still object of improvement efforts (see also the recent conferences at the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices – BfArM – devoted to the analysis and testing of PL readability: 15 th February 2006 and 5 th September 2007). Moreover PL information is blamed by health professionals of hindering compliance. Indeed, empirical findings emerging from psycho- sociological literature hint at contradictory attitudes in relation to health risk information in general: desire for this sort of information is not monotonically dependent on perceived uncertainty and present research falls short of providing coherent models of health information seeking behavior, which is expected to influence information processing and eventually lead to a decision change (e. g. therapy interruption). Apart from few exceptions (Koyuncu, 2005, 2006, Schlund, 1999) the legal literature on <b>package</b> <b>leaflet</b> fails to adequately address the disclaiming function of package leaflets and their role in the lay therapeutic choice. This may be partly explained by the fact that PLs have been developed within safety regulation, in which PL information is principally called to warrant for correct and safe use (Hart, 2003 a. o.), and also by the fact that liability for adequate information mainly concerns the doctor. By tacking into account the liability constraints determining the institutional functions of PL information, the dissertation investigates the role of PL information within the lay therapeutic choice and outlines the articulation of the responsibility spheres among doctor, pharmaceutical firm and patient as far as the therapeutic risk is concerned. The main conclusion resulting from my analysis is that legal function of PL information is not exhausted by safety purposes: as a privileged form of product instruction, it is also subject to liability regulation with a consequent reallocation of damage responsibility through risk disclosure. Therefore two main legal-communicative functions are identified for PL information: 1. Warning and risk prevention function, in observance of the consumer’s right to safety; 2. Disclosure of residual risk, in observance of the constitutionally protected right to self- determination. Safety information should prevent avoidable risk to occur; instead self-determination information should declare the unavoidable (residual) risk, so as to insure that the drug user is aware of it when he decides whether to undertake the therapy or not. The notion of residual risk is fundamental in this setting, because it is the risk which the beneficiary party needs to shoulder unless he has not previously been informed about it by the doctor and/or by the pharmaceutical firm through the PL. Once it has been established that PL information is not only a means of safety protection, but also part of the therapeutic informed consent, the point is then to evaluate whether PL information can be considered adequate for consent to be “informed”, i. e. valid. Because, from a normative perspective, information prior to consent should enable the patient to make an informed choice, the role of PL information has been evaluated on the basis of its contribution to epistemic accuracy within the therapeutic choice. By drawing on Andersson and Littkens’ two components model of individual health decision (2003), consent has been defined to be informed to the extent that it approaches a decision under risk, i. e. to the extent that the decision maker can assign a probability measure to each relevant health state and that he knows whether the act of taking the drug (a) shifts the probabilistic distribution towards stochastic dominance with respect to the act of not taking the drug. The model represents in fact the health decision as composed both by states over which the agent can assign probabilities and states shrouded by total ignorance. A complementary weight factor allows representing the proportion of ignorance and risk in the choice at hand. Against the framework of this model, PL information seems to provide the drug consumer with data whose personal relevance, and therefore prognostic value for the individual, is difficult to assess. This means that consent on the basis of PL information rather approaches a decision under ignorance than one under risk: as a prognostic device, PL information fundamentally asks more questions than it answers. Finally, a quantitative study (of limited sample size: n = 55) and a qualitative research have been carried out with the aim to provide a descriptive account of PL information as basis for the therapeutic decision...|$|E
40|$|Background:In Japan, both {{incidence}} and mortality rates of cancers have continuously increased and medical costs are growing {{more rapidly than}} the overall economy of Japan. However, {{there is no consensus}} threshold for cost-effectiveness in medical care, and few studies have investigated cost-effectiveness of medical care in Japan. The present {{study was to determine the}} direct costs of molecular-targeting drugs that were recently approved in Japan through simple and quantitative calculations. Thus, we calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost per life-year gained (LYG) by using reported data from randomized clinical trials for various cancers. Methods:Between 2008 and 2011, we reviewed seven molecular-targeting drugs that were approved for treatment of five cancers in Japan. These drugs included Bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, Lapatinib, and panitumumab. Direct cost, ICER, and LYG of the drugs were estimated from the randomized phase III clinical trial data referred to in <b>package</b> <b>leaflets.</b> Effectiveness was defined as the prolongation of both median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Costs were calculated as those of molecular-targeting drugs. Subsequently, ICER was based on 1 -month increases in both OS and PFS periods and 1 % increases in OS, and LYG was determined. Results:Direct costs ranged from ¥ 724, 804 ($ 9, 060) to ¥ 1, 506, 628 ($ 18, 833). ICERs of the drugs ranged from ¥ 724, 804 ($ 9, 060) to ¥ 1, 506, 628 ($ 18, 833) for a 1 -month increase in OS. For each month of PFS, ICERs ranged from ¥ 372, 243 ($ 4, 653) to ¥ 7, 399, 877 ($ 92, 498). The costs of Bevacizumab and sorafenib for treatment of HCC per 1 % increase in OS were ¥ 376, 657 ($ 4, 708) and ¥ 313, 733 ($ 3, 922), respectively. LYG ranged from ¥ 8, 697, 650 ($ 108, 721) to ¥ 18, 079, 530 ($ 225, 994). Conclusions:Some molecular-targeting drugs are not cost-effective. Considering ethical and moral issues, we should establish economic endpoints to approve new drugs in Japan...|$|R

40|$|In a tsetse-infested area of Kenya, we characterised veterinary-drug outlets {{based on}} {{personnel}} and business characteristics {{to assess their}} capacities to provide clinical veterinary services. Structured questionnaires were administered to the retailers and sought information {{on the characteristics of}} the owners, salespersons and businesses. A total of 41 retail outlets (20 agro-veterinary, 11 pharmacy, and 10 general shops) were identified. There was poor response to questions on owner characteristics. Proprietors, who had no more than secondary education owned 15 out of 28 shops. Few shops (4 / 29) were owned by proprietors, who had professional qualifications (in animal health). Most salespersons had only secondary education but no qualifications. Animal-health assistants (AHAs), veterinarians and manufacturer’s <b>package</b> inserts (drug <b>leaflets)</b> were the preferred information sources for the retailers. We concluded that drug retailers were poorly equipped with the technical knowledge necessary for drug dispensation and advice...|$|R
