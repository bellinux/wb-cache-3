5|$|During the investigation, the Royal Navy {{conducted}} recovery operations. The first {{pieces of}} wreckage were discovered on 12 February 1954 {{and the search}} continued until September 1954, by which time 70 <b>percent</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> of the main structure, 80 percent of the power section, and 50 percent of the aircraft's systems and equipment had been recovered. The forensic reconstruction effort had just begun when the Abell Committee reported its findings. No apparent fault in the aircraft was found, and the British government decided against opening a further public inquiry into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British aerospace industry, and the financial impact of the aircraft's grounding on BOAC's operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation. Comet flights resumed on 23 March 1954.|$|E

25|$|While the {{possibility}} of carbonates on Mars has been {{of great interest to}} exobiologists and geochemists alike, there was little evidence for significant quantities of carbonate deposits on the surface. In the summer of 2008, the TEGA and WCL experiments on the 2007 Phoenix Mars lander found between 3–5wt% (<b>percent</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight)</b> calcite (CaCO3) and an alkaline soil. In 2010, analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16–34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. The magnesium-iron carbonate most likely precipitated from carbonate-bearing solutions under hydrothermal conditions at near-neutral pH in association with volcanic activity during the Noachian Period.|$|E

500|$|In 1987–88 {{and again}} in 2000, reports {{surfaced}} in the Danish press {{that one of the}} bombs had not been recovered. SAC stated {{at the time of the}} accident that all four bombs were destroyed. In 2008, the BBC published an article that was based on its examination of partly declassified documents obtained some years earlier, via the United States Freedom of Information Act. The documents appeared to confirm that within weeks of the accident, investigators realized only three of the weapons could be accounted for. One of the declassified documents—dated to January 1968—details a blackened section of ice which had refrozen with shroud lines from a weapon parachute: [...] "Speculate something melted through the ice such as burning primary or secondary."

2500|$|Hydrogenated {{vegetable}} oils differ in two major ways from other oils which are equally saturated. During hydrogenation, {{it is easier}} for hydrogen to come into contact with the fatty acids {{on the end of the}} triglyceride, and less easy for them to come into contact with the center fatty acid. This makes the resulting fat more brittle than a tropical oil; soy margarines are less [...] "spreadable" [...] The other difference is that trans fatty acids (often called trans fat) are formed in the hydrogenation reactor, and may amount to as much as 40 <b>percent</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> of a partially hydrogenated oil. Hydrogenated oils, especially partially hydrogenated oils with their higher amounts of trans fatty acids are increasingly thought to be unhealthy.|$|E
2500|$|The Brix degrees are {{measured}} using an infrared sensor. This measurement does not equate to Brix degrees from a density or refractive index measurement, {{because it will}} specifically measure dissolved sugar concentration instead of all dissolved solids. When using a refractometer, one should report the result as [...] "refractometric dried substance" [...] (RDS). One might speak of a liquid as having 20 °Bx RDS. This refers to a measure of <b>percent</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> of total dried solids and, although not technically the same as Brix degrees determined through an infrared method, renders an accurate measurement of sucrose content, since sucrose in fact forms the majority of dried solids. The advent of in-line infrared Brix measurement sensors has made measuring the amount of dissolved sugar in products economical using a direct measurement.|$|E

PTFE was inserted into the matrix to assist lubrication, A composite coating of Co-P-PTFE was prepared by electroless plating. The composite consists of 9. 0 percent PTFE, 5. 1 percent P and 85. 9 <b>percent</b> Co <b>by</b> <b>weight.</b> The properties and Structures of Co-P-PTFE composite were studied by X-ray, SEM and ESCA, etc. The results show that the composite had high hardness and good adhesion to the matrix after plating, X-ray analysis showed that the composite was a hexagonal system and its crystal showed no change except that the lattice constant increased, evidently after it was treated with heat. The cobalt (100) face of the hexagonal system parallels the matrix surface and a solid solution was formed in the composite treated with heat. The composite has a strong tendency toward a certain direction. AES analysis indicated that the proportion of Co, P and F content is 13. 9 : 3. 1 : 83 {{on the surface of the}} composite. ESCA analysis proved further that fluorine exists in a form of PTFE on the surface of the composite, and phosphorus and cobalt exist in forms of simple phosphorus and Co+ 3, respectively. Tribology tests showed that the Co-P-PTFE composite has good tribological properties. The composite wear is 45 <b>percent</b> lower <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> loss than the coating of Co-P and 79 percent lower than 45 # steel in dry conditions and 60 <b>percent</b> lower <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> loss than the composite of Ni-P-PTFE in oil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} shows {{the progress of}} geopolymer synthesis based on high calcium fly ash. In this study, the fly ash contents of 60, 65, and 70 <b>percents</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> and sodium hydroxide solution concentrations of 8 to 12 M were used. Alkali activators for the geopolymer synthesis consisted of sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and the weight ratio of Na 2 SiO 3 to NaOH were 0. 50, 1. 00, and 1. 50. Drying shrinkage deformation of geopolymer paste was investigated by longitudinal measurement in a room temperature. Generally, the drying shrinkage behavior could be divided into three groups. The minimum drying shrinkage strain below 3, 000 x 10 - 6 mm/mm was observed. The results indicated that {{an increase in the}} fly ash to alkali solution ratio and the decease of NaOH concentration significantly decreased the drying shrinkage strain. The optimum ratio of Na 2 SiO 3 to NaOH was 1. 0. The findings show that high calcium fly ash geopolymer binder could be used for alternative construction materials with low shrinkage strain...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine if tapping sugar maple trees alters the {{decomposition}} of their leaf litter. To do this, leaf litter collection baskets were placed in tapped and untapped stands of maple trees in Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill, Vermont. Litter was allowed to collect in the baskets throughout the fall 2016 season, and then the leaves were dried, weighed, and run through a nutrient analyzer. The nutrient analysis yielded <b>percent</b> nitrogen <b>by</b> <b>weight,</b> <b>percent</b> carbon <b>by</b> <b>weight,</b> and carbon nitrogen ratios for each sample. It was found that the leaf litter of untapped samples had significantly more nitrogen and significantly lower carbon nitrogen ratios than the leaf litter collected in the tapped stand. This indicates a likely change in the decomposition of the leaves in each stand, because nutrient ratios have been shown to alter decomposition rates for leaves. One of the implications of slowed decomposition is retarded nutrient cycling, which could lead to a reduction in available nitrogen, a limiting nutrient for sugar maples, in the forest’s soil. More research should be done to determine the origin of the difference in nutrients. Additionally, a longer-term study is necessary to monitor the decomposition rates in this forest...|$|R
