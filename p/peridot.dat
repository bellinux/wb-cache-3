50|$|This {{episode was}} met with mixed reception. The episode was praised for the {{drilling}} scenes, the creepy atmosphere, and <b>Peridot's</b> characterization. However, the conclusion to the Cluster arc, which involved the component shards of the Cluster bubbling each other, was heavily criticized. Many people believed {{it to be an}} unsatisfying conclusion to the story arc, and that this conclusion was rushed and anticlimactic.|$|R
25|$|In 1948, Weldon and Ann Kees began {{summering}} at {{the artist}} colony at Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. In {{the autumn of}} that year, Kees had his first one-man show at the <b>Peridot</b> Gallery {{and one of his}} paintings was included in a group show of established and rising artists at the Whitney Museum. Despite these initial successes, however, Kees’s work only had very modest sales.|$|E
25|$|The word {{peridotite}} {{comes from}} the gemstone <b>peridot,</b> which consists of pale green olivine. Classic peridotite is bright green with some specks of black, although most hand samples tend to be darker green. Peridotitic outcrops typically range from earthy bright yellow to dark green in color; this is because olivine is easily weathered to iddingsite. While green and yellow {{are the most common}} colors, peridotitic rocks may exhibit a wide range of colors such as blue, brown, and red.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance and {{exploration}} both had significant {{impacts on the}} development of jewellery in Europe. By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability {{of a wide variety of}} gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the Cheapside Hoard, the stock of a jeweller hidden in London during the Commonwealth period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian emerald, topaz, amazonite from Brazil, spinel, iolite, and chrysoberyl from Sri Lanka, ruby from India, Afghan lapis lazuli, Persian turquoise, Red Sea <b>peridot,</b> as well as Bohemian and Hungarian opal, garnet, and amethyst. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings. Notable among merchants of the period was Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who brought the precursor stone of the Hope Diamond to France in the 1660s.|$|E
40|$|The <b>peridots</b> in the gem {{collection}} of our Museum were acquired {{a long time}} ago (part of them were from the {{collection of}} King William I of the Netherlands). We should be sceptical about data on the origin of this material. Firstly we do not generally know whether the stones were bought or received as a gift; we learned by experience that a person giving material (often a layman) will not be too precise when stating the locality especially as he will not see its importance. Moreover in the last century scientists could not realize yet how valuable an accurate description of the locality would be nowadays. For they did not think of the possibility that samples of one mineral from various localities might have different properties (of course they did not yet know the importance of an investigation as to the nature of inclusions). Besides in cataloguing small objects (such as gemstones) systems were used which did not rule out mistakes, so that a recent investigation of old material may present difficulties as to the definite locality...|$|R
50|$|The port {{was a key}} to {{the trade}} between {{southern}} India and the Phoenicians, the Persians, the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Roman Empire. The important known commodities exported from Muziris were spices (such as black pepper and malabathron), semi-precious stones (such as beryl), pearls, diamonds, sapphires, ivory, Chinese silk, Gangetic spikenard and tortoise shells. The Romans brought money (in gold coins), <b>peridots,</b> thin clothing, figured linens, multicoloured textiles, sulfide of antimony, copper, tin, lead, coral, raw glass, wine, realgar and orpiment. The cry to re-enact the ancient (first Centuries AD/BC) Muziris-Red Sea voyages made from the 1970s onwards by George Menachery and others has become more intense of late. The locations of unearthed coin-hoards suggest an inland trade link from Muziris via the Palghat Gap and along the Kaveri Valley to the east coast of India. Though the Roman trade declined from the 5th century AD, the former Muziris attracted the attention of other nationalities, particularly the Persians, the Chinese and the Arabs, presumably until the devastating floods of Periyar in the 14th century.|$|R
500|$|The centrepiece of the {{coronation}} regalia {{is named after}} Edward the Confessor, and {{is placed on the}} monarch's head at the actual moment of crowning by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Made of gold in 1661, StEdward's Crown has four fleurs-de-lis and four crosses pattée with two depressed arches on top. Surmounting the arches is a jewelled monde and cross pattée. Its frame is embellished with 444 precious and semi-precious stones, including amethysts, garnets, <b>peridots,</b> rubies, sapphires, topazes, tourmalines and zircons. There has been speculation that it may incorporate gold from a medieval crown seized by Cromwell and for some reason not melted down. The crown is [...] tall, and at a weight of [...] it has been noted to be extremely heavy. After 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., the Coronation Crown of GeorgeIV) or their state crown. The tradition of using St Edward's Crown was revived in 1911 for {{the coronation}} of GeorgeV. In 1953, Queen ElizabethII opted to use a stylised image of this crown in coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia throughout the Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority.|$|R
25|$|Pit'dah (פִּטְדָה = in the masoretic text) / Topazios (in the Septuagint) - {{despite the}} {{suggestion}} of the Septuagint that it was Topaz, Topaz was scarcely known {{at the time the}} Book of Exodus was written (according to both the traditional dating of the book and that by critical scholars); in the classical era, topazios referred to Topazos Island on which a particular yellow mineral was mined (topazios means to seek, in reference to the difficulty in finding the island). Others suggest that topaz was merely <b>peridot,</b> a light green semi-precious stone, and which stone in the ancient world was found primarily on Topazos Island as well as on St. John’s Island (Zabargad) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The word pit'dah is thought by scholars to be connected with the Assyrian word hipindu, which refers to something that flashed (presumably meaning shimmered), and thus the jewel in question would fit the description of Chrysolite, a translucent greenish yellow mineral, common throughout the Levant, and particularly found on a particular island in the Red Sea, {{under the control of the}} Egyptian Pharaoh.|$|E
500|$|Larger-scale {{agriculture}} {{occurs on}} rubber and cashew plantations. Other economic {{activities in the}} province include gem mining and commercial logging. The most abundant gem in Ratanakiri is blue zircon. Small quantities of amethyst, <b>peridot,</b> and black opal are also produced. Gems are generally mined using traditional methods, with individuals digging holes and tunnels and manually removing the gems; recently, however, commercial mining operations have been moving into the province. Logging, particularly illegal logging, {{has been a problem}} both for environmental reasons and because of land alienation. This illegal logging has been undertaken by the Cambodian military and by Vietnamese loggers. In 1997, an estimated 300,000 cubic meters of logs were exported illegally from Ratanakiri to Vietnam, compared to a legal limit of 36,000 cubic meters. John Dennis, a researcher for the Asian Development Bank, described the logging in Ratanakiri as a [...] "human rights emergency".|$|E

5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1983 by Stephen Ryan (vocals, guitar), Stan Erraught (guitar, {{formerly}} of The <b>Peridots),</b> Peter O'Sullivan (bass guitar), and Bernard Walsh (drums). They were strongly influenced by The Byrds and Gram Parsons, even being labelled [...] "Ireland's answer to The Byrds, Gram Parsons and the Velvet Underground all in one package". After a début single on the Hotwire label ("Clothes of Pride") which received airplay from John Peel, they were signed by Rough Trade, who issued the album Sacred Heart Hotel in 1986, which reached number 11 on the UK Independent Chart. Peel's patronage continued throughout their career, with the band recording four sessions for his BBC Radio 1 show, {{the first of which}} was included on Sacred Heart Hotel. They also appeared on RTÉ television. They released a further single and EP ("Never Saw You"/The Holyhead EP) which was a top five hit on the independent chart, and in 1988, Rough Trade released their second and final album, Speak Slowly, which peaked at number 6. Speak Slowly included the track The Lights of Tetouan although this was not released as a single. [...] The song is written by the band's singer, Stephen Ryan, about growing up on the south coast of Spain from where he could see the Moroccan town of Tetouan. [...] The Lights of Tetouan was covered (as The Lights of Te Touan) by Everything But the Girl on their 1994 EP Rollercoaster [...] Along with the original, as this version is a B-side, it is not widely known/available. However, it is available for listening/viewing online.|$|R
2500|$|Verte ("green" [...] in French) absinthe {{begins as}} a blanche. The blanche is altered by the {{colouring}} step, by which a separate mixture of herbs is steeped into the clear distillate. This confers a <b>peridot</b> green hue and an intense flavour. Vertes represent the prevailing type of absinthe that {{was found in the}} 19th century. Artificially coloured green absinthes may also claimed to be verte, though they lack the characteristic herbal flavours that result from the colouring process.|$|E

At this crisis I had the luck to come across my friend Inspector Hooper, Cape Government Railways, in command of an engine and a brake-van chalked for repair.|$|E
60|$|On one {{occasion}} {{he took up}} the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamp-light, the cymophane with its wire-like line of silver, the pistachio-coloured <b>peridot,</b> rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.|$|E
