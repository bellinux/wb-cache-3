40|$|Purpose – This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} acquirers’ <b>prior</b> related <b>knowledge</b> in the post-acquisition integration process. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify what constitutes the key <b>prior</b> related <b>knowledge</b> that can contribute to the reverse knowledge transfer following Chinese firms’ outward mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to Europe, and explain how <b>prior</b> related <b>knowledge</b> affects such transfer of knowledge. Design/methodology/approach – The authors employ a multiple case study approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted from February 2012 to June 2013 with 24 managers. Findings – The authors find that, in addition to knowledge about the target, prior international business experience, R&D capability, and industrial capabilities are key components of acquirers’ <b>prior</b> related <b>knowledge</b> that can contribute to the success of M&A integration and post-acquisition reverse knowledge transfer. Indeed, Chinese acquirers’ <b>prior</b> related <b>knowledge</b> can influence the reverse knowledge transfer from acquired firms to acquirers by directly improving acquirers’ absorptive capacity and building a harmonious organisational climate to facilitate such transfer. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the absorptive capacity and the cross-border M&A literature. It extends the current knowledge on the key components of an acquirer’s <b>prior</b> related <b>knowledge</b> in the outward M&A by Chinese firms. It also uncovers how post-acquisition reverse knowledge transfer is affected by acquirers’ <b>prior</b> related <b>knowledge...</b>|$|R

I suggest that, in the face of these <b>prior</b> <b>knowledges,</b> it is important to focus on masculinity as performance, as a cultural artefact and one that is deeply harmful to South African men.

5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E

5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in the}} aftermath of another Union defeat.

40|$|The {{integration}} of learners’ <b>prior</b> everyday <b>knowledge</b> and experiences during {{teaching and learning}} is a pre-requisite in the Namibian curriculum. The curriculum states that if learners are taught {{in a way which}} builds on what they already know and they relate new knowledge to the reality around them, their learning in school can be made more meaningful. Thus, learners’ meaning making in the topic on nutrition was researched to find out whether elicitation and {{integration of}} learners’ <b>prior</b> everyday <b>knowledge</b> and experience in the nutrition topic enhanced or constrained their learning. This study was conducted with my grade 10 learners at the school where I am currently teaching. The school is located in a rural area in Oshana region in Northern Namibia. This study is situated within an interpretive paradigm. Within the interpretive paradigm a qualitative case study approach was adopted. I considered this methodological orientation appropriate in this study as it allowed me to use the following methods: document analysis, brainstorming and discussion, semi-structured interviews and a focus group interview, practical activities with worksheets and observation and reflection. Multiple methods to gather data were used for triangulation and validation purposes. For data analysis purposes, the data sets were colour coded to derive themes and analytical statements. Ethical consideration was also taken seriously in this study. The findings from this study revealed that integration of learners’ <b>prior</b> everyday <b>knowledge</b> and experience enabled learners to understand science better particularly in the topic of nutrition. The study also revealed that learners possess a lot of <b>prior</b> everyday <b>knowledge</b> and experience about food they eat in their homes. However, data from the community members revealed that there are some contradictions between learners’ <b>prior</b> everyday <b>knowledge</b> and the science content of the topic. Nonetheless, engaging learners in practical activities in the testing of food (local and conventional western type foods) helped them to make meaning of the content learned. I therefore, recommend that learners’ <b>prior</b> everyday <b>knowledge</b> and experiences should be incorporated during teaching and learning of the topic on nutrition. The study also recommends that the Department of Education should ensure that teachers get the necessary support and training on how to integrate learners’ <b>prior</b> everyday <b>knowledge</b> and experiences...|$|R
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Single trial {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) classifica-tion {{is essential}} in developing brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). However, popular classification algorithms, e. g., common spatial patterns (CSP), usually highly depend on the <b>prior</b> neurophys-iologic <b>knowledge</b> for noise removing, although this knowledge is not always known in practical applications. In this paper, a novel tensor-based scheme is proposed for single trial EEG classi-fication, which performs well without the <b>prior</b> neurophysiologic <b>knowledge.</b> In this scheme, EEG signals are represented in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain by the wavelet transform, the multilinear discriminative subspace is reserved by the general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA), redundant indiscriminative patterns are removed by Fisher score, and the classification is conducted by the support vector machine (SVM). Applications to three datasets confirm the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed tensor scheme in analyzing EEG signals, {{especially in the case}} of lacking <b>prior</b> neurophysiologic <b>knowledge.</b> Index Terms—Electroencephalogram (EEG), general tensor dis-criminant analysis (GTDA), single trial classification.
