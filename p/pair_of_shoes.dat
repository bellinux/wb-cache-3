5|$|Kiat Kun is dejected {{until he}} learns {{that the third}} prize in the 1965 National Primary School Cross Country Competition is a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes.</b> Because he was sick on the day his school {{selected}} representatives for the race, he pleads with his P.E. teacher to let him enter.

5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> after {{taking them to}} be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a karung guni man had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings are frustrated and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.|$|E
5|$|For Pokiri, Mahesh {{sported a}} longer hair style {{than in his}} {{previous}} films and shed five kilograms of weight. He used a new wardrobe and the same <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> throughout the film. Jagannadh wanted to cast Ayesha Takia as the female lead. Due to a last minute change, the makers opted to replace Takia and considered several actresses including Deepika Padukone. Jagannadh approached Parvati Melton to play the female lead. She declined the offer because, at that time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who looked like a teenager {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E

Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and {{paid for by the}} city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a new <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes,</b> and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100.

By comparison, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> cost $2.00 at the time.|$|E

Jersey set up Summerland Factory which employed 250 people for sorting making and repairing clothes and shoes. Guernsey created a boot factory, even so the waiting list for a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> could be a year.|$|E

25|$|His enemies exaggerated his faults; e.g. his {{supposed}} miserliness. In fact, {{it seems}} that his thriftiness {{was the result of}} long years spent in obscurity (when his income was uncertain and scanty) rather than part of his character, because he could also be generous. We know that he helped his nephew Jean-François when he came to Paris and also helped establish the career of Claude-Bénigne Balbastre in the capital. Furthermore, he gave his daughter Marie-Louise a considerable dowry when she became a Visitandine nun in 1750, and he paid a pension to one of his sisters when she became ill. Financial security came late to him, following the success of his stage works and the grant of a royal pension (a few months before his death, he was also ennobled and made a knight of the Ordre de Saint-Michel). But he did not change his way of life, keeping his worn-out clothes, his single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes,</b> and his old furniture. After his death, it was discovered that he only possessed one dilapidated single-keyboard harpsichord in his rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, yet he also had a bag containing 1691 gold louis.|$|E
25|$|In Zemun, the crusaders became suspicious, seeing Walter's sixteen suits {{of armor}} {{hanging from the}} walls, and {{eventually}} a dispute over {{the price of a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> in the market led to a riot, which then turned into an all-out assault on the city by the crusaders, in which 4,000 Hungarians were killed. The crusaders then fled across the river Sava to Belgrade, but only after skirmishing with Belgrade troops. The residents of Belgrade fled, and the crusaders pillaged and burned the city. Then they marched for seven days, arriving at Niš on 3 July. There, the commander of Niš promised to provide escort for Peter's army to Constantinople as well as food, if he would leave right away. Peter obliged, and the next morning he set out. However, a few Germans got into a dispute with some locals along the road and set fire to a mill, which escalated out of Peter's control until Niš sent out its entire garrison against the crusaders. The crusaders were completely routed, losing about 10,000 (a quarter of their number), the remainder regrouping further on at Bela Palanka. When they reached Sofia on 12 July they met their Byzantine escort, which brought them safely {{the rest of the way}} to Constantinople by 1 August.|$|E
