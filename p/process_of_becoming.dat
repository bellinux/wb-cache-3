5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{winds of}} tropical storm force along the South Carolina coastline; the highest official wind gust was 51mph (82km/h) at Edisto Beach. The storm dropped precipitation {{across much of}} the state, including a state maximum of 4.42inches (112mm) at Pritchardville. Storm tides reached 7.81feet (2.4m) above the mean low-level water mark along Fripp Island, leading to some beach erosion along portions of the coastline. While in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> extratropical, the rainbands of Alberto spawned seven confirmed tornadoes in the state, most of which rated F0; a National Weather Service report indicated additional tornadoes may have occurred in the state. The tornadoes caused some minor damage, though overall damage in the state was minimal.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent the game losing players to {{counties}} or other commitments such as jobs, {{it was suggested that}} central contracts should be introduced. This was done in June 2009, with the first two going to Trent Johnston and Alex Cusack. The number of full-time contracts was expanded to six in January 2010 with support for a further nine players; the contracts were split into three categories. In January 2012 the number of contracts was increased to 23, and coach Phil Simmons highlighted the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> professional as an important factor in the team's success.|$|E

40|$|This paper problematises discourses about integration, {{their claims}} for {{accommodating}} difference and their implications in conceptualising {{the education of}} young migrant women. In thinking about the ethics and politics of integration and particularly those that are promoted through discursive frameworks generated by EU institutional mechanisms I argue that they reflect a politics of assimilation that does not allow educational <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> different. A politics of difference, {{in spite of the}} possibilities of generating conflict within schools and classes would better inform our thinking about an education that democratically attends to student differences. I shall draw on situations and examples related to the education of young migrant women to suggest that <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> migration, rather than those of integration, can be important sources in conceptualising education as <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> transformation where <b>becoming</b> different women is possible. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Elaborating the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> that Deleuze’s third synthesis depicts, Antoinette’s fate emerges not as a violence against an original identity. Rather, what the reader witnesses is a series <b>of</b> <b>becomings</b> or masks, some of which are validated, some of which are not, and it is in the rejection of certain masks, forcing Antoinette to become-Bertha, that the greatest violence lies...|$|R

Using a qualitative/interpretive method, we analyzed 980 pages of interview transcripts with stepparents and stepchildren. We studied the first four years of family development, using the five developmental pathways developed by Baxter, Braithwaite, and Nicholson (1999). Three salient issues identified in the family experiences were boundary management, solidarity, and adaptation. While the negotiation of these issues varied across the five trajectories, there were commonalities across family experiences that helped determine whether families had a successful experience <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> a family. Implications for blended family researchers and practitioners are also discussed...|$|R
