5|$|People {{from small}} {{villages in the}} hills near Genova, Italy {{were among the first}} to settle {{permanently}} in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (<b>probably</b> <b>less</b> than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. For the lower ranks the position is not certain. Ammianus' report on the battle implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords. Those that did not were armed with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E

5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: <b>Probably</b> <b>less</b> than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man is <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> than 250 years old, and {{may soon}} collapse. The stack is not {{mentioned}} in the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists {{at the point where the}} Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E
5|$|The first {{investigation}} of the chapel ruins, supported by the National Trust, was conducted by the local history group {{in the winter of}} 1998–99. This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, geophysics (resistivity, and magnetometry) and molehill sampling. The area surveyed was 100m long and 40m wide (109yd by 44yd). The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but did show an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from wartime defences. The resistivity survey clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> well-constructed, and possibly later in date.|$|E

Dorothy's annual income was £50, aided by £150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps {{out of fear}} that she was getting older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.|$|E
5|$|While the koala was {{previously}} classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016. Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal {{to include the}} koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures {{is based on a}} misconception that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> than 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Work {{performed}} by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided {{much of the}} labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming (latifundia), these may have been mostly slaves, but throughout the Empire, slave farm labour was <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> important than other forms of dependent labour by people who were technically not enslaved.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from its}} larger size and more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian mammoth also {{differed from the}} woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and the woolly mammoth. Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance {{than that of the}} woolly mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be that of the Columbian mammoth has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where mammoth dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths; however, since this location is so far south it is unlikely to be woolly mammoth hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> dense than that of the woolly mammoth due to the warmer habitat.|$|E
5|$|In Panama, it breeds year-round without {{apparent}} seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's Mamíferos de Venezuela (Mammals of Venezuela), reproductive {{activity is}} highest in June–July and December. In the laboratory, the gestation period is 28days; Linares reports {{that it is}} 20 to 30days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year {{and there are two}} to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> than 50days old, were already pregnant. The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old; he estimated that animals were unlikely to live {{for more than a year}} in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2.9months.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received more rain and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, there was <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E

5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E
5|$|Warfare was endemic {{in early}} Anglo-Saxon England, and major {{conflicts}} still occurred approximately every generation {{in the later}} period. Groups of well-armed noblemen and their households formed the heart of these armies, supported by larger numbers of temporary troops levied from across the kingdom, called the fyrd. By the 9th century, armies of 20,000 men could be called up for campaigns, with another 28,000 men available to guard urban defences. The most common weapon was the spear, with swords used by the wealthier nobles; cavalry was <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> common than in wider Europe, but some Anglo-Saxons did fight from horseback. The Viking attacks on England in the 9th century led to developments in tactics, {{including the use of}} shield walls in battle, and the Scandinavian seizure of power in the 11th century introduced housecarls, a form of elite household soldier who protected the king.|$|E
5|$|The oldest well-dated {{record of}} Oryzomys antillarum is at Drum Cave in the Jacksons Bay Caves system, {{where it was}} found in a stratum {{radiocarbon}} dated to between 10,250 and 11,260 years before present according to a 2002 study. It is present in several other undated sites that predate the human colonization of the island, around 1,400 years before present. However, a site (Wallingford Roadside Cave) from the last interglacial, the Eemian, contains only the hystricognath rodents Clidomys and Geocapromys browni and lacks Oryzomys. The presence of the rice rat on Jamaica before the arrival of humans disproves the hypothesis that it was introduced; instead, it must have reached the island by overwater dispersal through a rafting event, <b>probably</b> <b>less</b> than 125,000 years ago. During the last glacial period, low sea levels would have exposed much land between Jamaica and Central America, substantially decreasing the distance needed for the ancestor of O.antillarum to arrive on the island and probably influencing sea currents so that rafts of vegetation from Central America {{would be more likely to}} reach Jamaica. Species of Oryzomys are semiaquatic and closely associated with water, which may help to explain the occurrence of the genus on Jamaica. The rice rat has been found in many superficial, late Holocene cave deposits, some of which have been radiocarbon dated to within the last 1,100 years. Its remains also occur in some Amerindian archeological sites. From its common and widespread occurrence in caves, Ray suggested that the rice rat occurred in many different habitats before European contact. O.antillarum was the only sigmodontine rodent on any of the Greater Antilles, where the rodent fauna otherwise consists solely of hystricognaths and introduced rodents.|$|E
