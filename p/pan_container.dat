50|$|The Hildon library, {{originally}} developed by Nokia but since Maemo 5, developed by Igalia and Lanedo (who developed MaemoGTK+, the Maemo version of GTK+). It {{is a set}} of mobile specific GTK+ widgets for applications in Maemo. Up to Maemo 4, these widgets were designed for stylus usage. However, in Maemo 5, most widgets were deprecated and new widgets for direct finger manipulation were introduced, including a kinetic <b>panning</b> <b>container.</b>|$|R
50|$|The safe {{operation}} of a wood-burning stove requires regular maintenance such as emptying ash <b>pans</b> (<b>containers)</b> beneath the wood grate. Routine cleaning of the stove pipes and chimney is also needed to prevent chimney fires. Creosote and soot gradually build up in stovepipes and chimneys. This could damage the chimney and spread fire to the surrounding structure, especially the roof. When soot blocks the airflow through the stove pipes or chimney, smoke can build up in the stove pipes and in the house through the stove.|$|R

25|$|Guaraní {{ceramics}} {{fall into}} two major categories: na'e, or dishes, and yapepó, pots, <b>pans,</b> and storage <b>containers.</b> These were both utilitarian and ceremonial. The precontact ceramic tradition of the Gran Chaco was dramatically transformed under European colonization, which created a demand for pitchers, cups, and other introduced pottery forms. Author Josefina Pla observed that women are typically potters, and animals associated with men are not represented in Guaraní pottery.|$|R
50|$|The sales {{failure of}} the tri-motor {{airplane}} due to the Great Depression led Solar Aircraft Company into making parts for other manufacturers, especially hard-to-manufacture parts able to withstand high-temperatures, such as stainless steel exhaust manifolds. By 1939 Solar Aircraft Company had a work force of 229. Military orders during World War II led to rapid expansion {{and by the end}} of the war the company had a workforce of 5,000, largely part of a massive effort to build more than 300,000 exhaust manifolds for U.S. airplanes. Business dropped considerably after World War II and the management developed a plan to diversify into producing other stainless steel products including caskets, frying <b>pans,</b> bulk milk <b>containers</b> and even redwood furniture; immediately after World War II the company also produced the Solar Midget race car.|$|R
25|$|Brooks {{was said}} to prefer butter over clay as a molding medium. The latter had to kept moist and wrapped {{to prevent it from}} cracking, was not as {{sensitive}} for sculptural manipulation, and was more difficult to cast. Brooks had conquered the major disadvantage of butter simply by using ice. She discovered that she could even use butter for casting. After preserving her original butter Dreaming Iolanthe for a half a year, she desired a method which would not require keeping it in cold storage. Without knowing ahead of time what the results may be, she mixed up some plaster and poured it onto the butter sculpture. The plaster quickly set, and she cut a hole {{in the bottom of the}} milk pan which held her creation. Brooks then set the <b>pan</b> over a <b>container</b> of boiling water, and the butter melted and drained out of the hole. She removed the remainder of the bottom of the pan, and was left with a greased plaster negative. She placed more plaster inside and, after some difficulty removing the outer layer, was left with a successful plaster positive. Brooks was issued a patent in 1877 for her process of creating lubricated plaster molds. She did not, however, use plaster casts to reproduce her butter sculptures, instead preferring to sculpt a new one for each exhibit.|$|R
40|$|WO 2010125178 A 1 UPAB: 20101122 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{producing a}} coating on a {{surface of a}} metal with an elongation to micro-cracking {{greater than or equal}} to 2. 5 percent, a yellow index less than or equal to 2. 5, hardness 3. 1 to 6 Giga Pascal, thermal conductivity less than or equal to 2. 5 watt per meter Kelvin, and dielectric strength greater than or equal 40 kilovolt per millimeter. The coating is produced with stipulation that hardness is greater than equal to 6 Giga Pascal for an elongation to micro-cracking less than or equal to 2. 2 percent. The yellow index determined according to ASTM D 1925. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a coated metal substrate comprising a plasma polymer coating. USE - Method for coating a surface of a metal substrate i. e. semi-finished product (all claimed). Can also be used for a sanitary product, metal band such as steel band, brass band and copper band, percussion instrument, basin, food processing item such as frying pan, baking <b>pan,</b> stainless steel <b>container</b> for chemical industry, and non-light metal jewel. ADVANTAGE - The coating provides the metal substrate with good corrosion protection and improved chemical stability to alkaline media, thus improving visual effect of the metal substrate...|$|R
