The most {{successful}} application of the motives of comics in the modeling of clothes is to use <b>padding.</b> <b>Printed</b> image is widely used in the design of clothing and accessories, both in the industry - knitwear and textiles, as well as individual designers...|$|R
50|$|Industrial {{finishing}} is {{any kind}} of secondary process done to any metal, plastic, or wood product used in a common market such as automotive, OEM, telecommunications or point-of-purchase. The most common commodity in the industrial finishing market is plastic parts. These can be injection molded, thermoformed, extruded or vacuum formed. Most parts are painted but can be <b>pad</b> <b>printed</b> or silkscreened.|$|R
50|$|While {{crude forms}} of <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> have existed for centuries, {{it was not}} until the twentieth century that the {{technology}} became suitable for widespread use. First gaining a foothold in the watch-making industry following World War II, developments in the late 60s and early 70s, such as silicone pads and more advanced equipment, made the printing method far more practical. The ability to print on formerly unprintable surfaces caught the imaginations of engineers and designers, and as a result <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> exploded into the mass production marketplace.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pad</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> (also called tampography) is {{a printing}} {{process that can}} transfer a 2-D image onto a 3-D object. This is accomplished using an indirect offset (gravure) printing process that involves an image being transferred from the cliché via a silicone pad onto a substrate. <b>Pad</b> <b>printing</b> is used for printing on otherwise difficult to print on products in many industries including medical, automotive, promotional, apparel, and electronic objects, as well as appliances, sports equipment and toys. It {{can also be used}} to deposit functional materials such as conductive inks, adhesives, dyes and lubricants.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{a number}} of methods exist for the capture of {{fingerprints}} from cadavers that can then be used in isolation as a primary method for {{the identification of the}} dead. We report the use of a handheld, mobile wireless unit used in conjunction with a personal digital assistant (PDA) device for the capture of fingerprints from the dead. We also consider a handheld single-digit fingerprint scanner that utilises a USB laptop connection for the electronic capture of cadaveric fingerprints. Both are single-operator units that, if ridge detail is preserved, can collect a 10 -set of finger <b>pad</b> <b>prints</b> in approximately 45 and 90 s, respectively. We present our observations on the restrictions as to when such devices can be used with cadavers. We do, however, illustrate that the images are of sufficient quality to allow positive identification from finger <b>pad</b> <b>prints</b> of the dead. With the development of mobile, handheld, biometric, PDA-based units for the police, we hypothesize that, under certain circumstances, devices such as these could be used for the accelerated acquisition of fingerprint identification data with the potential for rapid near-patient identification in the future. 1741...|$|R

50|$|Mark quality {{depends on}} a variety of factors, {{including}} the substrate used, marking speed, laser spot size, beam overlap, materials thickness, and laser parameters. Laser bonding materials may be applied by various methods, including a brush on technique, spraying, <b>pad</b> <b>printing,</b> screen printing, roll coating, tape, and others.|$|E
50|$|Open ink well systems, {{the older}} method of <b>pad</b> <b>{{printing}},</b> used an ink trough for the ink supply, which was located behind the printing plate. A flood bar pushed {{a pool of}} ink over the plate, and a doctor blade removes the ink from the plate surface, leaving ink on the etched artwork area ready for the pad to pick up.|$|E
25|$|The {{desk pad}} (Chinese T: 畫氈, S: 画毡, Pinyin: huàzhān; Japanese: 下敷 shitajiki) is a pad made of felt.

However, these <b>printed</b> <b>pads</b> are used only by students. Both desk <b>pads</b> and the <b>printed</b> grids come in a variety of sizes.|$|R

5000|$|In {{rotogravure}} printing {{the doctor}} blade (from ductor blade) removes the excess ink from the smooth non-engraved {{portions of the}} image carrier [...] and the land areas of the cell walls. [...] Doctor blades are also used in other printing and coating processes, such as flexo and <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> for the same function. It is believed that the name derives from the blades used in flatbed letterpress equipment for blades used to wipe ductor rolls, and [...] "ductor" [...] became doctor.|$|E
50|$|The next {{development}} was the paper pad system. Diplomats had long used codes and ciphers for confidentiality and to minimize telegraph costs. For the codes, {{words and phrases}} were converted to groups of numbers (typically 4 or 5 digits) using a dictionary-like codebook. For added security, secret numbers could be combined with (usually modular addition) each code group before transmission, with the secret numbers being changed periodically (this was called superencryption). In the early 1920s, three German cryptographers (Werner Kunze, Rudolf Schauffler and Erich Langlotz), {{who were involved in}} breaking such systems, realized that they could never be broken if a separate randomly chosen additive number was used for every code group. They had duplicate paper <b>pads</b> <b>printed</b> with lines of random number groups. Each page had a serial number and eight lines. Each line had six 5-digit numbers. A page would be used as a work sheet to encode a message and then destroyed. The serial number of the page would be sent with the encoded message. The recipient would reverse the procedure and then destroy his copy of the page. The German foreign office put this system into operation by 1923.|$|R

40|$|Pd hexadecanethiolate and Pd butanethiolate {{precursors}} were patterned using {{inkjet printing}} techniques to form metallic Pd interconnects upon thermolysis. Patterns with lateral dimensions of similar to 50 mu m were produced. The surface morphology of the Pd interconnects was examined using scanning electron microscopy. By printing four-probe patterns, the resistance {{as a function}} of the precursor concentration was determined, allowing estimates for the resistivity of the printed interconnects. To demonstrate the utility of this fabrication approach, an electronic circuit consisting of single-wall carbon nanotubes was inkjet printed and then contacted with Pd <b>pads.</b> These <b>printed</b> patterns have also been applied as surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates that exhibit high sensitivity...|$|R
50|$|Other methods with {{similarities}} to printing, among them microcontact printing and nano-imprint lithography are of interest. Here, µm- and nm-sized layers, respectively, are prepared by methods similar to stamping with soft and hard forms, respectively. Often the actual structures are prepared subtractively, e.g. by deposition of etch masks or by lift-off processes. For example, electrodes for OFETs can be prepared. Sporadically <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> {{is used in}} a similar manner. Occasionally so-called transfer methods, where solid layers are transferred from a carrier to the substrate, are considered printed electronics. Electrophotography is currently not used in printed electronics.|$|E

5000|$|A {{good example}} of where laser {{engraving}} technology has been adopted into the industry norm is the production line. In this particular setup, the laser beam is directed towards a rotating or vibrating mirror. The mirror moves in a manner which may trace out numbers and letters onto the surface being marked. This is particularly useful for printing dates, expiry codes, and lot numbering of products traveling along a production line. Laser marking allows materials made of plastic and glass to be marked [...] "on the move". The location where the marking takes place is called a [...] "marking laser station", an entity often found in packaging and bottling plants. Older, slower technologies such as hot stamping and <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> have largely been phased out and replaced with laser engraving.|$|E
