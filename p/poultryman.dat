40|$|THE {{practice}} of forcing White Leg-horn yearling hens to molt {{during the late}} spring or early Summer, for the pur-pose of securing greater production of higher quality eggs {{during the period of}} peak fall egg prices, is quite widely fol-lowed by the commercial <b>poultrymen</b> of Washington.

The <b>poultrymen</b> who have successfully force molted yearling hens have claimed that flocks which are force molted not only produced more eggs but also pro-duced eggs of improved grades during the fall months, than do flocks which are per-mitted to lay and molt normally.

Hens fare better out of doors in Virginia {{than they do in}} New England, but make more profit out of doors anywhere than they will shut up in houses. If your climate will not permit your hen to live out doors get out of the climate or get out of the hen business. There is, however, a vast difference in the kind of out-of-doors. The running stream with its fringe of trees, brush and rank growing grass, forms daylight quarters for the hen par excellence. Rank growing crops, fodder piled against the fences, a board fence {{on the north side of}} the lot, or little sheds made by propping a platform against a stake, will all help. A place out of the wind for the hens to dust and sun and be sociable is what is wanted, and what must be provided, preferably by Nature, if not by Nature then by the <b>poultryman.</b>|$|E

The pesticide practices involved the handling, applying, storing, and disposing of pesticides. The specific purposes of this study were to: (1) determine if <b>poultrymen</b> followed good pesticide practice habits and (2) to determine if pesticide container labels were an effective means of influencing pesticide safety. A questionnaire was constructed which listed 2 7 questions concerning pesticide safety practices. The questions were grouped into the areas of personal preparation, personal protection, education, equipment and usage, storage and disposal. Each question, was answered by a response of do, sometimes, and don't. The questions were administered by personal interviews and direct observations of pesticide practices. The questionnaire was administered to 45 <b>poultrymen</b> during the summer of 1971. The data was analyzed and the responses were found to be statistically significant. The questionnaire was also submitted to seven experts concerned with pesticide usages and they were asked to evaluate the importance of each question in terms of contribution to pesticide safety. Two major conclusions may be drawn from the study: (1) that many of the <b>poultrymen</b> tended to follow poor pesticide safety practices in their personal handling, applying, storing and disposing of pesticides and (2) that labels on pesticide containers were not effective in influencing good pesticide habits because many of the <b>poultrymen</b> did not always read the label or utilize the consultative and educational services available to them prior to using pesticides...|$|R

40|$|In the {{organization}} and management of poultry farming many problems arise which call for a solution. Among such problems are the following: The amount of floor space per hen which will prove the most economical, the value of electric lights in poultry houses, amount of labor which can be profitably invested in a poultry flock, {{and the amount of}} feed which can be economically fed to poultry. There are many influences which determine poultry profits that cannot be controlled directly, but the factors mentioned here are largely within the control of the <b>poultryman.</b> He should, therefore, direct them as far as possible so as to increase his net returns. Each hen should be provided with floor space necessary for most efficient production. The <b>poultryman,</b> however, does not know the amount of space that will bring the greatest returns. If the net income from each hen is just as high with two square feet of floor space per hen as where each hen has six square feet, then it is not economical to have six square feet of floor space per hen. If this is the case, it would be advisable for the <b>poultryman</b> to increase the size of his flock so as to obtain the fullest returns from his investment in poultry houses and equipment. A poultry farmer should know if there are any advantages derived from the use of electric lights. If it is an advantage to use lights, the <b>poultryman</b> desires to know how many hours they should be used each day. If, through the use of lights, production is increased {{to such an extent that}} gross returns more than pay for wiring, cost of electricity, and other incidental expenses, lights will prove a profitable investment. A <b>poultryman</b> must give time and labor to his flock in feeding, cleaning coops and gathering eggs. When this work has been efficiently done, extra time and labor is not likely to increase profits. The poultry farmer wants to know the point where increased labor fails to increase profits. This same principle applies to the amount of feed given to poultry. Up to a certain point production may be increased as the amount of feed is increased, but before this point is reached, the extra eggs may not pay for the additional feed costs. The poultry farmer should know the limits of poultry feeding which will prove profitable. whether or not the <b>poultryman</b> solves these problems determines to a considerable degree his success or failure. This study is an attempt to point out the relationship existing between several of these factors which pertain to {{the organization}}, management, and profitableness of poultry farm...|$|E

Several workers (Rasmussen et al., 1964; Crane et al, 1967; Adams, 1968; and Quadri, 1970) reported that heat treat-ments, such as pelleting and extrusion, re-duced incidence of salmonella in poultry feeds and rendered animal by-products.

40|$|The {{value of}} direct {{sunlight}} and ultra violet {{light in the}} pre-vention and cure of leg weakness or rickets in the growing chick and laying hen has been demonstrated by numerous inves-tigations. ^ It {{has also been shown}} that ordinary glass as found in our homes and poultry houses does not transmit the bene-ficial rays of sunlight. ^ This has stimulated the search for ma-terials which would allow the passage of the ultra violet rays and which might be used advantageously in place of lead glass. As a result of these efforts several new "glasses " and "glass substitutes " have appeared on the market. The former are specially prepared for the transmission of ultra violet light but their cost, at the present, makes them impractical in the poultry industry. The <b>poultryman,</b> consequently, turns his attention to the "glass substitutes " which he can procure more reason-ably, in order that he may benefit his flock with some of the beneficial properties of sunlight during confinement.
