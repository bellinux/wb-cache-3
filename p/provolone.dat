5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} pizza cheese is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and <b>Provolone</b> cheeses as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E
5|$|Several cheeses may {{be mixed}} {{together}} in its formulation, {{and each has}} individual browning and blistering characteristics. For example, a combination of Mozzarella and Cheddar may blister less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while Mozzarella and <b>provolone</b> may brown less compared to other combinations.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} pizza cheese {{are used in}} Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Whole milk mozzarella is popular in pizzas in the East and Southwest regions of the U.S., while one survey showed that <b>Provolone</b> was more popular on {{the east and west}} coast. Cheddar may be used more in the Eastern and Southern regions of the U.S. Provel cheese is {{typically}} used in the preparation of St. Louis-style pizza in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. <b>Provolone</b> is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E

25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. It entails {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of <b>provolone</b> cheese cooked on the grill with oregano) are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (flank steak), lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E
500|$|The International Dictionary of Food and Cooking defines {{pizza cheese}} as [...] "a soft spun-curd cheese similar to Mozzarella made from cow's milk..." [...] that is [...] "...used {{particularly}} for pizzas and contains somewhat less water than real Mozzarella..." [...] Most {{are at least}} 95 percent Mozzarella, with different moisture and fat densities. Cheese for frozen pizzas may be comminuted, in which the cheese is processed into minute granules or fragments. Low-moisture Mozzarella can be formulated specifically for pizza. Cheese may be processed into blocks, from which the product can be grated, made into granules or sliced for use on pizza or other foods. Pizza cheese frequently consists of a blend {{of two or more}} cheeses, such as low-moisture Mozzarella or <b>Provolone.</b> Low-moisture Mozzarella was first manufactured in dairy factories in the Midwestern United States, and was originally called [...] "pizza cheese". Compared to standard Mozzarella, low-moisture Mozzarella has a firmer texture, is easier to grate, has better browning and melting characteristics, and is less perishable.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{foods and}} dishes {{are unique to}} Rhode Island and some {{are hard to find}} outside of the state. Hot wieners are {{sometimes}} called gaggers, weinies, or New York System wieners, and they are smaller than a standard hot dog, served covered in a meat sauce, chopped onions, mustard, and celery salt. Famous to Rhode Island is Snail Salad, which is served at numerous restaurants throughout the state. The dish is normally prepared [...] "family style" [...] with over five pounds of snails mixed in with other ingredients commonly found in seafood dishes. Grinders are submarine sandwiches, with a popular version being the Italian grinder, which is made with cold cuts (usually ham, prosciutto, capicola, salami, and <b>Provolone</b> cheese). Linguiça or chouriço (a spicy Portuguese sausage) and peppers is also popular among the state's large Portuguese community, eaten with hearty bread (though this is also popular in other areas of New England).|$|E
2500|$|A cheesesteak, or a Philly cheesesteak, is a long, crusty roll {{filled with}} thinly sliced sautéed ribeye beef and melted cheese. Generally, the cheese {{of choice is}} Cheez Whiz, but American and <b>provolone</b> are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak {{preparation}} lies {{in the balance of}} flavors, textures and what {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "drip" [...] factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or sweet peppers. The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor Pat Olivieri who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, Pat's King of Steaks on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to the steak. The cheesesteak is considered to be a cultural icon of the city of Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Provolone</b> is a {{semi-hard cheese}} with taste varying greatly from <b>provolone</b> piccante (sharp/piquant), aged {{for a minimum}} of four months and with a very sharp taste, to <b>provolone</b> dolce (sweet) with a very mild taste. In <b>provolone</b> piccante, the {{distinctive}} piquant taste is produced with lipase (enzyme) derived from goat. The Dolce version uses calf's lipase instead.|$|E

50|$|St. Louis-style pizza often, but not always, {{includes}} a white processed cheese known as Provel.
