Points can be {{accumulated}} by making field goals (worth two <b>points</b> <b>from</b> within the three-point line or three <b>points</b> <b>from</b> beyond the three-point line) or free throws (worth one point). The team that records the most points at the end of a game is declared the game's winner.

Colin Murphy was brought in for his second spell as manager.
