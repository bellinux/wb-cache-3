5|$|On 29 July 1944, Captain Parham {{handed over}} command of HMS Belfast to Captain R M Dick, and until April 1945 Belfast {{underwent}} a refit {{to prepare for}} service against Japan in the Far East which improved her accommodation for tropical conditions, and updated her anti-aircraft armament and fire control in order to counter expected kamikaze attacks by Japanese aircraft. By May 1945, Belfast mounted thirty-six 2-pounder guns in two eight-gun mounts, four quadruple mounts, and four single mounts. She also mounted fourteen 20mm Oerlikons. Her two aftmost 4-inch mountings were removed, and the remainder fitted with Remote <b>Power</b> <b>Control.</b> Her empty hangars were converted to crew accommodation, and her aircraft catapult was removed.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the <b>power</b> <b>control</b> of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model of}} {{distributed}} power system with <b>power</b> electronic <b>controlled</b> loads. Distribution networks transport the electrical energy from the transmission substations to the various loads. There are so many <b>power</b> electronics <b>controlled</b> loads that are connected in the distribution power system. Due to intensive use of <b>power</b> electronics <b>controlled</b> loads in an industry and other consumers in general, the harmonics produces a distortion in distribution network. Therefore, to protect the power system from the <b>power</b> electronics <b>controlled</b> loads, {{it is very important}} to identify the types and number of all the working <b>power</b> electronics <b>controlled</b> loads. The result of this paper shows that the method of calculating the number and also the types of all working <b>power</b> electronics <b>controlled</b> loads in any distribution system. A Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) Spectrum technique is used to identify the <b>power</b> electronics <b>controlled</b> loads in distribution power system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study in details the {{optimized}} link state routing (OLSR) protocol for ad hoc networks. In particular, we investigate its performance by focusing the attention on its energy efficiency. To have some terms of comparison the performance are {{compared with those}} of other routing schemes. Furthermore, to improve the energy efficiency by increasing the network life time, we propose and discuss a <b>power</b> <b>controlled</b> version of OLSR. OLSR <b>power</b> <b>controlled</b> provides the optimal paths in terms of minimum power needed to reach the destination, and not in terms of number of hops as in the classic version. By means of extensive simulations, we show that, in many system conditions, OLSR <b>power</b> <b>controlled</b> is able to achieve good energy saving...|$|R
25|$|Starting in 1991, several {{accidents}} and incidents involving the Boeing 737 {{were the result of}} uncommanded movement of their rudders. On 3 March 1991, United Airlines Flight 585, a 737-200, crashed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, killing 25 people. On 8 September 1994, USAir Flight 427, a 737-300, crashed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 132 people. There were four more incidents where a 737 rudder <b>power</b> <b>control</b> unit (PCU) malfunction was suspected.|$|E

Typical outfits for the submissive person invoke common icons of passivity or sexual innocence (e.g. a shepherdess, nun or schoolgirl outfit for women, or a leather slave harness and cuffs, thong, or ancient slave outfit for men). In a similar respect, the dominant person's attire often reflect images of <b>power,</b> <b>control,</b> and extreme discipline (a Nazi officer, military officer, police or prison warden uniform).|$|E
25|$|There {{was some}} {{evidence}} {{that one of the}} right elevator <b>power</b> <b>control</b> units may have suffered a malfunction, and the Egyptian investigation mentioned this as a likely cause of the crash. While noting that the damage did indeed exist, the NTSB countered that it was more than likely caused by the crash rather than existing beforehand, and furthermore it was not enough to cause the crash, as the 767 is designed to remain flyable even with two PCUs failed.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB {{found that}} there was a fatigue crack in the <b>power</b> <b>control</b> module, and that it was not {{possible}} to visually inspect that type of failure. The lower rudder control module's cast metal housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was an unusual failure since most failures are of internal components rather than the housing itself.|$|E

During that time, large factories were incorporated, and were hard for capitalists to control. Managers assumed a more prominent role in the organized environment, and since the profession was not yet sufficiently institutionalized, managers used an ideology of rationality and efficiency to establish their <b>power,</b> <b>control</b> and capital.|$|E
