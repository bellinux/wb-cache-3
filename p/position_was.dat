5000|$|Chargaff's second rule {{appears to}} be the {{consequence}} of a more complex parity rule: within a single strand of DNA any oligonucleotide is present in equal numbers to its reverse complementary nucleotide. Because of the computational requirements this has not been verified in all genomes for all oligonucleotides. It has been verified for triplet oligonucleotides for a large data set. Albrecht-Buehler has suggested that this rule is the consequence of genomes evolving by a process of inversion and transposition. This process {{does not appear to have}} acted on the mitochondrial genomes. Chargaff's second parity rule {{appears to be}} extended from the nucleotide-level to populations of codon triplets, in the case of whole single-stranded Human genome DNA. A kind of [...] "codon-level second Chargaff's parity rule" [...] is proposed as follows: Codon populations where 1st base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> T are identical to codon populations where 3rd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> A: [...] « % codons Twx ~ % codons yzA » (where Twx and yzA are mirror codons, e.g. TCG and CGA).

Codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> T are identical to codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> A: [...] « % codons wTx ~ % codons yAz » (where wTx and yAz are mirror codons, e.g. CTG and CAG). Codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> C are identical to codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> G: « % codons wCx ~ % codons yGz » (where wCx and yGz are mirror codons, e.g. TCT and AGA). Codon populations where 3rd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> T are identical to codon populations where 1st base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> A: [...] « % codons wxT ~ % codons Ayz » (where wxT and Ayz are mirror codons, e.g. CTT and AAG).
