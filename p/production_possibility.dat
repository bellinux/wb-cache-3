5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> curve (PPC) is a {{graphical representation}} of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|A PPF (<b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> frontier) {{typically}} {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E

Similarly, if one good makes more use of say capital and if capital grows faster than other factors, growth possibilities might be biased in favor of the capital-intensive good.|$|R

50|$|Microeconomic {{theories}} {{are involved with}} the choices that households and firms make. Some of these microeconomic concepts include elasticity of demand and supply, market structures and utility. Microeconomic looks into the way individuals and businesses behave in coming up with decisions {{to do with the}} distribution of rare resources and collaborations between these individuals and the firm. A <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> frontier illustrates the maximum probable output combinations of two services or goods an economy may realise while all other resources are efficiently and wholly engaged. A <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> frontier is used to explain the models of opportunity cost, illustrate the effects of economic development and demonstrate the theory of trade-offs.|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} <b>production</b> <b>possibilities</b> curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an {{attainable}} point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} <b>production</b> <b>possibilities</b> curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the <b>production</b> <b>possibilities</b> curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|R

50|$|Vent for surplus is {{a theory}} that was {{formulated}} by Adam Smith and later revised by Hla Myint on his thesis of South East Asia. The theory states that when a country produces more than it can consume it produces a surplus. This underutilization causes an inward movement on the <b>production</b> <b>possibilities</b> frontier. Trade with another country is then used to vent off this surplus and to bring the <b>production</b> <b>possibilities</b> frontier back to full capacity.|$|R
50|$|An {{economy with}} high {{unemployment}} is not using {{all of the}} resources, specifically labour, available to it.

40|$|Until very recently, the {{incorporation}} of exogenous variables {{in the analysis of}} productive efficiency relative to a stochastic frontier was an arbitrary process.

5000|$|Productive {{efficiency}} {{is a situation}} in which the economy could not produce any more of one good without sacrificing production of another good. In other words, productive efficiency occurs when a good or a service is produced at the lowest possible cost. The concept is illustrated on a <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> frontier (PPF), where all points on the curve are points of productive efficiency. An equilibrium may be productively efficient without being allocatively efficient - [...] i.e. it may result in a distribution of goods where social welfare is not maximized.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, Scarf {{launched}} his longest, hardest and most ambitious struggle: to tackle economies with indivisibilities, increasing returns and nonconvexity. In fact in 1963 he already wrote: ``Notes on {{the core of}} production economy,” which was widely circulated but was not published until 1986. In this note, he studied economies where the production set exhibits increasing returns. He showed that if the <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> set satisfies customary properties, but is not a cone, {{then there is a}} collection of consumers with conventional preferences and specific initial endowments for which the core is empty. His seminal article with Shapley in 1974: ``On cores and indivisibilities,” marked the first victory in his battle tackling indivisibilities and has become a most-cited classic article in the field.|$|E

50|$|The {{assumption}} of convex production sets plays {{a pivotal role}} in neoclassical economic theory. If the <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> set is convex then any efficient production plan will be supported by a set of competitive prices. The simplex method proposed by George Dantzig is an effective device for discovering these prices from the underlying linear programming problem. Unfortunately, such prices will no longer exist when the production set displays increasing returns to scale, indivisibilities, or other forms of nonconvexity. The most important example of a production set with indivisibilities is an activity analysis model in which all activity levels are constrained to be integers rather than arbitrary real numbers. Production sets with indivisibilities represents the most extreme form of nonconvexities in production and correspond to integer rather than ordinary linear programming problem. In this case, there is no simple test, like the pricing test arising from convex production sets, to verify whether a production plan is optimal or not.|$|E
50|$|Utility {{functions}} can {{be derived}} from the points on a contract curve. Numerous utility functions {{can be derived}}, one for each point on the <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> frontier (PQ in the diagram above). A social utility frontier (also called a grand utility frontier) can be obtained from the outer envelope of all these utility functions. Each point on a social utility frontier represents an efficient allocation of an economy's resources; that is, it is a Pareto optimum in factor allocation, in production, in consumption, and in the interaction of production and consumption (supply and demand). In the diagram below, the curve MN is a social utility frontier. Point D corresponds with point C from the earlier diagram. Point D is on the social utility frontier because the marginal rate of substitution at point C is equal to the marginal rate of transformation at point A. Point E corresponds with point B in the previous diagram, and lies inside the social utility frontier (indicating inefficiency) because the MRS at point C is not equal to the MRT at point A.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} edition of his book, Arrow misinterpreted IIA by {{considering}} the removal of a choice from the consideration set. Among the objects of choice, he distinguished those that by hypothesis are specified as feasible and infeasible. Consider two possible sets of voter orderings ( [...] , ..., [...] ) and ( [...] , ...,) such that the ranking of X and Y for each voter i is the same for '''' and ''''. The voting rule generates corresponding social orderings R and R'. Now suppose that X and Y are feasible but Z is infeasible (say, the candidate is not on the ballot or the social state is outside the <b>production</b> <b>possibility</b> curve). Arrow required that the voting rule that R and R' select the same (top-ranked) social choice from the feasible set (X, Y), and that this requirement holds no matter what the ranking is of infeasible Z relative to X and Y in the two sets of orderings. IIA does not allow [...] "removing" [...] an alternative from the available set (a candidate from the ballot), and it says nothing about what would happen in such a case: all options are assumed to be [...] "feasible." ...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{progress}} {{as a major}} source of economic development stems from the interaction of two types of innovations, drastic and incremental. While the former sets the fundamental pace of economic progress by redefining <b>production</b> <b>possibilities</b> as Schumpeter strongly emphasized, the latter takes the basic framework as given but pushes the <b>production</b> <b>possibilities</b> frontier outwards marginally in production practice. This paper studies the dynamic interaction and effects of these endogenously-determined innovations. Upstream firms in the model "produce" drastic innovation, which turns out brand new technology and obsolescences the existing technology used by downstream firms that specialize in final goods production. After the downstream firms adopt the new technology, they can improve it further by their incremental innovations.

Such land use systems {{can be used to}} explore options for strategic decision making with respect to land use policy and to do ex-ante assessment of land use alternatives to be further tested or developed in experimental settings. The so-called goal-oriented approach consists of three steps: (1) goal-oriented identification and design of land use systems; (2) quantification of biophysical production possibilities; and (3) defining the optimal mix of inputs, i. e. the production technique, required to realize <b>production</b> <b>possibilities.</b> The goal-oriented identification and design depends on the land-related objectives of a system under study, whereas plant, animal and environmental characteristics determine biophysical <b>production</b> <b>possibilities.</b> Characteristics of the production technique determine the realization of <b>production</b> <b>possibilities.</b> General guidelines are given to structure the specification and number of alternatives to be explored and to apply agro-ecological principles required for quantification of future-oriented land use systems.

Finally, suggestions are given for the application of the approach at spatial and temporal scales exceeding the field level and time horizon of 1 year...|$|R
