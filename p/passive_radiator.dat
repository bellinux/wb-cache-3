Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E

2500|$|The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager {{designed}} for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument {{is equipped with}} a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic CCD imager with a [...] aperture giving a resolution of 5μrad (~1arcsec). The CCD is chilled far below freezing by a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> on the antisolar face of the spacecraft. This temperature differential requires insulation, and isolation {{from the rest of the}} structure. The Ritchey–Chretien mirrors and metering structure are made of silicon carbide, to boost stiffness, reduce weight, and prevent warping at low temperatures. The optical elements sit in a composite light shield, and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation. Overall mass is , with the optical tube assembly (OTA) weighing about , for one of the largest silicon-carbide telescopes flown at the time (now surpassed by Herschel). For viewing on public web sites the 12-bit per pixel LORRI images are converted to 8-bit per pixel JPEG images. These public images do not contain the full dynamic range of brightness information available from the raw LORRI images files.|$|E

The system low frequency roll-off in a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> design will be slightly steeper, and will have a notch (dip) in {{frequency response}} due to the Vas (compliance, or stiffness of the speaker cone) of the <b>passive</b> <b>radiator.</b> The goal in designing a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> is to adjust the tuning so that this notch is below audible levels.|$|E
50|$|Passive {{radiators}} {{are used}} in home stereo speakers, subwoofer cabinets and car audio speaker systems, particularly in cases where {{there is not enough}} space for a port or vent system. While most studio monitor speakers are either ported bass reflex designs, or closed-back without a vent or <b>passive</b> <b>radiator,</b> Mackie sells one small monitor speaker that has a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> installed on the rear of the cabinet.

5000|$|A speaker {{enclosure}} using a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> (PR) usually contains an [...] "active loudspeaker" [...] (or main driver), and a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> (also {{known as a}} [...] "drone cone").

50|$|One {{benefit of}} the wOOx bass <b>radiator</b> (and <b>passive</b> <b>radiators</b> in general) when {{compared}} to the more common bass-reflex vents {{is that there is no}} possibility of air turbulence noise if the resonant system is greatly excited. As a result, additional equalization applied near the enclosure's tuning frequency can increase system output without generating extraneous noises or greatly increasing cone excursion of the active driver. Many wOOx-equipped mini-stereo systems produced by Philips feature a three-level equalization control which applies additional bass equalization at frequencies which excite the wOOx bass radiator, improving the visceral 'impact' of the bass through the wOOx radiator's extreme air displacement capability. This use of active equalization to increase overall system output is the primary characteristic that differentiates wOOx technology from typical loudspeaker systems equipped with <b>passive</b> <b>radiators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> {{usually has}} some means to adjust its mass (e.g., by adding {{weight to the}} cone), thereby {{allowing}} the speaker designer to change the speaker enclosure [...] "tuning".

40|$|A novel {{design to}} improve the cooling {{capability}} of spaceborne cryogenic <b>passive</b> <b>radiators</b> is described. The design {{is based on the}} use of lightweight angled radiation shields, low-conductance structural supports, and a separate detachable launch-support system to reduce the parasitic heat leaks from the warm spacecraft to the cold radiator. The effectiveness of this design is demonstrated by thermal-vacuum-chamber experiments which indicate that the angled-radiation-shield assembly has an effective emittance that is an order of magnitude lower than that of the best multilayer insulation used in flight. Performance predictions based on the experiments and analytical model indicate that an advanced passive-radiator design based on this technology would be between 10 and 57 percent of the size and 10 and 36 percent of the mass of the best state-of-the-art <b>passive</b> <b>radiators</b> and would make lower temperatures (less than 60 K) and larger heat loads practical. The cooling requirements of many new spaceborne instruments could be accommodated by application of this new passive-radiator design...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> speaker uses {{a second}} [...] "passive" [...] driver, or drone, to produce similar low-frequency extension, or {{efficiency}} increase, or enclosure size reduction, similar to ported enclosures. The passive driver is not wired to an amplifier; instead, it moves {{in response to}} changing enclosure pressures. In theory, such designs are variations of the bass reflex type, but with the advantage of avoiding a relatively small port or tube through which air moves, sometimes noisily. Tuning adjustments for a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> are usually accomplished more quickly than with a bass reflex design since such corrections {{can be as simple}} as mass adjustments to the drone. The disadvantages are that a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> requires precision construction quite like a driver, thus increasing costs, and has excursion limitations.|$|E

The left and right tweeters have been moved {{to the top of}} the speaker. The <b>passive</b> <b>radiators</b> are not covered by metal grills and can be seen pulsating. The speaker can be placed in both vertical and horizontal orientations.|$|R
5000|$|Sound Blaster Roar is a {{portable}} Bluetooth speaker manufactured by [...] Creative Technology Ltd. The speaker was launched on 27 February 2014 at the IT Show 2014 in Singapore. It has got two amplifiers one for driving the low and medium frequency {{and the other}} for high frequency. There are five drivers in the speaker, one 2.5" [...] woofer, two [...] <b>passive</b> <b>radiators</b> and two front 1.5” high frequency drivers.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> theory {{dictates}} that the <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> should {{be capable of}} displacing at least twice the volume of air that the active driver displaces through its own stroke. To satisfy this requirement, passive radiators traditionally have a larger surface area than the active driver. The dual-suspension design of the wOOx bass radiator allows the radiator to undergo extreme excursions, so the wOOx radiator displaces the necessary air volume without being larger than the active driver, enabling easier integration into consumer electronics products. More recent embodiments of the wOOx bass radiator use a single-roll suspension.|$|E
5000|$|Such a {{resonant}} system augments {{the bass}} {{response of the}} driver and, if designed properly, can extend the frequency response of the driver/enclosure combination to below the range the driver would reproduce in a similarly sized sealed box. The enclosure resonance has a secondary benefit in that it limits cone movement in a band of frequencies centered around the tuning frequency, reducing distortion in that frequency range. Ported cabinet systems are cheaper than a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> speaker with the same performance; whereas a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> system requires one or two [...] "drone cone" [...] speakers, a ported system requires only a hole or port and a length or tubing.|$|E
50|$|The wOOx {{radiator}} {{incorporates a}} mass {{element in the}} center of its diaphragm, which is used to adjust the tuning frequency of the loudspeaker enclosure. In this sense, a loudspeaker enclosure with passive radiators emulates a mass-spring system, much like the helmholtz resonator devices (bass reflex ports) more commonly used to tune loudspeaker enclosures. However, the amount of mass suspended on a <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> diaphragm enables extremely deep tuning frequencies to be possible in small enclosures. However, like any <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> system, it is possible to damage the bass radiator by driving it beyond its mechanical limits. To avoid this, some wOOx systems use an additional reflex vent, having the same tuning as the wOOx radiator. This relieves excess pressure that could tear the bass radiator apart.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>radiators</b> {{are used}} instead of a reflex port (a tube or vent cut into speaker {{cabinets}} to improve the bass response) for much the same reasons—to tune the frequency response, particularly in small volume enclosures and when small diameter drivers are used, for better low frequency performance. PRs are especially popular in situations in which a port would be inconveniently sized (usually too long for practical box configurations).|$|R

The nonlinear parameters are estimated from the measured displacement and sound pressure signal.

5000|$|Passive {{radiators}} are [...] "similar {{in operation}} to ported" [...] bass reflex systems, and both methods {{are used for}} the same reason: to [...] "...extend the cabinet system's low frequency response." [...] "By far, the port {{is the most common}} means of extended bass response in a cabinet. The second most common bass extender for loudspeakers is called a passive radiator" [...] A <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> is the use of one or more additional speakers in a cabinet. One speaker is a regular speaker with a magnet and voice coil. One or more additional <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> speakers have the cone, but {{they do not have a}} magnet or voice coil. Passive radiators are also called [...] "drone cones". Passive radiators are not connected to the power amplifier.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> system {{makes it}} easier for the speaker system to create the deepest pitches (e.g., basslines). These deep pitches are hard for the woofer to produce. With a PR system, the {{movement}} of the [...] "drone cone" [...] passive radiators reduces the amount that the woofer has to move. If a woofer has to move too much to produce very deep pitches, it can damage the woofer (this is called [...] "overextension"). A <b>passive</b> <b>radiator</b> system can provide an improved bass sound. Another benefit is that, given that PR designers usually use a larger [...] "drone cone" [...] than the real woofer (or use two drone cones), this means speaker designers can use a woofer that is not as large and achieve the same or better frequency response as in a bigger woofer.|$|E
50|$|Other {{enclosure}} types {{alter the}} rear sound radiation {{so it can}} add constructively to the output {{from the front of}} the cone. Designs that do this (including bass reflex, <b>passive</b> <b>radiator,</b> transmission line, etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output of the driver.|$|E

5000|$|Most VMPS {{speakers}} incorporated {{one or more}} <b>passive</b> <b>radiators</b> (PR). To achieve optimal sound quality, the {{set-up process}} required the listener change {{the mass of the}} PR by adding or removing Mortite putty from the cone. This process changed the resonant frequency and [...] "Q" [...] of the PR and dramatically affected the sound of the bass. This allowed the listener to change the overall tonal characteristic of the bass and to compensate for the bass response of the particular listening environment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>radiators</b> do not behave {{exactly as}} their {{equivalent}} bass-reflex designs {{in that they}} cause a notch in system frequency response at the PR's free air resonant frequency; this causes a steeper roll-off below the system's tuned frequency Fb, and poorer transient response. Due {{to the lack of}} vent turbulence and vent pipe resonances, many prefer the sound of PRs to reflex ports. PR speakers, however, are more complex to design and likely to be more expensive as compared to standard bass reflex enclosures.|$|R
