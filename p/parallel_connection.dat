5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world. The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or <b>parallel</b> <b>connection,</b> to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E

25|$|Supercapacitors {{bridge the}} gap between {{conventional}} capacitors and rechargeable batteries. They have the highest available capacitance values per unit volume and the greatest energy density of all capacitors. They support up to 12,000 Farads/1.2 Volt, with capacitance values up to 10,000 times that of electrolytic capacitors. While existing supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater. Power density is defined as the product of energy density, multiplied by the speed at which the energy is delivered to the load. The greater power density results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles than a battery is capable, and a greater tolerance for numerous charge/discharge cycles. This makes them well-suited for <b>parallel</b> <b>connection</b> with batteries, and may improve battery performance in terms of power density.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>parallel</b> TCP <b>connections</b> to {{increase}} throughput for bulk transfers is common practice within the high performance computing community. However, the effectiveness, fairness, {{and efficiency of}} data transfers across <b>parallel</b> <b>connections</b> is unclear. This paper considers the impact of systemic non-congestion related packet loss on the effectiveness, fairness, and efficiency of parallel TCP transmissions. The results indicate that <b>parallel</b> <b>connections</b> are effective at increasing aggregate throughput, and increase the overall efficiency of the network bottleneck. In the presence of congestion related losses, parallel flows steal bandwidth from other single stream flows. A simple modification is presented that reduces the fairness problems when congestion is present, but retains effectiveness and efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Our paper {{presents}} solutions using erasure coding, <b>parallel</b> <b>connections</b> to {{storage cloud}} and limited chunking (i. e., dividing the object {{into a few}} smaller segments) together to significantly improve the delay performance of uploading and downloading data {{in and out of}} cloud storage. TOFEC is a strategy that helps front-end proxy adapt to level of workload by treating scalable cloud storage (e. g. Amazon S 3) as a shared resource requiring admission control. Under light workloads, TOFEC creates more smaller chunks and uses more <b>parallel</b> <b>connections</b> per file, minimizing service delay. Under heavy workloads, TOFEC automatically reduces the level of chunking (fewer chunks with increased size) and uses fewer <b>parallel</b> <b>connections</b> to reduce overhead, resulting in higher throughput and preventing queueing delay. Our trace-driven simulation results show that TOFEC's adaptation mechanism converges to an appropriate code that provides the optimal delay-throughput trade-off without reducing system capacity. Compared to a non-adaptive strategy optimized for throughput, TOFEC delivers 2. 5 x lower latency under light workloads; compared to a non-adaptive strategy optimized for latency, TOFEC can scale to support over 3 x as many requests...|$|R
