30|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, Blangiardo (1996) {{introduced}} the “Centre sampling technique” (CS). The CS is a probabilistic multi-level sample method {{specifically designed to}} collect information on {{a representative sample of}} migrants when a (complete) list of the target population is not available, and the total number of the population is unknown (Baio, Blangiardo, & Blangiardo, 2011). The rationale of the CS is that migrants, during their everyday life, frequent a range of ‘aggregation centres’ (such as immigrant specific services, <b>phone</b> <b>centres,</b> churches, etc.), which can be used as first level unit of analysis to select migrants (the second level unit). The CS methodology provides a scheme to estimate a set of weights to correct the initial probability of inclusion in the sample (Fasani, 2008; Kraler & Vogel, 2008; Vogel & Kovacheva, 2008).|$|R

30|$|The {{sampling}} method {{used in the}} selection process was the Centre Sampling Technique (Baio et al. 2011), an approach used successfully in both Italian and European projects (e.g. Eurostat 2000; Huddleston and Dag Tjaden 2012). Surveys based on Centre Sampling are specifically designed to collect information on {{a representative sample of}} migrants, both legal and illegal. The method is based on a two-stage design. In the first stage, in order to guarantee a nationally representative sample, the interviews are allocated across Italian provinces and towns chosen by reference to their high incidence of migrants. In the second stage, a set of centres of aggregation—places where immigrants congregate such as <b>phone</b> <b>centres,</b> markets, places of worship and ethnic shops—is identified and in these places migrants are then randomly chosen for interview. In this survey, an appropriate procedure was introduced to avoid distortion due to the probability of a migrant being present in more than one centre. Interviews were performed face-to-face by interviewers with a foreign background, most of them cultural facilitators who had undergone specific training.|$|R

It equally tries to discover if there is a difference in the perceived students’ desire to express love to the opposite sex and violation of mobile phone rule. Furthermore, it strives to investigate if there is a difference in the perceived students’, who are not born again and violation of mobile phone rule. Apart from these, it finds out the time that students use their phone secretly, gender of students most involved in this violation and reasons why they do not like using telephone service provided for them on campus. The study engages both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. It employs percentage to describe data collected. Chi-square was used to test its hypotheses @. 005 level of significance. The result shows that most of the students caught for possession and use of phone were using it secretly at night. Moreover, male students were more involved in violation of mobile phone rule than their female counterparts.   The study equally discovered: a difference in the perceived lack of privacy in communication and violation of mobile phone rule; difference in the perceived students’ desire to express love to the opposite sex and violation of mobile phone rule and difference in the perceived students who are not born again and violation of mobile phone rule.

40|$|Each of {{the basic}} units, {{a part of the}} {{integrated}} rescue system of the Czech Republic, possesses its own information system for operating control which do not communicate mutually. Receiving the national numbers emergency calls is solved differently by each unit. The <b>phone</b> <b>centre</b> for emergency calls coming in from the European emergency number 112 has available technology communicating in a limited manner to the information systems of other units of the integrated rescue system but this method is insufficient and limited to only one-way transfer {{of the basic}} structured information for calling the emergency line 112 and the national emergency line 150 of the Anti-fire Rescue Group of the Czech Republic. It provides neither for communication nor integration to other emergency lines. The current situation where the basic units of the integrated rescue system have been established by several founders, the Ambulance Service is not controlled centrally and the level of different units operative centres as far as the integration being at variant levels is very complicated. Despite all this, the existing situation can be improved substantially. The solution rests in building the common information system across the basic units of the integrated rescue system. There is also available a project financed from the EU structural funds through the programme between 2007 and 2013. By establishing the quality project team and by specialists getting involved in all basic units of the integrated rescue system, such a chance can be taken advantage of due to their close collaboration, the project can be carried out and a higher standard of the service to fellow citizens and visitors of the Czech Republic can so be set in the area of solving exceptional events. The work describes the current situation of the operative centres of the integrated rescue system basic units, analysis of such a situation and sets out starting points, prerequisites and principles for establishing the unified information system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study undertaken in Dublin, to ascertain passenger preferences for public transport information. The study examines the need for public transport information across three stages of a public transport trip. The stages examined are as follows; stage one: pre-trip planning from home to work, stage two: at-stop/station information, and stage three: pre-trip planning from work to home. At each of these stages, the respondents were asked to choose between several methods of receiving information, via the internet, mobile <b>phone,</b> call <b>centre</b> or at stop real-time information displays. The study utilised a stated preference approach to ascertain what type of information respondents required at each stage and their willingness to pay for this information. This paper {{presents the}} findings of the study undertaken and reports several factors which affect respondent’s willingness to pay for public transport information. This paper examines several factors relating to the impact of the geographical location of a respondent in relation to the utility they derive from real-time public transport information. The first factor examined measures the impact that the proximity of an individual to a high quality public transport option has upon utility derived from real-time information. The second factor examines how the residential location of the respondent impacts upon the utility derived from real-time information. Both of these geographical factors were examined using the results of a stated choice experiment conducted in Dublin, Ireland. The first section of this paper presents the survey methodology applied in this study.

Pharmacotherapy by itself is not sufficient, because compliance of patients in remission is usually low {{and there are more}} factors contributing to relapse, especially stress of patients resulting from emotionally demanding situations in the family. PREDUKA (PREventive EDUcational programme for relapse prevention) is a six-hour professionally-led group programme for patients with psychotic disorders in ambulant therapy and for their relatives.

The project {{described in this}} chapter aimed to respond to herders’ demand for more timely and accurate localized weather forecasts {{as a means to}} reduce risks and improve planning of key livelihood activities. Extension of information and communication technology (ICT) services to remote parts of the country made experimentation with new communication systems feasible. The project started with a needs assessment, which found that the top priority of herders was to obtain three day weather forecasts for temperature, precipitation and wind speed. There was mobile coverage in 80 - 90 % of the land area and most herders had mobile phones (except for the poorer households). The network quality differed by community, with mostly poor reception in high mountain areas. A mobile phone, in combination with a fixed telephone connected to an antenna, allowed herders to receive forecast data and <b>phone</b> the sum <b>centre</b> or the office of the Mongolian non-government organization, Environment and Development Association (JASIL) to give feedback on forecasts received and to transfer their own weather observations.
