An August 2010 poll showed that 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities.

5|$|The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{faced the}} Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO), {{reporting}} to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, {{as well as the}} HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations. In late April 1992, the VRS was able to deploy 200,000 troops, hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage – HOS) could field approximately 25,000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons, while the ARBiH was largely unprepared with nearly 100,000 troops, small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons. Arming of the various forces was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September 1991. By mid-May 1992, when those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The extent of the control was extended to about 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

A big problem in Yemen is the cultivation of Khat, a psychoactive plant that releases a stimulant when chewed, and accounts for up to 40 percent of the water drawn from the Sana'a Basin each year, and that figure is rising. Some agricultural practices are drying the Sana'a Basin and displaced vital crops, which has resulted in increasing food prices. Rising food prices, in turn, pushed an additional six <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> into poverty in 2008 alone.

25|$|Mastery of the {{initiative}} made the US attrition strategy of seeking big battles problematic, and also undermined GVN/ARVN attempts at pacification. Manpower losses could always be made up with more infiltration of regulars from the North and additional recruitment of VC within the South. The arrival of US forces in 1965 saw a shift back to small unit and guerrilla warfare. The average of battalion sized attacks for example dropped from 9.7 per month to 1.3, while small-scale actions climbed by 150 percent. While US troops were being lured to remote regions in pursuit of base areas, big battles and large casualty ratios, 90% of all attacks were consistently occurring in the 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> that held over 80 {{percent of the population}} according to one American study covering 1966 and 1967.

Much of the land at higher elevations is extensive sheepwalk country and is grazed by hardy Welsh Mountain sheep that roam at will. As with {{other parts of the}} United Kingdom, farming has been under great pressure, leading to declines {{in the number of people}} employed on the land, the amalgamation of holdings and an increase in part-time farming. Farmhouses have been used for bed-and-breakfast or converted into self-catering accommodation, and farmers have diversified into tourism-related and other activities.

50|$|For {{agricultural}} purposes, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> can {{be divided}} into three regions: the Chaco, the central region, and the eastern region.

With <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mennonite colonies in the central Chaco, there was little crop activity. A more suitable location for crops was the central region in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> Asunción, where traditional crop production had dominated since peasants were pushed toward the capital at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paraguayan War. But government policies since the 1960s had favored breaking up minifundios in the central region and establishing larger, more efficient farms in the fertile eastern border region, which is endowed with rich, varied soils, well distributed annual rainfalls, and millions of hectares of hardwood forests. Together these regions cover some 16 million hectares, 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> land and approximately 98 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> crop land.
