5|$|Several {{species of}} <b>proboscideans</b> lived on islands and {{experienced}} insular dwarfism. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist {{earlier in the}} Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands {{due to a lack}} of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions. Dwarf <b>proboscideans</b> are known to have lived in Indonesia, the Channel Islands of California, and several islands of the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The cranial {{features}} Ocepeia {{shares with}} primitive eutherians include eye-sockets (orbits) set further {{back on the}} skull, relatively narrow cheek bones (zygomatic arches), and details of the inner ear, while characters it shares with paenungulates their paenungulate-like ancestors include a wide nasal cavity and a very short bony projection in the eye-socket. Pneumatized skulls are also found in larger <b>proboscideans</b> (e.g. elephants, mastodons, and other extinct relatives).|$|E
5|$|Ocepeia {{lived at}} a time when {{northwest}} Africa was at the intersection of the Atlantic Ocean and the ancient Tethys Ocean, and much of the area was flooded by shallow, warm inland seas. Ocepeia fossils are associated with diverse sharks, birds, and marine reptiles, and a small number of early mammals, including other condylarths and early <b>proboscideans.</b> The early appearance and specialized features of Ocepeia suggest afrotherians originated and diversified within Africa, contrary to theories suggesting a more northern origin.|$|E
5|$|S. {{gracilis}} entered South America {{during the}} early to middle Pleistocene, where it probably gave rise to S.populator, which lived {{in the eastern part}} of the continent. S.fatalis also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were therefore divided by the Andes mountains. The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and invasive species sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included <b>proboscideans,</b> horses, camelids and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. Native metatherian predators (including the saber-toothed thylacosmilids) had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats.|$|E

5|$|The Columbian mammoth shared its habitat {{with other}} now-extinct Pleistocene mammals (such as Glyptodon, Smilodon, ground sloths, Camelops and the American mastodon), horses and buffalos. It {{did not live}} in Arctic Canada, which was {{inhabited}} by woolly mammoths. Fossils of woolly and Columbian mammoths {{have been found in}} the same place in a few areas of North America where their ranges overlapped, including the Hot Springs Site. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths entered southern areas when Columbian mammoth populations were absent. The Columbian mammoth coexisted with the other extinct <b>proboscideans</b> Stegomastodon mirificus and Cuvieronius tropicus at sites in Texas and New Mexico during the early Irvingtonian.|$|E
5|$|The reasons Paraceratherium became extinct after {{surviving}} {{for about}} 11 million years are unknown, {{but it is}} unlikely that there was a single cause. Theorised reasons include climate change, low reproduction rate, and invasion by gomphothere <b>proboscideans</b> from Africa in the late Oligocene. Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, {{in the same way that}} African elephants do today, by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, Paraceratherium populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like Hyaenaelurus and Amphicyon also entered Asia from Africa during the early Miocene; these may have predated Paraceratherium calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are divided}} over whether climate change, hunting, or a {{combination}} of the two, drove the extinction of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate change hypothesis, warmer weather led to the shrinking of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland and semi-desert, with less diverse vegetation. The overkill hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the extinction to hunting by humans. This idea was first proposed by Paul S. Martin in 1967; more recent research on this subject have varied in their conclusions. A 2002 study concluded that the archaeological record did not support the overkill hypothesis, given that only 14 Clovis sites (12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains) out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting. In contrast, a 2007 study found that the Clovis record indicated the highest frequency of prehistoric exploitation of <b>proboscideans</b> for subsistence in the world, and supported the overkill hypothesis. Whatever the actual cause of extinction, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{primitive}} rhinoceroses, {{the front}} teeth of Paraceratherium {{were reduced to}} {{a single pair of}} incisors in either jaw, which were large and conical, and have been described as tusks. The upper incisors pointed downwards; the lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards. Among known rhinoceroses, this arrangement is unique to Paraceratherium and the related Urtinotherium. The incisors may have been larger in males. The canine teeth otherwise found behind the incisors were lost. The incisors were separated from the row of cheek teeth by a large diastema (gap). This feature is found in mammals where the incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations. The upper molars, except for the third upper molar that was V-shaped, had a pi-shaped (π) pattern and a reduced metastyle. The premolars only partially formed the pi pattern. Each molar {{was the size of a}} human fist; among mammals they were only exceeded in size by <b>proboscideans,</b> though they were small relative to the size of the skull. The lower cheek teeth were L-shaped, which is typical of rhinoceroses.|$|E
5|$|An apex predator, Smilodon {{primarily}} hunted large mammals. Isotopes {{preserved in}} the bones of S.fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (Bison antiquus, which was {{much larger than the}} modern American bison) and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes {{preserved in the}} tooth enamel of S.gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia. In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (Panthera leo atrox) bones show an overlap with S.fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa. As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and <b>proboscideans</b> were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S.populator thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. The differences between the North and South American species {{may be due to the}} difference in prey between the two continents. Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that Smilodon was a scavenger that mainly used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.|$|E

25|$|The {{range of}} most species of Mammut is unknown as their occurrences are {{restricted}} to few localities, the exception being the American mastodon (M.americanum), {{which is one of}} the most widely distributed Pleistocene <b>proboscideans</b> in North America. M.americanum fossil sites range in time from the faunal stages of Blancan to Rancholabrean and in locations from as far north as Alaska, as far east as Florida, and as far south as the state of Puebla in central Mexico, with an isolated record from Honduras, probably reflecting the results of the maximum expansion achieved by the American mastodon during the Late Pleistocene. A few isolated reports tell of mastodons being found along the east coast up to the New England region, with high concentrations in the Mid-Atlantic region. There is strong evidence indicating that the members of Mammut were forest dwelling <b>proboscideans,</b> predominating in woodlands and forests, and browsed on trees and shrubs. They apparently did not disperse southward to South America, it being speculated that this was because of a dietary specialization on a particular type of vegetation.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{paleontological study}} done in greater Matjhabeng began a {{programme}} of excavation {{of an early}} Pliocene locality. With an estimated age of 4.0-3.5 Ma, the locality also represents the only well-documented, river-deposited Pliocene locality in the central interior of southern Africa. After three years of excavation, a diverse fauna that includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals was recovered. Mammals ranged in size from rodents to mammoths, including an array of <b>proboscideans,</b> perissodactyls and artiodactyls, alongside rare carnivores.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{characteristics}} of mastodon bone sites, it can be inferred that, as in modern <b>proboscideans,</b> the mastodon social group consisted of adult females and young, living in bonded groups called mixed herds. The males abandoned the mixed herds once reaching sexual maturity and lived either alone or in male bond groupings. As in modern elephants, there probably was no seasonal synchrony of mating activity, with both males and females seeking out each other for mating when sexually active.|$|E

25|$|A mammoth is any {{species of}} the extinct genus Mammuthus, <b>proboscideans</b> {{commonly}} equipped with long, curved tusks and, in northern species, a covering of long hair.

They {{were members of the}} family Elephantidae, which also contains the two genera of modern elephants and their ancestors. Mammoths stem from an ancestral species called M. africanavus, the African mammoth. These mammoths lived in northern Africa and disappeared about 3 or 4 million years ago. Descendants of these mammoths moved north and eventually covered most of Eurasia. These were M. meridionalis, the 'southern mammoths'.|$|E
500|$|<b>Proboscideans</b> {{experienced}} several evolutionary trends, such as {{an increase}} in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to [...] tall. As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed {{to allow them to}} survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support. Early <b>proboscideans</b> developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity. The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased. The cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from C3-plants to C4-grasses, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. Only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs. The upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species. Some <b>proboscideans</b> developed tusks from their lower incisors. Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their middle ear anatomy and the internal testes of the males.|$|E
