5000|$|A fluid dynamic gauge (FDG) is a {{measurement}} technique {{used to study}} the behaviour of soft deposit layers in a liquid environment.

50|$|Deoxidized {{steel is}} steel {{that has some}} or all of the oxygen removed from the melt during the {{steelmaking}} <b>process.</b> <b>Liquid</b> steels contain dissolved oxygen after their conversion from molten iron, but the solubility of oxygen in steel decreases with cooling. As steel cools, excess oxygen can cause blowholes or precipitate FeO. Therefore, several strategies have been developed for deoxidation. This may be accomplished by adding metallic deoxidizing agents to the melt either before or after it is tapped, or by vacuum treatment, in which carbon dissolved in the steel is the deoxidizer.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic level sensors {{are used}} where {{hazardous}} conditions exist, {{where there is}} no electric power or its use is restricted, and in applications involving heavy sludge or slurry. As the compression of a column of air against a diaphragm is used to actuate a switch, no <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> contacts the sensor's moving parts. These sensors are suitable for use with highly viscous liquids such as grease, as well as water-based and corrosive liquids. This has the additional benefit of being a relatively low cost technique for point level monitoring.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct an applied field study {{investigating}} the feasibility of utilizing <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> swine manure in crop production. Four treatments were evaluated; unprocessed <b>liquid</b> swine manure, <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> effluent, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and zero-rate control. For shallow subsurface water (as measured by lysimeters), the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer treatment had the greatest levels of nitrate-N. However, there were no significant differences for any measured chemical parameter for groundwater (as measured by sampling wells) among the four treatments. In general, the zero-rate control treatment was the lowest yielding treatment for corn (Zea mays L.), in contrast to the equivalent response of the other treatments. Nutrient accumulation was similar for the four treatments, with the exception of greater plant manganese content of the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer treatment. For soybean (Glycine max L.), all four treatments responded in a similar fashion. After 5 years of annual treatment application, the <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> effluent and unprocessed manure treatments were similar for most soil parameters. In addition, soil and plant tissue samples were evaluated for pathogenic organisms (total coliform and Escherichia coli) and non-detectable levels were found for all treatments. The results of this study indicate the <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> swine effluent produced in this study, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and unprocessed manure had similar effects on crop characteristics and subsurface water quality...|$|R

50|$|A digital inline process {{refractometer}} sensor {{measures the}} refractive index {{and the temperature}} of the processing medium. The measurement is based on the refraction of light in the process medium, i.e. the critical angle of refraction using a light source. The measured refractive index and temperature of the process medium are sent to the control box. It calculates the concentration of the <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> based on the refractive index and temperature, taking pre-defined process conditions into account. The output is typically a 4 to 20mA DC output or, increasingly, an Ethernet signal proportional to process solution concentration, liquid density, Brix or other scale that has been selected for the instrument.|$|E
5000|$|A {{colloid mill}} is {{a machine that}} is used to reduce the {{particle}} size of a solid in suspension in a liquid, or to reduce the droplet size of a liquid suspended in another liquid. Colloid mills work on the rotor-stator principle: a rotor turns at high speeds (2000 - 18000 RPM). The resulting high levels of hydraulic shear applied to the <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> disrupt structures in the fluid. Colloid mills are frequently used to increase the stability of suspensions and emulsions., but {{can also be used to}} reduce the particle size of solids in suspensions [...] Higher shear rates lead to smaller droplets, down to approximately 1 µm which are more resistant to emulsion separation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The cut-density of sink-float separations with {{water-based}} magnetic liquids linearly {{depends on}} the magnetization of the <b>process</b> <b>liquid.</b> The control of the magnetization of the liquid, by means of measurement followed by extraction {{of water from the}} <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> by membranes or mixing with water or concentrated magnetic liquid, is therefore a critical part of the technology. A potential problem with mixing-in concentrated magnetic liquid is that the <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> may become inhomogeneous and will segregate in the magnetic field region. Mixing experiments for various scenarios were carried out on a simplified experimental process line and magnetization levels were compared with theoretical models. The results show as <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> segregation, due to incomplete mixing, can be avoided for all conceivable control strategies by using static mixers. A measurement tool based on a magneto-gravimetric principle was shown to have sufficient sensitivity to detect and control fluctuations of the magnetization of such a fluid in an industrial environment...|$|E
