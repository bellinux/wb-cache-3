5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils <b>peppermint</b> <b>oil</b> and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

40|$|Background: Considering {{the high}} {{secretion}} of gastric acid in peptic ulcer, its known complications {{and failure to}} previous therapeutic regimens, and also regarding history of prescribing <b>peppermint</b> essential <b>oil</b> {{in the treatment of}} gastric disorders and lack of information about interactions between <b>peppermint</b> essential <b>oil</b> and secretion of acid by parietal cells, this study was performed. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 60 male rats, species Sprague Dawley. Rats were divided in 6 equal groups. Each group received normal saline (0. 9) and menthol with doses of 0. 9, 2. 7, 9, 27 and 90 mg/kg by plastic cannula, respectively. Gastric secretion was extracted from pylorus. Gastric acidity was evaluated using titration by NaOH. Data analysis was performed by t-test, paired t-test, one way ANOVA and tukey's test. Results: Rate of gastric acid secretion was constant in rats received normal saline, while it increased in rats received <b>peppermint</b> essential <b>oil.</b> <b>Peppermint</b> essential <b>oil</b> with dose of 9 mg/kg decreased acid secretion from 100 to 61. 1 Â± 3. 8 percent at the beginning of prescribing.

Complete inhibition of the radial mycelia growth of C. gloeosporioides in vitro was observed with citronella or <b>peppermint</b> <b>oils</b> at 8 μL plate− 1 and thyme oil at 5 μL plate− 1. Thyme oil at 66. 7 μL L− 1 significantly reduced anthracnose from 100 % (untreated control) to 8. 3 % after 4 days, and to 13. 9 % after 6 days in artificially wounded and inoculated ‘Fuerte’ and ‘Hass’ fruit with C. gloeosporioides. GC/MS analysis revealed thymol (53. 19 % RA), menthol (41. 62 % RA) and citronellal (23. 54 % RA) as the dominant compounds in thyme, <b>peppermint</b> and citronella <b>oils</b> respectively. The activities of defence enzymes including chitinase, 1, 3 -β-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and peroxidase were enhanced by thyme oil (66. 7 μL L− 1) treatment {{and the level of}} total phenolics in thyme oil treated fruit was higher than that in untreated (control) fruit. In addition, the thyme oil (66. 7 μL L− 1) treatment enhanced the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. These observations suggest that the effects of thyme oil on anthracnose in the avocado fruit are due to the elicitation of biochemical defence responses in the fruit and inducing the activities of antioxidant enzymes.
