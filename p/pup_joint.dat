40|$|The {{technology}} of retrieving energy {{in form of}} oil and gas offshore is in continuous development, and is moving towards larger water depths and more difficult environmental conditions. Challenges regarding the use of deep water rigs in shallow waters have appeared in the industry, it is therefore of interest to investigate what happens when equipment designed for operation in deep water is used in shallow waters. An investigation can be done with a good analysis model. In this thesis an analysis model is created for the drilling riser system used by Deepsea Atlantic on the Troll field, where measurements of strains in the wellhead has been performed. The model results are compared with the measurements, which is done with the intention of optimizing the analysis model. In this thesis the computer software OrcaFlex is used to perform the riser analysis. In OrcaFlex the riser model is build up from lines, buoys and springs by use of the graphical user interface in the program. The main focus in this analysis is on the wellhead, but results for the 10 ft <b>pup</b> <b>joint</b> is also presented to provide a wider evaluation basis. The model has been run for two cases, corresponding to two measurement sequences. Due to lack of information the current has been implemented from Metocean report from Troll and the waves are taken from logs kept during the operations that correspond to the measurements. The evaluation of the model shows that at the area of main interest, the wellhead, the model does not provide accurate results. The forces and moments found do not correspond with the full scale measurements obtained. An investigation of the forces and moments in the wellhead is therefore not possible with the current model used. The reason for the deviation from reality is that the model is simplified to a large extent in the wellhead region of the system. In addition waves and current are affecting the analysis system in one direction and in reality the current direction will vary trough the water column. The investigation of the forces and moments in the 10 ft <b>pup</b> <b>joint</b> shows better results and the results coincide to some extent with the reality, but the analysis results are non-conservative. The energy spectrums generated for all cases show that the model response equals the response of the measured system. The response results combined with the results found for the 10 ft <b>pup</b> <b>joint</b> implies that the model has some correct elements and {{can be used as a}} basis for further development. In such a development the correct waves and current should be implemented from measured data; and the soil and wellhead model should be modeled in more detail. </p...|$|E
40|$|Operations Mobilization of Vidar Viking, Aberdeen, Scotland The Vidar Viking {{came under}} {{contract}} on 22 July 2004, when mobilization began in Aberdeen, Scotland. Mobilization in Aberdeen included two major installations: a moonpool {{and a full}} coring/drilling spread. By 26 July, all equipment for the Vidar Viking had arrived, including information technology equipment bound for the Oden. The derrick was load-tested and certified. The Vidar Viking took on {{a full complement of}} fuel at Aberdeen. Test Coring Site: Witch Ground, North Sea The Vidar Viking set sail for Landskrona, Sweden, on 28 July 2004. While the ship was en route, a first test of the drilling equipment was conducted in the Witch Ground area of the North Sea, ~ 8 h steam from Aberdeen. A test borehole was drilled in 152 m water depth to a depth of 37 meters below seafloor (mbsf) using the British Geological Survey's (BGS's) advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel. Cores were obtained with both systems. The APC recovered > 4 m in all runs (maximum = 4. 5 m). The Vidar Viking left the test coring site at 1900 h on 30 July and proceeded to Landskrona. Meanwhile, mobilization of the Oden proceeded at Gothenburg, Sweden, which included loading the laboratory equipment. On the evening of 31 July, the Oden set sail for Tromsø, Norway. Mobilization of Vidar Viking, Landskrona, Sweden The Vidar Viking reached Landskrona on the morning of 1 August 2004. The stern notch, a 100 ton section required by the Vidar Viking when working in ice, and the helideck were installed. The remaining containers were loaded onto the deck, including the core and European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling Science Operator curation containers sent from Bremen, Germany. Other mobilization work continued until the morning of 3 August, when the Vidar Viking departed for Tromsø. Mobilization of Vidar Viking and Oden, Tromsø, Norway The Oden arrived in Tromsø on the evening of 5 August 2004. The Vidar Viking arrived on the morning of 7 August. Two helicopters, required for ice reconnaissance missions, landed on the Oden and were secured. Rendezvous of three Expedition 302 ships Expedition 302 officially began when the Oden left Tromsø, Norway, at 2350 h on 7 August 2004. The Vidar Viking remained in Tromsø for the next 12 h to wait for dynamic positioning spare parts to arrive. The Oden transited to 81 ° 56 'N, 44 ° 59 'E to meet the other two ships in the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) fleet for Expedition 302, the Sovetskiy Soyuz and the Vidar Viking, {{at the edge of the}} polar ice pack on 10 August. The fleet entered the ice together with the Sovetskiy Soyuz leading, the Oden following, and the Vidar Viking bringing up the rear. Transit to first site During the transit to the operational area, ice reconnaissance and personnel transfer flights began on 12 August 2004. The fleet made unprecedented headway of 8 – 10 kt in sea ice. The fleet arrived on site at 2350 h on 13 August and began preparations for drilling and operations for maintaining position in sea ice. Preparations for drilling began with clearing ice from the moonpool. Once this was done, a steel skirt was deployed through and below the moonpool to protect the drill string from ice impact below the hull. Once the ice protection skirt was in place, the drill floor and iron roughneck were installed. The drill floor was ready for operations by 0900 h on 15 August. During this time, the fleet's ability to maintain station was tested by positioning the Sovetskiy Soyuz and the Oden upstream of the Vidar Viking. The initial stationkeeping tests were successful, and the Fleet Manager gave approval to start drilling operations at 1100 h on 15 August. Site operations Cores were recovered in five holes (Holes M 0002 A, M 0003 A, M 0004 A, M 0004 B, and M 0004 C) (Table T 1). Hole M 0001 A was abandoned after the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was lost. Logging was attempted in two holes and data were collected in Hole M 0004 B. Table T 2 documents the allocation of time, broken down into (1) waiting for better ice conditions, (2) operational breakdown, and (3) drilling operations. Waiting for better ice conditions was labeled "W. " If waiting on ice conditions required pulling pipe and subsequent preparations to begin drilling operations, these times were included in the W category because that time delay was caused by the "waiting for ice" situation. "Breakdown time" is defined as operational time consumed as a result of equipment or mechanical failure. The loss of a BHA, for example, regardless if caused by human error or mechanical failure, necessitated a drill string trip. If the trip time was caused by equipment failure, it was considered as breakdown time "B. " Site M 0001 (SP 2720 on Line AWI 91090) Site M 0001 (shotpoint [SP] 2720 on Line AWI 91090) was reached at 1100 h on 15 August 2004. Later that day during drill string deployment, the high-pressure mud valve on the top drive was damaged. The valve was removed, the rest of the drill string was run, and then the broken valve was replaced. Pipe trips were slowed or stopped intermittently to allow overheated hydraulic fluid in the new drill rig to cool. By 16 August, the drill string was deployed to the seafloor and the first piston corer was deployed at 0600 h. After pumping for 30 min, pressure was not obtained and the piston corer was retrieved without having fired. Damaged seals on the piston corer were replaced. Ice conditions were marginal, and at 0900 h operations were stopped and the drill string was lifted from the seabed. Ice conditions improved by 1400 h, and operations continued. The piston corer was deployed again, and no pressure developed in the drill string. Upon retrieval, the piston corer had not fired. It was suspected that the piston corer had not latched into the BHA. The extended core barrel was then deployed but was not recovered, which indicated that the BHA was lost. At 2000 h, the drill string was tripped to the surface and the BHA and extended core barrel losses were confirmed. Beginning early on 17 August, a new BHA was assembled and lowering of the drill string began. When > 800 m was deployed, the high-pressure mud valve on the swivel was damaged during pipe handling. The drill string was tripped to the surface because the operator did not want to risk leaving the drill string hanging in the water column for an unspecified period of time. After completing the pipe trip, the damage was assessed and the Oden's chief engineer was tasked with manufacturing a new valve using materials from a spare <b>pup</b> <b>joint.</b> As an interim solution, a conventional valve assembly was installed, which restricted operations so that no piston core could be deployed. Ice conditions deteriorated between 0900 and 2200 h, and the time was utilized to move the Vidar Viking to a new position (Hole M 0002 A). Because there were no mud valve spares, the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat began making arrangements for a Swedish Air Force C- 130 airdrop of two new valve parts and one conventional valve assembly. Site M 0002 (SP 2560 on Line AWI- 91090) Based on a strategy developed by the ice management team, the drill string was lowered while drifting onto the location of Site M 0002. By 2200 h on 18 August 2004, this strategy put the Vidar Viking within 190 m of the proposed site. The final positioning was done by icebreaking this short distance to Hole M 0002 A. Once on location at 0820 h, three more drill pipes were added and coring started. Because the mud valve was not yet repaired, the extended core barrel was deployed instead of the APC. A first attempt at coring was unsuccessful, but after adding more pipe and drilling another core run, some core was retrieved. The first core on deck arrived at 1335 h at a water depth of 1209 m. Drilling operations continued throughout the afternoon. The newly fabricated mud valve from the Oden arrived late in the afternoon, and preparations were made for its installation during a wireline trip. The temporary valve was replaced before more drill pipe was added for the next core run. By midnight on 19 August, a depth of 31 mbsf had been reached. Drilling and extended core barrel coring continued until 23 August (Table T 1) when the Fleet Manager ordered the drill pipe to be pulled to 40 mbsf because ice conditions had deteriorated. Permission to continue drilling operations was given midday, and operations continued until 2100 h when the ice conditions forced the termination of Hole M 0002 A at a depth of 271. 69 m. The drill string was tripped to the drill deck during the morning of 24 August. After waiting for ice conditions to change in the afternoon, a transit began at 1930 h to a position from which the Vidar Viking could drift onto location while tripping in the drill string. While we waited for improved ice conditions and operations set up for the next site continued, an air gun seismic survey was run from the Oden to tie Site M 0002 to the next site (Site M 0003). Site M 0003 (SP 2521 on Line AWI- 91090) The Vidar Viking reached the ice-drift position at 2100 h and awaited ice reconnaissance results. The iron roughneck, which had been removed to repair oil leaks, was installed after repairs; the ice protector skirt was lowered; and the drill floor was prepared. At 2300 h, the BHA and drill collars were run. At 0240 h on 25 August 2004, after 400 m of pipe had been deployed, the housing of the iron roughneck cracked and had to be removed for major repairs. Operations resumed at 1400 h using power tongs. The seafloor was reached at ~ 2300 h, and at 0110 h on 26 August, the first APC core was recovered from Hole M 0003 A (Table T 1). A second APC core with a shattered liner was recovered. The third APC core became stuck in the BHA. While trying to release the corer, the wireline parted at the mechanical termination, and it was necessary to pull the string. Hole M 0003 A was terminated at 0440 h. The ice management team conducted ice reconnaissance surveys, reviewed options, and recommended that the fleet move to a location farther west, where a longer-term prediction of relatively good ice could be made. Once the site was selected, the ice team predicted an upstream ice position for the Vidar Viking to start to drift onto the new location. The fleet steamed to the updrift ice position, arriving at 0630 h on 27 August. During this time, wireline termination repair, APC service, and iron roughneck testing and refitting took place. Site M 0004 (SP 3006 [Holes M 0004 A and M 0004 B] and 3004 [Hole M 0004 C] on Line AWI- 91090) At 0755 h on 27 August 2004 during the pipe trip to the seafloor, the high-pressure mud valve was damaged again. The valve was removed, and the remaining string was run to 1150 m depth while the valve was repaired. At 1800 h, the Vidar Viking was on location (Hole M 0004 A). Once on station, the repaired mud valve was installed and the drill string was run to the seabed. At 2230 h, drilling operations in Hole M 0004 A commenced and the hole was advanced by washing ahead to 17 mbsf (Table T 1) before a piston corer was deployed. Shortly after midnight on 28 August 2004, the APC became stuck in the BHA but was freed after ~ 1 h. Once on deck, the plastic liner in the core barrel was found to be shattered and 3. 5 m of the core was stuck in the barrel. In light of these problems with the APC—in particular, the risk of junking the hole again—it was decided to switch to extended core barrel coring. Two extended core barrel cores were recovered to a depth of 30. 5 mbsf followed by washing to 265 mbsf using the insert bit. This decision to wash ahead was made in order to recover sediment deeper than that recovered in Hole M 0002 A. By 2240 h, a depth of 265 mbsf was reached. Extended core barrel coring operations continued for the next 3 days (29 – 31 August), where the hole was advanced at varying rates with good to poor recovery. During this time, the drilling was very slow (e. g., 1 m/h) and recovery in many cores was zero (Cores 302 -M 0004 A- 13 X through 18 X). Different strategies were tried to improve the advance rate. At times, the hole was advanced by washing ahead in an attempt to make faster progress but this strategy was ultimately abandoned after it was found that the washing rate was almost the same as the coring rate. On 31 August from 0200 to 0500 h, for two coring runs in a row no core was recovered. The extended core barrel shoe was switched to a coring shoe for a third attempt at recovery. This coring run cleared a blockage in the bit as evidenced by a large drop in pump pressure. Following this core (with good recovery) and after clearing the blocked bit, core recovery and advancement improved over the next 12 h until basement was reached in Core 302 -M 0004 A- 35 X. Basement penetration was difficult (8 m penetration in 12 h with low core recovery), and a decision was made at 0900 on 1 September to stop coring at a total depth of 428 mbsf and conduct logging in Hole M 0004 A. The logging tools were moved to the rig floor, and the tool string (Formation MicroScanner–Accelerator Porosity Sonde–Natural Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Tool–Scintillation Gamma Ray Tool [FMS-APS-NGT-SGT]) and wireline rig-up proceeded simultaneously. The run into hole commenced at 2130 h. This was done at low speed in order to allow the tools to warm up. Communication with the tool was initially established, and it was lowered to the end of the drill pipe. A computer malfunction caused a communication loss to the tools. The problem was corrected by 0200 h. The tool was powered up, and attempts were made to get the tool to pass through the BHA into the open hole. All efforts failed at the same depth (~ 1366 meters below rig floor [mbrf]); so, while at rest at this depth, the calipers were opened on the FMS to check whether it was free or lodged. The calipers had some movement, which indicated that the tool string was free. The landing ring for the core barrel is the narrowest section of the whole pipe string (95 mm) and lies ~ 6 m above the bit. All the logging tools had been checked through a landing ring dockside in Aberdeen, but there was no hole calibration ring on board that could be used as a second check. Sequentially, four more logging attempts were made. Each time, it was assumed that the logging tools were too large in diameter and the string diameter was further reduced by removing the larger diameter components. The APS bowspring was removed first, followed by the knuckle joint. Finally, only the narrowest velocity-density string was deployed, which failed to clear the bit at the same depth as the previous runs. After the fifth attempt failed, the logging time allocated had been consumed and attempts to log Hole M 0004 A ended at 1045 h on 2 September. After the logging gear was cleared away and the drill string was lifted out of the seabed, preparations were made to start a second hole (Hole M 0004 B) at the site. During preparations, the inner barrel was deployed but did not latch. After an improvised downhole hammer was deployed and worked for 2 h, a short length of core (~ 10 cm of mudstone), which had been partially blocking the BHA, was recovered. By 2030 h on 2 September, the Vidar Viking was at the new position for the next hole (Hole M 0004 B). Coring in Hole M 0004 B started at a depth of 10 mbsf using the extended core barrel because the APC was deemed too risky. After retrieving the first sample, the hole was washed to 20 mbsf for an in situ temperature measurement. The BGS temperature probe was lowered to the base of the hole, pushed into the sediment, and programmed to record the temperature every 5 s. The probe was left to record temperature for 40 min, after which it was retrieved. Plans to wash to a depth of 215 mbsf, core to 230 mbsf, and then wash to 250 mbsf and log were stymied by problems with drilling pressure lines/gauges freezing at – 10 ?C. Because of these problems and the limited time left, the hole was only advanced to a depth of 220 mbsf. Temperature measurements were made at 60 and 100 mbsf. At 0000 h on 4 September, the pipe was pulled to 65 mbsf to prepare for logging. Rigging of the wireline and tool string occurred concurrently, and rig-up of both was completed by 0415 h. The tool string comprised the FMS-Borehole Compensated Sonic (BHC) -NGT-SGT; the choice of tools was such that it coul...|$|E
40|$|Parental care is {{associated}} with costs. Communal offspring care in species with altricial young may reduce the costs for a parent, but {{it comes with a}} risk of exploitation, jeopardizing the evolution of stable cooperation. Female house mice can either rear their young alone or communally with one or several other females. In the latter case, females pool litters and do not discriminate in their maternal behaviour between their own and alien offspring. Differences in litter size between females, or differences in the amount of investment they provide, might therefore result in one female exploiting another. To analyse the potential for conflict during cooperation, we compared under laboratory conditions the maternal investment (milk quantity and quality at peak lactation, when a female's own offspring were 15 days old) of wild-bred females nursing communally with one partner with that of females nursing solitarily. To increase the probability of asymmetry in litter sizes between communally nursing females, we used a genetic tool to reduce in utero litter size for one of the two partners. Communally nursing females invested according to the total number of <b>pups</b> in the <b>joint</b> nest and not according to their own litter size, making them vulnerable to exploitation. Females that gave birth to the smaller litter consequently overinvested; they had a higher investment per weaned offspring than females that gave birth to larger litters in communal nests or solitarily nursing females. Communal nursing in house mice thus represents a public good situation. Both partners invest according to the combined litter size, but they differ in the benefit they gain, which is the number of weaned offspring...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThis master`s {{thesis is}} called “Pumping of Gelled fluid in Pipeline Applications” and {{is carried out}} on request by Halliburton Pipeline & Process Services. The reason this thesis is carried out is that more {{information}} is needed to predict accurately the required pumping pressure to encounter when pumping gelled fluids. A test program {{was set up to}} provide data from situations similar to those from real projects. The test program was designed so {{it would be easy to}} collect and compare data. It was therefore carried out by pumping different gel plugs of lengths of 50, 100 and 150 meters into three different pipelines of 2, 4 and 6. 1 inches in diameter. The gel used in these gel tests is called Temblok- 50 ™. This is a Halliburton produced gel which is made by mixing a linear gel with a cross-linker. Cross-links are bonds that link one polymer chain to another. The Temblok- 50 ™ is a viscous water based gel with an extremely tough cohesive structure developed for use where a long life material is required. It is formed by cross-linking a natural gum or its derivatives in alkaline pH conditions. Temblok- 50 ™ is also a thixotropic gel because it has a time dependent viscosity. Fanning`s equation is used for calculating the theoretical pressure needed for moving gel plugs. A rewriting of Fanning`s equation gives the equation which is used in this thesis. This equation is shown below with an explanation of the different characters: Where: = pressure for moving the gel plug [bar] = pipe diameter [in] = wall shear stress [bar] = length of the gel plug [m] A thorough explanation of this equation and its use is seen in chapter 6. 1, Theoretical pressure. A test program for gathering accurate pumping and pressure data was planned. The aim with these tests was to figure out what pressure is needed to move gel plugs in a pipeline. The different gel plugs were placed inside 2 and 4 inch pipelines at a test site in Risavika Harbor and a 6. 1 inch pipeline at IRIS research center`s test site. To figure out how gel plugs move in the pipe, and if it is possible to get water pushing the gel, to flow past the gel plug without moving it, transparent pipes were used in different tests at the University of Stavanger. Before the tests in Risavika Harbor and at IRIS were carried out, safety margins between pressure safety valves (PSV) and calculated pressure were calculated. It was also calculated how much gel was needed. Initial to the gel tests was a tests set-up containing the P&ID (piping and instrumentation diagram), procedure and a work schedule designed. The test set up in Risavika Harbor was made of two main units, one pumping unit and one pipeline unit. The pumping unit is the same for every test, but the pipeline unit is changed between the 2 and 4 inch pipeline unit depending on which pipeline the test 3 was carried out in. These pipeline units were made by mounting together <b>pup</b> <b>joints</b> of different lengths to achieve two loops of the total lengths of 350 meters for the 2 inch pipeline and 250 meters for the 4 inch pipeline. At IRIS`s test site there is a 700 meter long and 6. 1 inches in diameter permanent pipeline to which the pumping unit was connected. This pipeline is build by mounting together casings. At the University of Stavanger a transparent pipe with the inner diameter of 1. 57 inches was placed vertical and a rubber plug connected to a pole was placed inside the pipe. Linear gel and cross-linker was poured into the pipe. Gel plugs ranging in length from 30 cm to 120 cm were set to settle in the pipe for more than 12 hours. After gel plugs had been settling in the vertical pipe for more than 12 hours the whole pipe was moved and placed horizontally in the test set up. The rubber plug was then removed by pulling it out while rotating the pole. The test set up consisted of a small Gilson pump, a hose which connected the Gilson pump and the 1. 57 inch transparent pipe. The transparent pipe had a t-junction connection in the beginning of it. A pipe was placed vertically from this t-junction and it had a valve connected to the top of it. A hose going upwards was connected to the end of the transparent pipe at the end of the pipe which was in front of the gel plug. The reason for using the vertical pipe from the t-junction and the upwards going hose was to make it possible to fill the pipe with water both in front and behind the gel plug, which was the last to be carried out before a test was run. The results produced by the tests in Risavika Harbor, IRIS research center and at the University of Stavanger were interpreted and presented in this thesis. There are many variables which have to be considered when interpreting the data from the gel tests. These variables are such as pipe diameter, length of gel plug, temperature, shear stress, cracks, settling time, first and second time the gel plug is set, flow of water pushing the gel plug, remains of gel in the pipeline and uncertainty of the data collected. From these variables it is discovered that all of them had some influence on the pressure needed to push gel plugs. The variables of first and second time gel plugs are set and remains of gel in the pipeline could be neglected when the pressure needed to start moving gel plugs are calculated. If it is the first or the second time gel plugs are set has almost no influence on the pressure needed to move gel plugs. Remains of gel in the pipeline have a bigger influence on gel plugs when they are already set in motion. The variables which need to be included, when pressure needed to move gel plugs is calculated, are pipe diameter, length of gel plug, temperature, shear stress, settling time and flow of water pushing the gel plug. It can be concluded that Fanning`s theoretical equation does not contain of enough variables to calculate the correct pressure needed to move gel plugs. This equation contains the variables; pipe diameters, length of gel plug and shear stress. Experience from the test results is that this equation lacks the variables of settling time, temperature and flow rate of water pushing the gel plug. In the theoretical equation for calculating pressure needed to move the gel plug the influence of length of gel plug and pipe diameter is probably right. The shear stress which is seen in the equation as has the formula of. This means that the formula for shear stress contains viscosity and velocity of 4 the gel plug, and pipe diameter, but none of the other variables. The influence of these three variables in a new expression for shear stress which will be a part of a new equation for calculating the pressure needed to start moving gel plugs in pipelines is unknown. What is known is that in this new equation temperature, flow rate of water pushing the gel plug and settling time has to be included. Settling time influences shear stress because the gel plug “sticks” more to the pipe wall when it settles. This will make it harder to move and gives in a way the wall more shear stress because the gel plugs “work” together with the shear stress of the pipe wall and provides more shear stress which the pump has to overcome to push gel plugs forward. The influence of temperature on the pressure needed to move gel plugs was not measured accurately enough. What can be concluded from the gel tests is that when a pipe with a gel plug inside is exposed to temperatures below zero degrees Celsius, the pressure needed to move gel plugs will be much lower than if the pipe has not been exposed. It can also be concluded that gel plugs will not be destroyed by being moved in or influenced by the pipe being exposed to temperatures below zero degrees Celsius. Flow rate of water given by the pump does not directly influence the shear stress, but it influences the shear stress indirectly. Too low flow rate will make the water, which is supposed to push the gel plug, flow into the crack between the top of the gel plug and the pipe wall. This crack is made because gel has a higher density than water and therefore water tends to flow on top of the gel. If the flow rate given by the pump is too low, then water will flow past the gel plug on top of it. Water can then either flow all the way across on the top if the gel or it can “drill” itself downwards in the gel plugs if there are air bubbles or bends in the pipe. When the flow rate of water given by the pump is high enough, it will “punch” the end of the gel plug so hard that it will be pushed upwards and seal the crack in top of the gel plug, making it possible to neglect the influence of this crack. The tests carried out at the University of Stavanger in the transparent pipes showed that there are many coincidences involved in the behavior of gel plugs. It was discovered that the top of the gel plug is the first part of it to be pushed forwards by pressure coming from the water which is pushed by the pump. The whole gel plug therefore starts to move first in the top of the gel plug and last in the bottom of it. The shape of the end of the gel plugs and if there are bubbles in it influence the pressure needed to move the gel plug. If the end of the gel plug is inclined the flow rate needed to push the end of the gel plug upwards has to be bigger than if the end of the gel plug is vertical. Because the shape of end of the gel plug is not easy to predict, it is hard to figure out if the water is going to flow on top of the gel or push it forwards. If there are air bubbles on top of the gel plug near the end of it the air bubbles will influence the pressure needed to move gel plugs because the air bubbles will help water to flow on top of the gel plug. Both air bubbles and the inclination of the end of the gel plug can cause the gel plug to split into two gel plugs. The conclusion is that the gel tests have given much information about how gel behaves in pipes and different pressures needed to move different lengths of gel plug in pipes of different sizes. A complete equation for calculating the pressure needed to move gel plugs cannot be calculated from these results because the behavior of the end of the gel plug and the influence of temperature is not well enough 5 documented. There are still many things to be tested before an equation which calculates the pressure needed for moving gel plugs can be constructed, but these gel tests are a step in the right direction...|$|R
