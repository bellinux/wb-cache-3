Indeed, despite the use of damage control techniques, the mortality from trauma induced coagulopathy has not changed significantly over the past 30 years. More specifically, a resurgence of interest in postinjury hemostasis has generated controversies in three primary areas: 1) The pathogenesis of trauma induced coagulopathy 2) The optimal ratio of blood components administered via a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>schedule</b> for patients at risk for this condition, ("damage control resuscitation"), and 3) The appropriate use of monitoring mechanisms of coagulation function during the phase of active management of trauma induced coaguopathy, which we have previously termed "goal directed therapy".

50|$|This is {{especially}} important if the process running the critical section has a much longer time to complete and its exit from its critical section, which will delay releasing the shared resource.

5000|$|Cisco IOS has a [...] "monolithic" [...] architecture, {{which means}} that it runs as a single image and all {{processes}} share the same memory space. There is no memory protection between processes, {{which means that}} bugs in IOS code can potentially corrupt data used by other processes. It also has a run to completion scheduler, {{which means that the}} kernel does not pre-empt a running process — the process must make a kernel call before other processes get a chance to run. For Cisco products that required very high availability, such as the Cisco CRS-1, these limitations were not acceptable. In addition, competitive router operating systems that emerged 10-20 years after IOS, such as Juniper's JUNOS, were designed not to have these limitations. Cisco's response was to develop a new version of Cisco IOS called IOS XR that offered modularity and memory protection between processes, lightweight threads, <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>scheduling</b> and the ability to independently restart failed processes. IOS XR uses a 3rd party real-time operating system microkernel (QNX), and {{a large part of the}} current IOS code was re-written to take advantage of the features offered by the new kernel. But the microkernel architecture removes from the kernel all processes that are not absolutely required to run in the kernel, and executes them as processes similar to the application processes. Through this method, IOS XR is able to achieve the high availability desired for the new router platform. Thus IOS and IOS XR are very different codebases, though related in functionality and design. In 2005, Cisco introduced IOS XR on the Cisco 12000 series platform, extending the microkernel architecture from the CRS-1 to Cisco's widely deployed core router.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{comparative}} study on the total revenue generated with pre-emptive and non pre-emptive priority scheduler for a fairly generic problem of pricing the server's surplus capacity in a single server Markovian queue. The specific problem is to optimally price the server's surplus capacity by introducing {{a new class of}} customers (secondary class) without affecting the pre-specified service level of its current customers (primary class) when pre-emption is allowed. <b>Pre-emptive</b> <b>scheduling</b> is used in various applications. First, a finite step algorithm is proposed to obtain global optimal operating and pricing parameters for this problem. These optimal operating and pricing parameters constitute a unique Nash equilibrium in a certain two player non cooperative game. We then describe the range of service level where <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>scheduling</b> gives feasible solution and generates some revenue while non <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>scheduling</b> has infeasible solution. Further, some complementary conditions are identified to compare revenue analytically for certain range of service level where strict priority to secondary class is optimal. Our computational examples show that the complementary conditions adjust {{in such a way that}} <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>scheduling</b> always generates more revenue. Theoretical analysis is found to be intractable for the range of service level when pure dynamic policy is optimal. Hence, extensive numerical examples are presented to describe different instances. It is noted in numerical examples that <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>scheduling</b> generates at least as much revenue as non <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>scheduling.</b> A certain range of service level is identified where improvement in revenue is quite significant.
