5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} exert more pressure, {{although}} all their play {{was in front}} of the Milan penalty area, while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. Milan had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball {{to the side of the}} Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2–0 to Milan. Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner. However, they were unable to find a second goal and the referee blew for full-time with the score 2–1 to Milan.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fairly}} cagey first 21 minutes, {{the first major}} {{incident}} of the game occurred when Paul Scholes and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United {{spent the rest of}} the first half pressing for a second goal, and had two good opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.|$|E

25|$|Given {{this basic}} definition, further {{criteria}} {{are needed to}} establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized {{by a lack of}} prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually {{from one to the other}} by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.|$|E
25|$|The {{intuitive}} {{concept of}} dimension of a geometric object X {{is the number}} of independent parameters one needs to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the cardinality of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the real line (this can be seen by an argument involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a space-filling curve shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and continuously, so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.|$|E
25|$|Congenital amusia, {{commonly}} known as tone deafness, refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation, and it affects about 4% of the population. Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born. They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes {{even if they have}} normal audiometry and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> wrong note in a given melody. If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.|$|E

500|$|Managerial {{decisions}} are a focus and game players {{are allowed to}} select their own lineups, although the game lacks Sabermetrics statistics due to {{the limitations of the}} era. Instead, the [...] "manager" [...] must make their decisions based on data such as player's average and home run totals. They also have the ability to change and decide who will be a pinch-hitter and who will be a substitute pitcher. One is even allowed to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> designated hitter. The game prohibits one from putting out more team members in a certain part of the field than would normally be allowed, which makes deciding which player will be used where a part of the experience.|$|E
500|$|James E. Perone {{says that}} Piper {{became known as}} a concept album in later years, because {{listeners}} wanted to play {{it all the way}} through rather than <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> favourite song. While Beatles biographer Philip Norman agrees that Piper is a concept album, other authors contend that Pink Floyd did not start making concept albums until 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. Author George Reisch called Pink Floyd the [...] "undisputed" [...] kings of the concept album, but only starting from Dark Side. In July 2006, Billboard described The Piper at the Gates of Dawn as [...] "one of the best psychedelic rock albums ever, driven by Barrett's oddball narratives and the band's skill with both long jams and perfect pop nuggets".|$|E

He also gives her a large silver cross pendant. In The Bronze, Buffy meets Willow and encourages her to seize the moment: [...] "Because tomorrow you might be dead." [...] She finds Giles and tells him about the stranger. Giles tells her to learn to hone her skills to sense vampires anywhere. Buffy uses her fashion sense to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> vampire (J. Patrick Lawlor) in the club and is alarmed to see Willow leave with him.

500|$|Some {{linguists}} {{and philosophers}} of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed [...] "extreme" [...] concept nativism. Kent Bach, for example, takes Fodor {{to task for}} his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy. Fodor claims {{that there is no}} lexical structure to such verbs as [...] "keep", [...] "get", [...] "make" [...] and [...] "put". He suggests that, alternatively, [...] "keep" [...] simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, [...] "keep your clothes on", [...] "keep your receipt" [...] and [...] "keep washing your hands" [...] will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, differently, to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of [...] "fast" [...] in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in Concepts: [...] "People sometimes used to say that exist must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a wine {{starts to}} mature, its bouquet {{will become more}} {{developed}} and multi-layered. While a taster {{may be able to}} <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> few fruit notes in a young wine, a more complex wine will have several distinct fruit, floral, earthy, mineral and oak derived notes. The lingering finish of a wine will lengthen. Eventually the wine will reach a point of maturity, when it is said to be at its [...] "peak". This is the point when the wine has the maximum amount of complexity, most pleasing mouthfeel and softening of tannins and has not yet started to decay. When this point will occur is not yet predictable and can vary from bottle to bottle. If a wine is aged for too long, it will start to descend into decrepitude where the fruit tastes hollow and weak while the wine's acidity becomes dominant.|$|E

2500|$|Undeterred, {{the group}} went to Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. {{headquarters}} regularly, offering to provide extra help for Motown's recordings, often including hand claps and background vocals. That year, the group recorded two tracks for Lu Pine Records, with Ross singing lead {{on one of}} the tracks. During the group's early years, Ross served as hair stylist, make-up artist, seamstress, and costume designer. In late 1960, having replaced McGlown with Barbara Martin, The Primettes were allowed to record their own songs at Hitsville's studio, many written by [...] "Smokey" [...] Robinson, who, by then, was vice president of Motown ("Your Heart Belongs To Me" [...] and [...] "A Breathtaking Guy"). Gordy, too, composed songs for the trio, including [...] "Buttered Popcorn"(featuring Ballard on lead) and [...] "Let Me Go The Right Way". While these songs were regional hits, they were not nationwide successes. In January 1961, Gordy agreed to sign the group on the condition they change their name. Eventually, Janie Bradford approached Florence Ballard, the only group member at the studio at the time, to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new name for the group. [...] Ballard chose [...] "Supremes", reportedly, {{because it was the only}} name on the list that didn't end with [...] "ette". Upon hearing the new name, the other members weren't impressed, with Ross telling Ballard she feared the group would be mistaken for a male vocal group (A male vocal was, indeed, named The Supremes.). Gordy signed the group under their name on January 15, 1962. A year later, Barbara Martin left the group, reducing the quartet to a trio. In late 1963, the group had their first hit with [...] "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes", peaking at #23 on Billboard's Hot 100 Pop chart. At the end of the year, Gordy assigned Ross as the group's lead singer, even though Ballard was usually the lead vocalist.|$|E
