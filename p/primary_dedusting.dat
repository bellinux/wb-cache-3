40|$|In {{this work}} an {{analysis}} of gasesâ€™ behavior into <b>primary</b> <b>dedusting</b> system of basic oxygen furnace (BOF) converter was developed. The methodology involves Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate velocity, temperature of gases in combustion for multi-phases systems including solid particles. The influence of {{the air in the}} flow, analysis of temperature and gas along the dedusting system and the influence in cooling pipes was investigated. Numerical data were validated with real values of the process. The next step was the implementation of changes in the geometry of the ducts in order to find a more stable situation for the equipment. The best result was obtained by increasing the diameter and smoothing the geometries in curves...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of the exhaust process on the specific electric demand in the arc furnace and to determine a strategy to reduce the electric energy demand with optimum off gas extraction. The combination of the simulation results and the measurements allows the detailed understanding {{of the impact of the}} exhaust on the mass and enthalpy flow rates in the arc furnaces. The optimisation of the exhausting process allows to minimize the losses of the energy that released in the arc furnace, but limitedly influences the heat transfer to the metal scrap and to the melt within the furnace. The exhaust process of the electric arc furnace optimised with regard to the minimum specific electric demand should have following elements:- mechanical air tight conditions at the furnace vessel- the <b>primary</b> <b>dedusting</b> volume flow rate, matched to the initial off gas production in the furnace,- reduced initial off gas production in the furnace...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{results of}} the reclamation of spent moulding sands with furfuryl resin are presented in this paper. The reclamation process was performed in the secondary reclamation chamber of the REGMAS 1. 5 vibratory reclaimer. 70 kg portions of moulding sands, previously subjected to the <b>primary</b> reclamation and <b>dedusting,</b> were used. The secondary reclamation was performed in two stages: the first consisted of determining the reclaimer intensity at various reclamation times (5 min, 10 min and 15 min) and various electrovibrator frequencies (40 Hz, 50 Hz and 60 Hz), the second consisted of determining the influence of additional crushing elements on the intensity of processes...|$|R
