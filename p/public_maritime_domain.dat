The commune is 10% covered with pine forests, including those of Pignada, Lazaretto, and Chiberta. The sandy coast starts 200 km north at the Pointe de Grave on the shore of the estuary of the Gironde and ends in Anglet. It is punctuated by numerous seawalls cutting the shore. At Anglet the outline of the <b>public</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> has been updated and a coastal reserve 40 m wide has been observed since 1978.

40|$|Come si evince dal titolo della tesi, la ricerca effettuata dal presente candidato nel corso del dottorato di ricerca ha avuto ad oggetto l’analisi delle competenze che, a diverso livello, comunitario, nazionale e regionale, sono attribuite agli enti in materia di rilascio di concessioni di servizi in abito interportuale, portuale e demaniale marittimo. L’attenzione, pertanto, ha dovuto innanzitutto essere rivolta ai compiti ed alle facoltà che, in forza del trattato che istituisce la Comunità Europea, sono attribuite alla Comunità stessa. Si è provveduto, pertanto, ad analizzare l’evoluzione della normativa per giungere all’attuale sistema giuridico. Gli aspetti della disciplina delle concessioni, oggetto di ricerca, hanno dovuto ripercorrere i vari procedimenti di infrazione comminati dalla Corte Europea, per i quali il sistema giuridico nazionale si è dovuto adattare con non poche difficoltà, soprattutto per la presenza di posizioni e prassi, negli anni, divenute consolidate. The {{object of}} this {{research}} concerns the competences of public administrations, both at European and at national level, {{in the field of}} service concessions regarding interports, harbors and <b>public</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>domain.</b> First of all, the evolution of the regulation has been examined, starting from the Italian navigation code and related annexes, {{in order to understand the}} current legal framework. Then, several contravention procedures held by the European Court of Justice (hereafter, ECJ) have been examined, together with their impact on national legal framework and applicative praxis. The research pay attention also to the national jurisprudence which has anticipated the intervention of the ECJ. In fact, before the intervention of the ECJ, Italian administrative Courts (i. e. Consiglio di Stato) have decided that concession procedures must comply to European principles of equal treatment, non discrimination, transparency and publicity. Italian administrative Courts have decided that, although directive 2004 / 18 /CE does not include concessions, articles 43 and 49 of the European Treaties establish principles of equal treatment, non discrimination, transparency and publicity as a general rule: so, public administrations have to guarantee an adequate level of publicity in favor of each competitor and, at the same time, an impartial procedure;national regulations allowing different procedures do not comply with the European Treaties and are not valid. Concerning national regulation, it has been analyzed the devolution of competences from the State to Regions, Counties and Municipalities, focusing on case-law regarding the payment of fees for the exploitation of <b>public</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>domain.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} analyse the {{legislative}} framework of concessions on <b>maritime</b> <b>domain.</b> The <b>Maritime</b> <b>Domain</b> and Seaports Act passed in 2003 prescribes concessions on <b>maritime</b> <b>domain.</b> In the meantime, two new general acts regarding concessions were passed in 2008, and in 2012 {{and the third}} general Concessions Act is in legislative procedure now. The authors will, by the methods of comparison and analysis, show that, unlike other laws governing concessions, the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Domain</b> and Seaports Act has never been aligned with the general law, which causes problems in practice and in its implementation.

The dilemma is whether the general act is applicable in procedures of granting concessions on <b>maritime</b> <b>domain.</b> The authors show in this paper that the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Domain</b> and Seaports Act is not aligned with the Concessions Act and point to the problems in practice due to obvious misalignment of these laws.

40|$|<b>Maritime</b> <b>Domain</b> Awareness is {{critical}} for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs {{and other types of}} critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Limited surveillance resources constrain <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> awareness and compromise full safety and security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis and decision support to assist marine authorities in their routine surveillance operations. The main contribution of this thesis is the formal engineering of robust methodical frameworks for the development of intelligent algorithms, systems, and services for real-time situation analysis, anomaly detection, and decision support; particularly for the <b>maritime</b> <b>domain.</b> Best engineering practice calls for a system to be modeled prior to construction, so one can rigorously inspect and reason about the key system properties, making sure these are both well understood and properly established. We therefore use Abstract State Machine as a Formal Method for engineering these frameworks to address the main aspects of <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> awareness including situation analysis and anomaly detection as well as decision support and emergency response. To be more specific, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America...|$|R
40|$|The {{port system}} is a {{particularly}} important segment of valorisation {{of the sea and}} of the maritime orientation of any country and together with shipping it constitutes a fundamental link of the maritime industry of a country. A strong maritime economy can be built by the developing of all of its segments, systematically linked into a single entity and mutually determined. In this respect, the ports play an especially important role because they constitute the primary benchmarks of development of the maritime economy of a country. The system of concession of the <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> has a developmental and a protective role for the local community, the region and the country as a whole. Therefore, the system should be transparent and the procedure for granting concessions, as simple as possible. In general, concessions {{for the use of the}} <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> serve as a vehicle of development of the economy and allow control and supervision over the use of the <b>maritime</b> <b>domain.</b> The institute of concession is especially significant for developing countries where different interests and pressures on the <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> occur. In Croatia, in accordance with the law, the concessions granted in ports open to public traffic of regional importance are granted by the port authority, while in Italy they are granted by the maritime authority. The authors in the paper analyse the Croatian and Italian procedures for demarcation of the boundaries of the <b>maritime</b> <b>domain</b> and with the institute of concession. Procedures prescribed by the law for granting concessions in ports open to public traffic, their implementation in practice and their implications are especially analysed and compared.
