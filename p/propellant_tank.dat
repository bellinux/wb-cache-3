5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a <b>propellant</b> <b>tank</b> in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 1934, in Kummersdorf, Germany, a <b>propellant</b> <b>tank</b> {{containing}} {{an experimental}} monopropellant mixture {{consisting of hydrogen}} peroxide and ethanol exploded during a test, killing three people.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>propellant</b> <b>tank</b> has a vent {{and relief}} valve at its forward end. This dual-function valve can be opened by ground support {{equipment}} for the vent function during prelaunch and can open during flight when the ullage (empty space) pressure of the liquid hydrogen tank reaches 38 psig (262 kPa) or the ullage pressure of the liquid oxygen tank reaches 25 psig (172 kPa).|$|E

25|$|Rockets {{consist of}} a {{propellant}}, {{a place to put}} propellant (such as a <b>propellant</b> <b>tank),</b> and a nozzle. They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.|$|E
25|$|Rocket {{propellant}} is {{mass that}} is stored, usually {{in some form}} of <b>propellant</b> <b>tank</b> or casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a rocket engine {{in the form of a}} fluid jet to produce thrust. For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as liquid hydrogen or kerosene burned with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen or nitric acid to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, CRS-7 {{launched}} a Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 to resupply the International Space Station. All telemetry readings were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight, when {{a loss of}} helium pressure was detected and a cloud of vapor appeared outside the second stage. A few seconds after this, the second stage exploded. The first stage continued to fly {{for a few seconds}} before disintegrating due to aerodynamic forces. The capsule was thrown off and survived the explosion, transmitting data until it was destroyed on impact. Later it was revealed that the capsule could have landed intact if it had software to deploy its parachutes in case of a launch mishap. The problem was discovered to be a failed 2-foot-long steel strut purchased from a supplier to hold a helium pressure vessel that broke free due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure <b>propellant</b> <b>tank,</b> causing the failure.The Dragon software issue was also fixed in addition to an analysis of the entire program in order to ensure proper abort mechanisms are in place for future rockets and their payload.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of cryogenic <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks</b> with reduced weight and production costs is described with reference to applications for the National Launch System.

Other key parameters for the alloy include fracture toughness, stress-corrosion resistance, and conformance to NASA specifications for cryogenic <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks.</b> The commercially produced aluminum-lithium alloy product forms are shown to operate acceptably in the temperature range for cryogenic <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks.</b> The alloy under consideration and the tank design are important advances in the development of ultralightweight launch-vehicle structures...|$|R

500|$|In April 1946, Convair {{received}} a 1.9 million dollar {{contract from the}} US Government to build and test ten MX-774 rocket. This {{was part of a}} large number of missile projects being developed by the US Army at that time, which included both ballistic missiles like Hiroc, and a variety of long-range cruise missiles as well. The original design of the Hiroc called for a missile that could deliver a [...] payload , and which had an accuracy that allowed it to deliver it to within [...] of the target. The development was headed by Karel J. Bossart, who would go on to contribute to the creation of the Atlas rockets. The MX-774 was based directly upon the design of the V2 Rocket, with several noticeable changes, such as an integrated <b>propellant</b> <b>tank,</b> swivelling engines, pressurized body, and detachable nose cap.|$|E

50|$|A liquid-propellant rocket or liquid rocket is {{a rocket}} engine that uses liquid propellants. Liquids are {{desirable}} because their reasonably high density allows {{the volume of}} the <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks</b> to be relatively low, and it is possible to use lightweight centrifugal turbopumps to pump the <b>propellant</b> from the <b>tanks</b> into the combustion chamber, which means that the propellants can be kept under low pressure. This permits the use of low-mass <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks,</b> resulting in a high mass ratio for the rocket.|$|R
