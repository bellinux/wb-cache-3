An upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger BMC B-Series engine was sold as the Riley One-Point-Five/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by BMC Australia as the Morris Major and the Austin Lancer.|$|E
5000|$|Only minor trim {{changes were}} made to the 1979 Monte Carlo which {{included}} a restyled grille, revised <b>parking</b> <b>lamp</b> detail and new wrap-around taillamps.

A new [...] 267 CID V8 became optional and the [...] 305 CID V8 continued as an option but was joined by a 160 hp 235 lbfft Nm version with a four-barrel carburetor. The same transmissions were carried over from 1978, including a standard three-speed manual and optional four-speed manual, or an optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic. This would be the last year that Chevrolet would offer manual transmissions on the Monte Carlo due to extremely low buyer interest.|$|E

40|$|In 1997, the U. S. {{government}} {{introduced an}} option of having headlamps labeled as visually/optically aimable (VOA). To be so labeled, the vertical gradient {{of the light}} output needs to meet certain minimum requirements. A concern with VOA lamps is that they might provide less light above the horizontal than conventional U. S. lamps, thus reducing the effectiveness of retroreflective signs. This study examined 36 first-generation VOA lamps, to assess the reduction of light above the horizontal. Furthermore, this study addressed the possibility of maintaining the status quo of light for sign visibility, by supplementing light from VOA lamps with light from either <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> or an auxiliary lamp mounted just above the driver. A comparison of the first-generation VOA lamps in our sample with marketweighted U. S. low beams from 1997 indicates that, {{on the right side}} of the beam pattern, just above the horizontal, the mean deficit from VOA lamps can reach 1, 400 cd per lamp. Two considerations lead to the conclusion that <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> will not be able to make up for this deficit. First, current U. S. requirements limit the output of <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> above the horizontal to no more than 125 cd. Second, the retroreflective geometry for <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> (i. e., the resultant observation angle) provides either no advantage or only a marginal advantage over headlamps. A lamp mounted on the roof just above the driver would provide a substantial advantage over headlamps in terms of retroreflective geometry, because the observation angles for such a lamp are smaller than for either headlamp. Taking into account this advantage, a single such lamp would need to have a peak intensity between 1, 500 and 2, 000 cd to make up for the deficit created by both VOA headlamps...|$|R

The metal horn ring used in '69 was deleted from the steering wheel, {{replaced by a}} Rim Blow unit. Increasingly stringent Federal safety requirements mandated the addition of red reflectors to the rear bumper, and yellow reflectors {{to the sides of}} the front <b>parking</b> <b>lamp</b> assemblies. Although horsepower remained unchanged at 365, Federal emissions requirements were met by the installation of [...] "Thermactor" [...] air injection pumps on the 460 cid engine. The interior wood appliques were upgraded to genuine Walnut. The door panels were redesigned and the power seat controls were moved from the seat edge to the door arm rests. The pattern of the stitching on the seats was modified. A power sliding sun roof joined the options list.|$|E
