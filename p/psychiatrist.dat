5|$|According to American <b>psychiatrist</b> Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any {{specific}} legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district <b>psychiatrist.</b> In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the <b>psychiatrist.</b> All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey is}} {{described}} {{of the number}} and distribution of all <b>psychiatrists</b> and trainee <b>psychiatrists</b> in Australia and in New Zealand in 1987, with estimates of available <b>psychiatrists</b> over the next decade. Australia {{as a whole is}} not short of <b>psychiatrists</b> or of trainee <b>psychiatrists,</b> but has a marked maldistribution between States and between city and rural areas which needs to be seriously addressed. In 1987 the ratio of <b>psychiatrists</b> to population in Australia was 1 : 11 290 and in New Zealand 1 : 21 440. It is estimated that by 1997 the cor-responding ratios will be 1 : 9 130 and 1 : 12 440. There were 549 trainee <b>psychiatrists</b> in Australia and 103 in New Zealand.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{understand}} how to improve collaboration between <b>psychiatrists</b> and family physicians in primary care settings. DESIGN: Qualitative study using 10 in-depth interviews and a focus group session. SETTING: Catchment area in eastern Montreal, Que. PARTICIPANTS: Five FPs and five <b>psychiatrists.</b> METHOD: Ten interviews and a focus group were conducted to identify ways of improving collaboration between FPs and <b>psychiatrists.</b> All session were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Analysts used Atlas. ti to compare findings vertically and horizontally. MAIN FINDINGS: Three strategies were identified: communication, continuing medical education (CME) for FPs, and access to consulting <b>psychiatrists.</b> The first two can be implemented by FPs and <b>psychiatrists</b> together, but <b>psychiatrists</b> thought the last one was not feasible {{due to lack of}} both time and remuneration for such activity. CONCLUSION: Better communication and CME for FPs in psychiatry can help improve collaboration between FPs and <b>psychiatrists.</b> Increased access to consulting <b>psychiatrists</b> requires substantial alteration in established clinical roles and routines...|$|R

5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new <b>psychiatrist</b> would be.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} th< 1 {{perceptions of}} psychiatric testimony by the public, lawyers, and <b>psychiatrists.</b> Five major criticisms {{are put into}} historical perspective: <b>psychiatrists</b> excuse sin; <b>psychiatrists</b> always disagree; <b>psychiatrists</b> give confus-ing, subjective, uninformed, jargon-ridden testimony; <b>psychiatrists</b> dictate the law; <b>psychiatrists</b> give conclusory opinions.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{of health care}} professionals who are incompetent, impaired, exploitative or have criminal intent is important for public safety. It is unclear whether <b>psychiatrists</b> {{are more likely to}} commit medical misconduct offences than non-psychiatrists, and if the nature of these offences is different. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the characteristics of <b>psychiatrists</b> disciplined in Canada and the nature of their offences and disciplinary sentences for the ten years from 2000 through 2009 to other physicians disciplined during that timeframe. Utilizing a retrospective cohort design, we constructed a database of all physicians disciplined by provincial licensing authorities in Canada for the ten years from 2000 through 2009. Demographic variables and information on type of misconduct violation and penalty imposed were also collected for each physician disciplined. We compared <b>psychiatrists</b> to non-psychiatrists for the various outcomes. There were 82 (14 %) <b>psychiatrists</b> of 606 physicians disciplined in Canada in the ten years from 2000 through 2009, double the national proportion of <b>psychiatrists.</b> Of those disciplined <b>psychiatrists,</b> 8 (9. 6 %) were women compared to 29 % in the national cohort. A total of 5 (6 %) <b>psychiatrists</b> committed at least two separate offenses, accounting for approximately 11 % of the total violations. A higher proportion of <b>psychiatrists</b> were disciplined for sexual misconduct (OR 3. 62 [95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 2. 45 - 5. 34]), fraudulent behavior (OR 2. 32 [95 % CI 1. 20 - 4. 40]) and unprofessional conduct (OR 3. 1 [95 % CI 1. 95 - 4. 95]). As a result, <b>psychiatrists</b> had between 1. 85 - 4. 35 greater risk of having disciplinary penalties in almost all categories in comparison to other physicians. <b>Psychiatrists</b> differ from non-psychiatrist physicians in the prevalence and nature of medical misconduct. Efforts to decrease medical misconduct by <b>psychiatrists</b> need to be conducted and systematically evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Psychiatry in Europe is {{undergoing}} a period of rapid and significant change. This includes changes in training, changes {{in the role of}} <b>psychiatrists,</b> and changes in the delivery and structure of mental health services.

The response rate among general practitioners was 60 % and among <b>psychiatrists</b> it was 67 %.

To capture {{the views of}} some local <b>psychiatrists</b> on referral and collaboration between SA <b>psychiatrists</b> and religious or spiritual advisers.   Methods. This explorative qualitative study involved indepth, semistructured interviews with 13 local academic <b>psychiatrists</b> selected through purposive sampling.

Conclusion. Dialogue between <b>psychiatrists</b> and religious or spiritual advisers should be developed on an individual practitioner and facility basis, as well as on an organised basis between representative societies.
