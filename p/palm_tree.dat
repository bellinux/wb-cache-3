5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> fronds.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} destroyed about 15sq. mi (39 km2) {{of fruit}} crop. A total of 18 {{people were injured}} during the storm. The storm destroyed 3,107 acres of mango trees and 5,662 acres of bananas were destroyed, with the worst crop damage occurring in Jalisco. Moreover, 540 acres of cocoa, 580 acres of papaya, and at least 382 acres of lemon trees were also destroyed by Eugene. Due {{to a combination of}} Eugene and Hurricane Greg, the region registered rainfall amounts for times the average. In addition, three people were killed; two of the deaths occurred in Michoacán. One man died in Venustiano Carrazano when a <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> was blown over. Another man perished in Manzanillo when he was struck by a fallen <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> Over 5,000people were left homeless (mostly from poor and rural areas), including 60people in Manzanillo. Total crop damage amounted to $142million (1987USD); fruit crop damage alone amounted to more than $2.6million (1987USD). Damage to eight beach houses totaled to $120,000.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} several of the men were {{obscured}} in some fashion, either in shadow or, in one instance, behind a large potted <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> Also interviewed were psychiatrist Charles Socarides, who strongly advocated the position that homosexuality is a mental disorder, and fellow psychiatrist Irving Bieber, who shared Socarides' opinion of homosexuality as pathology. Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of the inside of a gay bar along with shots of hustlers working a street corner and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E

5|$|September 16–17, 2014: Hurricane Odile's outer rainbands brought {{thunderstorms}} {{to parts}} of Southern California, as a tropical storm. The remnants of Hurricane Odile also caused damage across central and eastern San Diego County on September16, 2014, generating high winds and several uncharacteristically powerful thunderstorms in the region. Wind gusts over 20knots reportedly uprooting trees, felled branches, cut power lines, crushed several cars, and flipped at least one airplane at Montgomery Field Airport. Dry lightning generated by a line of severe thunderstorms {{in one of the}} rainbands set fire to a <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> in San Diego and storm force wind gusts within those severe thunderstorms left 6000 customers without power.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{predictions}} for heavy rainfall {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean, the hurricane's movement was more northerly than expected, resulting in less precipitation along the Central American coast than anticipated. In its early developmental stages, Hattie struck San Andrés Island, located offshore eastern Nicaragua, with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts of 104mph (167km/h). As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds. Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> plantations were devastated. The schooner Admirar, anchored {{in one of the}} island's bays, capsized during the storm. Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961USD) in San Andrés. The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south.|$|E
5|$|During Byzantine rule, {{the first}} hermitage in Palestine was {{established}} by the early Christian monk Hilarion {{at the site of}} modern-day Deir al-Balah. Hilarion initially built a small hut there, but during the reign of Constantius II (337–361) he set up the hermitage. Towards the end of his life, the monastery grew and began to attract numerous visitors. Hilarion resided at the monastery for a total of 22 years until his departure for Cyprus where he died in 371 AD. The hermitage was divided into several small cells constructed of mud brick and <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> branches. According to local tradition and observations from Western travelers in the 19th century, the prayer hall of the Monastery of Hilarion is currently occupied by the Mosque of al-Khidr. French explorer Victor Guérin noted that two marble columns in the mosque were possibly parts of the Byzantine-era monastery.|$|E

At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|Delta caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of €312million ($364million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95mph (152km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90mph (147km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer {{part of the building}} when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind. In La Palma a falling <b>palm</b> <b>tree,</b> trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Marítima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.|$|E

30|$|Date <b>palms</b> <b>trees</b> {{are grown}} in many {{countries}} around the world. Arab countries have an estimated 105  million date <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> of which more than 51  million in Arab Gulf Countries (GCC) resulted in the availability of large amounts of waste biomass. The main produced biomass consists of palm leaves, barks and date seeds (Salman et al. 2016). Recent inventory of available waste biomass of date <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> in GCC showed that more than 1.013  million tonnes palm leaves; 574.8 thousand tonnes of cull dates and 345 thousand tonnes of dates seeds available annually. Date palm leaves are the most available by-products of date <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> due to cleaning and pruning operation that are conducted annually (Salman et al. 2016). Currently, the waste of date <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> is either disposed of in the landfills or burned without energy recovery (El-Juhany 2010; Usman et al. 2015). A significant portion of this waste biomass could be efficiently used as viscosity reduction agents. The massive available amount of waste of date <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> can sufficiently provide significant potential feedstock for the cost effective materials suitable for viscosity reduction of crude oil.|$|R
