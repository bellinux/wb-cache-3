Such algorithm {{is based on a}} symbolic computation arising from the classical umbral calculus and, so far as we know, this is the first Maple procedure for such unbiased estimators. The core of the algorithm is a routine that symbolically extends the relations between augmented monomial symmetric functions and power sums in multivariate data points. With regard to <b>polykays,</b> comparisons with the procedure implemented in Mathematica have shown better results in terms of computational times.

A feature of the classical umbral calculus is that an umbra has {{the structure of a}} random variable but with non reference to a probability space. This brings the umbral syntax closer to statistical methods...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{classical}} umbral calculus, we provide a unifying syntax for single and multivariate $k$-statistics, <b>polykays</b> and multivariate <b>polykays.</b> From a combinatorial point of view, we revisit the theory as exposed by Stuart and Ord, {{taking into account}} the Doubilet approach to symmetric functions. Moreover, by using exponential polynomials rather than set partitions, we provide a new formula for $k$-statistics that results in a very fast algorithm to generate such estimators.

40|$|In {{order to}} tackle {{parameter}} estimation of photocounting distributions, <b>polykays</b> of acting intensities are proposed {{as a new}} tool for computing photon statistics. As unbiased estimators of cumulants, <b>polykays</b> are computationally feasible thanks to a symbolic method recently developed in dealing with sequences of moments. This method includes the so-called method of moments for random matrices and results to be particularly suited to deal with convolutions or random summations of random vectors. The overall photocounting effect on a deterministic number of pixels is introduced. A random number of pixels is also considered. The role played by spectral statistics of random matrices is highlighted in approximating the overall photocounting distribution when acting intensities are modeled by a non-central Wishart random matrix. Generalized complete Bell polynomials are used in order to compute joint moments and joint cumulants of multivariate photocounters. Multivariate <b>polykays</b> can be successfully employed in order to approximate the multivariate Mendel-Poisson transform. Open problems are addressed {{at the end of}} the paper.

40|$|We propose new {{algorithms}} {{for generating}} $k$-statistics, multivariate $k$-statistics, <b>polykays</b> and multivariate <b>polykays.</b> The resulting computational times are very fast compared with procedures existing in the literature. Such speeding up is obtained {{by means of}} a symbolic method arising from the classical umbral calculus. The classical umbral calculus is a light syntax that involves only elementary rules to managing sequences of numbers or polynomials. The cornerstone of the procedures here introduced is the connection between cumulants of a random variable and a suitable compound Poisson random variable.

The goals of this paper are threefold. We first introduce the notion of spectral sampling as an operation on a finite set of n real numbers x = (x 1, [...] .,xn) generating a random set y = (y 1, [...] .,ym) of m ≤ n real numbers whose distribution is determined by x. Spectral sampling is not the same as simple random sampling in the sense that y is not a subset of x, but the parallels are unmistakable and striking. In particular, there exist symmetric functions Kλ—analogous to k-statistics and polykays—such that E(Kλ(y) | x) ...|$|R

We provide four algorithms to generate single and multivariate k-statistics and single and multivariate <b>polykays.</b> The computational times are very fast compared with the procedures available in the literature. Such speeding up is obtained through a symbolic method arising from the classical umbral calculus. The classical umbral calculus is a light syntax to manage sequences of numbers or polynomials, involving only elementary rules.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating an arbitrary smooth functional of k ≥ 1 distribution functions (d. f. s) in terms of random samples from them. The natural estimate replaces the d. f. s by their empirical d. f. s. Its bias is generally ∼ n − 1, where n is the minimum sample size, with a p th order iterative estimate of bias ∼ n −p for any p. For p ≤ 4, we give an explicit estimate {{in terms of the}} first 2 p − 2 von Mises derivatives of the functional evaluated at the empirical d. f. s. These may be used to obtain unbiased estimates, where these exist and are of known form in terms of the sample sizes; our form for such unbiased estimates is much simpler than that obtained using <b>polykays</b> and tables of the symmetric functions. Examples include functions of a mean vector (such as the ratio of two means and the inverse of a mean), standard deviation, correlation, return times and exceedances. These p th order estimates require only ∼ n calculations. This is in sharp contrast with computationally intensive bias reduction methods such as the p th order bootstrap and jackknife, which require ∼ n p calculations. Key-Words: bias reduction; correlation; exceedances; multisample; multivariate; nonparametric; ratio of means; return times; standard deviation; von Mises derivatives.
