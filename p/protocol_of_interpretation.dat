30|$|Once found, the {{analysis}} of tephras from archaeological sites should be handled following the established laboratory and analytical <b>protocols.</b> The <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> tephra distributions in and around a given site should be conducted as a collaborative effort between environmental and archaeological specialists. Natural processes alone can move tephra around in profiles, and even create false secondary layers either above or below the actual air-fall event strata [31, 78, 161]. Adding humans {{to the list of}} taphonomic agents will not make the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> such layers easier, but it is worth stressing that tephra may, due to it being inorganic, provide a particularly useful (at times perhaps sole) dating tool in archaeological sequences with poor organic preservation.|$|R
40|$|Properties {{of biomass}} {{relevant}} to combustion are briefly reviewed. The compositions of biomass among fuel types are variable, especially {{with respect to}} inorganic constituents important to the critical problems of fouling and slagging. Alkali and alkaline earth metals, {{in combination with other}} fuel elements such as silica and sulfur, and facilitated by the presence of chlorine, are responsible for many undesirable reactions in combustion furnaces and power boilers. Reductions in the concentrations of alkali metals and chlorine, created by leaching the elements from the fuel with water, yield remarkable improvements in ash fusion temperatures and confirm much of what is suggested regarding the nature of fouling by biomass fuels. Other influences of biomass composition are observed for the rates of combustion and pollutant emissions. Standardized engineering practices setting out <b>protocols</b> <b>of</b> analysis and <b>interpretation</b> may prove useful in reducing unfavorable impacts and industry costs, and further development is encouraged. q 199...|$|R

40|$|Foods {{contain a}} plethora of {{aromatic}} molecules—natural colors, synthetic dyes, flavors, vitamins, antioxidants, etc. —that are luminescent, exhibiting prompt fluorescence or delayed phosphorescence. Although food autofluorescence {{has been used to}} detect specific contaminants (e. g., aflatoxins) or to authenticate specific foods (olive oil), much of the potential of using the optical luminescence of intrinsic molecules for sensing properties of foods is unrealized. We summarize here work characterizing the photophysical properties of some edible, and potentially GRAS (generally-recognized-as-safe), chromophores and especially their sensitivity to, and thus potential for sensing, various physical—viscosity, mobility/rigidity—or chemical—polarity, pH—properties of food known to reflect or be indicative of food quality, stability, and safety. A thorough-going characterization <b>of</b> and robust <b>protocols</b> for <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the luminescent signals from edible chromophores can expand the repertoire of analytical techniques available to monitor quality, and even safety, of the food supply at various stages of production, distribution and storage or even at point of sale...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Real-time {{quantitative}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) is a sensitive technique to monitor treatment response in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Standardization <b>of</b> RT-PCR <b>protocols</b> and <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> results are important to maintain the reliability of this molecular test. Methods: We present the analysis of treatment monitoring after administration of Indian generic imatinib mesylate (IM) (Veenat) in 73 patients with CML-chronic phase using RT-PCR. Results: A consistent decrease in the median breakpoint cluster region-abelson 1 (BCR-ABL 1) percentage denoting a continued time-bound response to IM is observed. At 6 months, 87. 5 % patients showing ≥ 1 -log reduction in BCR-ABL 1 levels subsequently developed ≥ 3 -log reduction as compared to 42. 8 % patients showing < 1 -log reduction. All patients with ≥ 3 -log reduction in BCR-ABL 1 at 12 months maintained treatment response at 18 months. Conclusion: The efficacy of Veenat (NATCO) is comparable to Gleevac (Novartis). Patients who attain ≥ 1 -log reduction at 6 months and ≥ 2 -log reduction at 12 months {{are more likely to}} subsequently attain a major molecular response...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{beliefs about}} the {{functions}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord have been attacked following recent evidence that position and vibration sensations may be carried in the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts. There is evidence that the one specific function of the dorsal columns is for the transmission of information concerning the direction of tactile cutaneous movement. Thirty normal controls, 43 patients with spinal cord disorders and 10 patients with functional disorders were examined prospectively using an easily administered "direction <b>of</b> scratch" <b>protocol.</b> <b>Interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the direction of a 2 cm vertical tactile cutaneous movement over the lower limbs was found to be accurate in normal controls and grossly inaccurate in patients with functional disorders, exceeding the error rate of guessing. Detection of direction of 2 cm scratch was moderately impaired in 11 of 13 patients with spastic paraparesis and preserved sensation to all other modalities and 23 of 24 patients with spastic paraparesis and impaired proprioception and/or vibration sensations. Direction of 2 cm scratch, proprioception and vibration sensations were preserved in the three cases with anterior spinal cord syndromes. It is proposed that tactile perception of direction of 2 cm scratch over the lower limbs is a sensitive sign of posterior column function which can be usefully incorporated into the clinical sensory examination in the evaluation of spinal cord disorders...|$|R

Particular emphasis is put on the processes which take place within reader during <b>interpretation.</b> Main benefits <b>of</b> the work are creation of the original model <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> based on the Shannon-Weaver mathematical model of communication and its placement into wider interpretation theory issue. First part of work describes widespread Shannon-Weaver mathematical model together with matching model <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Also, there is described a model of communication which was adapted especially for use of interpreting on interpersonal communication by means of text. Practical use of current theories <b>of</b> <b>interpretations</b> is outlined as well, together with the detail description of the term of information value of message for author, reader and objective observer.

40|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (RT-PCR), virus isolation (VI) and indirect fluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) are three assays currently used by the salmon industry to identify fish infected with infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). However, no data {{are available on the}} repeatability (within-laboratory consistency) and reproducibility (between-laboratory consistency) of these assays and very limited information is available on the effect of freezing samples on test results. In order to evaluate these assays, five laboratories participated in a blinded study of 400 kidney samples representing four populations of farmed Atlantic salmon with different prevalence of ISAV. Each laboratory used its own testing protocols. Repeatability and reproducibility were evaluated using kappa as the measure of agreement. The effect of freezing was evaluated using the McNemar test. Freezing did not affect VI but improved the sensitivity of RT-PCR. The repeatability and reproducibility of VI was almost perfect. There was a substantial difference in repeatability of RT-PCR among the three laboratories with kappa ranging from 0. 5 to 0. 96. The repeatability for RT-PCR was generally low. The repeatability of IFAT was moderate when the results were analysed using 1 + and above as a positive result.
