40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinical {{epidemiology}} and statistics skills of clinical researchers are often limited. We assessed methodological skills of medical researchers and identified {{factors associated with}} higher skill levels. METHODS: In a cross-sectional mail survey at two Swiss teaching hospitals, participants (N= 409) rated their ability to perform 26 research-related activities, such as identifying the research question, selecting a study design, computing the required sample size, performing data analysis, and reporting results. RESULTS: The proportion of respondents {{who were able to}} perform a specific activity was 33. 2 % on average, ranging from 1. 5 % for "numerical statistics (bootstrap, simulation, cross-validation, [...] .) " to 76. 0 % for "oral presentation of results. " The overall skill level (expressed {{as a percentage of the}} 26 activities) was associated with principal investigator experience (+ 8. 7 %), greater percentage of time devoted to research (+ 12. 4 % for near full-time versus no time commitment), years of research experience (+ 17. 6 % for 15 - 40 years versus 0 years), past number of clinical research projects (+ 18. 0 % for 15 - 230 projects versus 0 - 1 projects), and hours of <b>formal</b> methodological <b>training</b> (+ 32. 6 % for 200 - 1200 hours versus 0 - 9 hours). CONCLUSION: Self-reported methodological skills were generally modest. The most important covariates of skill levels were current time commitment to research, <b>past</b> experience, and <b>formal</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R
30|$|Focussing on {{marginal}} effects, {{we observe}} that individuals from urban area have higher probability of getting <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> {{as compared to}} the individuals from rural area. Similarly, male and single individuals have higher probability of getting <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> as compared to females and ever-married individuals, respectively. Individuals with any formal education have higher probability of getting <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> {{as compared to the}} illiterate individuals. Individuals with any technical education have higher probability of getting <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> as compared to those who do not have any education. In the case of religion, individuals from Christianity and other religions have higher probability than individuals following Hinduism. As far as social groups are concerned, individuals from Scheduled Castes (SCs), Other Backward Castes (OBCs) and general households have higher probability of getting <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> as compared to the individuals from STs households. Individuals working in secondary and tertiary sector have higher probability of having received <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> as compared to those working in primary sector.|$|R
40|$|The {{hospitality}} {{industry is a}} billion dollar industry based upon customer service. Measure of quality service is an intangible concept based upon {{the perception of the}} customer. It is the industry 2 ̆ 7 s front-line employee that has the responsibility of fulfilling the perceived image of service the guest has envisioned. In 1991, industries throughout the U. S. budgeted 43. 2 billion dollars to be spent on <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> of its employees. The dollar commitment made to training exemplifies a companies commitment to its employees and customers. The <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> of the front desk agent bares the same commitment. In this study is was assumed that through <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> the front desk agent would gain a better knowledge and confidence in their job performance and overall job satisfaction. As a result the industry would have a knowledgeable, confident and satisfied front desk agent that would provide better customer service. This descriptive study attempted to identify the status of <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> of the front desk agent, the effect <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> had on job satisfaction and retention and the differences in the perception of <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> between the front desk agent/trainee and the front desk manager /trainer in the Rochester/Monroe County, N. Y. area. The study was conducted through a 28 and a 40 item questionnaire asked of both the front desk agent/trainee and the front desk manager/trainer. The questions asked dealt with <b>formal</b> <b>training,</b> job satisfaction and demographics. It was concluded that although <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> {{is an important factor in}} the {{hospitality industry}} overall job satisfaction is an independent variable of <b>formal</b> <b>training.</b> The questionnaire did however infer that for those hotels that do provide <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> there is a difference in the perception of training between the front desk agent/trainee and the front desk manager/ trainer...|$|R

The important aspect of <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> is for the dogs to respond and understand directional commands. The dogs will learn how to safely cross the street, stop at curbs, stop or guide their owner through obstacles and overhead obstacles also known as clearance. They continue to practice commands such as forward, heel, and rest that they learned with their former puppy raiser family. Once the <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> is completed and the dogs have successfully graduated, they are then partnered up with their new owner.|$|R
30|$|In particular, {{the survey}} {{contains}} {{the following information}} about <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> programs at the firm and at the worker level. At the firm level, the survey asks: “Did your plant run <b>formal</b> in-house <b>training</b> programs for its employees in 2001 ?”, “ Did your plant send employees to <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> programs run by other organizations during the fiscal year of 2001 ”? At the worker level the survey asks: “Have you received <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> since you joined this firm?”. Based on these two questions, we constructed two variables capturing the incidence of on-the-job training at the firm and at the worker level. First, we constructed a firm level dummy variable that equals one if the firm offered <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> to its workers in the year prior to the survey. Second, we constructed a worker level dummy variable that equals one if the worker has received <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> since he joined that firm. In addition, for those workers whose the current position is not their first job, we have information on whether the worker received training at his previous job 11.|$|R

40|$|This paper greatly enriches the {{discussion}} on the determinants of lifelong learning of scientists and engineers (S&Es). In our analysis, {{which is based on}} a survey among S&Es in the Netherlands, we take account of both <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> and different modes of informal learning. We find that S&Es employed in firms which apply innovative production processes more often participate in <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> and also benefit from the informal learning potential of their jobs. Therefore, public policies that stimulate process innovation also prevent skills obsolescence among S&Es. However, lifelong learning is not triggered in firms with many product innovations. S&Es who are employed in firms which operate on highly competitive markets also participate in <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> less often. The same holds for S&Es employed in small firms, although the latter compensate their lower participation in <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> by more hours of self-teaching. S&Es employed in jobs which require a high level of technical knowledge have more <b>formal</b> <b>training,</b> whereas those employed in jobs which require more general skills are significantly more involved in informal learning. Furthermore, older S&Es with long firm tenures participate in <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> less often and have fewer opportunities for learning in their jobs. Therefore, their competence level is at risk. education, training and the labour market;...|$|R

Small business firms play {{an increasingly important}} role in the economic and social well-being of the global community. In the US over 98 % of all businesses employ fewer than 100 people (Heneman & Berkley, 1999). In the United Kingdom (UK), 99. 8 % of all businesses have fewer than 50 employees (BIS, 2011). While small firms {{have a significant impact on}} our economic and social well-being, there is a high failure rate. Finding ways to increase the survival and success rate of small businesses will have a significant positive impact on our economy and communities. We know that <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> in large businesses contributes to increased productivity, and ultimately increased organizational performance, but there is little research on the use of, or impact of <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> in small businesses. The lack of longitudinal data on the use of <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> in small businesses is one of the main stated reasons for the lack of research and understanding in this area. This research uses data from the Kauffman Firm Survey, the largest longitudinal survey of nascent small businesses ever conducted, and multivariate linear mixed modeling to look at the impact over time of <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> on organization level performance in those businesses. The results show a significant impact in profits, asset levels, and profit margin for those small businesses that did <b>formal</b> <b>training.</b> The results also show significant differences in the number of employees, asset levels and additional human resource activities between those firms doing <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> and those not doing <b>formal</b> <b>training.</b> The two major conclusions are: <b>Formal</b> <b>training</b> has a significant positive impact on organizational performance, and not all small businesses are the same...|$|R
