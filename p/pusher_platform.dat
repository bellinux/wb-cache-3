It can be any railcar where a brakeman can safely ride for some distance to help the engineer with visibility {{at the other end}} of the train. Flatcars and covered hoppers have been used for this purpose, but often the <b>pushing</b> <b>platform</b> is a caboose that has had its windows covered and welded shut and permanently locked doors.

500|$|Ski poles {{are used}} for balance and propulsion. Modern {{cross-country}} ski poles are made from aluminium, fibreglass-reinforced plastic, or carbon fibre, depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly {{they were made of}} wood or bamboo. [...] They feature a foot (called a basket) {{near the end of the}} shaft that provides a <b>pushing</b> <b>platform,</b> as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing. Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a single pole for both cross-country and downhill. The single pole was longer and stronger than the poles that are used in pairs. In competitive cross-country poles in pairs were introduced around 1900.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Combining the GPS location-based {{services}} and the latest Web 2. 0 technologies, this paper builds a scalable personalized mobile information <b>pushing</b> <b>platform,</b> which can provide user-friendly and flexible location-based service. We first propose a Location-based Data and Service Middleware based on Service-Oriented Architecture in order to implement Mobile Information Pushing System involved {{in a variety of}} formats of data integration and conversion, as well as a combination {{of a wide range of}} services. Then, we propose a novel 3 -D Tag-Cloud module, so that it can visualize useful retrieval information even in the limited mobile screen. Especially, we design a multi-dimensional collaborative filtering algorithms, in order to achieve dynamic personalized recommendation and mobile information sharing. Cooperating with some restuarants, we also develop a dynamic restaurant mobile location-based recommendation and discount counpons pushing system. The successful application of the application system do show the efficiency of our ideas...|$|R

50|$|Precision stages such {{as those}} used for optics do not use a lead screw, but instead use a fine-pitch screw or a {{micrometer}} which presses on a hardened metal pad on the stage platform. Rotating the screw or micrometer <b>pushes</b> the <b>platform</b> forward. A spring provides restoring force to keep the platform {{in contact with the}} actuator. This provides more precise motion of the stage. Stages designed to be mounted vertically use a slightly different arrangement, where the actuator is attached to the movable platform and its tip rests on a metal pad on the fixed base. This allows the weight of the platform and its load to be supported by the actuator rather than the spring.|$|R

This article explores the increasingly intersecting worlds of Social Media, mobile, and open source. We describe how Social Media has the potential to change the way communities use and create open source tools to better align with end-user expectations...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{learning}} customers' preference and making recommendations to them from today's information-exploded environment is critical and non-trivial in an on-line system. There are two different modes of recommendation systems, namely pull-mode and push-mode. The majority of the recommendation systems are pull-mode, which recommend items to users only when and after users enter Application Market. While push-mode works more actively to enhance or re-build connection between Application Market and users. As {{one of the most successful}} phone manufactures,both the number of users and apps increase dramatically in Huawei Application Store (also named Hispace Store), which has approximately 0. 3 billion registered users and 1. 2 million apps until 2016 and whose number of users is growing with high-speed. For the needs of real scenario, we establish a <b>Push</b> Service <b>Platform</b> (shortly, PSP) to discover the target user group automatically from web-scale user operation log data with an additional small set of labelled apps (usually around 10 apps),in Hispace Store. As presented in this work,PSP includes distributed storage layer, application layer and evaluation layer. In the application layer, we design a practical graph-based algorithm (named A-PARW) for user group discovery, which is an approximate version of partially absorbing random walk. Based on I mode of A-PARW, the effectiveness of our system is significantly improved, compared to the predecessor to presented system, which uses Personalized Pagerank in its application layer...|$|R
