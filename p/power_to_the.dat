5|$|A purely non-socialist, conservative-led {{cabinet of}} Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was {{appointed}} on 27 November. The nomination {{was both a}} long-term aim of the conservatives and a respond to the labour movements' acts during November 1917. Svinhufvud's main goals were to separate Finland from Russia, strengthen the military power of the Civil-White Guards and to return at least {{a part of the}} Parliament's new <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate.|$|E
5|$|As the {{situation}} in Europe escalated into war, the Assembly transferred enough <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Secretary General on 30 September 1938 and 14 December 1939 to allow the League to continue to exist legally and carry on reduced operations. The headquarters of the League, the Palace of Nations, remained unoccupied for nearly six years until the Second World War ended.|$|E
25|$|As with <b>the</b> {{allocation}} of <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States Congress under the United States Constitution, the Constitution of Australia grants {{a number of}} specified <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Parliament of Australia, while leaving unassigned <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state parliaments. Most of <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> granted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> federal parliament can also be exercised by the state parliaments, though because of section 109 of the Australian Constitution federal laws will prevail in case of inconsistency. This arrangement resulted in a constitutional dispute as <b>to</b> whether <b>the</b> federal government could be subject to state laws, and vice versa.|$|R

5|$|During the 1995 {{legislative}} campaign, Ryzhkov {{defended his}} own tenure as Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, claiming that Russians were far worse off under capitalism than Soviet communism. Russian TV channel NTV broadcast a debate featuring only Ryzhkov and Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal politician who strongly supported economic reforms. At the election, {{he was elected}} to the State Duma Federal Assembly as an independent candidate. Once elected, he headed the <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> People bloc, a communist faction with nationalist tendencies. The <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> People bloc came about through the merger of Ryzhkov's supporters and the All-People's Union headed by Sergey Baburin. Its policies were left-wing and included revival of the Soviet Union, the introduction of a planned economy, more state involvement in the economy and the promotion of nationalism and patriotism. During the 1996 presidential election Ryzhkov endorsed Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) candidate, for the presidency.|$|E

5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E

5|$|Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered: Hipparchus (c. 190– c. 120 BC) {{credited}} the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, {{and poet}} Eratosthenes (276–194 BC) {{as the first}} to invent the armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) {{was the first to}} apply motive <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a waterwheel which in turn was powered by the constant pressure head of an inflow clepsydra clock, the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.|$|E

5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|By about 19:30, Marlboroughs pumps had {{contained}} the flooding in the boiler rooms {{but she took}} {{on a list of}} around 7–8degrees. Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight compartments were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently shored up. Three more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19:33. She evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
