40|$|The {{objective}} of the following study was to evaluate the microbial efficacy of a Precure™ (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) dip (3 vs. 30 seconds) treatment (pH = 1. 5) for further processed broiler parts including wings, leg quarters and breast halves. Precure™ is listed as a solution of GRAS acids for use by FDA and is listed as a safe and suitable ingredient by USDA for use on poultry. This {{study was conducted in}} response to the request by several poultry companies for a means to increase the shelf-life of further processed broiler parts. Therefore, 60 post-chill broiler carcasses were obtained from a local USDA-inspected poultry processing facility and were transported on ice to MCA Services (Rogers, AR). Upon arrival at the laboratory, the carcasses were held under refrigerated conditions (40 to 42 o F) for 24 hours to simulate transport to a further processing (cut-up) facility. After the 24 -hour refrigerated hold period, the 60 carcasses were each manually cut into six pieces including two wings, two leg quarters and two breast halves. The cut-up parts were then randomly divided into three groups including a control and two treatment groups. Within each treatment group a pair of wings, a pair of leg quarters or a pair of breast halves served as an individual sample. Thus, there were 20 samples {{for each of the three}} carcass parts within each of the three treatment groups. The treatment groups included the control which received no further treatment, a group which was subjected to a 3 -second room temperature dip in Precure™ (pH = 1. 5) and a group which was subjected to a 30 -second room temperature dip in Precure™ (pH = 1. 5). Parts in both of the dip treatments were allowed to drain for 30 seconds after dipping. All samples (two wings, two leg quarters or two breast halves) were placed into sterile poultry rinse bags and were then held refrigerated at 40 o F until microbiological evaluation was initiated (3 in accordance with USDA/FSIS standard laboratory procedures. The lower detection level was 1 colony forming unit per mL. All dipped parts were also observed for organoleptic properties and no negative qualities were observed. The Aerobic Plate Counts for the control parts were 2. 0 logs (wings), 2. 4 logs (leg quarters) and 1. 9 logs (breast halves). The group that was subjected to the 3 -second Precure™ dip had Aerobic Plate Count values of 0. 5 logs (wings), 0. 3 logs (leg quarters) and 0. 9 logs (breast halves). There was no recovery of Aerobic Plate Count from parts that were subjected to the 30 -second dip in Precure™. Thus, the 3 -second dip in Precure™ resulted in Aerobic Plate Count reductions of > 97 % for wings, > 99 % for leg quarters and > 89 % for breast halves while the 30 -second dip in Precure™ allowed for no recovery of organisms. Results from this study clearly demonstrate that the use of Precure™ (pH = 1. 5) as a dip treatment (3 to 30 seconds) for <b>poultry</b> <b>parts</b> will significantly improve the microbiological properties of <b>poultry</b> <b>parts</b> without adversely affecting the sensory attributes. Thus, the commercially available Precure™ treatment provides the processor with a very economical means of controlling the microbiological properties, and possibly extending the shelf-life, of further processed <b>poultry</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|E

This study uses a normalized quadratic function to estimate the output supply of commercial and backyard broiler producers in Indonesia and the input demand for three major inputs: day-old chicks, feed, and labor.

40|$|Human Campylobacteriosis is {{the most}} {{frequent}} disease to be notified to the authorities caused by bacteria in Germany besides Salmonellosis. In 2005 about 61. 823 cases have been reported. These are 6. 502 more than the year before, when 55. 321 have been counted. Therefore a rapid and reliable detection of pathogenic organisms is needed to ensure microbiological safety and quality. The classical cultural methods {{for the detection of}} Campylobacter spp. are time-consuming and well trained laboratory personal is required for each type of bacteria. To examine samples potentially contaminated by Campylobacter spp. just in time, new and more specific screening methods have to be developed. Those methods have to be evaluated in order to establish such new systems in routine diagnostics. In this study three new rapid screening methods for the qualitative detection of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. were investigated. The practical orientation was estimated using essential parameters of evaluation. Two commercially purchasable immunological systems and one genotypical method were compared with the cultural reference method following ISO 10272. Poultry meat, poultry giblets and faeces of poultry were examined for thermophilic Campylobacter spp. in the three systems qualitatively. Artificially contaminated meat was used in the three systems, too. Definitive concentrations of Campylobacter spp. in poultry meat were accomplished by using a process encountered in previous studies of artificial contamination. The incidence of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. was investigated in <b>poultry</b> <b>parts</b> of different type (meat, giblets) and different terms of storage (fresh, frozen). High rates of contamination were found in poultry samples naturally contaminated by Campylobacter spp. Especially in fresh samples Campylobacter spp. was isolated significant more often compared to frozen samples. In faeces of poultry high rates of contamination were found as well. Therefore flocks carrying a heavy burden may be found at the abattoir. Because of the high rates found, the slaughtering process seems not to mean an obstacle to the survival of Campylobacter spp [...] Rather considerable cross contamination has to be expected. The results of this study show that high numbers of samples can be examined in all three alternatives systems taking far less time compared to the cultural reference method. Especially the both immunological systems are favourable for HACCP in terms of timesaving. Presumptive positive results can be obtained within two days. In official food surveillance presumptive positive samples have to be confirmed by cultural methods. It takes about six days to isolate and specify Campylobacter spp. through the cultural reference method. ELFA or rather GLISA shortens the time to proof contamination with Campylobacter spp. by three days including cultural confirmation of presumptive samples. The two immunological methods evaluated in this study, proof to be specific and sensitive, accounting to their proceeding principles. ELFA is even more sensitive than GLISA. Both methods are rapidly learnable and can be easily established in routine diagnostics. The genotypical method compared in this study is a very sensitive and rapid system to detect thermophilic species Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni in meat, giblets and faeces of poultry. It can be established for routine diagnostics in specialized laboratories only. Positive results can be obtained after three days, including 48 h for enrichment. It {{is the most}} sensitive method of the three tested alternative systems. PCR products should be verified. The results of this study show that new systems for the rapid screening of Campylobacter spp. exist and that they could be established in routine diagnostics. To ensure microbiological safety and quality of consumer protection even more effectively new methods should find entry into the acknowledged collections of methods (like in § 64 LFGB).

40|$|Diseases {{passed from}} animals to humans cause untold {{damage to the}} lives and {{livelihoods}} {{of people living in}} ACP countries. Livestock producers need more help installing better animal husbandry, veterinary and public health practices, to contain the threat and make the most of their animal resources. Humans and animals have been living side by side since livestock domestication began nearly 10, 000 years ago. But while this symbiosis undoubtedly brings benefits, close contacts between Man and livestock can also cause problems. While animals are a major source of protein, by-products and income for many households, they are also a source of disease, especially when Man and beast live in close proximity, and hygiene and veterinary procedures are inadequate. Most of the world s emerging diseases are of animal origin, and nearly all are zoonoses, the term given, in the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), to those diseases which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man. The highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 strain of avian influenza, currently sweeping through Asia, Africa and Europe, is perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the potential damage caused by zoonotic diseases. But in many ACP regions, other animal diseases have long taken a heavy toll on humans. To date, scientists have identified more than 200 zoonoses, the effects of which vary widely, from death or disability in humans to lower production rates in animals. The latter scenario, while clearly less tragic, is nevertheless a serious constraint to food security in many ACP countries. A number of zoonotic diseases are characterised by lower outputs of animal products, manure and traction power. Some zoonoses, such as avian influenza and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease, see Spore 94), have an impact on food safety. A secondary but important repercussion is the fear factor on consumers, together with trade barriers, as embargoes are put into force. A deadly virus As avian influenza continued what some say is its inexorable march through the world, health officials warned that local livestock-keeping practices in Africa could increase the risk of the virus mutating to become transmissible between humans. In Africa, as in other ACP regions, households often live in close contact with poultry in their homes and backyards. Once the virus has mutated to become transmittable between humans, there can be no going back, and millions of lives could be lost. There is no cure for the disease and no vaccine so far. At the time of going to press, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Niger Nigeria and Sudan had confirmed the H 5 N 1 avian flu strain, with two deaths confirmed in Egypt, but at an emergency meeting held in March in Gabon, one UN official warned that more countries were affected than had admitted. These are the only countries who dared announce their results, said WHO epidemiologist Andre Ndikuyeze. Unfortunately, others haven't been so brave. Porous borders, a flourishing informal chicken trade and inadequate veterinary services are acknowledged as key reasons for the spread. The poultry is everywhere and yet veterinary services are nowhere, said Dr Bonaventure Mtei, of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). In Nigeria, health workers are spreading the word about the risks, using leaflets, meetings and the media. But not everyone is receptive to the warnings. A major problem facing health and veterinary officials in some ACP countries is that not everyone believes that the threat is real. In several northern states of Nigeria, people are opposing mass culling, claiming it is a western plot. It s nonsense what people are saying about chickens, laughed Alhaja Sikiratu, in Lagos. When I was small, I ate chicken infected with cholera, and nothing happened to me! FAO is urging adequate compensation to encourage early reporting, but Nigerian poultry farmers, who are being paid 1, 000 CFA (1. 50) per bird, complain they only receive funds for culled poultry, not for those which have died from the disease. The economic effects have been quick to make themselves felt, as consumers in both North and South shun poultry and egg products. Trade experts have warned that dumping of poultry on ACP countries from Europe could drastically affect prices, as happened with beef after the BSE crisis. Rapid detection needed In the affected areas, initiatives are under way to halt the spread. Member states of the Economic Community of West African States have set up an observation network for the rapid detection of sick poultry. Out in the field our staff are alerting the public and collecting information, said Dr Mamadou Kané, director of animal health in Mali. In other ACP regions, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is mapping a regional strategy to cope with the threat of H 5 N 1, which, it acknowledges, is bound to reach the region sooner or later. In March, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community launched the Pacific Regional Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Project, to provide animal surveillance and other responses. But while the spotlight focuses on avian flu, there are a whole host of other zoonoses which have a devastating effect on human health and livelihoods. Experts have warned that urgent action is needed {{to prevent the spread of}} a particularly virulent form of sleeping sickness transmitted by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense that has broken out in eastern Uganda. Infected cattle continue to be transported to outlying markets, raising fears of an epidemic. With Africa s pig population more than doubling over the past 30 years, there are concerns over growing incidences of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic disease of the central nervous system transmitted by pigs. Nearly 50, 000 people die of the tape worm disease each year, mainly in rural areas with poor pig management practices and inadequate meat inspection and sanitation. and timely intervention Cost-effective control measures already exist for several zoonotic diseases. But they are not always applied as zoonoses often rank low in terms of funding. As long ago as 1992, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication concluded that cysticercosis could be eradicated. Other problems facing ACP countries include difficulties in collecting accurate data. Often, surveillance systems lack uniformity and local staff may accept endemic diseases as the norm or fail to report potential zoonose outbreaks to avoid livestock trading bans. When outbreaks of diseases do occur, ACP countries need technical assistance for diagnosis, vaccination and slaughtering programmes. But preventative help is even more crucial. A recent FAO e-conference claimed that public health emergencies such as avian influenza were failures of prevention. The rise in livestock production seen in much of the South must be accompanied by access to credit, development of infrastructure and animal production and health services. Most important of all, farmers need access to information. FAO has set up four regional networks, offering advice on zoonotic disease, through e-conferences, discussions and newsletters. The International Network for Family Poultry Development encourages higher standards in small-scale poultry production through its electronic newsletter. A project developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency for surveillance of livestock disease in Africa uses ICTs to offer training of trainers, on the Internet and on CDs. Meanwhile, as states neighbouring Nigeria slapped a ban on poutry imports, the country was counting the cost to its poultry industry. Before, we always had a good crowd of customers, complained the owner of a Lagos fried chicken eatery. Look at my restaurant now: it s empty ! FAO and WHO have issued a five-point plan for consumers 1. No birds from flocks with disease should enter the food chain. 2.

Its {{focus is on}} risk factors for HPAI spread related to the host population, namely <b>poultry</b> farms. In <b>Part</b> 1, <b>poultry</b> keepers’ disease awareness, potential contagious contacts amongst poultry farms, {{and the issue of}} organizing basic demographic data are addressed. In Part 2, emphasis is placed on the interplay between population data, namely contact structures, and mathematical models of epidemics, in general, and on the specific case of the Swiss <b>poultry</b> population. <b>Part</b> 1 Using a mixed methods research design, consisting of a countrywide cross-sectional survey among 3, 978 poultry keepers and interviews with experts from the poultry industry, revealed that: (i) risks perceived by the poultry keepers well reflected the officially communicated ones; (ii) having a non-commercial poultry farm was associated with low knowledge scores; (iii) both commercial and non-commercial farms were involved with remote between-farm contacts, which was in contrast to commonly presumed small poultry movement ranges in the non-commercial sector. Organizing demographic and epidemiological information in a relational poultry farm database would allow for considering more than one farm site per poultry keeper and facilitate multi-criteria queries. Part 2 Computer simulations comparing two types of individual-based models for the total outbreak size showed that: (i) models assuming a randomly mixed population provided acceptable estimates of the total outbreak size if the number of contacts per day was high or if the per-contact transmission probability was high; as well as for diseases with very short infectious periods; yet (ii) models considering the structure and stability of potentially contagious contacts were superior if the number of daily contacts or the transmission probability were low.

Diets with {{high levels of}} sNSP depress growth and have anti-nutritive properties when fed to <b>poultry,</b> and <b>part</b> of this effect is attributed to the ability of sNSP to increase the viscosity of intestinal digesta (2). A previous study into the effects of guar gum, a viscous water-soluble NSP, on the performance and health of weaner pigs showed a detrimental effect on growth and an exacerbation of experimental post-weaning colibacillosis caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli when this ingredient was fed (3). The aim of this study was to further investigate the potential detrimental effects of increased intestinal viscosity in weaner pigs by feeding them an experimental diet supplemented with carboxymethycellulose (CMC), a water-soluble preparation resistant to fermentation. The effect of increased viscosity on gastrointestinal development, growth performance and incidence of diarrhoea caused by haemolytic E. coli was monitored...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFollowing the {{outbreak}} of H 5 N 1 “bird flu” in Hong Kong in 1997, the isolation of H 9 N 2 subtype viruses from patients in southern China and Hong Kong SAR once again raised the spectre of a possible influenza pandemic. H 9 N 2 viruses have recently been responsible for disease in <b>poultry</b> in various <b>parts</b> {{of the world and}} preliminary studies of the H 9 haemagglutinin (HA) genes of viruses isolated during 1998 and 1999 in Germany, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia showed a close relationship to the HA genes of the viruses that infected two children in Hong Kong SAR. Analysis of the complete genome of a Pakistan isolate, A/chicken/Pakistan/ 2 / 99, showed that it is closely related in all eight genes (97 – 99 % homology) to the human H 9 N 2 isolates and furthermore that the six genes encoding internal components of the virus are similar to the corresponding genes of the H 5 N 1 viruses that caused 6 (out of 18) fatal cases of human infection. Thus H 9 N 2 viruses similar to those that caused human infections in Hong Kong are circulating more widely {{in other parts of the}} world. Whether or not these H 9 N 2 viruses also have features that facilitate avian-to-human transmission is not known. Since avian H 9 N 2 viruses are currently perceived to represent a significant threat to human health it is important to determine whether or not viruses of this subtype circulating in <b>poultry</b> in various <b>parts</b> of the world have the potential to infect people...|$|R
40|$|Poultry {{production}} has experienced tremendous change in Egypt {{in the last}} three decades. Small-scale family poultry production, otherwise termed household <b>poultry,</b> was <b>part</b> of this transformation but to date no concise description has been made of Egyptian household poultry. In this report, this is described using surveys and reviews. Inputs and outputs of this production system were evaluated and the profitability of the household poultry was estimated. Household poultry contribute immensely to food security in Egypt; providing income for individual families. A mean flock size of 73 (mixed breeds) was determined and this yielded a net annual profit of 2287. 67 LE (US$ 397. 34) per annum. The important household poultry diseases are principally viral and bacterial. While Egyptian household poultry are similar to others in Africa in terms of multi-species flocks, womendriven projects, labour and marketing structures, it differs in input systems, hatchery method, disease management, and other indices. Suggestions for improvement of this sector of the poultry industry are offered.

40|$|The U. S. poultry {{industry}} {{is the fastest}} growing sector within the meat complex. Concentration and efficiency of U. S. poultry production have grown steadily since the mid- 1930 s. Poultry is the most vertically integrated of the meat industries and vertical coordination, the linking together of successive stages of production and marketing through ownership or contracting, has spread rapidly, allowing poultry producers to maintain lower per-unit production costs and higher profits relative to those in other meat industries. Virtually all commercial poultry is grown under contract or by integrated firms. Due to the vertical integration, production decisions, from the hatchery supply flock through final production, are made by vertically coordinated management. This allows {{for the analysis of}} <b>poultry</b> production as <b>part</b> of a single production process, unlike beef and pork production. ...|$|R

Since 2003, Hong Kong has successfully used <b>poultry</b> vaccination as <b>part</b> of its strategy to minimise this threat within Hong Kong. In mid- 2008, an HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreak occurred in a vaccinated poultry farm in Hong Kong.

40|$|The highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus H 5 N 1 {{was the cause}} of a pandemic of avian influenza in <b>poultry</b> throughout many <b>parts</b> of the world. The role of wild birds in the transmission and cycling of this virus has been uncertain and the current study was designed to collect further data on the role of wild birds in the transmission of H 5 N 1 in Thailand. The study site for the current study was located in Nakorn Pathom province, the central part of Thailand, where both backyard poultry and low biosecurity poultry farms are common and co-exist. The analysis of existing extensive data from the national wild bird surveillance program for HPAI H 5 N 1 virus in Thailand, found that since 2004 the prevalence of infection with H 5 N 1 in wild birds was low (1. 0...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{emergence}} as avian (1996) and zoonotic human pathogens (1997), H 5 N 1 influenza viruses have become endemic among <b>poultry</b> in large <b>parts</b> of Asia, but outbreaks {{have also been}} seen in Africa and Europe. Transmission from animals to humans remains sporadic, but mortality of human infection is high (63 %). To date, reported cases of {{human to human transmission}} have been rare. Patient and laboratory data suggest that highly efficient viral replication and the resulting intensified immune response of the human host are the determining factors in H 5 N 1 pathogenesis and case fatality rate. Therefore, in the management of H 5 N 1 disease (early) suppression of viral replication is key. The underlying biochemistry and cell biology of H 5 N 1 pathogenesis and treatment are briefly discussed in this review. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
