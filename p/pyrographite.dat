40|$|Abstract: This work {{presents}} a new, non-invasive method for the discrete detection of combustion zone propagation in high energy materials – pyrotechnic compositions – {{by means of}} thermocouples bonded to the external, side surface of a pyrolytic graphite (<b>pyrographite)</b> tube filled with the pyrotechnic composition and ignited at the one end by a CO 2 laser. The thermocouples were positioned in a line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the <b>pyrographite</b> tube, which {{was used as a}} directional heat guide (thermal management) and a thermoresistant structure, enabling detection of the propagation of the combustion zone as a heat zone generated by the combustion, traveling on the outside surface of the <b>pyrographite</b> tube along its axis. Such a directional heat guidance was caused by the unique thermal conductivity anisotropy of <b>pyrographite</b> resulting in low thermal conductivity of the <b>pyrographite</b> tube along its axis and high thermal conductivity across the tube radius. The thermocouples detected passages of the outside heat zone that were equally time delayed in relation to the combustion zone inside the tube. Dividing the distance between the thermocouples by the time between their thermoelectric response to the same (corresponding) isotherm of the heat zone, gave the average burning rate of the high energy composition being tested over the distance between the thermocouples. The proposed procedure for burning rate determination was verified by numerical simulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Subthreshold {{photoelectron}} emission {{was observed}} {{to emerge from}} palladium nanoclusters formed on <b>pyrographite</b> surface under irradiation by photons in the energy range 3. 1 6. 5 eV. The average size of the palladium nanoclusters on the <b>pyrographite</b> surface was 50 80 nm, and the average height, 2 4 nm. Besides conventional photoemission from states below the Fermi level, photoelectron emission was observed at the energies of photons irradiating the surface 0. 9 eV below the work function of the Pd surface. It is assumed that this emission is stimulated by direct electron transitions from Pd states below the Fermi level to the unfilled electron surface states formed in the Coulomb potential of image forces image states and, sub sequently, into vacuum. This phenomenon is assumed to originate from the contact spot field generated above the surface which is nonuniform in work function. This assumption {{is supported by the}} calculations presented in the pape...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{investigation}} of methods of the nanoscale modification of {{the surface of the}} conducting materials with the aid of the scanning tunnel microscope. Developed and created have been specilaized units for the tunnel-probe systems, allowing to perform the local modification. The technological modes of the local modification of the surface of metal films (Au, Cu, Ni) in the air and in the liquid dielectrics have been developed. The local (equal to 10 to 100 nm) of non-uniformityon the surface of the metal films have been obtained at the effect of the electric field with the intensity of about 10 * 997 V/cm and above. The technological modes of modification of the <b>pyrographite</b> surface have been developed with use of intermediate medium (air, water, epoxide resin). The model of the process of the <b>pyrographite</b> modification by means of its layer-by-lyaer chipping as a result of action of the ponderomotor forces of the electromagnetic field has been offered. The methods of the contact modification of the surface has been developed. Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{basis is}} {{proposed}} for extrapolating soot oxidation rate measurements obtained in laboratory flames {{to the more}} extreme operating conditions of gas turbine combustion chambers. The proposal {{is based on the}} observation that, within probable experimental uncertainty, the limited soot oxidation measurements correlate with the more extensive measurements of the surface oxidation rates of macroscopic samples of <b>pyrographite.</b> The soot oxidation rates thus determined for the conditions of a typical gas turbine combustion chamber are considerably lower than estimates which were based on simple extrapolations of the flame data...|$|E
40|$|UV {{spectrometry}} (187 – 380 nm) with {{charge coupled device}} (CCD) detection {{was used}} to study the evolution of absorption spectra during the vaporization of various species in the pyrocoated graphite furnace, with electrodeposited Ir and Rh as modifiers. In order to mimic a typical matrix composition, various salts of aluminum, manganese, copper, magnesium, sodium, and lead were used in microgram amounts. Changes in spectra and vapor release rate, along with aging of the tubes in the repetitive temperature cycles, were observed. Compared to the unmodified pyrocoated tubes, the presence of Ir or Rh causes {{a significant reduction in}} the vaporization efficiency, especially for microgram amounts of copper and aluminum introduced as nitrates, and manganese introduced as a sulfate. The vaporization efficiency, for magnesium and sodium as chlorides, and for lead as a sulfate, remained unchanged. Interestingly, the aging of the tubes was accompanied by partial restoration of the spectral characteristics for unmodified tubes. For example, with unmodified pyrocoated tubes, the vaporization spectrum, appearing {{as a consequence of the}} decomposition of aluminum nitrate, consisted of Al 2 O bands overlapped by Al atomic lines. In the freshly modified tubes, intensities of those lines and bands were substantially reduced, and in this case, the dominance of AlO molecules was observed. The efficiency of vaporization of aluminum species increased in the aged modified tubes. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the modified surfaces for the new and aged tubes indicated that aging of the tubes is accompanied by the destruction of the pyrocoating, formation of <b>pyrographite</b> shells around the areas where the modifier was electrodeposited, and finally, complete substitution of the metal on the graphite surface by <b>pyrographite</b> debris...|$|E
40|$|Among the superconducting {{graphite}} intercalation compounds, CaC 6 exhibits {{the highest}} critical temperature Tc= 11. 5 K. Bulk samples of CaC 6 are obtained by immersing highly oriented <b>pyrographite</b> pieces in a well-chosen liquid Li–Ca alloy for 10 days at 350 °C. The crystal structure of CaC 6 {{belongs to the}} { m R}ar{ 3 }{ m m} space group. In order to study the superconducting properties of CaC 6, magnetisation was measured {{as a function of}} temperature and direction of magnetic field applied parallel or perpendicular to the c-axis. Meissner effect was evidenced, as well as a type II superconducting behaviour and a small anisotropy. In agreement with calculations, experimental results obtained from various techniques suggest that a classical electron-phonon mechanism is responsible for the superconductivity of CaC 6. Application of high pressure increases the Tc up to 15. 1 K at 8 GPa...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this research program {{was to determine the}} effects of surface cleaning and deliberate gaseous contamination on the adhesion behavior of selected candidate materials for use in the NERVA nuclear rocket engine program. Using a torsion balance technique, the relationship between the normal compressive load applied to crossed rod samples and the resultant contact resistance was used to ascertain the extent of adhesion under each set of experimental conditions. In addition to an evaluation of the static adhesion behavior of selected materials combinations, the experimental apparatus was modified to permit a similar investigation relating to the effects of specific tangential displacements of the sample wires, i. e., their sliding friction behavior. During the course of this subcontract, the materials combinations 440 C vs. 440 C. <b>pyrographite</b> vs ZTA graphite, Nbc (graphite) vs. Nbc (graphite), and Electrolize Inconel 718 vs. Au electroplated 302 S/S were evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Recent years, {{a number}} of {{materials}} were examined {{for the purpose of}} field-induced modifications using an air-operated scanning probe microscope (SPM). Local surface oxidation under the action of positive bias applied between the sample and the SPM tip, i. e. anodization, was demonstrated in the experiments with silicon and certain metals. The same actions resulted in formation of nanocavities in highly-oriented <b>pyrographite</b> (HOPG), suggesting the anodization to be responsible for removing the uppermost surface layers from the substrate [1]. A more complex behavior was observed for amorphous carbon materials. Both graphite-like [2] and well-conducting diamond-like carbon (DLC) films [3] showed either nanoprotrusions or nanocavities inside exposed areas, depending on the voltage magnitude. Evidences were given that, above a threshold, the SPM actions led to the anodization. To explain patterning the nanoprotrusions, phase transitions in carbon due to local heating of the material were proposed [3]. However, the variety in reactions of carbon materials under the electrical field actions is still far from understanding, From this point of view, it seems important to compare the character of nanomodifications in the wellconducting and poorly conducting DLC films...|$|E
