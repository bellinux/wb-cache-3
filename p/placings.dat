5|$|The race {{included}} three individual classifications {{and a team}} classification. The {{most important of these}} was the general classification. This was calculated by adding up each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Bonus seconds were awarded for top-three <b>placings</b> in each stage (10 seconds for the first rider, 6 seconds for the second, 4 seconds for the third) and for <b>placings</b> in intermediate sprints (3 seconds for the first rider, 2 seconds for the second, 1 second for the third). The rider with the lowest cumulative time after taking bonus seconds into account was the leader of the classification and was awarded a blue and yellow jersey. (Blue and yellow are colours traditionally associated with Yorkshire.) The winner of the general classification was considered the winner of the race.|$|E

Though he was outclassed by the race's truly elite riders, particularly so by Giro champion Alberto Contador, he finished the race in fourth place overall, easily the best final placing in a Grand Tour in the team's history.

40|$|The study {{concentrates}} on voluntary organizations {{and participation in}} them. In particular voluntary sectors in Nordic societies are the point of interest. The study sets out to trace the varied discussions on voluntary organizations, third sector, and civil society. Based on a review of theoretical discussions, a general theory of voluntary organizations is developed. The theory includes social origins of voluntary organizations, their place and functions in the society, and explanation of participation in voluntary organizations. Special attention is directed to the dialectic relationship of voluntary organizations and social class. Also the interdependent relationship of voluntary organizations with the pub-lic sector receives due attention. Ordinary organization theory, what goes on inside the organizations, is {{to a large degree}} left outside discussion. This study has no independent empirical part. However, Nordic countries are used as a ´case´ for the testing of the theoretical discussion. Last chapter before conclusions presents some data on voluntary organization in the Nordic countries, which is then reflected on the general theory. Voluntary organizations can be approached from basically three perspectives: (1) as civil society, (2) as third sector, and (3) as general social activity. The approach on this study is mainly from the civil society and third sector perspectives. Important influences {{in the development of the}} theory con-cerning the civil society perspective have been Martti Siisiäinen and Norwegian researchers Per Selle, Stein Kuhnle and Kurt Klaudi Klausen. In the third sector perspective major influence has been the American initiated comparative international research project that is lead by Lester M. Salamon and Helmut K. Anheier. The project research in Finland is directed by Voitto Helander. The study starts with a definition of voluntary organizations and other related concepts such as social movements and the third sector. Voluntary organizations are defined as formal private organizations that do not aim at profit making and that are based on voluntary participation. The picture on voluntary sector that is outlined in the study is to a large degree positive. Voluntary organizations play several important social functions. First of all, they contribute to proper functioning and the stability of the democratic political system. They mediate between private interests and the political system. They also form an intermediate level between the individual and the society. By integrating people into the society they contribute to the general stability of the social system as a whole. Voluntary organizations are also an alternative to public sector and the markets. They produce collective goods and services that these for some reason are not able to provide or provide them in a unsatisfactory or insufficient manner. Still further, voluntary organizations are a central factor in the construction and reconstruction of social classifications, such as class. Participation in voluntary organizations is divided into active and passive participation. ´Passive participation´ equals passive membership. Voluntary participation is always an individual decision based on individual needs and interests but it is often affected by social and system level issues. Through socialization individuals acquire attitudes that are more or less favourable to participation, and social networks are a central channel through which individuals join organizations. On the other hand, system level structural differences and political traditions affect participation levels. Structural opportunities for participation vary significantly across social systems and across time. Nordic countries have some of the highest levels of memberships in voluntary organizations. The present day voluntary sector is rooted deeply in the social movements of nineteenth century. In addition what is common to Nordic voluntary sectors is that they have relatively low participation rates compared to high membership, their voluntary social sector is relatively weak, and voluntary organizations are closely affiliated with the state but have in any case retained relative autonomy. One important observation is that the position of voluntary organizations seems to be changing. The end of the industrial society, globalization, crisis of the welfare state, and the growing individual orientation all have affected the voluntary sector and continue to have effect in the future. It seems that voluntary organizations as formal organizations are loosing some of their centrality in democratic participation. On the other hand, their importance in recreation and general social activity has increased. It also seems likely that their role in welfare production is growing. At least they provide a potential alternative for the states struggling with costly welfare regimes. 1. INTRODUCTION 8 Research questions 11 Structure of the paper 11 2.
