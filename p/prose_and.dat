5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history). While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.|$|E

5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> style.|$|E
5|$|From 1885 {{until his}} death in 1908 his work was {{dominated}} by <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> poems. The 1895 prose text Der Schmetterling contains autobiographical accounts. Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 Franz Sternbald's Wanderungen. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics and form of narration.|$|E

5|$|Kavirajamarga (850) by King Amoghavarsha I is the {{earliest}} available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada, {{though it is}} evident from this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries.

The book refers to early Kannada <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> poetry writers such as Durvinita, perhaps the 6th-century monarch of Western Ganga Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Lady Grange's {{father was}} convicted of murder and she {{is known to have}} had a violent temper; {{initially}} her absence seems to have caused little comment. News of her plight eventually reached her home town of Edinburgh and an unsuccessful rescue attempt was undertaken by her lawyer, Thomas Hope of Rankeillor. She died in captivity, after being in effect imprisoned for over 13 years. Her life has been remembered in poetry, <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> plays.|$|E
5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on {{the opposition}} of <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates. The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between {{the creation of a}} poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.|$|E
5|$|The artistic {{workshops}} {{established by}} Æthelwold reached {{a high standard}} of craftsmanship in manuscript illustration, sculpture and gold and silver, and were influential both in England and on the Continent.

His Winchester school {{played an important role}} in creating the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language, and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer.|$|E

5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E

The life of Rishabhanatha is also detailed in Mahapurana of Jinasena, Trisasti-salaka-purusa-caritra by the scholar Hemachandra, Kalpa Sutra a Jain text containing the biographies of the Jain Tirthankaras, and Jambudvipa-prajnapti.|$|E
5|$|Writing Kannada {{literature}} in native metres was first popularised {{by the court}} poets. These metres were the sangatya, compositions sung {{to the accompaniment of}} a musical instrument; shatpadi, six-line verses; ragale, lyrical compositions in blank verse; and tripadi, three-line verses. However, Jain writers continued to use the traditional champu, composed of <b>prose</b> <b>and</b> verse. Important literary contributions in Kannada were made not only by court poets but also by noblemen, commanders, ministers, ascetics and saints associated with monasteries.|$|E
