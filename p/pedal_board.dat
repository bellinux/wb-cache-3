25|$|Carlos Santana's {{distinctive}} guitar tone {{is produced}} by PRS Santana signature guitars plugged into multiple amplifiers. The amps consist of a Mesa Boogie Mark I, Dumble Overdrive Reverb and more recently a Bludotone amplifier. Santana compares the tonal qualities of each amplifier {{to that of a}} singer producing head/nasal tones, chest tones, and belly tones. A three-way amp switcher is employed on Carlos's <b>pedal</b> <b>board</b> to enable him to switch between amps. Often the unique tones of each amplifier are blended together, complementing each other producing a richer tone.|$|E
500|$|Clusters {{were also}} used on the organ, where they proved more {{versatile}} (or their composers more imaginative). Their most frequent use on this instrument was to evoke the sound of thunder, but also to portray sounds of battle, storms at sea, earthquakes, and Biblical scenes such as {{the fall of the}} walls of Jericho and visions of the apocalypse. The noisy sound nevertheless remained a special sound effect, and was not integrated into the general texture of the music. The earliest examples of [...] "organ thunder" [...] are from descriptions of improvisations by Abbé Vogler {{in the last quarter of}} the 18th century. His example was soon imitated by Justin Heinrich Knecht (Die durch ein Donerwetter [...] unterbrochne Hirtenwonne, 1794), Michel Corrette (who employed a length of wood on the <b>pedal</b> <b>board</b> and his elbow on the lowest notes of the keyboard during some improvisations), and also in composed works by Guillaume Lasceux (Te Deum: [...] "Judex crederis", 1786), Sigismond Neukomm (A Concert on a Lake, Interrupted by a Thunderstorm), Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély (Scène pastorale, 1867), Jacques Vogt (Fantaisie pastorale et orage dans les Alpes, ca. 1830), and Jules Blanc (La procession, 1859). The most notable 19th-composer to use such organ clusters was Giuseppe Verdi. The storm music which opens his opera Otello (1887) includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that is also the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture.|$|E

500|$|When Liszt {{started writing}} symphonic poems, [...] "he {{had very little}} {{experience}} in handling an orchestra ... {{his knowledge of the}} technique of instrumentation was defective and he had as yet composed hardly anything for the orchestra." [...] For these reasons he relied first on his assistants August Conradi and Joachim Raff to fill the gaps in his knowledge and find his [...] "orchestral voice". Raff, [...] "a gifted composer with an imaginative grasp of the orchestra", offered close assistance to Liszt. Also helpful were the virtuosi present at that time in the Weimarian Court orchestra, such as trombonist Moritz Nabich, harpist Jeanne Pohl, concertmaster Joseph Joachim and violinist Edmund Singer. [...] " [...] mixed daily with these musicians, and their discussions must have been filled with 'shop talk.'" [...] Both Singer and cellist Bernhard Cossmann were widely experienced orchestral players who probably knew the different instrumental effects a string section could produceknowledge that Liszt would have found invaluable, and about which he might have had many discussions with the two men. With such a range of talent from which to learn, Liszt may have actually mastered orchestration reasonably quickly. By 1853, he felt he no longer needed Raff's assistance and their professional association ended in 1856. Also, in 1854 Liszt received a specially designed instrument called a [...] "piano-organ" [...] from the firm of Alexandre and fils in Paris. This huge instrument, a combination of piano and organ, was basically a one-piece orchestra that contained three keyboards, eight registers, a <b>pedal</b> <b>board</b> and a set of pipes that reproduced the sounds of all the wind instruments. With it, Liszt could try out various instrumental combinations at his leisure as a further aid for his orchestration.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, a revolutionary change was {{occurring}} in the techniques of French organ performance. [...] The German organist Adolf Hesse (1809–1863), a student of Bach's biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel, had demonstrated in 1844 in Paris the pedal technique which (together with a German-style <b>pedal</b> <b>board)</b> made the performance of Bach's works possible. [...] This was totally {{outside the scope of}} the kind of playing which Franck had learned from Benoist at the Conservatoire; most French organs did not have the <b>pedal</b> <b>board</b> notes required for such work, and even France's own great classical organ tradition dating from the period of the Couperins was at that time neglected in favour of the art of improvisation. [...] Hesse's performances might have been treated simply as a short sensation for their dazzling virtuosity, but that Hesse's pupil Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens (1823–1881) came to Paris in 1852 and again in 1854. [...] Lemmens was then professor of organ at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, and was not only a virtuoso performer of Bach but a developer of organ teaching methods with which all organists could learn to play with precision, clarity, and legato phrasing. [...] Franck appeared on the same inaugural concert program as Lemmens in 1854, much admiring not only the classic interpretation of Bach but also the rapidity and evenness of Lemmens's pedal work. Léon Vallas states that Franck, pianist before he was organist, [...] "never wholly acquired the legato style himself"; nevertheless he realized the expansion of organ style made possible by the introduction of such techniques and set about the task of mastering them.|$|E
2500|$|When {{performing}} live, he uses {{banks of}} Vox AC30 amplifiers keeping some amps with only guitar {{and others with}} all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay1, Delay2. On his <b>pedal</b> <b>board,</b> May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer {{that allows him to}} choose which amps are active. He uses a BOSS pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in [...] "In The Lap of The Gods" [...] (Live at Wembley '86) or [...] "Hammer to Fall" [...] (slow version played live with P.Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser ("We Will Rock You", [...] "We Are the Champions", [...] "Keep Yourself Alive", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in [...] "Brighton Rock".|$|E
5000|$|From 1959 to 1962, Herrick held {{an organ}} {{scholarship}} at Exeter College, Oxford, {{where he studied}} music. Following this, he obtained a Boult scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music. His interests expanded to the harpsichord. 'The harpsichord had also fascinated me, and Millicent Silver became my professor ... From a historical point of view, of course, everything about her approach was wrong. But the experience of working with her gave me a vivid taste of an unknown world.'

5000|$|Rob Halford {{referred}} to Turbo as the [...] "love/hate Judas Priest album". In 2008 he told Kerrang!: [...] The only agenda we've {{ever had in}} Priest was to really give every album its own life and I think we've achieved that on everything from Rocka Rolla up to the new one, Nostradamus. That said, {{if ever there was}} a controversial record in terms of what people might have expected from us, it's Turbo. It was the fact that we moved into a different atmosphere, but that's where we were at that particular time. Some of the technological advances like the <b>pedal</b> <b>boards</b> that Glenn and KK used were giving us options for different sounds and experimentation. Personally I think there are still some great tracks on that album ... It's one of the recordings that divide opinion.|$|R
50|$|Boss's line of compact pedals {{began in}} 1977 {{with the release}} of six pedals, all of them discontinued: an {{overdrive}} pedal (OD-1), a phaser pedal (PH-1), a parametric equalizer called the Spectrum (SP-1), a 6-band graphic equalizer (GE-6), a compressor pedal (CS-1) and an automatic wah pedal (TW-1). The Boss DS-1 was released the next year, in 1978. Their first compact chorus pedal (CE-2) came in 1979, and their first flanger pedal (BF-2) in 1980. In 1983 Boss released the DD-2 Digital Delay, the first mass-produced digital delay in a compact pedal format. The Metal Zone (MT-2) was released in 1991. In 1992 Boss released nine new pedals, including the Turbo Distortion (DS-2).

5000|$|Mendelssohn's eighth visit {{occurred}} in 1842 after the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne. Her husband Prince Albert was a keen organist and, under his influence, {{the music of}} Bach started to be performed at royal concerts. On the second of his two invitations to Buckingham Palace, Mendelssohn improvised on Albert's organ and accompanied the queen in two songs by Fanny and himself. Between these two visits, he once more performed the St Anne prelude and fugue, this time before an audience of 3,000 in Exeter Hall in a concert organized by the Sacred Harmonic Society. In London there were few church organs with German <b>pedal</b> <b>boards</b> going down to CC: those which did included St. Paul's Cathedral, Christ Church, Newgate and St. Peter's, Cornhill, where Mendelssohn frequently performed solo recitals. During his last visit in 1847, he once more entertained Victoria and Albert in Buckingham Palace in May before playing {{a few days later}} the prelude and fugue on the name of [...] "BACH" [...] BWV 898 on the barely functional organ in Hanover Square Rooms during one of the Ancient Concerts organized by Prince Albert, with William Gladstone in the audience.|$|R
