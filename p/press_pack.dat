500|$|In an {{interview}} in the <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> for the production, Lyndhurst described Freddie Robdal as [...] "a villain – charming, but nasty", and comparing him to Rodney, said that: [...] "They're from two entirely different suitcases as far as I'm concerned. I didn't want to bring into it anything that I'd already done with Rodney and fortunately there wasn't any opportunity to do so. They're like chalk and cheese." [...] Speaking about the 19-day filming schedule and the [...] "not great" [...] budget, he also told Michael Deacon of The Daily Telegraph that: ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2008, The Washington Post ran a 13-part series billed, in part, as [...] "a tale of the tabloid and {{mainstream}} <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> journalism that helped derail the investigation". The two investigative reporters behind the Post series, Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz, wrote a book detailing their investigation. The book, Finding Chandra, was published in May 2010. Commentators, including The Washington Post Metro reporter Robert Pierre, wrote that emphasis on a glamorous white murder victim, when [...] "about 200 people are killed in this city every year, most of them black and male", was [...] "absolutely absurd and dare I say, racist, at its core".|$|E
50|$|The Ewo Yuen <b>Press</b> <b>Packing</b> Company, {{also known}} as the Ewo <b>Press</b> <b>Packing</b> Company was {{established}} in Shanghai in 1907 and owned jointly by Jardines and a Chinese partner. When the partner retired in 1919, Jardines became sole proprietors of a company with total floor space of , which provided a normal annual output of 40,000 to 50,000 bales - quantities that doubled during peak years. Items packed included raw cotton, cotton yarn, waste silk, wool, hides, goatskins, and other commodities for which <b>press</b> <b>packing</b> for shipment or storage was suitable. The firm also offered rooms to the public for use in the sorting, grading, and storage of all types of cargo. The plant was situated near the mouth of the Soochow Creek, an important transport route at the time providing access to the interior of China or to Shanghai harbour for exports.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, Jardines built cotton mills, a <b>press</b> <b>packing</b> plant, and a brewery in Shanghai while {{expanding}} into Africa, America, and Australia. When war came to China in 1937, the firm suffered heavily both in Hong Kong and in mainland China.|$|R

500|$|Three {{members of}} the Tapas Seven—Fiona Payne, Russell O'Brien and Rachael Oldfield—said they had seen Murat outside {{apartment}} 5A shortly after the disappearance, as did an Ocean Club nanny and two British holidaymakers, one a barrister {{and the other a}} businesswoman. This would not have been surprising considering how close Murat lived to 5A, but he and his mother said he had been at home all evening. The McCann circle was clearly suspicious of Murat: one of the McCann's supporters offered Richard Bilton, a BBC reporter, [...] "exclusive access to any new developments in the case" [...] if Bilton would report back what the <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> was saying about Murat.|$|E
500|$|A <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> was {{distributed}} to the media prior to its release to promote the album. The centerpiece of the pack was {{a copy of the}} Billy Idol's Cyberpunk custom stickered 3½" [...] floppy disk, which was housed in a custom multi-coloured folder with artist and title logo on the front and contact information on the back. The pack included a 5-page version of the biography in the diskette, for the benefit of any journalist who lacked the equipment to operate the floppy disk. Also included in the pack were three black-and-white publicity photographs. Two pictures of Idol were taken by Peter Gravelle and the other was a digitally edited image of Idol as he appeared in the blendo video, [...] "Heroin".|$|E

50|$|The {{proposal}} was {{to bypass the}} entire process of making paper and impregnating individual sheets, to be subsequently laminated. Instead, Aldershof proposed making a thick paste of cellulose powder and phenolic resin, to form the core in a single piece prior to curing. The melamine-impregnated cover sheets would be laid atop that, in forming the <b>press</b> <b>packs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pucca {{was also}} {{licensed}} out to Warner Bros. Consumer Products (WBCP) in 2009. Utilizing this, WBCP started a promotional activity on Valentine's Day in France and Italy, where [...] "flowers and Pucca <b>press</b> <b>packs</b> {{were sent to}} key journalists." [...] A greater amount of advertising has also been started throughout the regions at various trade shows and there are currently plans to expand this to include shows in Germany and Spain.|$|R

50|$|One more {{prototype}} {{was produced}} in 1928, and then the big moment finally arrived: on August 10, the first camera went into series production. Altogether, 14 units were made that year. Then, at 11am on Monday, 11 December, selected journalists were invited to {{a press conference in}} the festively decorated production area. Paul Franke put together <b>press</b> <b>packs</b> for the occasion, which led one magazine to publish a test report without ever actually handling the camera. Although Franke had forgotten to prepare sample photographs to distribute to the press, he neatly avoided this oversight by distributing empty, labelled cartons around the building, just for show.|$|R
5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with girls handing out <b>press</b> <b>packs</b> {{and a variety}} of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|R

5000|$|Within the {{biography}} {{section of the}} custom floppy disk included with the <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> edition of the Cyberpunk album, the song was described by Mark Frauenfelder: [...] "Here's a prayer for the tomorrow people and power junkies.

50|$|SMA {{is mixed}} {{and placed in}} the same plant as that used with {{conventional}} hot mix. In batch plants, the fibre additive is added direct to the pugmill using individually wrapped <b>press</b> <b>packs</b> or bulk dispensing equipment. Mixing times may be extended ensure that fibre is homogeneously distributed throughout the mix and temperatures controlled in order to avoid overheating or damage to the fibre. In drum plants, particular care must be taken to ensure that both the additional filler content and fibre additive are incorporated into the mixture without excessive losses through the dust extraction system. Filler systems that add filler directly into the drum rather than aggregate feed are preferred. Pelletised fibres may be added through systems designed for addition of recycled materials, but a more effective means is addition through a special delivery line that is combined with the bitumen delivery, so that the fibre is captured by bitumen at the point of addition to the mixture.|$|R

5000|$|Mr. Koo {{was at the}} time, aged 30, a Chinese Manager in the [...] "EWO Hong", {{better known}} as Jardine, Matheson & Company. The idea came to him when, as a manager, he was {{recruiting}} young apprentice workers for the EWO <b>Press</b> and <b>Packing</b> Company. Well over 100 secondary students, in their early teens, applied for four vacancies of this lowly paid, menial job. Many of them had excellent school reports, but {{had to give up}} education to seek work to support their family.|$|R
50|$|The {{publication}} of the report was {{seen by many as}} the nadir of the 1990s Conservative governments of the UK. Prior to the report's publication, those ministers who were criticised were given the opportunity to comment and request revisions. The 1,806-page report was published, along with a <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> which included a few relatively positive extracts from the report presented as if representative of the entire report, at 3:30pm. Given a then largely pro-government press, this proved effective at stalling an extensive analysis in the media.|$|E

The band has also been compared to bands such as My Bloody Valentine, The Breeders, PJ Harvey, and Mazzy Star although the band does not completely agree with some of the comparisons and Hardy has shown herself to be especially confused by Breeders comparisons. It is suggested by Hardy and another journalist that most articles that have been written about Giant Drag are re-wordings of their <b>press</b> <b>pack</b> (which compared them to such bands).|$|E

According to Broadcast, the show aimed to [...] "shed light on a world of alcoholic HR bosses, power-crazed managers and sexually unfettered PAs".|$|E
