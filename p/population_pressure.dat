5|$|The {{sheer size}} and {{complexity}} of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other, more tangible closed systems. For example, he likens human existence on Earth— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this <b>population</b> <b>pressure,</b> by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E

25|$|After the {{desertification}} of the Sahara, settlement became {{concentrated in}} the Nile Valley, where numerous sacral chiefdoms appeared. The regions with the largest <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> were in the Nile Delta region of Lower Egypt, in Upper Egypt, and also along {{the second and third}} cataracts of the Dongola reach of the Nile in Nubia. This <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of bureaucracies among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was Ta-Seti, founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} {{university}} education initiated in the 1960s responded to <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and the belief}} that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In 1961 the college was renamed the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus. In 1974 it became the independent University of Regina.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} {{university}} education initiated in the 1960s responded to <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and the belief}} that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.

50|$|The {{original}} {{abundance of}} land resulted in low density urban development of Preston's former farmland, however <b>population</b> <b>pressures</b> and Preston's locality {{with respect to}} the Melbourne CBD has led to a growing tendency to medium to high-density urban redevelopment.|$|R
50|$|Faced with <b>population</b> <b>pressures</b> {{from the}} Thule and other {{surrounding}} groups, {{such as the}} Algonquian and Siouan to the south, the Tuniit gradually receded. They were thought to have become completely extinct as a people by about 1400 or 1500.|$|R
25|$|The {{policy of}} {{university}} education initiated in the 1960s responded to <b>population</b> <b>pressure.</b> In 1967, {{two of the}} colleges that {{had been part of}} the University of Manitoba were given university status by the provincial government. United College, which had been formed by the merging of Wesley College and Manitoba College, became the University of Winnipeg, and Brandon College became Brandon University.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of this century, {{professional}} education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.|$|E
25|$|Southeast of the Drakensberg {{mountains}} lived Nguni-speaking peoples (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, and Ndebele). They too {{engaged in}} state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later {{became known as}} the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the Zulu Kingdom. They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.|$|E
50|$|Following this notification, Maharashtra state {{government}} converted 19 CTs {{in the state}} to statutory ULBs. These 19 CTs are in close proximity to the town of Pune and this conversion is expected to lessen the infrastructure and <b>population</b> <b>pressures</b> on the town.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to religion, {{the economy was}} also a motivator in the association's foundation. The Highland Clearances, crop failures, and <b>population</b> <b>pressures</b> in industrialised urban centres all created conditions that, by the mid-nineteenth century, made emigration seem attractive to many poorer Scots.|$|R
25|$|Supported by the United States, Magsaysay {{was elected}} {{president}} in 1953 on a populist platform. He promised sweeping economic reform, and made progress in land reform by promoting the resettlement of poor people in the Catholic north into traditionally Muslim areas. Though this relieved <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> in the north, it heightened religious hostilities. Nevertheless, he was extremely popular with the common people, and his death in an airplane crash in March 1957 dealt a serious blow to national morale.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} {{university}} education initiated in the 1960s responded to <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and the belief}} that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In addition, the single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary. By 1966, the University of Calgary had been established as an autonomous institution.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} theories of early and primary state formation is the hydraulic hypothesis, which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects. The theory was most significantly detailed Karl August Wittfogel's argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different agricultural producers would join together in response to <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the 1980s <b>population</b> <b>pressures</b> and the {{availability}} of cheaper land resulted in the decline of agriculture in the Woodcrest area.

25|$|The {{policy of}} {{university}} education initiated in the 1960s responded to <b>population</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and the belief}} that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.|$|E
25|$|Territorial {{expansion}} of the Luhya people (the western neighbours of the Terik) has strained Terik-Luhyia relations during the last decades. Luhya are felt {{to be a threat}} to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The {{expansion of}} the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of <b>population</b> <b>pressure.</b> This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' as they call it. Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because they were afraid of the Luhya.|$|E
25|$|Surrey {{had little}} {{political}} or economic significance in the Middle Ages. It was not the main power-base of any important aristocratic family, nor the seat of a bishopric. Its agricultural wealth was limited by the infertility of most of its soils, while urban development, excepting the London suburb of Southwark, was sapped by the overshadowing predominance of London and {{by the lack of}} direct access to the sea. <b>Population</b> <b>pressure</b> in the 12th and 13th centuries initiated the gradual clearing of the Weald, the forest spanning the borders of Surrey, Sussex and Kent, which had hitherto been left undeveloped due to the difficulty of farming on its heavy clay soil.|$|E
50|$|Assarting {{has existed}} since Mesolithic times and often it {{relieved}} <b>population</b> <b>pressures.</b> During the 13th century, assarting was very active, but decreased with {{environmental and economic}} challenges in the 14th century. The Black Death in the late 1340s depopulated the countryside and many formerly assarted areas returned to woodland.|$|R
50|$|While it {{is likely}} that <b>population</b> <b>pressures</b> caused {{tensions}} between various groups, the primary force that seems to have driven unity or division among tribes and family groups is geophysical: on low islands, where communications are essentially unimpeded, there {{does not appear to have}} developed any widely observable incidence of conflict.|$|R
