40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>area</b> <b>pad</b> layout method to e ciently reduce the space required for interconnection pads and pad drivers. Unlike peripheral <b>pads,</b> <b>area</b> <b>pads</b> use {{only the top}} metal layer and therefore allow active circuitry to be laid out underneath. With identical functional elements grouped together, a group of pad drivers share the same well and can be placed tightly together. The use of silicided di usion reduces the well contact to di usion contact spacing requirement. By taking advantage of this spacing requirement and using serpentine gate layout, a driver's size can be e ectively reduced without reducing the driving capacity. An embedded multicomputer router interface chip has been implemented using these techniques and has achieved 554 pads in a 9 mm 6 mm chip with a 0. 8 m single-poly 3 -metal N-well CMOS process. 1...|$|R

50|$|They {{can come}} in many {{different}} configurations {{from that of a}} pure race boat to that of a recreational craft. A padded v-hull is very similar in basic shape to the popular v-hull which simply forms a vee when looking {{at the back of the}} watercraft. The difference in design with the padded v-hull is that where the point of the vee would be on the bottom of a plain v-hull there is a flat area ranging from six to ten inches wide. When looking at a padded v-hull from underneath, the front of the hull shows a vee which slowly starts to taper and blend back to the flat <b>pad</b> <b>area.</b> This back portion of the hull is the pad and it will protrude from the vee surface one-half to one-full inch. The pad more efficiently provides hydrodynamic lift due to very low deadrise planing surface, compared to the vee hull lifting surfaces. This highly efficient lift helps to unwet the less efficient vee sections hull which reduces drag tremendously. It uses hydrodynamic pressure to ride higher in the water. As the boats speed increases, water pressure builds on the flat surface of the pad causing the boat to ride higher in the water and ultimately the boat will be riding on just the <b>pad</b> <b>area.</b> At low speeds these hulls ride and handle just the same as a regular v-hull of the same size and weight. Once speeds increase the padded hull will out accelerate and have a higher top speed than a plain v-hull since the padded hull has less drag once speeds increase.|$|E

The foot of a tokay bears approximately 3600 tetrads of setae per mm2, or 14,400 setae per mm2 (Schleich and Kastle 1986; pers- obs-)- Consequently, a single seta should produce an average force of 6-2 pN, and an average shear stress of 0-090 N mm−l (0.9 atm). However, single setae proved both much less sticky and much more sticky than predicted by whole animal measurements, under varying experimental conditions, implying that attachment and detachment in gecko setae are mechanically controlled (Autumn et al. 2000)." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, as {{the vehicle}} moves another loss {{mechanism}} comes into play. This {{is due to the}} skin friction between the lift air and the ground below it. Some of the lift air [...] "sticks" [...] to the running surface, and is dragged out from under the pad as it moves. The amount of air that is lost though this mechanism is dependent on vehicle speed, surface roughness and the total area of the lift pads.
