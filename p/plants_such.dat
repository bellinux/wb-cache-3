Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody <b>plants,</b> <b>such</b> as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E

5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other <b>plants,</b> <b>such</b> as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} English gardens, {{this one is}} at its best in May and June, when the magnolias are in bloom and luxurious <b>plants,</b> <b>such</b> as peonies and alliums, are flowering. An ongoing {{initiative}} is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native <b>plants</b> <b>such</b> as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that giant North American fruits of <b>plants</b> <b>such</b> as the Osage-orange, Kentucky coffeetree and honey locust evolved in tandem with now-extinct American megafauna such as mammoths and other proboscideans, {{since there are no}} extant endemic herbivores able to ingest these fruits and disperse their seeds. Introduced cattle and horses have since taken over this ecological role.|$|E
