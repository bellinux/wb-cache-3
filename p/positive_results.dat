5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false <b>positive</b> <b>results.</b> Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce <b>positive</b> <b>results</b> for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E

30|$|The {{negative}} cost saving per second {{is actually a}} <b>positive</b> <b>result,</b> because the handling time for this scenario is lower than for the standard situation, meaning that the cost savings (<b>positive</b> <b>result)</b> are divided by a negative extra handling time (i.e. less handling time).|$|R
5|$|Costs {{increase}} with dementia severity {{and the presence}} of behavioural disturbances, and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care.

5000|$|Cervical Compression Test, {{a variant}} of Spurling's test, is {{performed}} by laterally flexing the patient's head and placing downward pressure on it. Neck or shoulder pain on the ipsilateral side (i.e. the side to which the head is flexed) indicates a <b>positive</b> <b>result</b> for this test. However {{it should be noted}} that a <b>positive</b> test <b>result</b> is not necessarily a <b>positive</b> <b>result</b> for spondylosis and as such additional testing is required.|$|R
50|$|Fehling's {{test can}} be used as a generic test for monosaccharides and other {{reducing}} sugars (e.g., maltose). It will give a <b>positive</b> <b>result</b> for aldose monosaccharides (due to the oxidisable aldehyde group) but also for ketose monosaccharides, as they are converted to aldoses by the base in the reagent, and then give a <b>positive</b> <b>result.</b>|$|R

In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan.

5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the International Society of Nephrology (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with <b>positive</b> <b>results.</b> Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks could potentially injure or kill staff and make equipment unusable.|$|E

However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer was ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6million in consultancy fees with no <b>positive</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E
5|$|Favre and the Packers {{continued}} posting <b>positive</b> <b>results</b> {{through the}} next few seasons. Through the 2004 season, the Packers had the longest streak of non-losing seasons (13) in the NFL, despite an 8–8 record under head coach Ray Rhodes, a 9–7 season under head coach Mike Sherman, and no playoff berths in either 1999 or 2000. The streak ended in 2005, with the Packers finishing with a 4-12 record.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{types of}} control are {{negative and positive}} controls, and both are found in {{many different types of}} experiments.

5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported <b>positive</b> <b>results</b> in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with <b>positive</b> <b>results</b> at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
5|$|In {{extreme cases}} of {{intractable}} CSF leak, a surgical lumbar drain has been used. This procedure {{is believed to}} decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure and volume. This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting the healing of dural tears by lowering the pressure and volume in the dura. This procedure has led to <b>positive</b> <b>results</b> leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year.|$|E

25|$|TST (tuberculin skin test) {{positive}} {{is measured}} by size of induration. The size of the induration {{considered to be a}} <b>positive</b> <b>result</b> depends on risk factors.

High-risk groups include recent contacts, those with HIV, those with chest radiograph with fibrotic changes, organ transplant recipients, and those with immunosuppression.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, William Gray noticed a trend of low {{hurricane}} {{activity in the}} North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and <b>positive</b> <b>results</b> led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel {{to an increase in}} major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence.|$|E

They believe the driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van.
