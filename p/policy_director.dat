[...] Similarly, the <b>policy</b> <b>director</b> of the Democratic Leadership Council says Satin's book [...] "ultimately places him in the sturdy tradition of 'idealistic' American reformers who think smart and principled people unencumbered by political constraints can change everything." ...|$|E

500|$|Regier and Khalidi {{speculate}} {{that the use of}} scare quotes by both Rosen and Sullivan suggest that they are using a term not familiar to them, something they may have adapted from a foreign language. Since both of them were academics specializing in Middle Eastern studies, it could be presumed that they had at least a reading knowledge of Arabic and were familiar with the term's use in Arabic media in the region, Regier and Khalidi argued. The two further speculated that Rosen, who often took strongly pro-Israel positions and later became <b>policy</b> <b>director</b> of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, may have also perhaps picked up the term from Israeli media and scholars, as the [...] "street" [...] terminology for popular opinion is also used sometimes in Hebrew.|$|E
