50|$|Screen {{frequency}} {{is determined}} by the type of paper the image is printed on. An absorbent paper surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets spread (dot gain)—so requires a more open <b>printing</b> <b>screen.</b> Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality, as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained. This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency. For example, printing on an uncoated paper stock often limits <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> frequency to no more than 120 lpi, therefore, a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240 ppi.|$|E

50|$|Mark quality {{depends on}} a variety of factors, {{including}} the substrate used, marking speed, laser spot size, beam overlap, materials thickness, and laser parameters. Laser bonding materials may be applied by various methods, including a brush on technique, spraying, pad <b>printing,</b> <b>screen</b> printing, roll coating, tape, and others.|$|E
5000|$|PPI {{can also}} {{describe}} the resolution, in pixels, {{of an image}} file. A 100×100 pixel image printed in a 1 inch square has a resolution of 100 pixels per inch. Used this way, the measurement is meaningful when printing an image. It has become commonplace to refer to PPI as DPI, even though PPI refers to input resolution. Industry standard, good quality photographs usually require 300 pixels per inch, at 100% size, when printed onto coated paper stock, using a <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> of 150 lines per inch (lpi). This delivers a quality factor of 2, which is optimum. The lowest acceptable quality factor is considered 1.5, which equates to printing a 225 ppi image using a 150 lpi screen onto coated paper.|$|E
5000|$|The use of raster {{scanning}} in television was proposed in 1880 by French engineer Maurice Leblanc. The concept of {{raster scanning}} was {{inherent in the}} original mechanical disc-scanning television patent of Paul Nipkow in 1884. The term raster was used for a halftone <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> pattern as early as 1894. Similar terminology was used in German at least from 1897; Eder writes of [...] "die Herstellung von Rasternegativen für Zwecke der Autotypie" [...] (the production of raster negatives for halftones). Max Dieckmann and Gustav Glage {{were the first to}} produce actual raster images on a cathode-ray tube (CRT); they patented their techniques in Germany in 1906. [...] It has not been determined whether they used the word raster in their patent or other writings.|$|E

50|$|The set of {{procedures}} used {{in any particular}} prepress environment {{is known as a}} workflow. Workflows vary, depending on the printing process (e.g., letterpress, offset, digital <b>printing,</b> <b>screen</b> printing), the final product (books, newspapers, product packaging), and the implementation of specific prepress technologies. For example, {{it is not uncommon to}} use a computer and image-setter to generate film which is then stripped and used to expose the plate in a vacuum frame; this workflow is hybrid because separation and halftoning are carried out via digital processes while the exposure of the plate is an analog one. That demonstrates that the borders around the prepress are very fluid. Furthermore, - depending on the printing method and the print product - the elements of the prepress of a graphic print production can differ from case to case. This circumstance requires a management of the workflow. It is necessary to manage the responsibility for each part of the workflow. That can mean that employees, who are actually responsible for other parts of the production (e.g. Layout), have to attend to parts of the prepress.|$|E
40|$|SCALE UP! is an {{exploration}} in hand-printed surface patterns {{in relation to}} scale. The aim is to make hand-printed large-scale surface patterns, by challenging {{the limitations of the}} <b>printing</b> <b>screen,</b> the fabric width and the circle as a shape; with the circle as a pattern and structure to visualise it, by colours and bleed-through. The project is based in an interest in working large-scale, in the area of screen printing. We often see printed full-width fabrics where the repeat fills the whole width. However, a possibility to take it one step further and not be limited by the width of the fabric or the size of the <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> was seen. Why be satisfied with the size of a full-width pattern and see the <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> as a frame to keep within?

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new method of position detection for a mesh-backed <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> with an alignment mark that is overlapped by mesh patterns. A circular hole is selected as an alignment mark {{so that at}} least a portion of its contour can be observed {{through the windows of}} the mesh wires. To recognize the true contour, the smallest circle enclosing binary patterns acquired with a transmitted illumination is detected. Then the mark position is calculated by approximating the recognized contour to a circle with the least square fitting. To speed up the procedure, a convex hull and the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is generated before the smallest enclosing circle detection. According to the experimental results, an accuracy of 0. 2 pixels and a processing time of 1. 0 seconds have been achieved...|$|E

We present the results achieved by printing the front side finger lines and bus bars of mono- and multi-crystalline solar cells with PTPTM technology and compare these with results of neighboring cells manufactured by state-of-the-art screen printing technology. Finger lines with high aspect ratio and uniform line shape down to 20 μm width could be printed.

40|$|Abstract: ISO 13660 (2001) {{provides}} {{definitions and}} measurement methods for line width, raggedness, large area graininess, darkness, background haze and extraneous marks. The major shortcoming of ISO 13660 (2001) is {{its inability to}} describe or address the visual significance of most measured values obtained following the proposed procedures. ISO 19751 even though in development will hopefully expand the definition of print attributes which allow for an easier implementation of the measurement. In this paper, Image quality is evaluated on minute details and characteristics that build up a print, using recommended tools and equipment. This case study is an exploratory experiment to evaluate the print quality with changing toner digital <b>printing</b> <b>screen</b> rules and resolutions.

40|$|Abstract—New {{generation}} of thin-film transistors (TFTs), where the active material is amorphous oxide, conjugated polymer, or small molecules, {{have the advantage}} of flexibility, high form factor, and large scale manufacturability through low cost pro-cessing techniques, e. g., roll-to-roll <b>printing,</b> <b>screen</b> printing. During high-throughput production using these techniques, the probability of defects being present increases with the speed of manufacturing and area of devices. Therefore a high-throughput and low cost testing technique is absolute essential to maintain high quality of final product. We report a Simultaneous Multiple Device Testing (SMuDT) approach which is up to 10 times faster and cost effective than conventional testing methods. The SMuDT approach was validated using circuit simulation and demonstrated by testing large scale indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) TFTs. A method to ‘bin ’ the tested devices using Figure of Merit was established.
