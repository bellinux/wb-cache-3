5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, {{but if the}} frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for}} the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|The show's <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Meyer is {{a former}} United States Senator who runs a failed Presidential {{campaign}} before being asked to be the winning candidate's Vice President. As Vice President, her world is kept in balance by her assistants: Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) is the Vice President's chief of staff, while Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) is Meyer's grovelling personal aide. Selina also hires Dan Egan (Reid Scott), who threatens Amy's place in the staff, and Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), a press spokesman. Meyer has no significant other, and requires that her daughter Catherine, from a past marriage, make appointments to see her.|$|E
50|$|The <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a {{separate}} purchaser could provide greater efficiency {{for the health}} system.|$|R
50|$|The {{only thing}} <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> {{properly}} inferred from these <b>premises</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not fish cannot fly, provided that dogs exist.|$|R
50|$|The {{argument}} is valid (because the conclusion is true {{based on the}} <b>premises,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the conclusion follows the premises) and since the <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> in fact true, the {{argument is}} sound.|$|R
25|$|The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a mind-altering {{technology}} has for decades, {{at the behest}} of American intelligence during the Cold War, been withheld from scrutiny. Dispensing sensitive information in the interest of enhancing civilian life, the author shares his own notes as well as those left by earlier researchers.|$|E
25|$|Philip José Farmer {{portrays a}} very {{different}} Oz in his book A Barnstormer in Oz. The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> nothing after the first book occurred—Dorothy never returned to Oz, and instead grew up, got married, and had a son. Her son, Hank Stover, is the main character, a World War I veteran flier and the titular barnstormer. While flying in his Curtiss JN-4 biplane he enters a green haze and emerges in the civil war-stricken land of Oz.|$|E
25|$|A reconstructed martial art {{necessarily}} {{rests on}} historical records, either combat manuals or pictorial representations. Martial arts reconstruction specifically does not claim an unbroken tradition of some historical martial arts. On the contrary, the <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in an unbroken tradition, styles significantly evolve over time. It {{is not necessary}} for the tradition to have been interrupted in order to reconstruct an earlier style; {{a case in point}} is classical fencing which reconstructs the sport fencing of the 19th century before it evolved into current Olympic fencing, or historical German ringen which over time developed into contemporary styles of folk wrestling. Claims of ancient martial arts which survive unchanged by unbroken tradition (e.g. as suggested by Yehoshua Sofer), do not fall under reconstruction and are by their nature unverifiable, even to the person making the claim.|$|E
5000|$|Televimsen was {{a former}} Norwegian {{television}} series which was shown from 1963 to 1968. The series was created by film producer Ivo Caprino and author Arild Feldborg. Televimsen's <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Frank Robert had returned.|$|R
5000|$|... "committee {{indicated}} {{directions in}} which to move with respect to policies of prevention, treatment, harm reduction and social reinsertion. One of our <b>premises</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> drug abusers <b>are</b> ill, not criminals, and that they need help," [...] he said.|$|R
2500|$|The {{show was}} dubbed [...] "Phobia Asylum" [...] {{that year and}} the <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> guests would <b>be</b> cured of their phobias, {{regardless}} of their nature by a radical new treatment which involved special chemically altered spider venom, and repeated exposure to the object of fear.|$|R
25|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the {{widespread}} acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind (1979). The basic <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating {{a position in the}} mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.|$|E
25|$|The state's {{ethnic groups}} {{are known for}} their unique musical styles as well as {{regional}} dances. The best known dance is the Danza de los Tlacoloteros. This originated in the Central Valleys region, and its theme is agriculture. The owners of “tlacololes” (cornfields) are called “tlacololoeros.” The basic <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these tlacololoeros chase away malevolent spirits from the crops, which are represented by naguals or fierce tigers. The dance has 15 characters. It is most often performed in places such as Chichuihualco, Taxco, Chilpancingo, Iguala and Atlixtac. Another dance that feature tigers is the Danza del Tecuano, where the animals stalk characters. This one is most often performed in Tuxpan, Ciudad Altamirano and Huitzuco. Other dances performed in the state include the Danza de los Diablos, the Danza de los Manueles, the Danza de los Gachupines, the Danza de los Siete Vicios, the Danza de los Pescados, the Danza de los Machos, the Danza de los Moros, the Danza de los Maizos, the Danza de los Zopilotes, the Danza de los Tejoneros and the Danza del Palomo de Guerrero.|$|E
500|$|According to Russell Kirk, [...] "Nor is it {{possible}} to appreciate Eliotwhether or not one agrees with himif one comes to Four Quartets with ideological blinders. Ideology, it must be remembered, is the attempt to supplant religious dogmas by political and scientistic dogmas. If one's first <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> religion must be a snare and a delusion, for instance, then it follows that Eliot becomes an enemy to be assaulted, rather than a pilgrim whose journal one may admire-even if one does not believe in the goal of that quest." ...|$|E
50|$|In May 2008, Sanford {{along with}} several other skeptics and {{scientists}} created a pilot for a TV series titled The Skeptologists. The <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> claimed experts {{in a field of}} pseudoscience or the paranormal would present their claims, which would then be investigated by the team.|$|R
50|$|The 1999 {{animated}} {{television series}} Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> aliens had <b>been</b> living among humans for ages, {{and were the}} origins {{of many of the}} creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including a clan of banshees as the main antagonist.|$|R
5000|$|The {{show was}} dubbed [...] "Phobia Asylum" [...] {{that year and}} the <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> guests would <b>be</b> cured of their phobias, {{regardless}} of their nature by a radical new treatment which involved special chemically altered spider venom, and repeated exposure to the object of fear.|$|R
500|$|Critic R.Fiore {{initially}} {{found the}} 1992 ending disappointing, but {{changed his mind}} 2012, saying the sad ending gave Ed [...] "an emotional punch that it wouldn't otherwise have". [...] Cartoonists such as Craig Thompson at first found the story off-putting, but later came to admire it. [...] Critic Douglas Wolk wrote {{that it is not}} surprising that Brown had not settled on one conclusion to the story, as that [...] "would mean some kind of narrative closure", while Eds <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "everything makes sense as a big picture eventually, but nothing can be relied on from moment to moment".|$|E
500|$|Forgotten Realms is {{the name}} of a fantasy world setting, {{described}} as a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and supernatural phenomena are quite real. The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> long ago, the Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected. As time passed, the inhabitants of planet Earth have mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world – hence the term Forgotten Realms. On the original Forgotten Realms logo, which was used until 2000, small runic letters read [...] "Herein lie the lost lands", an allusion to the connection between the two worlds.|$|E
500|$|The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Naughty Sorceress has {{captured}} and [...] "imprismed" [...] (imprisoned in a prism) the Kingdom's ruler, King Ralph XI. The ultimate {{objective of the}} game is to defeat the Naughty Sorceress and free King Ralph. In King Ralph's absence, most of the power in the Kingdom of Loathing is held by the Council of Loathing, which gives quests to characters as they increase in level, with the final quest given when the character has reached level 13 and finished the other quests. [...] Players can also unlock quests from other sources, some of which are available only after ascending.|$|E
5000|$|The program's <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> among an American family's bequests from a British {{relative}} was a butler, Higgins. Episodes [...] "focused on {{the attempts}} of the English butler {{to adjust to}} life in America and to his new employers, and of the family to adjust to having a butler." ...|$|R
50|$|The second unusual <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> as a 1943 {{advertisement}} for {{a radio station}} noted, stories dealt with the rehabilitation of criminals. The background for {{this aspect of the}} program <b>was</b> <b>that</b> before suffering amnesia, Ordway had been a criminal mastermind. Thus, he went from heading a criminal gang to helping to rehabilitate criminals.|$|R
50|$|Kings of Comedy was {{a reality}} {{television}} series broadcast made by Endemol for Channel 4. The show was presented by Russell Brand and narrated by Matthew Rudge. The <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> eight comics {{lived in a}} Big Brother-style house to try to determine whether old-school comics or the newer generation are best.|$|R
500|$|Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is {{the debut}} novel by British writer Susanna Clarke. Published in 2004, {{it is an}} {{alternative}} history set in 19th-century England {{around the time of}} the Napoleonic Wars. Its <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Centred on the relationship between these two men, the novel investigates the nature of [...] "Englishness" [...] and the boundaries between reason and unreason, Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Dane, and Northern and Southern English cultural tropes/stereotypes. It has been described as a fantasy novel, an alternative history, and a historical novel. It inverts the Industrial Revolution conception of the North-South divide in England: in this book the North is romantic and magical, rather than rational and concrete.|$|E
500|$|The show's <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Dr. Quest, {{a famous}} , investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son, Jonny Quest, adopted son Hadji Singh, {{bodyguard}} Race Bannon, Race's daughter Jessie, and pet bulldog Bandit. Real Adventures is set {{a few years}} after the classic series, making Jonny and his friends teenagers. Lawrence aimed to use [...] "existing, real phenomenon"—such as the [...] "Airstrips of Nazca, the Ruins of Teotihuacan or the possible existence of Giant Squid"—to capture audiences' curiosity. Stressing plausibility, he suggested writers cover real-world enigmas, cryptozoology, unique locales, an alien posing as the vice president, and fictional but [...] "believable" [...] mysteries. The Quests would frequently visit the virtual environment of QuestWorld, and encounter the villainous Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage. Paralyzed years prior by Race's SWAT team, Surd would try to exact revenge through technology; Rage—a former government agent left for dead on a botched mission—would try to destroy the world with nuclear terrorism.|$|E
2500|$|Rod Serling: [...] "Let's {{look at an}} {{incident}} that might happen in the future, or perhaps could have happened already. The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> contact is made by extraterrestrial beings {{with representatives of the}} United States Air Force at Holloman Air Force Base in the deserts of New Mexico".|$|E
50|$|Here Rabindranath Tagore started Patha Bhavana, {{the school}} of his ideals, whose central <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{learning}} in a natural environment would be more enjoyable and fruitful. After he received a Nobel Prize in 1913, the school was expanded into a university in 1921. By 1951, it {{had become one of}} India's central universities.|$|R
50|$|The <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{each would}} {{accommodate}} for the other's missing sense. Hamish became Andy's eyes, leading {{him when the}} pair were walking, or describing what was happening during other activities, including a cooking class. Conversely, Andy became Hamish's ears, writing down what he and others were saying so Hamish could follow the conversation.|$|R
50|$|His <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each {{repetition}} {{in learning}} increases the optimum interval {{before the next}} repetition is needed (for near-perfect retention, initial repetitions {{may need to be}} made within days, but later they can be made after years). Later research suggested that, other than the two factors Ebbinghaus proposed, higher original learning would also produce slower forgetting.|$|R
2500|$|The End of Eternity is a Hugo Award shortlisted 1955 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, with mystery and thriller {{elements}} on {{the subjects of}} time travel and social engineering. Its <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a causal loop - a type of temporal paradox in which events and their causes form a loop.|$|E
2500|$|Nefertiti {{was well}} in the {{forefront}} during her husband's reign and even depicted engaging in kingly activities such as smiting the enemies of Egypt (see image, right). [...] The core <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her prominence and attendant power in the Amarna period was almost unprecedented for a queen which makes her the most likely and most able female to succeed Akhenaten.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Gentle used an {{alternate}} history version of Carthage as a setting in her novels [...] and Ilario, A Story of the First History. In these books, Carthage {{is dominated by}} Germanic tribes, and the <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Visigoths conquered Carthage {{and set up a}} huge empire that repelled the Muslim conquest. In these novels, titles such as [...] "lord-amir" [...] and [...] "scientist-magus" [...] indicate a fusion of European and North African cultures, and Arian Christianity is the state religion.|$|E
50|$|In January 2009, {{the boys}} were in {{character}} at selected venues nationally including Massey Hall in Toronto. They performed the Ricky, Julian and Bubbles Community Service Variety Show. The <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> fulfilling court order community service and must put on a puppet show aimed at demonstrating the dangers of using alcohol and drugs.|$|R
50|$|The show {{began with}} a clip from The Today Show with Matt Lauer, talking about the Creature. The <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Universal made the film based on a real creature, and a new team of explorers were on a second {{expedition}} to investigate, the principals being Kay, Mark & David (all characters which also appeared in the original film).|$|R
50|$|The serial {{dealt with}} the struggles of lower income people in cities {{trying to make a}} living in an {{increasingly}} harsh social and economic climate. The <b>premise</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they all work and live together at the local street corner (Nukkad) and every evening they share jokes and sometimes their never-ending troubles and unfulfilled dreams with each other.|$|R
