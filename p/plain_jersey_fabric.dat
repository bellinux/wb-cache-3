40|$|ABSTRACT: Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is a white, water {{insoluble}} pigment. It {{is used in}} paints, plastics, foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Its main application on textile materials as an ultraviolet ray protecting agents. Titanium dioxide can reflect, scatter or absorb ultraviolet ray. Besides Titanium dioxide also modify the properties of fabrics. In previous research, titanium dioxide was applied mainly by padding mangle method. This paper presents an approach to observe the effect of titanium dioxide treatment 100 % cotton knitted (<b>plain</b> <b>jersey)</b> <b>fabric</b> applied by exhaustion method followed by curing and washing. The treated fabrics were then analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the tensile strength, pH value and absorbency of the treated and untreated fabrics were checked. It is found that titanium dioxide impairs the better hand feel and absorbency (wetting time) of all treated fabrics increased gradually than untreated fabrics. The treatment increases the strength and keeps the pH of the fabric in acidic medium...|$|E
40|$|People are {{increasingly}} choosing non-standard textile {{products that are}} of different features. Among these, there is a relatively rarely used knits made with dog hair. Accordingly, <b>plain</b> <b>jersey</b> <b>fabric</b> knits made from condensed yarns for the thesis research has been made. Yarns have contained Lithuanian’s most popular German blackface sheep wool and dogs (Yorkshire, Spaniel, Poodle, Shih Tzu) hair. Also, for comparison, knits made with poodle hair and PA multifilament yarns has been produced. The literature review has outlined that typical wowen fabric and knits functional properties such as thermal conductivity, air and water permeability are analyzed quite often. However, aberrant protein fibre knits are designed and analyzed more rarely. For this reason, functional properties research that regards to knits made with dog hair will evaluate the following features- thermal properties, knits fiber compositions, dependencies between knits structual parameters and functional properties. The thesis work has analyzed knits made from different dog breeds hair and different mixture yarns. The experimental results, such as structual indicators, air pearmeability, thermal conductivity indicators and thermal exhange processes were determined and evaluated. Overall, analysis has been made for 19 knits with different percentage compositions. The yarn composition influence was determined on investigated knits characteristics and knits thermal characteristics of the comparative analysis were produced. It was established {{that there is a}} relationship between analyzed knits thickness and air permeability. The thermal conductivity indicators remain stable after increasing dog hair percentage in yarn mixtures. It was also found that knits made with Spaniel dog hair have lower thermal conductivity. Knits made with Yorkshire and Spaniel hair have the best properties of thermal resistance. It was concluded, that knits thermal properties improves after adding 15 – 35 % other kind of protein fibers in to the yarn mixtures...|$|E

H 577 P ITC 2017 LiuSxxi, 172 pages :color illustrationsThe {{research}} {{progress made}} {{in the field of}} materials science and the efforts put forth by many researchers have resulted in many research works that focus on wearable electronic textiles. Nowadays, wearable electronic textiles have progressed from the research lab into the industry and subsequently commercialized. The different ways of incorporating conductive fibers and electronic components into traditional textiles have been receiving much attention due to the potentially significant commercial value. However, the industry {{does not appear to have}} the means to new knowledge and knowledge transfer. For example, the industry does not have the resources to calculate and control yarn resistance on fabrics simply based on current textile knowledge, and wearable electronic products thus cannot be further developed. Nevertheless, the results of research on such products are not significant or adequate due to the complexity of the interdisciplinary efforts required for their success. Therefore, there is a need to establish a systematic method to provide the industry with a reference source to produce wearable electronics. The relationship between different stitches and the properties of conductive materials needs to be elaborated. This study conducts a series of experiments on the resistivity of conductive knitted fabric with different knitwear structures. Based on a previous study that modeled the resistance of <b>plain</b> <b>jersey</b> <b>fabric</b> with different numbers of wales and courses, planar geometric models are established for 1 x n float and Single Pique structures. Resistive network models are developed for different external voltages to determine the resistance values of conductive knitted fabrics with different numbers of wales and courses. Corresponding experiments are carried out to verify the proposed models. The simulated results obtained through modeling agree well with the experimental data with an acceptable range of error. Finally, a comparison of jersey (knit), float and tuck stitches is carried out with the relative wales and courses. It is concluded that both float and tuck stitches could reduce the total resistance of conductive knitted fabrics, and between them, tuck structures can provide lower resistance as well as a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. On the other hand, float structures are more economical, as conductive yarn is expensive so its cost is reduced with use of float stitch as the loop length is much shorter than that of the tuck stitches. Three thermal knitwear garments are developed in the experiments to test the thermal performance to determine the optimal design from the different knitted structures. It is concluded that the thermal properties are influenced by the different knitted structures and Single Pique has the most optimal performance in terms of the heating effect among the three types of selected structures. The newly developed resistance models in this study will provide significant benefits to the commercialization of wearable electronic textiles, as well as to the apparel industry as they can now offer apparel products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional, but also have high added value.

So ensuring the required quality in a knitted fabric is a vital issue for the manufacturer. One of the major problems encountered in knitted fabric is spirality. It affects particularly single <b>jersey</b> <b>fabric</b> and presents a serious problem during garment confection and use. So controlling spirality is a basic requirement for producing quality knitted fabric.

In this work the basic single <b>jersey</b> <b>fabric,</b> i. e. <b>plain</b> <b>jersey</b> cotton <b>fabrics</b> were produced by a Hosiery knitting machine and spirality values were observed for different yarn T.
