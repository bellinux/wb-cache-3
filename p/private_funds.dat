40|$|Proposed {{cutbacks in}} {{government}} science funding have caused many {{to expect that}} the rate of scientific progress will significantly decline. Before the magnitude of the decline can be estimated, a preliminary question must be answered: what {{is the extent to which}} <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> of science may be expected to fill the gap left by the declining government funding? Using data on government and <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> of science, preliminary estimation indicates that past government funding of science has not "crowded out" <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> of science. If this finding is supported by further research, it would indicate that <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> could not be expected to replace lost federal funding of science.

5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion <b>private</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and <b>private</b> <b>funds</b> toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the number}} of U.S. {{commercial}} radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations.

In 1989 Chicago Park District allocated $150,000 to the repair project, which amount was matched by the Ferguson fund. By the end of 1991, the Park District had collected $320,000 of the $520,000 estimated repair costs from public and <b>private</b> <b>funds,</b> although in 1994 the sculpture still awaited repair.|$|E
5|$|For twoyears {{after the}} bombing the only {{memorials}} to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding {{the site of the}} building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29million, which was raised by public and <b>private</b> <b>funds.</b> The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg.

5|$|In 1948, the ACLU {{prevailed in}} the McCollum v. Board of Education case, which {{challenged}} public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for from <b>private</b> <b>funds.</b> The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms. In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the New Meadowlands Stadium opened, {{replacing}} Giants Stadium. The {{new stadium}} is a 50/50 {{partnership between the}} Giants and Jets, and while the stadium {{is owned by the}} New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the stadium using <b>private</b> <b>funds,</b> and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300-million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of the new stadium which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million, before rising to an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. One advantage gained by owning the stadium is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments, leasing the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year. The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them. Both teams received $150 million loans from the NFL to pay for construction of the stadium. Representatives from the league's teams voted 30–2 in favor of the loan.|$|E
5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to last longer than 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds {{proposed}} a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and <b>private</b> <b>funds</b> at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, {{due in part to the}} Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.|$|E
