At Kabete, endosulfan, dimethoate, pirimiphos-methyl, fluvalinate, Bacillus thuringiensis and neem extract were evaluated on short-duration genotype ICPL 87091. At Kiboko, endosulfan, dimethoate, pirimiphos-methyl, B. thuringiensis and deltamethrin were evaluated on short-duration ICPL 87091, medium-duration ICP 6927 and long-duration ICEAP 00020. The major insect pests on pigeon <b>pea</b> were <b>pod</b> <b>borers</b> (Helicoverpa armigera, Maruca vitrata, Etiella zinckenella and Lampides boeticus at Kiboko, and H. armigera, E. zinckenella and L. boeticus at Kabete), pod-sucking bugs (Clavigralla tomentosicollis) and pod fly (Melanagromyza chalcosoma). The results indicated that all sprays improved grain yields and seed quality at Kabete, with 57 - 152 % grain yield gains with different insecticides. Endosulfan performed better among the high volume sprayed insecticides at Kabete. Pod fly damage was less in plots treated with dimethoate and endosulfan. Results from Kiboko showed that ultra-low-volume (ULV) spraying was more efficient than high volume sprayed insecticides. Endosulfan was also good among the high volume sprays.

Frequent attacks by pathogens, insect pests, and nematodes cause impairments to the plants at various stages of crop growth. The average annual loss in legumes due to pests and pathogens was estimated to be up to 20 % (Dhaliwal et al., 2010). In other words, the efforts dedicated to protect the crop may witness substantial increment in food legume production. Up to 100 % losses have been reported in various legume crops in Asia and Africa in case of the conditions that favor diseases and pests (Vijay et al., 2015). In India, a considerable extent of yield in pigeon pea and chickpea is lost due to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> [Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner)]. In pigeon <b>pea,</b> spotted <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> [Maruca vitrata (Fabricius)] remains the second most important pest causing up to 84 % reduction in crop yield, amounting to a loss of nearly US$ 30 million in monitory terms (Margam et al., 2011). Similarly, more than 40 % damage to the <b>pods</b> in pigeon <b>pea</b> is caused by pod fly [Melanagromyza obtusa (Malloch)] (Singh et al., 2013). The other pathogens that plague legume production include wilt, dry root rot, Phytophthora blight, collar rot, stem/white rot, Macrophomina blight, and yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV). Losses caused by wilt in legumes may vary from 0 to 100 % depending on the crop stage (Pande et al., 2013).|$|R

40|$|The legume <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Helicoverpa armigera {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{divesting}} pests of pigeon pea. And it is an important biotic constraint to pigeon pea production worldwide. In recent years, development of Helicoverpa armigera populations resistant to insecticides has further hampered the control of measures. Therefore, identification and utilization of cultivars resistant to tolerant to Helicoverpa armigera would have a number of advantages, particularly for a relatively low value crop such as pigeon pea. Resistant/susceptible cultivars would provide an equitable, environmentally sound and sustainable pest management tool.

Inheritance of resistance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> and grain yield was different in desi and kabuli types. In desi type chickpea, the additive component of genetic variance was important in early maturity and dominance component was predominant in medium maturity group, while in the late maturity group, additive as well as dominance components were equally important in the inheritance of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance. Both dominant and recessive genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance seemed equally frequent in the desi type parental lines of medium maturity group. However, dominant genes were in overall excess in the parents of early and late maturity groups. In the kabuli medium maturity group, parents appeared to be genetically similar, possibly due to dispersion of genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and susceptibility, while their F 1 s were significantly different for <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> damage. The association of genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and susceptibility in the parents {{could be attributed to}} the similarity of parents as well as their F 1 s for <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> damage in kabuli early and late maturity groups. Grain yield was predominantly under the control of dominant gene action irrespective of the maturity groups in desi chickpea. In all the maturity groups, dominant and recessive genes were in equal frequency among the desi parental lines. Dominant genes, which tend to increase or decrease grain yield are more or less present in equal frequency in parents of the early maturity group, while in medium and late maturity groups, they were comparatively in unequal frequency in desi type. Unlike in desi chickpea, differential patterns of genetic components were observed in kabuli chickpea. While the dominant genetic component was important in early and late maturity group, additive gene action was involved in the inheritance of grain yield in medium duration group in kabuli chickpea. The dominant and recessive genes controlling grain yield are asymmetrically distributed in early and medium maturity groups in kabuli chickpea. The implications of the inheritance pattern of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield are discussed in the context of strategies to enhance <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield in desi and kabuli chickpea cultivars...|$|R

Researchers from the University of Agricultural Sciences have been studying birds that fed on <b>pod</b> <b>borers</b> of field beans. Five species of birds were found to be important: the house crow, the house sparrow, the golden oriole, the black drongo and the mynah. At one time of year these birds were seen to eat as many as five to eight larvae per minute. Over the whole season the house crows, which were present at a population of about 200 per sq km, each accounted for four larvae per minute. <b>Pod</b> <b>borers</b> were not the only insects eaten. Analyses of the birds' crops showed that their diet consisted of about one-third <b>pod</b> <b>borers,</b> and about twice that for other insects, but whether some of these are beneficial has still to be verified. Some plant material was eaten by one species, the house sparrow, but it was far less than would have been damaged by the <b>pod</b> <b>borers.</b> At the site, with the highest bird population, crop losses resulting from <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> were 22 %, compared to 61 % where bird numbers only 50 per sq km. The researchers conclude that encouraging insectivorous birds is a far more effective method of controlling nests for subsistence farmers than using expensive chemicals. Birds can be encouraged by providing niches for feeding, shelter and nesting in tree and shrub borders around the herds. Bamboo poles can be used to provide extra perching sites.

Unfortunately, the same defensive system makes chickpeas inhospitable plants for beneficial insects' posing problems for an effective biological control strategy. However, researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have devised an effective integrated pest management (IPM) programme. First they suggested growing chickpeas in wider rows than usual so that egrets can walk down the rows and pick off the <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> caterpillars. The {{next step was to}} get the <b>pod</b> <b>borer's</b> natural enemies to move into the crop.

However, if promotion of NPV in Nepal for <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> control were to be adopted, a policy for the supply of NPV would need to be developed. Importation is feasible but local production would probably be cheaper. Several models of local production exist including farmer production, village production, state or extension service production and commercial private sector production and these models need to be evaluated for adoption in Nepal. A national system of regulation for NPV would also need to be developed...|$|R

40|$|Twenty genotypes (14 {{lines and}} 6 {{released}} varieties) of chickpea were evaluated in natural infestation condition at the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Ishurdi, Pahna, Bangladesh during the rabi season of 2003 - 04. The parameters used for evaluating these genotypes were relative pest pressure index (RPPI), relative intensity of damage index (RPPI), relative productivity index (RPI), and yield. None of the genotypes could exhibit complete resistance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). Considering overall performance ICCV- 98939, ICCV- 95138, ICCV- 96020, ICCV- 97004, BCX- 91042 - 3, and BCX- 91040 - 3 rated a more tolerant to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> attack {{in comparison to}} check (BARI Chola- 5). Of them, ICCV- 95138 was the best considering resistance and yield. ICC- 4918 was the most susceptible. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) also known as gram {{is one of the}} important pulse crops in Bangladesh. It is attacked by eleven species of insect pests (Rahman et al., 1982). Among these pests, the <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Helicoverpa (= Heliothis) armigera (Huhner) is the most serious one in most of the chickpe...|$|R
40|$|The legume <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Maruca(testulalis) vitrata (Geyer) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{limitations}} to increasing the production and productivity of grain legumes in the tropics. Bionomics, host-plant resistance, natural enemies, cultural practices, and chemical control of the legume <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> have been discussed in this bulletin to identify gaps in present knowledge and to help plan future strategies for research on this pest on pigeonpea. While information is available on bionomics and host-plant resistance in cow pea, such information on pigeonpea and other legumes is limited. Several natural enemies have been recorded on M. vitrata,and pathogens such as Bacillus thuringiensis, Nosema, and Aspergillus play an important role in regulating its populations under field conditions. Cultural practices such as inter-cropping, time of sowing, density of sowing, and weeding reduce the <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> damage. Several insecticides have been found to be effective for controlling this insect. There is a need to focus future research on standardizing the resistance screening techniques, identification and utilization of resistance, and integrated pest management strategies for sustainable agricultural production...|$|R
