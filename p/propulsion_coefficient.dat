40|$|The {{possibility}} to use Artificial Neural Network for estimating ship resistance and <b>propulsion</b> <b>coefficients</b> are investigated. Different ANNs are tested by varying input parameters, network size and complexity and division of data material into training and testing sets. ANN prediction methods are trained for Resistance (Cr), total propulsion efficiency (nD), open water efficiency (n 0), hull efficiency (nH), wake fraction (w), thrust deduction (t) and relative rotative efficiency (nR). The data {{material for the}} thesis are model test results from MARINTEK and consist of 193 fishing vessels and loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the ongoing {{developments}} of cavitation modelling so far which include preliminary validation studies for simulating the performances of two benchmark model propellers: i. e. PPTC propeller with inclined shaft; and E 779 A propeller, in non-cavitating and cavitating conditions. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to estimate the propeller’s performance in cavitating conditions particularly developing tip vortex cavitation. The simulations in open water and cavitating conditions were carried out in uniform flow using a commercial CFD package. Firstly, the validation studies were conducted for non-cavitating condition. The comparison with the benchmark experimental data showed good agreement for the thrust and torque coefficients as well as for the open water efficiency. Next, the cavitation developed on the propeller was simulated using a numerical model based on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. <b>Propulsion</b> <b>coefficients</b> (KT, KQ) and the cavity patterns on the benchmark propellers’ blades showed very good agreement with the experimental data. However, the tip vortices off the blades could only be traced for E 779 A propeller by using a new mesh refinement approach...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Modern high comfort class {{appendages}} in cruise liner. The initial design {{stage is}} very important for the new vessel hydrodynamic success, difficulties there can follow the vessel during it’s whole life time. With modern cruise liners the shaft line, brackets, and bossing play a very important role, {{due to the fact that}} they have a major effect on appendage resistance, the wake field and propeller cavitation. The wake field is the most important source of propeller-hull excitations and noise. The advantages of POD propulsion are mainly caused by optimum hull lines, the best possible wake field and small appendage resistance. A wide range of wake measurements together with aft appendage alternatives are described to study carefully their effects to wake field and <b>propulsion</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The wake of conventional appendages is compared with the wake of a podded propulsor in order to get a good view of expectations. Especially wake tangential component effects to propeller tip vortex and propeller noise are shown with some cruise liner examples. The use of vortex generators are studied for wake and noise improvement purposes to modern ferry case. Finally, it is shown that the influence of the scale-effects {{is very important}} and this effect is investigated with RANS-calculations and model test, followed by a summary and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1996 A need exists {{whereby the}} {{preliminary}} power requirement {{of a ship}} can be rapidly estimated. Because the majority of methods available for this purpose are manual and consist {{of a number of}} independent components, they are tedious and time consuming to use. With the advent of the personal computer and its widespread acceptance, it was logical to examine the various components involved to determine their suitability for computerisation and general accuracy. In total eleven hull resistance prediction methods were examined, eight of which were computerised. Model test data of four vessels were used to evaluate these eight programs. The methodproviding the best results was selected to form the core of an integrated Power Prediction program. Factors such as appendage resistance, fouling and hull roughness were examined and appropriate methods selected for inclusion into the integrated program. Various propeller series were examined and evaluated against a variety of examples and model data. Two propeller optimisation programs were written and a general method for determining the optimum characteristics from Kr-KQ polynomials is described. Methods for determining <b>propulsion</b> <b>coefficients</b> were examined and their results compared with those obtained from model tests. The method providing the best overall results was incorporated into the Power Prediction program Added resistance due to sea state was broken down into two components, namely wind and wave resistance. Only the head sea and wind conditions were considered. Various methods for estimating wind resistance were examined and a program developed capable of providing resistance estimates regardless of wind direction. The problem of added resistance due to waves was examined and two programs written around the methods examined. To facilitate prediction estimates, sea state was chosen as the prime function. Wave height is estimated for the appropriate sea state and wind speed in turn from the wave height Actual sea trial data ofa twin screw channel ship is used to determine the overall accuracy ofthe Power Prediction Progra...|$|R
40|$|Ceramic {{thin film}} {{thermocouples}} {{are being developed}} to replace noble metal thermocouples operating within the harsh environments of advanced turbine engines used for power generation and <b>propulsion.</b> Seebeck <b>coefficients</b> as large as 158 V/°C were determined for indium oxide (In 2 O 3) at 950 °C and 256 V/°C for zinc oxide ZnO at 1250 °C relative to platinum reference electrodes. Because these Seebeck coefficients are appreciably larger than those for metallic thermocouples, alloys in the system indium zinc oxide ZnxInyOx+ 1. 5 y were investigated by cosputtering from high purity ZnO and In 2 O 3 targets. Thermocouple libraries were patterned with platinum reference electrodes and rapidly screened using combinatorial chemistry techniques. Thermoelectric response, power, and resistivity were determined for each thermocouple in the library. Thermocouples with the optimum compositions were prepared and the resulting power factor of the biceramic junctions was determined from 75 to 650 °C. © 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|A 3 -D {{unsteady}} vortex lattice {{technique is}} applied to the analysis of a pair of vertical oscillating wing tails, in order to investigate quantitatively its propulsive performance. Each lifting component undergoes a combined transverse and angular motion at the same frequency, in a uniform inflow condition. A free-wake analysis is incorporated in order to account for the effects of non-linearity, especially at increased amplitudes of oscillatory motion. Wing thickness effects are taken into account by an appropriate linearisation of the no-entrance boundary condition, and the effects of viscosity by means of a frictional drag coefficient applied to the solid surface. Numerical results are presented vs. experimental measurements for the <b>propulsion</b> thrust <b>coefficient</b> and the efficiency of the system over a range of motion parameters, including wing's aspect ratio, Strouhal number, feathering parameter and phase lag between oscillatory motions. These results indicate the significance of 3 -D effects and show that the present technique, after appropriate elaboration, especially as concerns unsteady LE flow separation and stall effects, can serve for the design of this kind of propulsive systems with optimised performance...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{research}} the bionic mechanics in unsteady flow and the hydrodynamic performance of the oscillating tail fin, in this paper, an experimental device imitating bionic tail fin were built, the design concepts and the rolling systems of the mechanical tail fins were demonstrated, including the procedures and correlated works on {{the selection of the}} servo motors, online control and signal data collecting and processing.

40|$|This report {{describes}} experiments {{carried out}} on a 1 : 29. 78 scale fully appended model of the Contract Design of the Joint Support Ship (JSS) in the Oceans, Coastal and River Engineering (OCRE) Towing Tank in June/July 2012. The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate performance of this revised design of the JSS {{in terms of its}} resistance, propulsion and wake survey characteristics. Revised design featured modifications to bulbous bow and stern region to correct deficiencies observed in the Preliminary Design of the JSS. Appended Resistance: Resistance coefficient is essentially {{the same as that of}} the preliminary design up to ten knots, is slightly higher (about 2 %) at 10 knots and then becomes steadily less at all speeds above 10 knots. Maximum reduction in resistance coefficient is 12. 5 % and occurs at 20 knots (Froude number (Fr) = 0. 244). Full scale effective power shows a similar trend. Propulsion: Propulsion tests showed that Contract Design represents an improvement over Preliminary Design in terms of Delivered Power (PD) and propeller revolutions. As was the case with Appended Resistance, there was little difference below 10 knots. Above 10 knots, PD for Contract Design versus Preliminary Design decreases steadily. The maximum percentage reduction in Delivered Power is 24 % at 19 knots. Ship <b>propulsion</b> efficiency <b>coefficients</b> for this design confirm trends shown by the improvements in PD and propeller revolutions. Wake Survey: Wake Survey shows improved flow particularly into the upper portion of the propeller disk for the Contract Design when compared to the Preliminary DesignPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In {{the naval}} ship design and {{acquisition}} process, especially {{at an early}} stage, is increasingly crucial the application of computational tools, able to tackle the main ship characteristics and their interactions {{for the assessment of}} different design solutions in a reasonable time. The most comprehensive use of such computational tools is, undeniably, the possible interface with a cost estimating module and a performance evaluator with the aim to better lead the concept exploration process. The Ship Synthesis Model (SSM) can be an useful computational tools/approach in this exploration process: it allows to select a subset of feasible ship configurations which satisfy the settled requirement, evidencing the balancing of different functions, often affected by conflicting constraints. In fact, beside design requirements (speed, endurance, crew members, payload…), it permits to identify several design parameters (L,B, form <b>coefficients,</b> <b>propulsion</b> and diesel enerator plants,…), together with their functional relations and functional constraints. Then different balances in terms of propulsion and electric power, weights, volumes and areas are worked out. In the proposed paper an SSM code is presented together with an application case, in terms of trade off analysis for an offshore patrol vessel design. The sensitivity analysis of the SSM tool has been performed in relation with different ship requirements...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous micro-swimming robots can be {{utilized}} to perform specialized procedures {{such as in}} vitro or in vivo medical tasks as well as chemical surveillance or micro manipulation. Maneuverability of the robot {{is one of the}} requirements that ensure successful completion of its task. In micro fluidic environments, dynamic trajectories of active micro-swimming robots must be predicted reliably and the response of control inputs must be well-understood. In this work, a reduced-order model, which is based on the resistive force theory, is used to predict the transient, coupled rigid body dynamics and hydrodynamic behavior of bio-inspired artificial micro-swimmers. Conceptual design of the micro-swimmer is biologically inspired: it is composed of a body that carries a payload, control and actuation mechanisms, and a long flagellum either such as an inextensible whip like tail-actuator that deforms and propagates sinusoidal planar waves similar to spermatozoa, or of a rotating rigid helix similar to many bacteria, such as E. Coli. In the reduced-order model of the microswimmer, fluid’s resistance to the motion of the body and the tail are computed from resistive force theory, which breaks up the resistance coefficients to local normal and tangential components. Using rotational transformations between a fixed world frame, body frame and the local Frenet-Serret coordinates on the helical tail we obtain the full 6 degrees-of-freedom relationship between the resistive forces and torques and the linear and rotational motions of the swimmer. In the model, only the tail’s frequency (angular velocity for helical tail) is used as a control input in the dynamic equations of the micro-swimming robot. The reduced-order model is validated by means of direct observations of natural micro swimmers presented earlier in the literature and against; results show very good agreement. Three-dimensional, transient CFD simulations of a single degree of freedom swimmer is used to predict resistive force coefficients of a micro-swimmer with a spherical body and flexible tail actuator that uses traveling plane wave deformations for <b>propulsion.</b> Modified <b>coefficients</b> show a very good agreement between the predicted and actual time-dependent swimming speeds, as well as forces and torques along all axes...|$|R
