50|$|ComposerThe Composer was {{the first}} Lensbaby lens to feature a ball-and-socket style body coupled with a manual barrel focus.

50|$|The {{image of}} a pinhole camera may be {{projected}} onto a translucent screen for real-time viewing (used for safe observation of solar eclipses) or to trace the image on paper. But it is more often used without a translucent screen for <b>pinhole</b> <b>photography</b> with photographic film or photographic paper placed on the surface opposite to the pinhole aperture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first known}} {{description}} of <b>pinhole</b> <b>photography</b> {{is found in}} the 1856 book The Stereoscope by Scottish inventor David Brewster, including the description of the idea as [...] "a camera without lenses, and with only a pin-hole". One older use of the term [...] "pin-hole" [...] in the context of optics was found in James Ferguson's 1764 book Lectures on select subjects in mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and optics.|$|E
50|$|Hand lensed {{video is}} {{a process in which}} a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera is used to create a pinhole like moving image. Unlike {{traditional}} <b>pinhole</b> <b>photography</b> the aperture is created by placing one’s hands over the CMOS sensor. This creates a variable sized and shaped aperture. This technique was first developed by Charles Lim Yi Yong in 2009. The first video using is One Day I Forgot and Used My Hands premiered at the 2011 Rotterdam International Film Festival.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the artist {{undertook}} her first experiments with {{the medium of}} <b>pinhole</b> <b>photography.</b> To capture a direct imprint of her environment, Lutter transformed the loft in which she lived into a camera obscura. Through the aperture of a pinhole, rather than a carved lens, an inverted image {{of the outside world}} was projected onto mural-sized sheets of photographic paper. Refraining from the reproducibility warranted by conventional photography, the artist retained the unique negative print in an effort to maintain the immediacy of her images.|$|E

50|$|Guest: Bucklow's Guest series {{portrays a}} cast of {{characters}} drawn from his circle of acquaintances. Bucklow created the giant images using sunlight with a technique similar to the <b>pinhole</b> <b>photography</b> technology. He begins by making a life-sized silhouette drawing from the sitter's shadow {{on a sheet of}} aluminium foil, which is then penetrated with thousands of pinholes within the outline of the shape. He then places the foil on top of colour photographic paper, using sunlight to record many images of the sun and sky simultaneously. His Guest series was exhibited in Japan in Winter 2009. Bucklow's series The Beauty of the World, was made up of images using the same technique, but including different patterns and designs instead of silhouettes of people. These works are ongoing, along with the series Tetrarchs made using the same photographic process.|$|E
