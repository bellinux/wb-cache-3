30|$|The {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} in a Therapeutic Community Center where the therapeutic program involved work and spiritual activities. During SST, the participants were encouraged to practice, with their peers, the skills they had learned in the intervention. The SST training was given by two psychologists with previous experience in the treatment of drug users. Both of them had participated in an SST training program to develop their SS. Subsequently, they conducted an SST training program with a non-clinical group and after that they conducted a <b>pilot</b> study <b>under</b> weekly <b>supervision.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Esperanto {{instruction}} is rarely available at schools, including four primary schools in a <b>pilot</b> project <b>under</b> the <b>supervision</b> of the University of Manchester, and by one count {{at a few}} universities. However, outside China and Hungary, these mostly involve informal arrangements rather than dedicated departments or state sponsorship. Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest had a department of Interlinguistics and Esperanto from 1966 to 2004, after which time instruction moved to vocational colleges; there are state examinations for Esperanto instructors. Additionally, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland offers a diploma in Interlinguistics. The Senate of Brazil passed a bill in 2009 that would make Esperanto an optional {{part of the curriculum}} in public schools, although mandatory if there is demand for it. [...] the bill is still under consideration by the Chamber of Deputies.|$|R

Instrument-rated pilots also use view-limiting devices supervised by an instructor or a safety pilot to practise instrument flight and maintain instrument flying proficiency.|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{information on}} both {{the number of young}} people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> on an average day and the number of young people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the year. In Australia, responsibility for juvenile justice lies with the states and territories and involves both juvenile justice agencies and other justice agencies such as the police and the courts. Each year, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collects data on young people <b>under</b> juvenile justice <b>supervision</b> from the states and territories and publishes the results in the Juvenile justice in Australia reports. This report contains the main tables from Juvenile justice in Australia 2008 – 09 (AIHW forthcoming). For more detailed analyses, please see the forthcoming report. The number of young people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> on an average day is calculated by summing the number of days each young person spends <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the year and dividing this total by the number of days in the financial year. The number of young people <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the year is calculated by counting each distinct young person <b>under</b> <b>supervision</b> during the financial year. Each young person is counted only once, even if they entered and exited supervision multiple times during the year...|$|R
