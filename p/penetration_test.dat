Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard <b>penetration</b> <b>test</b> values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

This paper adds <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> {{to the realm of}} information security investment. <b>Penetration</b> <b>testing</b> is modeled as an information gathering option to reduce uncertainty in a discrete time, finite horizon, player-versus-nature, weakest-link security game. We prove that once started, it is optimal to continue <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> until a secure state is reached. Further analysis using a new met-ric for the return on <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> suggests that <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> almost always increases the per-dollar efficiency of security investment. ...|$|R

25|$|The Standard <b>Penetration</b> <b>Test</b> recovers {{a highly}} {{disturbed}} sample, {{which is generally}} not suitable for tests which measure properties of the in-situ soil structure, such as density, strength, and consolidation characteristics. To overcome this limitation, the test is often run with a larger sampler with a slightly different tip shape, so the disturbance of the sample is minimized, and testing of structural properties is meaningful for all but soft soils. However, this results in blow counts which are not easily converted to SPT N-values – many conversions have been proposed, some of which depend {{on the type of}} soil sampled, making reliance on blow counts with non-standard samplers problematic.|$|E

The system of testing shells, which remained in use up to 1944, meant that, statistically, a batch of shells of which 70% were faulty stood an even chance of being accepted. Indeed, even shells that failed this relatively mild test had still been issued to ships.

However, <b>penetration</b> <b>tests,</b> and preventive security analysis in general, require considerable investments in money, time, and labor, which can cause them to be overlooked. Alternatively, automated <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> programs are used to conduct a security evaluation with less user effort, lower cost, and in a shorter period of time than manual <b>penetration</b> <b>tests.</b> The trade-off is that automated <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> tools are not as effective as manual tests.

The development of better automated tools can help organizations quickly and frequently know the state of their security measures and can help improve the manual <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> process by accelerating repetitive tasks without sacrificing results. This thesis presents Automated Network Exploitation through <b>Penetration</b> <b>Testing</b> (ANEX), an automated <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> system designed to infiltrate a computer network and map paths from a compromised network machine to a specified target machine. Our goal is to provide an effective security evaluation solution with minimal user involvement that is easily deployable in an existing system. ANEX demonstrates that important security information can be gathered through automated tools based solely on free-to-use programs. ANEX can also enhance the manual <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> process by quickly accumulating information about each machine to develop more focused testing procedures.

2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard <b>Penetration</b> <b>Test</b> (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the relative density of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The soil strength parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and weak rock. In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below groundwater level, the soil may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a standard <b>penetration</b> <b>test,</b> and should not be regarded as such, it may at least give an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E
