40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the cost, return, and profitability of broiler production in some selected areas of Mymensingh district. It was mainly based on primary data which were collected through face to face interview from the respondents of broiler production {{during the month of}} December, 2011. Selected samples consisted of 30 broiler farm owners selected by using purposive sampling technique. For the analysis of data, tabular and production function techniques were used. This study estimated the average cost of raising broiler to be Tk. 8, 35, 910. 65 <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> It was found that the variable cost <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> stood at Tk. 8, 23, 735. 93 which accounted for 98. 54 percent of total cost. The total fixed cost <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> accounted to Tk. 14, 041. 66. It is evident from the study that the gross return <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> stood at Tk. 10, 78, 022. 39. The net return <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> was calculated at Tk. 2, 42, 111. 47. The findings revealed that broiler production was a profitable enterprise. Cobb-Douglas production function was also applied to explore the specific effect of the factors on broiler production. It was observed that most of the included variables had significant impact on broiler production. Out of six variables included in the regression, four variables (i. e., feed cost, cost of day-old chick, labour cost and litter cost) had significant positive impact on return. This study also identified some problems in the production of broiler in the study area. Finally, based on the findings of the study, some recommendations were made for the development of broiler production in Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{management}} {{is one of}} the measures of Annex IX of the revised Gothenburg Protocol and described in detail in the Guidance Document (Bittman et al., Options for ammonia mitigation: guidance from the UNECE task force on reactive nitrogen. Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Edinburgh, 2014). The measures of Annex IX aim at the abatement of ammonia (NH 3) emissions from agricultural sources. This chapter reviews literature dealing with the economic costs of N management, aimed at decreasing the N surplus and increasing N use efficiency (NUE) at farm level. Nitrogen balances are important tools for N management; they are prerequisites for monitoring, reporting and verification. They have been implemented in practice in Denmark and The Netherlands, and are used in many other countries as research tool. The economic costs of making N balances at farm level range between 200 and 500 € <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Possible additional costs relate to comparing and discussing these balances with other farmers. Also governments make costs for verification and control, estimated at 50 – 500 € <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the livestock farms surrounding the Waterberg Plateau Park in north-central Namibia to assess farmer attitudes, management techniques, financial impacts, {{as well as}} the potential benefits of tourism and trophy hunting, with respect to leopard Panthera pardus conservation. Farmers were asked about their use of six livestock husbandry techniques and farmers who employed at least one had 85 % less reported conflict than farmers not employing any. Livestock farmers lost on average 3. 8 % of their calves to depredation annually (US$ 1370 <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year)</b> but were willing to lose 3. 3 %, a difference of only US$ 180 per farm or US$ 3064 regionally. Where losses were higher than stated tolerance, we found that potential benefits from tourism and trophy hunting could offset losses. Surveys with tourists and professional hunters in the region strengthened this conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Farmer's lung {{incidence}} in Ireland was constant until 1996, {{even though}} hay making methods were revolutionised in late 1980 's. We undertook {{this study to}} find out the incidence of farmer's lung in Ireland from 1982 - 2002 and its correlation with rainfall and the effect of changing farm practices. The primary cases of farmer's lung were identified from Hospital in Patients Enquiry (HIPE) unit of the national Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI) Dublin. Rainfall data were obtained from Met Eireann whereas population, hay production and silage production were obtained from the Central Statistics Office, Dublin. As the farming population is in decline, we used the annual working unit (AWU), which reflects the true population at risk. An AWU is the equivalent of 1800 hours <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> worker <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> The incidence rates were constant from 1982 - 1996, but from 1997 - 2002 a marked decline was observed. There was strong positive correlation with hay production (r = 0. 81) and strong negative correlation with silage production (r = - 0. 82). This study indicates that the incidence of farmer's lung is now in decline...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess whether}} forests {{contribute}} indirectly to the dietary diversity of rural households by supporting diverse agricultural production systems. We applied our study {{in a landscape}} mosaic in Southern Ethiopia that was divided into three zones of increasing distance to Munesa Forest - "near," "intermediate," and "distant. " A variety of research tools and methods, including remote sensing, participatory methods, farm survey, and yield assessment, were employed. Diets of households were more diverse in the near zone than {{in the other two}} zones (6. 58 ± 1. 21, 5. 38 ± 1. 02, and 4. 41 ± 0. 77 food groups consumed daily in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). This difference was not explained by food items collected from Munesa Forest but by biomass flows from the forest to farmlands. Munesa Forest contributed an average of 6. 13 ± 2. 90 tons of biomass <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> and <b>per</b> <b>year</b> to the <b>farms</b> in the near zone, in the form of feed and fuelwood. Feed from the forest allowed for larger livestock herds in the near zone compared with the other two zones, and fuelwood from the forest reduced the need to use cattle dung as fuel in the near zone compared with the two other zones. These two biomass flows contributed to the availability of more manure to farmers closer to the forest (908 ± 853 kg farm- 1, 771 ± 717 kg farm- 1, and 261 ± 487 kg farm- 1 in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). In turn, increased manure enabled a larger percentage of farms to cultivate a diversified homegarden (87, 64, and 39 % of farms in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). Homegardens and livestock products provided the greater contribution to household dietary diversity closer to the forest...|$|R
40|$|A {{postal survey}} of British sheep farmers {{provided}} {{information on the}} proportion of farms that experienced their first case of scrapie in each year between 1962 and 1998. We {{found no evidence of}} a large increase in the proportion of scrapie-affected farms prior to, during or following the epidemic of BSE in British cattle. After correcting for between-farm heterogeneity in the probability of acquiring scrapie, we estimated the yearly between-flock force of infection since 1962. The current force of infection is estimated at approximately 0. 0045 <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> and combined with a simple model of scrapie spread provides an estimate of the average duration of a scrapie outbreak on an individual farm. Considering all farms, the average outbreak lasts for five years, but if only those farms that have cases in animals born on the farm are considered, it lasts 15 years. We use these parameter estimates to compare the proportion of farms with scrapie in time periods of different lengths. In the survey, 2. 7 % of farms had a case in 1998. The 5. 3 % of farms reporting having a case between 1993 and 1997 is consistent with the hypothesis that the scrapie force of infection remained constant over this period...|$|E
40|$|Multiple linear {{regression}} models able to estimate total farm milk production from nutritional inputs were developed from farm survey {{data provided by}} dairy farmers in Queensland, Australia. These models were specifically developed for inclusion in a decision support system that could provide dairy farmers with an annual milk production estimate, thus enabling them to compare their production with an average farm using the same inputs in their region. Separate models were developed for each of 4 regions in Queensland and an additional model was developed for farms producing greater than 750 kL of milk <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> The models were tested on dairy farms in Queensland by using the decision support system on farms that were not involved with initial model development. The partial regression coefficients for the models were biologically sensible and, apart from some minor interactions between independent variables in 2 regions, were additive. These interactions {{were not included in}} the final model in the interests of parsimony, ease of explanation and a need to provide transparent models within the decision support system. The coefficients of determination (R 2) for the models varied from 79. 9 to 88. 3 %. Forward-feed artificial neural network models were also used to confirm the relative accuracy of the multiple {{linear regression}} models and to allow for any interactions or non-linear functions in the data and to show that the simple equations are more appropriate for a farmer-orientated decision support system...|$|E
40|$|In {{sea cage}} fish farming, {{production}} quotas aim to constrain {{the impact of}} fish farming on the surrounding ecosystem. It is unknown how these quotas affect economic profitability and environmental impact of genetic improvement. We combined bioeconomic modelling with life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate the economic (EV) and environmental (ENV) values of thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of sea bass reared in sea cages, given four types of quota commonly used in Europe: annual production (Qprod), annual feed distributed (Qannual_ feed), standing stock (Qstock), and daily feed distributed (Qdaily_ feed). ENV were calculated for LCA impact categories climate change, eutrophication and acidification. ENV were expressed per ton of fish produced per year (ENV(fish)) and <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> (ENV(farm)). Results show that irrespective of quota used, EV of FCR as well as ENV(fish) and ENV(farm) were always positive, meaning that improving FCR increased profit and decreased environmental impacts. However, the EV and the ENV(fish) of TGC were positive only when quota was Qstock or Qdaily_ feed. Moreover, the ENV(farm) of TGC was negative in Qstock and Qdaily_ feed quotas, meaning that improving TGC increased {{the environmental impact of}} the farm. We conclude that Qstock quota and Qdaily_ feed quota are economically favorable to a genetic improvement of TGC, a major trait for farmers. However, improving TGC increases the environmental impact of the farm. Improving FCR represents a good opportunity to balance out this increase but more information on its genetic background is needed to develop breeding programs improving FCR...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to examine the cost and profit of raising broiler farms and also to examine the {{existing}} marketing system of commercially produced live broiler under contract growing system. The findings {{of the study were}} based on the analysis of primary data. The sample size of the study was 65 which included 25 contract growing farmers and 40 traders. The average cost of raising broiler <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> batch (50 days) was estimated at Tk. 73322 for 1000 birds. The gross return <b>per</b> broiler <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> batch (50 days) for 1000 birds was estimated at Tk. 81380. The net return (profit) <b>per</b> broiler <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> batch (50 days) for 1000 birds was estimated at Tk. 8058. In broiler marketing system five important channels were identified. The average marketing cost of Aftab Bahumukhi Farm Limited (ABFL) for 1000 birds was Tk. 2295. The average marketing cost of broiler in Dhaka city for wholesaler-cum-retailers and retailers were Tk. 2824 and Tk. 2046 per 1000 birds respectively. In Kishoreganj market the marketing cost of wholesaler-cum-retailers and retailers were Tk. 2545 and Tk. 2370 per 1000 birds respectively. The average gross margin of broiler in Dhaka city market for ABFL, wholesaler-cum-retailer and retailer were estimated at Tk. 9000, Tk. 7500 and 9000 respectively for 1000 birds (1500 kg). In Kishoreganj the average gross margin of broiler for ABFL, wholesaler-cum-retailers and retailers were estimated at Tk. 4500, Tk. 7500 and Tk. 9000 respectively for 1000 birds (1500 kg).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of predator culling {{as a means of}} reducing livestock losses using hunting club data for Cooper (outside Mossel Bay) for the period 1976 to 1981. Results showed that caracal (Caracal caracal) culling increased subsequent livestock losses when compared to farms where fewer caracals were culled. When controlling for lagged rainfall, remoteness and a proxy for other unobserved farm characteristics, a logit model indicated the marginal effect of culling to be a 17. 5 % increase in the likelihood of livestock losses during the next year. The corresponding negative binomial model estimated the effect of an additional caracal culled to be a 0. 373 unit {{increase in the number of}} sheep lost. A lagged rainfall variable was negative and significant in both models. According to the logit results, the marginal millimetre of rain reduced subsequent losses by 1. 1 %. For the negative binomial model, the marginal effect of rainfall was reduced losses by 0. 047 of a sheep, which was about a 5 % increase in losses. The average number of livestock lost was 0. 94 sheep <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Distance travelled, used to proxy remoteness, was positive in the negative binomial model and non-significant in the logit model. Lagged livestock losses were not significant in either model. This result is important because it provides support for stricter predator control regulations by showing that livestock farmers are inadvertently harming their own interests through inappropriate culling, a practice which continues to this day...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a series of studies on the epidemiology of TB in brushtail possum and domestic cattle populations in New Zealand. The first set of studies provides an analysis of the results of routine TB testing carried out in the Featherston area from July 1980 to June 2004. The median annual incidence rate of TB reduced from 4. 7 cases per 1000 cattle-years at risk for the period 1986 to 1991 to 1. 8 cases per 1000 cattle-years at risk for the period 1992 to 2003, coincident with the use of poisoning to control possums in the surrounding forest park (a major possum habitat area). We identified clusters of cattle TB cases adjacent to the forest park and found no evidence of spatio-temporal interaction of TB risk among farms. Our findings support the hypothesis that possums living in the forest park are a source of bovine TB in this area and that farm-to-farm transmission was not an important mechanism of infection spread. A mixed-effects Poisson regression model was developed to investigate the influence of farm-level covariates on the number of cattle confirmed with TB. The model showed that, despite intensification of possum control activities, proximity to forest parks remained a significant predictor of the number of confirmed TB cases <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Our analyses identified a significant, 3 -fold increase in TB risk in dairy cattle relative to beef conditional on the size of local possum habitat, and confirmed the positive influence of cattle population size and the presence of previous infection status as a determinant of the number of confirmed TB cases <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> The second set of studies investigates details of capture events recorded during a longitudinal, capturemark- recapture study of possums in a 22 -hectare study site near Castlepoint, from April 1989 to August 1994. Social network analyses were used to identify contact patterns and to estimate the influence of contact on R 0 for bovine TB. The average number of contacts per possum ranged from 20 to 26 per year. We estimated that TB would spread if an average of between 1. 94 and 1. 97 infective contacts occured per year per infected possum. We evaluated the effect of sex, habitat and contact behaviour of 26 postmortem confirmed TB cases in possums with those of 104 matched controls. Unit increases in the number of infected contacts increased the odds of TB infection by 2. 61 (95 % CI 1. 29 – 5. 29, P < 0. 01). Our results show that individual contact behaviour is a determinant of the presence of TB foci within this population and challenge the hypothesis that contact with many individuals increases the probability of infection. A model to predict spatial variation in possum abundance was developed using a Geographic Information System. Details of possum capture events were obtained from 157 10 -trap lines distributed within 42 randomly located transects at Molesworth Station. Two GIS-based models were developed to predict the number of possums caught per line using Poisson regression techniques. The first model used remotely sensed environmental data; the second used a combination of remotely sensed and fine-scale data. Both models provided adequate predictive ability with Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 60 %. We conclude that the prediction maps produced from this model provide a useful decision support tool for possum control managers. These results have implications for the management of TB in this area of New Zealand, providing the information that will allow effective control activities to be applied at significantly lower cost...|$|E
40|$|Aim and method: An {{exploratory}} {{and descriptive}} study to obtain basic {{data on the}} extent, nature, sources and severity of injuries sustained on fruit farms was conducted. The possibility of utilizing lay health workers (LHWs) on farms to document routine information on injuries was also investigated. Descriptive information of all injuries occurring on selected farms, both occupational and other, needing some form of treatment, were documented over a one-year period from June 1999 to May 2000. A purposive non-probability sampling method was used. Forty-eight fruit farms {{with a history of}} trained LHWs were purposefully selected. Injuries were documented using a one-page questionnaire. Results: A total of 500 injuries were recorded, giving an average of 10. 4 injuries <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Half of these injuries were work-related. Workers aged 20 - 39 were most at risk. Injuries sustained were related to routine activities of fruit farming, occurred mostly in the orchards and involved cuts, bruises and abrasions to the hands, including the fingers, and the eyes. Most of the non-work related injuries occurred in and around the home. A third of these injuries were sustained by persons < 20. A large percentage of the non-work related injuries were violence- and alcohol related. Most of the injuries required basic primary health care that could be managed by the LHW. Injury severity caused people to take time off for one third of the cases. Conclusion: A relatively high occupational injury rate in comparison to high-income countries. Occupational Health and Safety legislation needs to be institutionalized and adhered to. Alcohol and violence on farms is a serious public health problem. LHWs could potentially {{play an important role in}} documenting injury data...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{reported}} {{of a study}} of the income and cropping systems of peri-urban vegetable farmers around Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, as well as the constraints and opportunities for vegetable production and marketing. Urban population growth is fuelling the demand for timely supplies of fresh vegetables. Much of this increased demand, particularly for the more perishable species, is satisfied through peri-urban production which has significantly increased since the change from centrally planned and collective systems to a market economy. Around Ho Chi Minh City farms are small (on average about 0. 8 ha), 65 % which are de facto owned and with about 60 % dedicated to vegetables. Most vegetable farmers also grow rice and/or groundnuts, while cabbage is the most commonly grown vegetable crop. Vegetables provide about $ 1000 total revenues, or $ 650 added value (returns to labour, land and management) <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Added value per ha per day of vegetables is double or more than that for rice, providing employment for five or more times the number for rice, despite very high labour use. The negative correlation between farm size and cropping intensity suggests that labour is a factor limiting vegetable production enterprises. One of the major demands on labour is for irrigation. Major input costs relate to organic materials, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, although much variability exists between crops. Pests, and low and variable vegetable prices, are the most commonly cited constraints. There is a clear trough in vegetable supply during August to October following the hot-wet months, and an apparent overuse of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Lack of communal purchase of inputs and marketing limit the success of market-oriented vegetable farms...|$|E
40|$|Dairy {{production}} has presented in Vietnam since 50 years, but these dairy farms really developed from 2001. In the period 2001 – 2010, the average {{growth rate of}} dairy herds was up to 30 % per year. However, fresh milk production satisfies about 20 - 25 % of milk consumption. The rural areas of Hanoi Province are large for dairy production. This province builds the 7 agro-ecological sub-regions {{for the development of}} dairy farming, in which Ba Vi District is a most of sub-regions for dairy production development. But the average size is about 2. 5 cows per farm. This research aims to better understand how the factors in milk sector adapt to current economic conditions in Hanoi suburbs through analyzing farming systems. These studies were conducted from January to August 2012 on 43 dairy farms with different production scales at Ba Vi District to characteristic of dairy farming systems. The data were collected by interviewing and keeping records at the farms that have milk production. The results showed that three dairy production systems in these zones: (1) Dairy small farming system has from 1 to 3 cows per farm; (2) The medium farming system has from 4 to 5 cows per farm; and (3) The dairy intensive farming system has more 5 cows per farm. The economic activities were really diversified with landless per household farm such as rice production, gardens, grass production and sylviculture. Land resources per farm of intensive farming system were largest including 9, 239 m² for garden around the household; 2, 574 m² for rice land; 563 m² of grass area and 3, 325 m² for sylviculture. While the small farming system has the lowest potential land, each household has only 2, 815 m² of garden; 1, 795 m² of rice land; 2, 095 m² of grazing land. The medium farming system has about 3, 150 m² of garden; 2, 220 m² of rice land and 3, 891 m² of grazing land. Milk production cycle was quite long with intensive farming system, up to 324 days comparing with 299 days per cycle with medium farming system and to 306 days per cycle with small-scale farmers. This difference was not statistically signification (P> 0. 05). Average milk production yield per cow was high with medium farming system (16 kg per cow per day) in comparison with 15 kg per day at intensive and small farming systems (P> 0. 05). Milk production yield has been improved in the past years with crossbreed cows such as Holstein-Friesian 50 % and 75 %. But this productivity was still considered to be lower than the milk production yield with dairy cows raised in Moc Chau District under Son La Province with 20. 5 kg per cow per day and 6, 250 kg of milk per cow per cycle). In addition, in the period from 2006 to 2012, fresh milk prices at farm gate have continued to rise for the farmers, while feed prices increased in the period from 2006 to 2010 and these feed prices were stable between 2011 and 2012. In the period of 2006 to 2012, fresh milk prices at farm gate increased from 0. 17 USD per kg in 2006 to 0. 60 USD per kg in 2012 and feed prices were from 0. 15 USD per kg in 2006 increasing to 0. 39 USD per kg in 2012. The net incomes were calculated per a cow per year reached 1, 274 USD with the small-scale farming households to 1, 476 USD with medium farming system. The net income per kg of fresh milk at farm gate obtained from 0. 28 USD with small farming system to 0. 31 USD with medium farming system. The net household income was high from dairy production, from 2, 437 USD <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> with small farming system to 5, 487 USD <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> with intensive farming system. The net labor family income gained from 997 USD per active per year with small farming system to 2, 757 USD per active per year with intensive farming system. Thus, dairy production farms in recent years in Hanoi Suburbs provide very high economic efficiency for farmers in comparison with other agricultural activities at the farms. This explains why the rate of dairy family farming has grown very fast in the studied zones in the period from 2009 to 2012. This trend will continue to grow in the future. This research was also showed that the price of fresh milk plays a crucial role for profitable at farm level. But medium farming system with the size from 4 to 5 dairy cows per farm is more profitable with current economic conditions at farms...|$|E
40|$|Extended-spectrum β-lactamase and AmpC-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL/AmpC) are an {{emerging}} problem and are hypothesized {{to be associated}} with antimicrobial use (AMU), and more specifically with the use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. Whether ESBL/AmpC also occur in organic dairy herds, which have restricted AMU, is not known. Additionally, it is unknown whether, in addition to restricted AMU, other factors in organic herd management are associated with ESBL/AmpC herd status. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC in organic dairy herds in the Netherlands. Subsequently, the relationships between the ESBL/AmpC herd status and AMU and between ESBL/AmpC herd status and farmers' management were assessed in organic dairy herds. For this study, 90 randomly selected, officially registered organic dairy herds were included. The ESBL/AmpC herd status was determined based on the bacteriological culture result of a slurry sample. The sensitivity of testing slurry samples for ESBL/AmpC herd status is less than 100 % for detecting herds with a low ESBL/AmpC prevalence. For that reason, herds that tested positive for ESBL/AmpC in slurry were defined as positive and herds with negative slurry samples were defined as unsuspected. A comprehensive questionnaire on management practices was conducted and records on specified antimicrobials that were provided to these herds by the veterinary service providers were obtained. From the data on antimicrobial supplies by the veterinarian, the animal daily defined dose of antimicrobials <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> (DDDAF) was calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the relation between the ESBL/AmpC herd status and DDDAF. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate management factors associated with the ESBL/AmpC herd status. We found ESBL/AmpC in 12 of the 90 (13 %; 95 % confidence interval = 7 - 22 %) slurry samples from organic dairy herds. The median DDDAF in organic dairy herds was 0. 5, which was not significantly different between ESBL/AmpC-positive and -unsuspected dairy herds. No association could be found between the use of different types of antimicrobials, such as third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, and ESBL/AmpC herd status. Factors that were associated with higher odds of being ESBL/AmpC-positive were pig farms located within a 2 -km radius of the barn, applying parental treatment for clinical mastitis, and providing milk replacer to the female calves after colostrum intake. The prevalence of ESBL/AmpC in organic dairy herds appeared lower than the prevalence in previous studies conducted in conventional dairy herds. Apparently, ESBL/AmpC are also present in herds with low AMU; this indicates that other factors than AMU are also associated with ESBL/AmpC herd status...|$|E

40|$|Before {{setting up}} or {{changing}} a pig farm operation, {{the consequences of}} the farm set up must be explored and changes planned. To calculate technical and economic consequences a farm manager model for pig production systems, the Pig Farm Manager, has been developed. The Pig Farm Manager estimates the effects of various farm designs as well as farm management on production, environmental and economical parameters. The Pig Farm Manager includes simulations for sow farms and finisher pig farms. In the model the user enters farm data on e. g. farm size, housing system or farm management (e. g. feeding strategy), which the model uses to calculate output-parameters. The Pig Farm Manager estimates cost price, profits, gross margins, costs and income <b>per</b> <b>farm,</b> <b>per</b> sow or finisher place. To evaluate the analytical capacities of the model a comparison between a standard sow farm and a high-health-status farm was made. The high-health-farm (HHF) had better growth of piglets, lower mortality rate and better fertility traits for sows compared to a standard farm. However, the HHF had higher investment costs and required more labour. Overall, on the HHF, cost price per piglet was 3. 19 lower and yearly farm income about 21, 000,- higher compared to the standard sow farm. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Although {{trees and}} {{livestock}} are not closely-linked components of modem western agricultural systems, {{this was not}} always the case. Traditional 'woodpasture' systems were widespread in Europe and allowed production of meat, firewood and building timber from the same area of land. What are the benefits of such systems today in the Tropics? In recent years, increasing pressure on land in tropical countries has resulted in massive deforestation with consequent erosion and reduction in soil fertility as well as serious shortages of fuelwood. This has convinced many agricultural scientists that trees have a crucial {{role to play in}} tropical agriculture and that they should not be confined to intensive plantations but should instead be integrated with arable agriculture and livestock husbandry. Integration of livestock and trees makes excellent sense for farmers in tropical countries, both in terms of intensification of land use and economic security. Because animals provide traction and manure in addition to meat, milk and hides, their inclusion in the farming system actually increases crop production. They need not compete for land with crops, so long as adequate forage is available throughout the year. In addition to the advantages mentioned above leguminous trees, which fix nitrogen, can provide protein-rich leaves as supplements for ruminants and pigs, and nutritious browse during periods when other feeds are unavailable. (See CTA Activities, Spore 31 'Caribbean livestock: improving health and nutrition'). Farming systems that integrate trees with livestock In the semi-arid areas of Africa both pastoralists and farmers encourage the growth of acacia trees; the highly nutritious foliage and pods provide an important source of dry fodder for their animals. In the Sahel one species, Acacia albida, is particularly important since it produces green foliage throughout the dry season when other sources of forage are scarce. An abundant crop of nutritious pods is also produced {{at the end of the}} dry season, when the need for fodder is greatest, and a single tree will produce between 50 and 150 kg of pods per year. Similarly, in the semi-arid highlands of the Haraghe region of Ethiopia a traditional agroforestry system based on A. albida has evolved. Estimates of the additional income resulting from growing the trees in the farmers' gelds suggest that the value of produce (cereal grain and stover, fuel-wood and fodder) increases in proportion with the cover of the tree canopy. At a planting rate of 20 trees per hectare, the additional value of the produce (compared with fields without trees) was equivalent to US$ 230 per hectare per year and the total value of the fodder produced was about $ 370 per hectare per year. To date, tree-planting in semi-arid areas has mainly been done in the context of fuelwood and erosion control programmes and the benefits to agriculture are poorly documented. Nevertheless, species suitable for semi-arid areas of the highlands of East Africa have been identified by the International Council for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) at Machakos in Kenya. They include Leucaena, Acacia albida, A. tortilis, Sesbania sesban, S. bispinosa, Prosopis juliflora and P. pallida. Not all of these have been tested in farmers' fields but recent experiments in a semi-arid region of India using leucaena in mixed sorghum and livestock smallholdings gave remarkable improvements in sorghum yields and provided a valuable source of fodder and firewood. Here, leucaena was planted in rows 6 m apart with sorghum planted between. The trees were pollarded at 2 m height immediately before planting the sorghum, and the leaves were fed with sorghum stover to cattle. The researchers found that the value of produce from the leucaena/sorghum combination was about one third greater than that from sorghum alone and that income from the forage accounted for about 20 % of the total value. Another way in which trees and livestock can be integrated is by growing forage under tree plantations. This is widely practised in Goats browsing on leucaena the Pacific region, where both cattle and small ruminants are grazed under coconut plantations; in S. E. Asia, in rubber and coconut plantations; and, to a smaller extent, in West Africa in oil palm plantations. Grazing animals in plantations has a number of advantages for smallholder farmers. Under-utilized land and labour are made more productive and farm income is increased. With careful management, improvements in growth and yield of the tree crop can be achieved and considerable savings can be made in costs of herbicides to control ground-cover herbage. Because the market price of the produce from tree crops (particularly copra and coconut oil) fluctuates widely, inclusion of livestock in the system provides a buffer against falling prices. Since tree crops take a minimum of 6 to 7 years before coming into economic production, a combination of forage and food crops intercropped with young trees can help to offset the costs of establishing plantations. Finally, the cooler temperatures under tree plantations can provide a better microclimate for animal production than unshaded areas. Studies carried out in S. E. Asia and the Pacific illustrate the benefits of integrating livestock with coconut production. In southern India, the net return from smallholder coconut plantations was calculated as approximately US$ 350 per hectare per year, but when milk cattle were included net returns increased to $ 942 per year. Likewise, in the Philippines a recent comparison of the relative returns to coconut plantations alone and coconuts with beef cattle showed that inclusion of cattle more than doubles net returns, from $ 159 to $ 327 <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Inclusion of improved forages can often dramatically increase liveweight gains and profits from livestock in plantations. In the New Hebrides, planting guinea grass (Panicum maximum) and forage sorghum under coconut resulted in a ninefold increase in profits from livestock as compared with unimproved native pasture species. In much of humid S. E. Asia the creeping legumes calopo and puero (originally introduced to plantations as ground cover to control weeds) provide nutritious fodder for animals and there is considerable scope for improving pastures under plantations with these and other forage legumes. Alley cropping The third example of integrating trees with agriculture is a more recent development which has not yet been widely adopted by farmers in the Tropics. However, many agriculturalists think alley cropping has immense potential for stabilizing and improving smallholder farming. Traditional agriculture in the Tropics relies on the bush fallow system of shifting cultivation to restore soil fertility. Following forest clearance and cultivation, the litter from the dense growth of shrubs which develops on fallow land restores soil organic matter, the key to maintaining fertility. This system has maintained crop yields and soil fertility on the fragile soils of the humid tropics for millennia, but more recently growing populations have led to increasing demand for food, resulting in shortened fallow periods. The consequences for soil fertility and crop yields have been disastrous. Within living memory, average crop yields in parts of humid West Africa have almost halved, and in some areas cultivated land has even been abandoned as a result. Scientists from the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), at Ibadan in Nigeria, have tested a system to replace shifting cultivation that would allow continuous cropping without the resulting loss in soil fertility. Alley cropping consists of hedges of fast-growing shrubs interplanted with food crops. Using nitrogen-fixing leguminous shrubs such as leucaena or gliricidia, crop yields have been maintained at reasonable levels over several years, without the need for a fallow period. The system has several advantages. The shrubs provide green manure or mulch for companion crops, a source of stakes and firewood and, most importantly, biologically-fixed nitrogen to maintain and enhance soil fertility. Additionally, alleys planted along the contours on sloping ground can help to prevent soil erosion. Researchers from the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA), who also worked at Ibadan, realized that this system might also provide a means of improving productivity of sheep and goats in humid Africa, where forest sheep and dwarf goats are traditionally raised. Because they are fed only on kitchen refuse and agricultural by-products, such as cassava leaves, their productivity is low and surplus meat is rarely produced. Demand for fresh meat in the towns of West Africa is increasingly met largely by expensive beef. If the productivity of local small ruminants could be raised, a large and easily accessible market for meat would be available to farmers. Problems and outlook for integrating livestock and trees The leaves of both leucaena and gliricidia are highly nutritious for small ruminants and are produced throughout the dry season in humid regions, a period when other forages are scarce. Trials in which grass supplemented with varying quantities of leucaena or gliricidia leaves was fed to West African dwarf sheep show that inclusion in the diet of only 800 grammes of leaves per day increased liveweight gain by 30 % and survival of the young by 26 %. After some initial reluctance, many local farmers have adopted the idea of feeding browse from alleys to their animals, so that in only five years over 60 farmers in the Ibadan region established new alley farms. One of the advantages of the system is that it allows farmers freedom of choice as to how they use browse, either as fertilizer for crops or feed for animals, according to their own needs and the relative price of meat versus food crops. Following the initial success of alley farming in the Ibadan region, ILCA has started a network throughout West Africa to promote integration of trees and livestock. The examples that have been described suggest that integration of livestock husbandry with trees could provide major benefits for farmers in ACP countries. But it would be wrong to assume that there are no problems to be overcome and that the future of agroforestry in the Tropics is guaranteed. One general problem, particularly in Africa, is that of communal land tenure. Where farmers do not have individual tenure rights, the incentive to plant trees, which have long-term production cycles, is very low. This is probably one of the reasons for the relatively slow uptake of alley farming in West Africa, where much land is held communally or by tenant farmers. Likewise, in humid areas where the natural regrowth is dense bush, there may be considerable reluctance by farmers to plant shrubs or trees on land which they have recently spent much effort on clearing for food crops. Furthermore, in densely populated areas, such as the highlands of East Africa, land is already intensively used and any new management system needs careful on-farm testing to ensure that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages in actual practice. Also, where a completely new system such as alley farming is introduced, farmers may lack the management skills in both agroforestry and animal husbandry which are necessary to maintain productivity. Apart from such social and economic constraints, technical problems may also restrict opportunities for integrating livestock with trees. In many tropical areas animal diseases are a major problem. Much of the humid forest region of Africa is infested with tsetse fly, and only trypanosomiasis-resistant animals can be raised. In the same area, the disease PPR ('Peste des petite ruminants') causes serious weight loss and abortion in sheep and goats and the advantages of alley farming can only be fully exploited if animals are regularly vaccinated against the disease. When livestock are grazed in tree plantations, competition for nutrients and water between the trees and the pasture may result in poor establishment of one or other of the two components. There is often initially a considerable problem in preventing animals damaging young trees and then, as the tree canopy develops, in preventing overgrazing and maintaining a healthy sward in the heavily-shaded conditions. In this situation, careful regulation of stocking rates is essential and requires considerable livestock management skills. In the drier areas of the Tropics, competition between trees and pasture for limited soil moisture can also be a problem. There is also a pressing need to identify tree species that can grow well under the poor and erratic rainfall conditions encountered in such areas. Despite all these problems, the integration of livestock farming with trees in the Tropics is likely to expand for a variety of reasons. In many areas, deforestation has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and timber as well as serious soil erosion. While the conventional response of establishing fuel-wood plantations can provide a partial solution, shortage of land for food crops places a limit on the area that can be planted. Integration of trees in farmland simultaneously provides fuel and helps to control erosion. Including an animal component in the system not only provides meat, milk and hides but manure and traction as well. In many areas of the tropics, demand for meat and milk products far outstrips supply and the deficit is met by expensive imports paid for with scarce foreign currency. Self-sufficiency in livestock products should be seen as a national goal as well as an important source of farm income. However, as was stressed in the introduction, integration of livestock and trees should not be seen in isolation from the farming system as a whole. Only if the new technologies are carefully tailored to the particular requirements of individual farming communities are they likely to prove acceptable. It is in this respect that agroforestry is likely to provide the major challenge to agricultural scientists and extension workers alike in the 21 st century. Although trees and livestock are not closely-linked components of modem western agricultural systems, this was not always the case. Traditional 'woodpasture' systems were widespread in Europe and allowed production of meat, firewood and building [...] ...|$|E

30|$|Wise et al. (2012) {{estimated}} that mesquite invasions were providing a net benefit to local communities in South Africa, but that {{a net loss}} will result shortly as mesquite trees continue to spread. Although mesquite is providing {{about half of the}} farmers in the Northern Cape with a mean direct-use value R 2 000 per annum, the mean expenditure of farmers to control mesquite is over R 20 000 <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> annum (Shackleton et al. 2015 a). Mesquite invasions have also led to numerous other social, ecological and economic costs such as negative impacts on water, grazing potential, biodiversity and infrastructure that have not been fully valued (Ndhlovu et al. 2011; Dzikiti et al. 2013; Shackleton et al. 2015 a, 2015 c). This suggests that mesquite invasions in South Africa generate more costs than benefits. Some argue that mesquite invasions play a positive role in that they reduce the use and pressure on native trees (Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO 2004). However, mesquite invasions are having large-scale negative impacts on native tree population stability, abundance, density and mortality in South Africa (Schachtschneider and February 2013; Shackleton et al. 2015 b, 2015 c) and natives are still being harvested in preference to mesquite. Native trees will therefore decline as mesquite stands become more widespread and dense, possibly more so than as a result of direct harvesting. In Kenya, mesquite is negatively impacting populations of native species that supply specialised NTFPs, e.g., a palm (Hyphaene compressa) used for weaving and thatching (Stave et al. 2007).|$|R

Through this study, we estimated the potential carbon sequestration of wood fiber plantations in Saskatchewan Gray Luvisolic and Dark Gray Chemozemic/Luvisolic soils and also identified research needs to improve future estimations. Estimations were done for all future scenarios of approximately 500 years. Scenarios differed in species composition, agroforestry adoption rate, carbon pools considered, and different approaches to account for forest products stocks. The time-step used in all accountings was the rotation length. The first set of scenarios consisted of single species wood fiber plantations, with all available farms converting 10 ha each to wood fiber plantations at one time. For these scenarios, carbon stocks were accounted in 2 pools (aboveground and belowground). Such scenarios resulted in hybrid poplar wood fiber plantations with highest carbon sequestration potential (91. 3 Mt C), followed by trembling aspen (19. 1 Mt C) and white spruce (17. 8 Mt C). For similar scenarios, but accounting for carbon stocks in 3 pools (aboveground, belowground, and forest products), trembling aspen and white spruce had similar carbon sequestration (0. 4 Mt C), followed hybrid poplar (- 9 Mt C). This scenario for hybrid poplar was reproduced and the production approach was used {{to account for the}} forest products pool; and this resulted in - 2. 3 Mt C sequestered. Scenarios that considered a single species in wood fiber plantations at an average adoption rate 0. 33 % <b>farms</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> (10 ha <b>per</b> <b>farm),</b> and included carbon stocks in 2 pools (aboveground and belowground), hybrid poplar had the highest carbon sequestration potential (65. 5 Mt C), followed trembling aspen (15 Mt C) and white spruce (13. 9 Mt C).

On two dairies we conducted four seasonal sampling campaigns, each across 13 animal production and waste management systems and associated environmental pathways: application to animals, excretion to surfaces, manure collection systems, soils, and shallow groundwater. Concentrations of antibiotics were determined using on line solid phase extraction (OLSPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) for water samples, and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) LC/MS/MS with ESI for solid samples. A variety of antibiotics were applied at both farms leading to antibiotics excretion of several hundred grams <b>per</b> <b>farm</b> <b>per</b> day. Sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and their epimers/isomers, and lincomycin were most frequently detected. Yet, despite decades of use, antibiotic occurrence appeared constrained to within farm boundaries.

When detected below ground, tetracyclines were mainly found in soils, whereas sulfonamides were found in shallow groundwater reflecting key differences in their physicochemical properties. In manure lagoons, 10 compounds were detected including tetracyclines and trimethoprim. Of these 10, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, and lincomycin were found in shallow groundwater directly downgradient from the lagoons.
