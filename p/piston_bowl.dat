The effect of <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> geometry on the performance and exhaust emissions from a modern, high speed direct-injection (HSDI) diesel engine was investigated. Four <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> geometry’s (shape) were designed, manufactured and tested in a pre-production HSDI diesel engine installed on an eddy-current dynamometer. A series of experimental tests were performed to determined the optimum injector configuration for each <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> shape, the best bowl shape for minimum drive-cycle simulated emissions, {{and the effect of}} in-cylinder swirl ratio at various engine operating conditions. Results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combustion simulation of extreme injector configurations, correlated well with the experimental trends observed. Full-load testing to determine the optimum injector configuration for each <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> shape, indicated that exhaust emissions were very sensitive to the point of fuel impingement on the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> walls. In particular, the trend in the emission of particulates and NOx was explained in relation to the point of fuel impingement, and supported by CFD combustion simulation. The emission of smoke and particulates was found to be dependent on wall wetting and late combustion. Key features for the successful design of future HSDI <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> shapes were identified, based on the results form <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> comparison tests at a selection of the European drive cycle simulation conditions. The effect in-cylinder swirl ratio on engine performance and emissions was determined. An increase in the rate of mixing and heat release from higher swirl generally raised the emissions of NOx, but reduced smoke formation at low engine speeds.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Compression Ignition (Cl) engine has been the engine of choice for heavy duty on and off-highway power generation due to its robustness and high fuel efficiency. Cl engines also emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide (C 02) than other prime-movers. Many governments are currently promoting the reduction of C 02 emissions and hence the efficient and robust Cl engine {{is expected to be}} used increasingly in many on and off-highway sectors. However, Cl engines emit pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen (NO,), particulate matter (PM) and hydrocarbons (HC), and hence increasingly strict legislative limits to these are being phased in over the next I 0 years. To aid the development of engines that meet this legislation, designers require {{a better understanding of the}} combustion and pollution formation processes in the engine cylinder. In-cylinder air charge motion is known to fundamentally affect the mixing and combustion of the injected fuel in Cl engines and hence the emissions produced by the engine. Therefore, characterisation and quantification of the in-cylinder flow is an important step in the process of achieving the conditions necessary for optimal combustion. This research has investigated, using optical measurement techniques, the in-cylinder air flow characteristics for three different Cl engine inlet regimes. An optical engine was developed with directed and helical inlet ports, which were designed to provide similar swirl numbers as measured on steady-flow swirl test rigs. The aim of the research was to link the steady-flow test rig results with measurements taken, using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) at top dead centre (TDC). Testing involved two different <b>piston</b> <b>bowls</b> (deep and shallow <b>bowl</b> <b>pistons)</b> and three different engine speeds (800 rpm, 1200 rpm and 1600 rpm), to observe their affects on the charge air motion at TDC. A phenomenological model based on kinetic energy analysis of the flow was used in the current work for comparison with measured data. The model used measured data from the steady-flow swirl rig as initial conditions to model the flowfield of the charge air at TDC and these results were compared with measured data. The measured data compared well with the modelled data for the shallow <b>bowl</b> <b>piston,</b> with a velocity profile that was between solid body rotation and a pre-determined velocity profile in the model. Results from the model for deep <b>bowl</b> <b>piston</b> geometry showed less agreement with the measured data and this was believed to be due to the effect of squish motion on the charge air motion at TDC. The velocity profile of the different inlet port geometries exhibited good repeatability across different engine speeds. This result showed how the steady-flow swirl rigs under-predict the charge air motion for combined inlet ports. Whole field datasets are valuable for the validation of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models...|$|R

The first three parameters represents the fluid flow characteristics occurred inside cylinder which influences much to the combustion chamber where the air flows to the cylinder during the intake stroke and enhances greatly the mixing of air and fuel to give a better mixing for the combustion process.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{pollutant}} {{gases in the}} atmosphere has reached a critical state due {{to an increase in}} industrial development and the rapid growth of automobile industries that use fossil fuels. The combustion of fossil fuels produces harmful gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen monoxide (NO), soot, particulate matter (PM), etc. The use of Dimethyl Ether (DME) biofuel in diesel engines or other combustion processes have been highly regarded by researchers. Studies show that the use of pure DME in automotive engines will be possible in the near future. The present work evaluated the environmental and performance effects of changing the injection strategy (time and temperature), <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> geometry, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) composition for a DME-burning engine. The modification of <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> parameters and engine simulation were numerically performed by using AVL fire CFD code. For model validation, the calculated mean pressure and rate of heat released (RHR) were compared to the experimental data and the results showed a good agreement (under a 70 % load and 1200 -rpm engine speed). It was found that retarding injection timing (reduction in in-cylinder temperature, consequently) caused a reduction in NO emissions and increased soot formation, reciprocally; this occurred because of a reduction in temperature and a lower soot oxidation in the combustion chamber. It became clear that 3 deg before top dead center (BTDC) was the appropriate injection timing for the DME-burning heavy duty diesel engine running under 1200 rpm. Also, the parametrical modification of the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> geometry and the simultaneous decrease of Tm (<b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> depth) and R 3 (bowl inner radius) lengths were associated with lower exhaust NO emissions.

40|$|International audienceSingle {{cylinder}} optical {{engines are}} used for Internal Combustion (IC) engine research as they allow {{for the application of}} qualitative and quantitative non-intrusive, diagnostic techniques to study in-cylinder flow, mixing, combustion and emissions phenomena. Such experimental data is not only important for the validation of computational models but can also provide a detailed insight into the physical processes occurring in-cylinder which is useful for the further development of new combustion strategies such as gasoline Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Diesel Low Temperature Combustion (LTC). In this context, it is therefore important to ensure that the performance of optical engines is comparable to standard all-metal engines. A comparison of optical and all-metal engine combustion and emissions performance was performed within the present study. The objective was to investigate the principal differences between optical and all-metal engines and understand how these differences ultimately affect mixing, combustion and emissions formation processes. Experimental results reveal the significant impact of differences in combustion chamber wall temperatures between optical and standard engine <b>piston</b> <b>bowls</b> on combustion phasing and engine-out emissions. Quantitative measurements of piston wall temperatures using a laser-induced phosphorescence technique were performed which allowed the subsequent definition of appropriate engine operating strategies so as to compensate for differences in heat transfer properties. Furthermore, differences in combustion chamber geometry were also studied. Geometrical differences can arise as a result of dynamic (compressive/tensile) and thermal loading of the extended piston-liner assembly on the optical engine, potentially leading to changes in the effective Compression Ratio. In addition, intake charge dilution in optical engines is often achieved via the use of simulated Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). A comparison has been made between simulated EGR (using pure nitrogen) with real EGR under Diesel LTC conditions. Finally, "pure", single component fuels are often employed in optical Diesel engines due to laser diagnostic constraints. However, these fuels generally differ from standard Diesel fuel in terms of cetane number and fuel volatility which can significantly influence the combustion and emissions characteristics in optical engines. These aspects have also been investigated within the present study. An improved understanding of the differences between optical and all-metal engines has allowed us to develop appropriate strategies to compensate for these differences on the optical engine. It is shown here that combustion phasing (and engine-out emissions) matching between optical and all-metal engines can be achieved even for advanced LTC Diesel combustion strategies. The ability to ensure fully representative combustion and emissions behaviour of optical engines ultimately increases the value of optical engine data, highlighting the importance of using such engines as research tools for the further development of innovative, low emission combustion concepts...|$|R

40|$|Despite of the {{abundance}} of HCCI (Homogeneous Charged Compression Ignition) engine experiments, there are several unknown key characteristics, which are difficult to measure with a conventional test engine setup. First, the cylinder temperature distribution is not readily available from test measurements. Second, the instability and misfire mechanisms {{can not be easily}} analyzed by engine testing. Finally, the ability to isolate a particular variable is not always practical in testing. In this thesis, an analytical tool is used to explore HCCI combustion under more controlled conditions. A newly available KIVA-MZ model with a novel mapping scheme between CFD cells and thermodynamic zones, provides a virtual experimental environment to explore the combustion process with respect to various engine operating and design parameters. Nine engine operating and design parameters were investigated with respect to their effects on ignition timing. Equivalence ratio (0. 2 ~ 0. 4), EGR (5 %, 20 %, and 40 %), Load (7 ~ 13 mg/cycle), RPM (750 ~ 3750), wall temperature (400 K, 450 K), swirl (0. 93, 3. 93), compression ratio (12. 5, 16), <b>piston</b> geometry (<b>bowl,</b> pancake), and crevice volume (1 %, 4 %, and 8 %) are those nine parameters. The effects of these parameters on combustion efficiency and burning rate were also investigated with controlled ignition timing. Based on the model results of cylinder temperature distribution information, the design parameters were found to influence the temperature distribution more than the operating parameters did. The ignition timing is not an independently controlled variable; however, the CFD results showed that ignition timing {{is the single most important}} variable for the whole combustion process. Besides ignition timing, equivalence ratio and engine speed are the second and third most important variables for burning rate. Fast burning rate normally results in higher combustion efficiency, but the peak combustion efficient is mainly determined by the crevice volume. In order to the knowledge from the CFD parametric study results, HCCI combustion correlations were developed. These correlations were implemented into GT-Power, a leading commercial 1 D engine simulation software package handing general engine system simulation. This improved GT-Power model is a significant improvement over traditional HCCI engine control models with fixed combustion efficiency and burning duration...|$|R

The homogeneous combustion was generated by a <b>piston</b> with small <b>bowl</b> in the centre of cylinder head to represent the symmetrical side. On the other hand, the stratified combustion was produced by a piston with relatively large bowl to locate the arrived fuel during injection process.

The results of CFD calculation for homogeneous combustion were compared with the data obtained from the single-cylinder engine experiment, which includes the in-cylinder average pressure, CO, NO levels and indicated a close agreement. The important parameters to be compared and evaluated between the homogeneous and stratified combustions are cylinder pressure, engine power, mass fraction burned, CO, CO 2 and NO emissions. From the CFD study accomplished, it reveals that the homogeneous combustion has an advantage in producing more performance compared to the stratified condition, but with higher emissions level. At the same time, the stratified combustion has a capability in lowering the exhaust emissions with a consequence of less performance.

The effects of injection timing, spray angle and fuel composition are studied using {{a modified version of}} KIVA 3 V code. The objectives of this research include: 1) {{to examine the effects of}} fuel on engine performance and emissions; 2) to study the effects of spray angle on flow patterns and pollutants formation using a discrete multi- component approach; 3) to develop a new droplet evaporation model using the continuous thermodynamics formulation, which is capable in accommodating multiple distribution functions, accounts for preferential evaporation, finite diffusion and surface regression of the droplet; 4) to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model in engine applications. A numerical study is also conducted to study the effect of spray angle in a small bore high speed direct injection engine. Soot located in the squish region or the region above the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> are readily oxidized due to abundance of oxygen. Portions of fuel are burnt in the region about the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> or squish for both spray angles of 150 ?? and 70 ??. Soot located within the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> is oxidized at a much slower rate due to deficient of oxygen after combustion. Soot emissions are mainly due to soot remaining within in the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> at the end of combustion cycle. Any strategy that pushes soot out of the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> can improve the oxidation process, thus, reducing soot emission. Extra oxygen in biodiesel also helps in reducing the emission. The effects of variable cone angle spray on the performance of a diesel engine are studied. Using a variable cone angle injection extends the range of injection time without engine wall wetting, which decreases soot and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. The numerical predictions show a 10 % improvement in thermal efficiency without compromising NOx and soot emissions. The study shows that the evaporation of the fuel affects the ignition behavior and combustion quality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the evaporation and mixing processes is essential for further improvement in engine performance. A multi- component droplet evaporation model, as efficient as a traditional zero-dimensional model, yet preserving the correct description of the underlying physical process is developed in this study. The continuous thermodynamics formulation is used, for which the fuel (or liquid mixture) is described using a probability distribution function. The variation of composition in both liquid and vapor phases is represented by tracing the changes of the probability distribution function parameters. In the present study, the gamma distribution is used to represent the fuel fractions, and, the composition is tracked by tracing the mean and standard deviation of the distribution function. Finite diffusion, internal circulation, surface regression and high pressure effects are all accounted for. The model is shown to reproduce in a satisfactorily manner, experimental measurements adopted from the literature. The model is applied to predict the evaporation of single component (distribution) and multi-component droplets. The results show that the proposed model predicts the important distillation characteristics of practical fuel, which cannot be reproduced by a single component model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{droplet size}} {{distribution}} and in-cylinder mixture {{formation of a}} slit injector were investigated under varied fuel temperature and air flow conditions. This variance in fuel temperature and air flow represents the altered spray momentum and external forces acting upon the spray. Phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) was used to investigate the effect of fuel temperature and air flow on droplet size distribution. The in-cylinder mixture formation process and the factors affecting the in-cylinder mixture distribution were analyzed under various fuel temperature and air flow conditions using laser induced fluorescence (LIF). When the fuel temperature and air flow velocity increased, the smaller droplets were entrained to the upper and central parts of the spray altering the initial droplet size distribution. The reduced spray momentum decreased the spray penetration in the combustion chamber, and {{the interaction between the}} spray and <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> was degraded. This phenomenon eventually caused a relatively lean and dispersed mixture distribution near the spark plug at high fuel temperatures. The optimal spray momentum and external force depend on the fuel quantity (air-fuel ratio) and <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> shape. Consequently, the spray momentum and the external forces acting upon the spray should be optimized to form the stoichiometric and well-distributed mixture near the spark plug. 1...|$|E

In order to improve engine quality, understanding on flow properties in engine cylinder is of major importance because flow condition significantly influences engine efficiency. Capabilities in providing optimum flow conditions which include high discharge coefficient, optimum swirl ratio, and optimum tumble ratio in respective engine can result in enhancement of engine power and comfort, along with reduction of fuel consumption, exhaust emission and noise.

40|$|Abstract Particle image {{velocimetry}} (PIV) {{is applied}} to measure the vertical (r-z) plane flow structures in a light-duty direct-injection diesel engine with a realistic piston geometry. The measurements are corrected for optical distortions due to the curved <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> walls and the cylindrical liner. Although the correction procedure removes geometric distortion, within the bowl the resulting velocity vectors remain biased by the swirl velocity. Nevertheless, clear visualization of the combustion chamber flow structures is achieved. The two-dimensional divergence of the measured mean velocity fields is also explored, and {{found to be a}} useful—though qualitative — diagnostic for identifying the locations of heat release. Mean flow fields are presented and contrasted for operation both with and without fuel injection and combustion. With fuel injection, the flow is initially dominated by a single vortical structure formed by deflection of the fuel jet at the bowl wall. However, a dual-vortex structure, similar to the numerical predictions of previous studies, forms shortly thereafter. At the selected operating condition, the flow divergence estimates (and the mean flow streamlines) indicate that the bulk of the heat release takes place within the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl,</b> resulting in a much stronger flow out of the bowl than is observed without combustion. Later in the cycle, the flow leaving the bowl triggers the formation of a toroidal vortex located above the piston top, just outside the bowl mouth.

40|$|Direct {{injection}} {{diesel engines}} {{have been widely}} used in transportation and stationary power systems because of their inherent high thermal efficiency. On the other hand, emission regulations such as NOx and particulates have become more stringent from the standpoint of preserving the environment in recent years. In this study, previous results of multiple injection strategies have been further investigated to analyze the effects of narrow fuel spray angle on optimum multiple injection schemes in a heavy duty common rail direct injection diesel engine. An advanced computational fluid dynamics simulation has been carried out on a Caterpillar 3401 diesel engine for a conventional part load condition in 1600 [*]r/min at two exhaust gas recirculation rates. A good agreement of calculated and measured in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate and pollutant formation trends was obtained under various operating points. Three different included spray angles have been studied in comparison with the traditional spray injection angle. The results show that spray targeting is very effective for controlling the in-cylinder mixture distributions especially when it accompanied with various injection strategies. It was found that the optimum engine performance for simultaneous reduction of soot and NOx emissions was achieved with 105 ° included spray angle along with an optimized split injection strategy. The results show, in this case, the fuel spray impinges {{at the edge of the}} <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> and a counterclockwise flow motion is generated that pushes mixture toward the center of the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl...</b>|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{alternative}} energy and fuels has grown considerably {{in recent years}} due to increasing concern about the adverse effects of global warming, the limited sources of non-renewable feedstocks, the insecurity of their supply and associated fluctuations in their prices. However, although there is an urgent, and widely recognized, need to address these issues, selecting suitable candidate feedstocks and fuels is far from straightforward, since numerous factors must be considered when selecting promising candidates for further evaluation and, ultimately, commercial use. This thesis addresses the potential use of one alternative fuel for Diesel engines that is renewable (when produced from biomass) : dimethyl ether, DME, which is a promising candidate mainly because of its excellent life cycle efficiency and low carbon dioxide footprint (due to its renewability). A combustion system designed to use Diesel fuel is not suitable for combusting DME efficiently, especially not at high levels of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), {{which is used to}} control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX). Hence, the aims of the work this thesis is based upon were to: (i) elucidate the requirements of a combustion system using DME that enables faster combustion, providing higher efficiency while yielding lower emissions, and (ii) implement appropriate modifications to the test engine. This was done by adapting the engine’s combustion system to the intrinsic characteristics of the fuel. Piston and nozzle geometries were selected as the most important and relevant hardware parameters for achieving this aim. These were re-designed and the effects of the re-configurations were evaluated in combustion computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses, heavy duty single-cylinder engine experiments and spray chamber studies. Combusting DME in a Diesel engine has faced challenges of poor efficiency, hardware considerations by peak cylinder pressures and exhaust gas temperatures, and high emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) as large amounts of EGR have been used to suppress NOX formation. However, these challenges can be solved by appropriate adjustments of the combustion system, which can be summarized as follows. First, the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> geometry should enable greater tangential and radial spreading of the flames, thereby exposing a larger flame area to the surrounding air (and combustion products). Second, the included angle should allow for sufficiently large distances between the spray axis and <b>piston</b> <b>bowl,</b> and optimal spreading of the sprays/flames when interacting with the bowl. Third, the flow should be lower than flows historically used, to enhance mixing and thereby limit the extent of very rich zones impinging on the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl.</b> Fourth, the number of orifices should be correlated to <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> diameter to balance the advantages of increasing the total spray area and the disadvantage of reducing their spatial distribution in the bowl. Fifth, the injection pressure should be increased to promote mixing and thereby reduce CO emissions. In conclusion, {{it has been shown that}} a combustion system for DME can be considerably improved by using a piston design that promotes flame spread; a nozzle configuration that improves mixing late during the diffusion combustion; and raising the injection pressure. These modifications result in significantly reduced exhaust emissions and increased engine efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} the {{conventional}} diesel combustion in small-size passenger car engines is an object of research. The combustion process can be divided in the sub-processes injection, mixture formation, auto-ignition and combustion. In the present work different laser-optical measurement technologies were used to receive information about the combustion in a passenger car diesel engine. The investigations were carried out in a cylinder of a passenger car diesel engine, modified for the optical access. Diesel as the fuel was used. The combustion of the pre-injection spray, which serves mainly for the reduction of combustion noise, was qualitatively visualized for an 8 hole nozzle. Obviously, during pre-injection combustion soot is formed. Some of this soot remains up {{to the beginning of}} the main injection event. This is confirmed by flame luminescence imaging of the auto-ignition of the main injection with the standard 6 hole nozzle. Soot formation and soot oxidation of the main injection were examined in detail under different conditions by Laser-Induced Incandescence (LII) as well as the Laser Extinction Method (LEM). Employing both measurement techniques the temporal development of the local soot distribution and the average soot volume fraction were determined till the late mixture-controlled combustion phase. In general, a lower injection pressure and the use of the 8 hole nozzle showed significant differences in the soot distribution in comparison to the reference operating point. The influence of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the soot oxidation was examined by a single-cycle analysis. This revealed that by application of EGR a raised number of soot pockets appears without soot luminescence. With EGR combustion reactions cease more often in the presence of soot. Therefore, soot is only slowly further oxidised in these regions. At the end of the late mixture-controlled combustion phase the Spontaneous Raman Scattering (SRS) could be applied successfully for determination of temperature and mole fraction distribution of oxygen and carbon dioxide above the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl.</b> From the results it can be reasoned, that soot emissions must predominantly result from the slowing down of the oxidation reactions at low temperatures. Local oxygen concentrations are high, and hence should not be the primary cause of soot oxidation limitation. Soot deposition on the bowl surface was estimated by determination of the transmission reduction of the glass <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> based on LII signal. It was shown by a comparison with exhaust soot emissions of different operating conditions that soot on the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> does not contribute directly to the exhaust soot emissions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{environmental}} concerns are posing {{a great challenge}} to DI Diesel engines. Increasingly tightening emission limits require a higher attention on combustion efficiency. A high efficiency Diesel engine can be developed only mastering all the parameters that can affect the combustion and, therefore, NOx and soot emissions. In this scenario, computational fluid-dynamics can prove its power guaranteeing {{a deeper understanding of}} mixture formation process and combustion. In this work, the development of an engine in order to fulfill Tier 4 i emission standard will be presented, the Tier 4 i compliance must be reached without an excessive increase of the final cost of the engine. Originally, the engine was a two-valve engine supplied with a DPF, since no SCR aftertreatment is supplied, NOx emission target are achieved through external exhaust gas recirculation and retarding the start of injection. Through combustion process simulations, performed with the CFD code KIVA 3 D, varying different geometric parameters and the intensity of the swirl ratio, the interaction between the swirl flow field, generated by the intake duct, the reverse squish motion, and motions aerodynamically generated by spray has been investigated leading to a better interaction between the flow field, the fuel spray and the <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> geometry and to the definition of a new engine lay-out. The study shows how, given the need of retarded injection for limiting NOx emission, the decrease of swirl ratio, when combined with a proper <b>piston</b> <b>bowl</b> design, allows a significant decrease of soot emissions and the achievement of Tier 4 i emission standard.
