5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands.

5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily nationwide, and the beer {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Bolckow and Vaughan {{built their}} first blast {{furnaces}} at Witton Park, founding the Witton Park Ironworks.

5|$|Portraiture was an {{important}} component of Rodin's oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{arguments for}} initially producing Geysers steam wells at wellhead pressures {{in excess of}} 200 psig instead of the normal practice of <b>producing</b> <b>at</b> minimum wellhead pressures. A conceptual model is presented which defines a flow equilibrium resulting from a “constant pressure source” whose location {{is a function of}} the withdrawal rate from the reservoir. Based on this model, it is argued that <b>producing</b> <b>at</b> elevated wellhead pressures is equal to <b>producing</b> <b>at</b> minimum wellhead pressures, assuming the mass withdrawal is the same. Additional benefits of <b>producing</b> <b>at</b> elevated wellhead pressures are discussed and include minimizing casing and reservoir rock thermal transients and scaling and bridging of the wellbore. SFGI’s experience has been favorable but due to a very high capacity factor and very few outages, a comparison of performance of other areas of The Geysers is inconclusive. 6 refs., 3 figs...|$|R
