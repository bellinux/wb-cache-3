25|$|The {{place where}} {{emergency}} psychiatric services are delivered are most {{commonly referred to}} as <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>Emergency</b> Services, <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>Emergency</b> Care Centers, or Comprehensive <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>Emergency</b> Programs. Mental health professionals from a wide area of disciplines, including medicine, nursing, psychology, and social work in these settings alongside psychiatrists and emergency physicians. The facilities, sometimes housed in a psychiatric hospital, psychiatric ward, or emergency room, provide immediate treatment to both voluntary and involuntary patients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Within a protected environment, <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> services exist to provide brief stay of two or three days to gain a diagnostic clarity, find appropriate alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for the patient, and to treat those patients whose symptoms can be improved within that brief period of time. Even precise psychiatric diagnoses are a secondary priority compared with interventions in a crisis setting. The functions of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> services are to assess patients' problems, implement a short-term treatment consisting of no more than ten meetings with the patient, procure a 24-hour holding area, mobilize teams to carry out interventions at patients' residences, utilize emergency management services to prevent further crises, be aware of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric resources, and provide 24/7 telephone counseling.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol was {{considered}} indispensable for treating <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> situations, although the newer atypical drugs have gained {{greater role in}} a number of situations as outlined in a series of consensus reviews published between 2001 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Involuntary commitment, or sectioning, {{refers to}} {{situations}} where police officers, health officers, or health professionals classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, gravely disabled, or mentally ill {{according to the}} applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service setting, a preliminary professional assessment is completed {{which may or may}} not result in involuntary treatment. Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment will exist. While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} from India is conspicuous by paucity of well-planned studies on <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Trivedi and Gupta (1982) in a retrospective {{study found that}} 2. 9 % of the total patients coming to emergency room of a general hospital were diagnosed to be having psychiatric illness.

25|$|Patients with {{psychotic}} {{symptoms are}} common in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service settings. The determination {{of the source of}} the psychosis can be difficult. Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service setting {{will not be able to}} provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.|$|E
25|$|Individuals may {{arrive in}} <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service {{settings}} {{through their own}} voluntary request, a referral from another health professional, or through involuntary commitment. Care of patients requiring psychiatric intervention usually encompasses crisis stabilization of many serious and potentially life-threatening conditions which could include acute or chronic mental disorders or symptoms similar to those conditions.|$|E
25|$|In some locations, {{such as the}} United States, {{voluntary}} hospitalizations are {{outnumbered by}} involuntary commitments {{partly due to the}} fact that insurance tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service settings admit approximately one third of patients from assertive community treatment centers. Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Today the {{availability}} of specialists is limited for psychiatric patients in rural areas, especially during <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergencies.</b> To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway has implemented a new decentralised on-call system in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergencies,</b> by which psychiatrists are accessible by videoconference 24 / 7. In September 2011, the new on-call system was established in clinical practice for patients and health staff at three regional psychiatric centres in Northern Norway. Although {{a wide variety of}} therapies have been successfully delivered by videoconference, there is limited research on the use of videoconferenced consultations with patients in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergencies.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the use of videoconference in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergencies</b> based on the implementation of this first Norwegian tele-psychiatric service in emergency care. Methods/design The research project is an exploratory case study of a new videoconference service in operation. By applying in-depth interviews with patients, specialists and local health-care staff, we will identify factors that facilitate and hinder use of videoconferencing in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergencies,</b> and explore how videoconferenced consultations matter for patients, professional practice and cooperation between levels in psychiatric care. By using an on-going project as the site of research, the case is especially well-suited for generating reliable and valid empirical data.

25|$|Emergency {{psychiatry}} is {{the clinical}} application of psychiatry in emergency settings. Conditions requiring psychiatric interventions may include attempted suicide, substance abuse, depression, psychosis, violence or other rapid changes in behavior. <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> services are rendered by {{professionals in the}} fields of medicine, nursing, psychology and social work. The demand for emergency psychiatric services has rapidly increased throughout the world since the 1960s, especially in urban areas. Care for patients in situations involving emergency psychiatry is complex.|$|E
25|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy is}} a {{controversial}} form of treatment which cannot be involuntarily applied in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service settings. Instances wherein {{a patient is}} depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative. While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.|$|E
25|$|Treatments in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service {{settings}} are typically transitory {{in nature and}} only exist to provide dispositional solutions and/or to stabilize life-threatening conditions. Once stabilized, patients suffering chronic conditions may be transferred to a setting which can provide long term psychiatric rehabilitation. Prescribed treatments within the emergency service setting vary dependent upon the patient's condition. Different forms of psychiatric medication, psychotherapy, or electroconvulsive therapy {{may be used in}} the emergency setting. The introduction and efficacy of psychiatric medication as a treatment option in psychiatry has reduced the utilization of physical restraints in emergency settings, by reducing dangerous symptoms resulting from acute exacerbation of mental illness or substance intoxication.|$|E

25|$|As of 2000, the World Health Organization {{estimated}} {{one million}} suicides {{in the world}} each year. There are countless more suicide attempts. <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service settings exist to treat the mental disorders {{associated with an increased}} risk of completed suicide or suicide attempts. Mental health professionals in these settings are expected to predict acts of violence patients may commit against themselves (or others), even though the complex factors leading to a suicide stem from so many sources, including psychosocial, biological, interpersonal, anthropological and religious. These mental health professionals will use any resources available to them to determine risk factors, make an overall assessment, and decide on any necessary treatment.|$|E
25|$|Aggression can be {{the result}} of both {{internal}} and external factors that create a measurable activation in the autonomic nervous system. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service settings are homicidal in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide. Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, paranoid personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc. Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatment}} methods {{may be used}} in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service settings. Brief psychotherapy can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected. The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals. The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective. If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{disasters}} and man-made hazards can cause severe psychological stress in victims surrounding the event. Emergency management often includes <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> services {{designed to help}} victims cope with the situation. The impact of disasters can cause people to feel shocked, overwhelmed, immobilized, panic-stricken, or confused. Hours, days, months and even years after a disaster, individuals can experience tormenting memories, vivid nightmares, develop apathy, withdrawal, memory lapses, fatigue, loss of appetite, insomnia, depression, irritability, panic attacks, or dysphoria. Due to the typically disorganized and hazardous environment following a disaster, mental health professionals typically assess and treat patients as rapidly as possible. Unless a condition is threatening life of the patient, or others around the patient, other medical and basic survival considerations are managed first. Soon after a disaster clinicians may make themselves available to allow individuals to ventilate to relieve feelings of isolation, helplessness and vulnerability. Dependent upon {{the scale of the}} disaster, many victims may suffer from both chronic or acute post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients suffering severely from this disorder often are admitted to psychiatric hospitals to stabilize the individual.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1960s {{the demand}} for {{emergency}} psychiatric services has endured a rapid growth due to deinstitutionalization both in Europe and the United States. Deinstitutionalization, in some locations, {{has resulted in a}} larger number of severely mentally ill people living in the community. [...] There have been increases in the number of medical specialties, and the multiplication of transitory treatment options, such as psychiatric medication. The actual number of psychiatric emergencies has also increased significantly, especially in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> service settings located in urban areas. Emergency psychiatry has involved the evaluation and [...] treatment of unemployed, homeless and other disenfranchised populations. Emergency psychiatry services sometimes can be accessibility, convenience, and anonymous. While many of the patients who used <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> services shared common sociological and demographic characteristics, the symptoms and needs expressed did not conform to any single psychiatric profile. The individualized care needed for patients utilizing <b>psychiatric</b> <b>emergency</b> services is evolving, requiring an always changing and sometimes complex treatment approach.|$|E
