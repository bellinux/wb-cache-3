It {{has been found that}} the latent period of the <b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>response</b> in man is approximately 3 seconds. However, it has also been noted that the latent period of affective responses to photos of men and women can end within 0.8 seconds. The James-Lange theory contends that such affective responses result from reverberations from the viscera. Cannon pointed out that the time required for nerve impulses to travel from the brain to the periphery and back to the brain again could not occur quickly enough to be the cause of such emotional responses.|$|E
40|$|There {{is already}} an {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} vascular and sweating responses which are evoked in the limbs by experimental painful stimuli. As far as the present authors are aware, previous investigators are all agreed that these responses show no evidence of " local sign "; that is to say, a painful stimulus applied to one limb produces an equal response {{on each side of}} the body. This point has been studied by Sattler (1943), who also reviewed the previous literature. Sattler, using the Hardy-Wolff stimulator, was unable to find any evidence of local sign in the limbs, either in the vasomotor responses, studied plethysmographically, or in the sudomotor responses, as measured by changes in the skin resistance (<b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>response).</b> H...|$|E
40|$|THE {{relation}} of the cerebral cortex to {{the activity of the}} sympathetic nervous system is not yet fully clear. The clinical and experimental observations, which have recently been reviewed by Kennard (1937), have been conflicting, and there have been few quantitative determinations of the effects of cortical stimulation and ablation upon the functions of the human sympathetic nervous system. Many indices of sympathetic function have been used in the past, peripheral vascular changes, the <b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>response,</b> sweating, pupillary changes, and visceral contraction being the most usual. The " galvanic skin reflex " is dependent on an intact sympathetic nervous system, and may be accurately measured. It has therefore been widely used as an index of sympathetic activity in studies of cortical function. In 1905 Bechterew stimulated the medial part of the anterior sigmoid gyrus in the cat and caused sweating of the pads. The response was greater on the contralateral side. Winkler (1908) obtained a symmetrically equal response to similar stimulation. In 193...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{major and}} minor forms of {{hereditary}} hyperekplexia (HE) are characterized by excessive startle responses, which are accompanied by transient stiffness only in major HE; patients with major HE also have continuous stiffness during infancy. A point mutation has been identified for major HE in the gene encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the glycine receptor but not for minor HE. OBJECTIVE: To measure startle reflexes and autonomic responses in the {{major and minor}} forms of HE in the original Dutch HE pedigree. DESIGN: Startle reflexes and autonomic responses were studied with 3 series of 20 auditory stimuli with intervals of 10 seconds (at 90 and 113 dB) and 60 seconds (at 113 dB). SETTING: A university hospital neurologic department. PATIENTS: Four patients with minor and 9 patients with major HE (patient groups) (a part of the Dutch HE family pedigree) and 20 healthy controls (control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Startle movements were quantified with latencies and areas of electromyographic bursts of the following 4 muscles: the orbicular muscle of the eye, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the biceps muscle of the arm, and thenar muscles. Autonomic reactions were measured with <b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>responses.</b> RESULTS. The 4 muscles contracted in similar order in the groups. The onset latencies of the orbicular muscle of the eye, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the biceps muscle of the arm were significantly prolonged in patients with minor HE (P <. 006). The frequencies of occurrence of the electromyographic bursts were not different in the minor HE and major HE groups, but they were significantly higher in both patient groups compared {{with those in the}} control group (P <. 001). The magnitude of the startle responses did not differ between the 2 patient groups (P =. 4), but it was larger in both patient groups than in the control group (P <. 001). Startle habituation in the minor HE group was much weaker than in the major HE group (P <. 001) or in the control group (P <. 001). The size of <b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>responses</b> (P =. 1) and the degree of habituation (P =. 24) in the minor HE group did not differ from those in the major HE group. Compared with that in the control group, the size of <b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>responses</b> in the minor HE group was larger (P <. 001) and they habituated stronger (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The differences in the startle pattern between major HE and minor HE agree with the clinical and genetic findings: only major HE constitutes part of the HE phenotype. The cause of the minor HE is, as yet, unknow...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{hereditary}} hyperekplexia have excessive startle {{responses that}} {{are accompanied by}} transient stiffness and also continuous stiffness in infancy. A point of mutation has been identified for the major form of hereditary hyperekplexia in the gene encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the glycine receptor. OBJECTIVE: To measure startle reflexes and autonomic responses in the major form of hereditary hyperekplexia in the original Dutch pedigree. DESIGN: Startle reflexes and autonomic responses were examined by administering 3 series of 20 auditory stimuli at intervals of 10 seconds (90 and 113 dB) and 60 seconds (113 dB). SETTING: The Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology at the Leiden University Hospital, Leiden, the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Nine patients with the major form of hyperekplexia and 20 healthy controls. Of the 9 patients, 5 took medication. The patients {{are part of the}} Dutch hyperekplexia pedigree. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Startle responses were quantified with latency periods and areas of electromyographic bursts of the orbicular muscle of the eye, sternocleidomastoid and biceps muscles, and the thenar muscles. Autonomic reactions were measured with psychogalvanic responses and beat to beat changes of blood pressure and heart rate. RESULTS: The electromyographic bursts of the 4 muscles occurred in similar order in both patients and controls. The onset of the latency periods in the patient group was significantly (P <. 001) prolonged in patients who took medication. Without medication, patients had shorter latency periods of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (P =. 003) than controls. The electromyographic burst occurred significantly more often in patients than in controls (P <. 001). The areas of the bursts were significantly larger in patients than in controls (P <. 001); the degree of habituation was significantly stronger in patients than in controls (P <. 001). The amplitude of the <b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>response</b> was increased in hyperekplexia, and the degree of habituation was significantly weaker in patients than in controls. Blood pressure and heart rate did not clearly react in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Motor startle responses are stronger and show more habituation in patients with hereditary hyperekplexia than in controls. The excessive responses include the <b>psychogalvanic</b> <b>response.</b> Increased responses do not necessarily indicate decreased habituation in hyperekplexi...|$|E
