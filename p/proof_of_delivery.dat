2500|$|According to PayPal, {{it protects}} sellers {{in a limited}} fashion via the Seller Protection Policy. In general the Seller Protection Policy is {{intended}} to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> to the buyer. PayPal states the Seller Protection Policy is [...] "designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non-receipt of any merchandise". The policy includes a list of [...] "Exclusions" [...] which itself includes [...] "Intangible goods", [...] "Claims for receipt of goods 'not as described and [...] "Total reversals over the annual limit". There are also other restrictions {{in terms of the}} sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect). The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation (e.g., Sale of Goods Act) and in addition it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions.|$|E

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{hash table}} (DHT) is a peer-to-peer network that offers {{the function of}} a classic hash table, but where different key-value pairs are stored at different nodes on the network. Like a classic hash table, the main function provided by a DHT is key lookup, which retrieves the value stored at a given key. Examples of DHT protocols include Chord, Pastry, Kademlia and Tapestry. Such DHT protocols certain correctness and performance guarantees, but formal verification typically discovers border cases that violate those guarantees. In his PhD thesis, Tianxiang Lu reported correctness problems in published versions of Pastry and developed a model called LuPastry, for which he provided a partial <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> correct <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> lookup messages assuming no node failure, mechanized in the TLA+ Proof System. In analyzing Lu's proof, I discovered that it contained unproven assumptions, and found counterexamples to several of these assumptions. The contribution of this thesis is threefold. First, I present LuPastry+, a revised TLA+ specification of LuPastry. Aside from needed bug fixes, LuPastry+ contains new definitions that make the specification more modular and significantly improve proof automation. Second, I present a complete TLA+ <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> correct <b>delivery</b> for LuPastry+. Third, I prove that the final step of the node join process of LuPastry/LuPastry+ {{is not necessary to}} achieve consistency. In particular, I develop a new specification with a simpler node join process, which I denote by Simplified LuPastry+, and prove correct <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> lookup messages for this new specification. The <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> correctness of Simplified LuPastry+ is written by reusing the proof for LuPastry+, which represents a success story in proof reuse, especially for <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> this size. Each <b>of</b> the two <b>proofs</b> amounts to over 32, 000 proof steps; to my knowledge, they are currently the largest proofs written in the TLA+ language, and [...] -together with Lu's proof [...] -the only examples of applying full theorem proving for the verification of DHT protocol...|$|R
40|$|Adipose {{tissue is}} pivotal in the {{regulation}} of energy homeostasis through the balance of energy storage and expenditure and as an endocrine organ. An inadequate mass and/or alterations in the metabolic and endocrine functions of adipose tissue underlie the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. To fully understand the metabolic and molecular mechanism(s) involved in adipose dysfunction, in vivo genetic modification of adipocytes holds great potential. Here, we demonstrate that adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, especially serotypes 8 and 9, mediated efficient transduction of white (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult lean and obese diabetic mice. The use of short versions of the adipocyte protein 2 or uncoupling protein- 1 promoters or micro-RNA target sequences enabled highly spe-cific, long-term AAV-mediated transgene expression in white or brown adipocytes.

Despite satisfactory results of BTX-A injection, the endoscopic procedure still has risks of anaesthetic and operative complications. Several studies have investigated more simple ways to deliver BTX-A to the detrusor muscle but with limited success. In our study, we assessed the evidence <b>of</b> BTX-A <b>delivery</b> using a newly modulated hyaluronan-phosphatidylethanolamine (HA-PE) carrier in a rat model through BTX-A-HA-PE bladder instillations.

Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of injected animals at the 11 th postinjection week revealed significantly higher transgene activity in animals receiving compacted DNA plasmids when compared to animals receiving naked DNA. There was minimal evidence of brain inflammation.

40|$|AbstractA potent anti-vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{biologic}} and a compatible delivery system were co-evaluated for protection against wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) over a 6 month period following a single intravitreal (IVT) injection. The anti-VEGF molecule is dimeric, containing two different anti-VEGF domain antibodies (dAb) {{attached to a}} human IgG 1 Fc region: a dual dAb. The delivery system is based on microparticles of PolyActive™ hydrogel co-polymer. The molecule was evaluated both in vitro for potency against VEGF and in ocular VEGF-driven efficacy models in vivo. The dual dAb is highly potent, showing a lower IC 50 than aflibercept in VEGF receptor binding assays (RBAs) and retaining activity upon release from microparticles over 12 months in vitro. Microparticles released functional dual dAb in rabbit and primate eyes over 6 months at sufficient levels to protect Cynomolgus against laser-induced grade IV choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). This demonstrates <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> concept for <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> an anti-VEGF molecule within a sustained-release system, showing protection in a pre-clinical primate model of wet AMD over 6 months.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a Self-Interest-Driven (SID) {{incentive}} scheme to stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes for ad dissemination in autonomous mobile social networks. As a key innovation of SID, we introduce “virtual checks” {{to eliminate the}} needs of accurate knowledge about whom and how many credits ad provider should pay. A virtual check is included in each ad packet. When an intended receiver receives the packet {{for the first time}} from an intermediate node, the former authorizes the latter a digitally signed check, which serves as a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> successful ad <b>delivery.</b> Multiple copies <b>of</b> a virtual check can be created and signed by different receivers. When a node that owns a signed check meets the ad provider, it requests the provider to cash the check. Both ad packets and signed checks can be traded among mobile nodes. We propose the effective mechanisms to define virtual rewards for ad packets and virtual checks, and formulate the nodal interaction as a twoplayer cooperative game, whose solution is obtained by the Nash Bargaining Theorem. Extensive simulations are carried out to compare SID with other existing incentive algorithms under real world mobility traces. I...|$|R
40|$|The ever-more-capable smart {{mobile phone}} {{gave birth to}} a novel sensing paradigm, {{participatory}} sensing. In the application environment of mobile participatory sensing networks, mobile equipment is usually weakly connected. Due to uncertainty of connection, mobile nodes sometimes need encounter opportunities to accomplish data communication and transmission. However, the participants' reluctance would diminish their enthusiasm if there is no incentive mechanism. To address this nontrivial issue, we propose reputation-based incentive schemes to motivate participants to disseminate reliable data in participatory sensing system, named RIDD, while minimizing incentive cost for maintaining sufficient number of reliable participants. When an intended receiver receives the data packet from a participant, the receiver authorizes the participant by an acknowledgment message within an encryption code automatically generated by the data packet, which serves as a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> successful data <b>delivery.</b> RIDD evaluates participants using reputation degree calculated according to the encryption code, encouraging reliable participants to keep being interested in the participatory service with rewards. We conduct simulations in different scenarios. The results show that RIDD remarkably increases the winning probability of participants who disseminate accurate data and reduces the cost for retaining sufficient number of reliable participants.
