In experiment 1 the monkeys {{were given the}} choice between tap water and defined concentrations of citric acid, ascorbic acid, malic acid, acetic acid, or tannic acid dissolved in tap water. In experiment 2 the animals were given the choice between a 50 mM sucrose solution and defined concentrations of the same acids dissolved in a 50 mM sucrose solution. With both procedures Saimiri sciureus significantly discriminated concentrations as low as 10 mM ascorbic acid and acetic acid, 5 mM citric acid and malic acid, and 0. 2 mM tannic acid from the alternative stimulus. The results showed: (1) that squirrel monkeys respond to the same range of acid concentrations as other nonhuman primate species tested so far, (2) that Saimiri sciureus detects food-associated acids at concentrations well below those present in most fruits, and (3) that the responsiveness of this New World primate to acidic tastants was largely unaffected {{by the addition of}} a sweet-tasting substance.

METHODS: Eighty women (40 with a foetus in breech presentation and 40 with a foetus in cephalic presentation) with a gestational age from 36 weeks onwards were offered scenarios of vaginal and caesarean breech delivery in which 1 -month and 2 -year neonatal and maternal complication rates were varied; expectant fathers (when present) were interviewed separately. Thresholds for complication rates where patients switch preferences were visualised graphically in trade-off curves.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between obesity and taste, especially sweet taste, {{has been and}} is of interest. From {{this point of view}} of a small primate, the lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), is of particular interest. It goes through a yearly cycle of physiological changes, one of which is an extreme variation in body weight of up to 100 %. This occurs concomitantly with significant changes of the animal's liking for sucrose; measured by two-bottle preference tests, the threshold for sucrose changes from 28 - 45 in lean to 77 - 105 mM in obese animals. It is possible that a change in peripheral taste sensitivity might be the cause for these preference changes. To test this possibility we studied the ability of M. murinus to taste sucrose with electrophysiological and conditioned taste aversion techniques. The electrophysiological recordings were obtained from the chorda tympani proper nerve in two heavy and three lean animals. We did not record any difference between the two groups in their neural response to a series of sucrose concentrations. Conditioned taste aversion experiments with 200 mM sucrose as conditioning stimulus and 50 and 200 mM sucrose as test stimuli gave similar results.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the taste responsiveness of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) to seven substances tasting sweet to humans and to compare the results with those of other primate species. Using a two-bottle preference test (1 min) I found that the taste preference thresholds of the chimpanzees for five food-associated carbohydrates ranged between 20 - 30 mM for sucrose, 20 - 50 mM for fructose, 60 - 80 mM for glucose, 50 - 80 mM for maltose, and 30 - 80 mM for lactose. Taste preference thresholds for two steviol glycosides ranged from 0. 04 - 0. 05 mM for stevioside, and 0. 03 - 0. 05 mM for rebaudioside A. The chimpanzees displayed clear preferences for all sweet-tasting substances presented. In line with data obtained in other primates, the taste <b>preference</b> <b>threshold</b> of the chimpanzees for sucrose was lower compared to the other carbohydrates presented and the taste preference thresholds for stevioside and rebaudioside A were lower compared to sucrose. In general, the taste sensitivity of the chimpanzees fell into the range of data reported in other nonhuman primate species. Interestingly, the taste preference thresholds of the chimpanzees reported here are similar to the taste detection thresholds obtained in humans, despite the fact that the former are only a conservative approximation of an animal’s taste sensitivity.

40|$|Abstract Ripe fruit eating {{shapes the}} {{behavior}} {{of most of the}} apes. Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are very different sizes and, conse-quently, have been traditionally viewed as ecologically distinct, but few studies have explored the behavioral and physiological foundations of their diets. Debate continues on the extent that large-bodied gorillas may be less selective and more opportunistic fruit eaters than chimpanzees. Taste responses have been predicted to relate to body size and digestive strategies. This study employs laboratory research on taste perception and discrimination among captive zoo-housed chim-panzees and relates it to previous work on gorillas to better characterize diets and niche separation among these apes. During the captive trials, differences were recorded in consumption patterns of water and vary-ing concentrations of dilute aqueous fructose (sweet) and tannic acid solutions (astringent), compounds commonly found in wild foods. The chimpanzees exhibited similar <b>preference</b> <b>thresholds</b> for fructose (50 mM) to other primates studied. They exhibited slightly lower inhibition thresholds for tannic acid solutions than gorillas, but higher than smaller pri-mates studied to date. These preliminary findings suggest that tannin tolerance may well be mediated by body size, though possible species differences in sali-vary proteins or other sensory differences remain to be explored. This research furthers our efforts to under-stand the roles of body size and physiological adap-tations in shaping diet and niche separation of chimpanzees and gorillas...|$|R

To this end a two-bottle preference test of brief duration (1 min) was employed. When presented at {{a concentration of}} 200 mM, the spider monkeys significantly preferred three proteinogenic amino acids (Glycine, L-Proline and L-Alanine) over fresh water whereas four other amino acids were significantly rejected (L-Tyrosine, L-Valine, L-Cysteine and L-Isoleucine). At a concentration of 100 mM, seven proteinogenic amino acids were significantly preferred (Glycine, L-Proline, L-Alanine, L-Glutamic acid, L-Aspartic acid, L-Serine and L-Lysine) whereas one was significantly rejected (L-Tryptophan). A comparison between the taste qualities of the amino acids as described by humans and taste preference/rejection responses observed with the spider monkeys suggests a fairly high degree of agreement in perception of these taste substances between the two species. When given the choice between fresh water and defined concentrations of two amino acids that taste sweet to humans the spider monkeys were found to significantly discriminate concentrations as low as 10 - 50 mM of Glycine and 10 - 40 mM of L-Proline from the solvent. This suggests that spider monkeys are similar in their taste sensitivity for Glycine and L-Proline compared to humans and slightly more sensitive compared to mice...|$|R

Building {{on the concept of}} the ‘financial trilemma’, it argues that different bank internationalisation patterns in the seven northern member states explain different preferences on the transfer of supervisory powers over less significant banks to the ECB. In particular, the reach of internationalisation into a national banking system – notably the extent to which even smaller banks were exposed to foreign banking operations – is shown to be the core factor explaining different national <b>preferences</b> on <b>threshold.</b> In the five countries with a large number of small and parochial alternative (cooperative and savings) banks, it is necessary to examine the system-specific structures of these banks to explain better the reach of internationalisation and national <b>preferences</b> on the <b>threshold.</b> Determined German opposition to ECB supervision of smaller alternative banks is juxtaposed with either less hostile or more positive support of at least four other countries despite the important presence of small alternative banks...|$|R
