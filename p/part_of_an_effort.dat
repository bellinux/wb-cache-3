5|$|Hashimoto's {{submarine}} {{then returned}} to Japan, {{one of the few}} such ships to survive the war. Hashimoto was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution at the court-martial of Charles B. McVay III, the commanding officer of Indianapolis, a move which was controversial at the time. He was later <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to exonerate McVay, which was eventually successful. Hashimoto later became a Shinto priest. He died in 2000.|$|E
5|$|SM U-17 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 21 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. U-17 sank an Italian destroyer in July 1916 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to disrupt the Otranto Barrage but sank no other ships during the war. The boat survived the war and was delivered to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> by MirCorp to {{refurbish}} and privatize the aging Mir space station, which was {{nearing the end}} of its operational life. Further commercially funded missions beyond Soyuz TM-30 were originally planned to continue the restoration efforts of the then 14-year-old space station, but insufficient funding and investment ultimately led to the de-orbit of the station in early 2001.|$|E

50|$|Designed by Auckland {{architect}} Thomas Mahoney {{and built}} John P. Murray in 1903, both the Board (established 1886) {{and the building}} were <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Hamiltonians and the broader Waikato to separate themselves from their more populous northern province, Auckland. The false-fronted single storey office building of brick and concrete, in Stripped Classical design, has a decorative pressed metal ceiling in the board room.|$|R
5|$|The new World Trade Center complex will {{eventually}} include five high-rise office buildings built along Greenwich Street, {{as well as}} the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood. The construction of the new building is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex.|$|E
5|$|U-17 {{primarily}} operated from Cattaro, patrolling off the Italian and Albanian coasts. The submarine {{had several}} opportunities to sink merchant ships and warships throughout the war, but sank only one Italian destroyer in July 1916 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to disrupt the}} Otranto Barrage. At {{the end of the}} war, U-17 was undergoing repairs at Pola. She was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was {{in decline}} across the league as the Great Depression took hold. The Habs posted a losing record in 1932–33, leading to still smaller crowds. Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to cut costs. The move {{was not a}} popular one, and fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a {{standing}} ovation when he scored against the Canadiens {{on the last day}} of the 1934–35 season.|$|E

5|$|Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, {{which were}} {{designated}} the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies {{of oil and}} other important raw materials. This formed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.|$|E
5|$|Offensive {{additions}} included halfback Ara Parseghian {{and quarterback}} George Terlep, {{but the most}} significant signing {{of the year was}} Dub Jones. Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick describes this trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A. Tittle from Louisiana State University, but were forced to send him to the Baltimore Colts as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to balance talent among the AAFC's teams during the league's third year of play.|$|E
5|$|The London Borough of Hillingdon's Hillingdon Civic Centre {{was built}} in Uxbridge High Street in 1973, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to unite the {{services}} of the council, which had formed in 1965 with the merger of the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge, Ruislip-Northwood Urban District, Hayes and Harlington Urban District and Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District. Before the new building was completed, council services had been spread throughout Uxbridge {{and the rest of}} the borough and various buildings, as a result of the merging of the former district councils.|$|E

5|$|The {{entry of}} a new {{ownership}} group of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the offseason that included Branch Rickey affected the Browns' schedule in 1948. Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers. The plan was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to bring {{more attention to the}} AAFC and help attendance by sending its most successful team on a cross-country road trip, a strategy that had worked in baseball.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to establish}} a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E

5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2013, Vieira {{announced}} that after eleven {{seasons with the}} syndicated Millionaire, she would be leaving the show as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to focus on other projects in her career. She finalized taping of her last episodes with the show in November 2012. While Philbin briefly considered {{a return to the}} show, Cedric the Entertainer was introduced as her successor when season twelve premiered on September 2, 2013. On April 30, 2014, Deadline {{announced that}} Cedric had decided to leave the show in order to lighten his workload, resulting in him being succeeded by Terry Crews for the 2014–15 season. Crews was succeeded by Chris Harrison, host of The Bachelor and its spin-offs, when season 14 premiered on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} both Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to destroy the}} landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried {{to blow up the}} bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker. Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E
