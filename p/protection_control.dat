5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of uranium were amassed {{and tens of}} thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material <b>Protection,</b> <b>Control,</b> and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{industrial}} and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes {{are used as}} coupling agents to adhere fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers to certain polymer matrices, stabilizing the composite material. In other words, silane coats the glass fibers to create better adhesion to the polymer matrix. They {{can also be used}} to couple a bio-inert layer on a titanium implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonry <b>protection,</b> <b>control</b> of graffiti, applying polycrystalline silicon layers on silicon wafers when manufacturing semiconductors, and sealants. The semiconductor industry used about 300 metric tons per year of silane in the late 1990s. More recently, a growth in low-cost solar photovoltaic module manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The PECVD process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To reduce that waste and the ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further several recycling efforts have been developed.)". , [...]|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{developments}} mentioned above, {{a new concept}} of the integrated wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> (IWAPC) has been proposed recently. The main focus of the concept [16, 17] is the integration between the <b>protection</b> and <b>control,</b> particularly at the wide-area or regional level, aimed to provide a number of benefits to the future <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> system, e.g., the potential to merge the three lines of defence system and on-line self-healing decision making, {{in order to prevent}} cascading tripping of large area power network. The concept of integrated wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> is introduced, in which a three-level hierarchically coordinated system, supported by the specially designed real-time synchronised wide-area communication network, provides the <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> for wide area or regional power substations/plants and their associated power network. The key element in the system is the integrated wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> information platform, which receives real-time synchronised data from the communication network to support the integration of <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> at the wide area/regional level.|$|R
30|$|Wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> {{equipment}} is functioned to be time keeping. If the time synchronization signal source system is lost, the time keeping precision {{can meet the}} requirements by related <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> functions.

30|$|Synchronized {{wide area}} {{communication}} {{has become a}} mature technology, which makes the real-time interaction between the substations and the wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> system possible. However, the present <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> system to handle this real-time data has been recognized to be deficient. This paper begins by reviewing the development history of power system protection, with special attention paid to the recent development {{in the field of}} wide-area and integrated protections, in order to look into the future development of <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> systems. Then the concept of integrated wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> is introduced, where it can be shown that a hierarchical <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> system provides the <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> for wide area or regional power substations/plants and their associated power networks. The system is mainly divided into three levels: the local, the substation/plant, and the wide area/regional. The integrated functions at each level are described in details with an aim to develop an optimal coordination mechanism between each level. The key element in the proposed system is the wide area real-time <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> information platform, which not only enables the merger of three lines of defence for power system <b>protection</b> and <b>control,</b> but also provides a perfect tool for the application of cloud computing in substations and power networks.|$|R

30|$|The {{hierarchical}} <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> system includes {{local area}} protection, substation area <b>protection</b> and <b>control,</b> and wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control.</b> Local area <b>protection</b> faces single target object.

It makes decision with the collected information of electrical quantities, binary quantities, and local area protection equipment in the substation. It realizes the redundancy and optimization of protections, performs and improves the safe and automatic control functions of the substation layer, meanwhile, it acts as a slave station of wide area protection and control; Wide area <b>protection</b> and <b>control</b> faces towards multiple substations.
