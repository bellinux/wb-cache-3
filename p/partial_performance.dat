He takes {{conclusions}} ready-made, or he makes them in a hurry. Life is so short that he thinks it better to err than wait. He has no patience, no faith in anything but himself. He thinks he is a being when in reality he is only a link in a being, and so he is more anxious to be complete than right. The last devotion {{of which he is}} capable is that devotion of the mind which suffers <b>partial</b> <b>performance,</b> but insists upon exhaustive thought. He scamps his thought and finishes his performance, and before he is dead it is already being abandoned and begun all over again by some one else in the same egotistical haste...." ...|$|E

50|$|The STREAM {{consists}} of 30 test items involving upper-limb movements, lower-limb movements, and basic mobility items. It is a clinical measure of voluntary movements and general mobility (rolling, bridging, sit-to-stand, standing, stepping, walking and stairs) following a stroke. The voluntary movement {{part of the}} assessment is measured using a 3-point ordinal scale (unable to perform, <b>partial</b> <b>performance,</b> and complete performance) and the mobility part of the assessment uses a 4-point ordinal scale (unable, partial, complete with aid, complete no aid). The maximum score one can receive on the STREAM is a 70 (20 for each limb score and 30 for mobility score). The higher the score, the better movement and mobility is available for the individual being scored.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{implementation}} of monitoring and control strategies to improve industrial performances. Industrial performances are nowadays defined in terms of numerous and multi-level criteria to be synthesized for overall improvement purposes In our approach, the overall performance of the company is the aggregated value of its <b>partial</b> <b>performances</b> related to each criterion. The aggregation model is performed with a Choquet integral. Two improvement strategies in this multi-criteria context are then envisaged. The contribution of a criterion to the Choquet aggregated performance has a key role in both strategies that are thus compared and justified through the monitoring of criteria contributions. A case study illustrates the propositions of the paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a design of wheel loader’s engine unit and its performance, {{as well as the}} choice of {{suitable}} unit itself. Theoretical part describes a standard approach used in designing loaders in the performance and weight class according to the parameters listed and also introduces common designs of loader’s individual parts. It gives the reader an overview of various machines currently available on today’s market and their comparison. The second part of the thesis consists of performance design and calculations based on the comparison of performances needed for various working modes of the machine, where the performance are calculated as a sum of <b>partial</b> <b>performances</b> of differents parts of machines. The result of this paper is a choice of motorized unit that suits all the designed and calculated parameters...|$|R
50|$|In their briefs, the appellants {{alleged that}} the court had erred 1) by misinterpreting Miss Smith's promise as one to make a gift to a charity rather than as one to create a trust, 2) by misapplying {{standards}} to judge <b>partial</b> <b>performance</b> of a contract, and 3) by ignoring the distinction between a claim to part of an estate {{that could have been}} enforced before Miss Smith's death and a claim to the entirety of an estate that only could have been enforced after her death. A hearing was held before a panel of the Court of Special Appeals on March 5, 2001. On July 31, 2001, the court issued its opinion, rejecting the appeal.|$|E
50|$|The opera had a <b>partial</b> <b>performance,</b> to piano accompaniment, at the Wigmore Hall in London in 1953, {{when the}} part of Nelson was sung by Peter Pears. Critics {{received}} this well, but the reviews of the full version a year later, staged at Sadler's Wells Theatre with the encouragement of Benjamin Britten, were mixed. This may have been because Britten's own The Turn of the Screw also premiered around the same time, inevitably invoking comparisons. It may also have affected critics that earlier in 1954, Berkeley's second, and very different, opera, the surrealistic comedy A Dinner Engagement, had been premiered; this successful one-act work remains {{the only one of}} Berkeley's operas to have held the stage.|$|E
