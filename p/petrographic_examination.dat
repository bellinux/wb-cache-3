5000|$|The term [...] "granitic" [...] means granite-like and {{is applied}} to granite {{and a group of}} {{intrusive}} igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin. These rocks mainly consist of feldspar, quartz, mica, and amphibole minerals, which form an interlocking, somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole (often hornblende) peppering the lighter color minerals. Occasionally some individual crystals (phenocrysts) are larger than the groundmass, in which case the texture is known as porphyritic. A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry. Granitoid is a general, descriptive field term for lighter-colored, coarse-grained igneous rocks. <b>Petrographic</b> <b>examination</b> is required for identification of specific types of granitoids. The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite.|$|E
5000|$|Felsite {{is a very}} {{fine-grained}} {{volcanic rock}} {{that may or may}} not contain larger crystals. Felsite is a field term for a light-colored rock that typically requires <b>petrographic</b> <b>examination</b> or chemical analysis for more precise definition. Color is generally white through light gray, or red to tan and may include any color except dark gray, green or black (the colors of trap rock). The mass of the rock consists of a fine-grained matrix of felsic materials, particularly quartz, sodium and potassium feldspar, and may be termed a quartz felsite or quartz porphyry if the quartz phenocrysts are present. This rock is typically of extrusive origin, formed by compaction of fine volcanic ash, and may be found in association with obsidian and rhyolite. In some cases, it is sufficiently fine-grained for use in making stone tools. Its fine texture and felsic components allow for good knapped pieces, much like working chert, producing conchoidal fracture.|$|E

40|$|Owing {{to their}} tightness, intra {{reservoir}} barriers {{have the potential}} to prevent homogenization of reservoir fluids and so cause compartmentalization. Identification of these barriers is an important step during reservoir evaluation. In order to achieve this, three main approaches: i) detailed petrographic and core analysis, ii) petrophysical studies (flow unit concept) and iii) geochemical analysis (strontium residual salt analysis) were applied systematically in the Permo-Triassic carbonate reservoirs (Dalan and Kangan formations) of a supergiant gas reservoir located in the Central Persian Gulf. Integration of these approaches has led to a fullclarification of the intra reservoir barriers. <b>Petrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> revealed the potential stratigraphic barriers to fluids flow created by various depositional/ diagenetic characteristics. Petrophysical data such as poroperm values, pore throat size distribution and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were used to differentiate the reservoir flow units from non-reservoir rock. According to different trends in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of residual salts, the existence of flow barriers was evaluated and proved. Finally, by integrating these approaches, three intra reservoir barriers were introduced in the studied reservoir interval. These intra reservoir barriers are depositional and diagenetic in nature and are located in stratal positions with sequence stratigraphic significance. The possibility of reservoir compartmentalization was evaluated in the studied wells, and then their existence was predicted at the adjacent fields. As shown in this study, integration of <b>petrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> with flow unit determination in a sequence stratigraphic framework has the potential for recognizing intra reservoir barriers and predicting compartmentalization of the studied Permo-Triassic reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|Aggregate {{type and}} {{mineralogy}} are critical {{factors that influence}} the engineering properties of concrete. Temperature variations result in internal volume changes could potentially cause a network of micro-cracks leading {{to a reduction in}} the concrete’s compressive strength. The study specifically studied the effect of the type and mineralogy of fine and coarse aggregates in the normal strength concrete properties. As performance measures, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and compressive strength were tested with concrete specimens containing different types of fine aggregates (manufactured and natural sands) and coarse aggregates (dolomite and granite). <b>Petrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> were then performed to determine the mineralogical characteristics of the aggregate and to examine the aggregate and concrete microstructure. The test results indicate the concrete CTE increases with the silicon (Si) volume content in the aggregate. For the concrete specimens with higher CTE, the micro-crack density in the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) tended to be higher. The width of ITZ in one of the concrete specimens with a high CTE displayed the widest core ITZ (approx. 11 µm) while the concrete specimens with a low CTE showed the narrowest core ITZ (approx. 3. 5 µm). This was attributed to early-age thermal cracking. Specimens with higher CTE are more susceptible to thermal stress...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the Permian-Triassic mass extinction (PTME) across the Sydney Basin of Eastern Australia, and to gather new evidence for use in determining the nature and cause of the PTME. This was achieved by identifying and assessing the significance of the isotopic, geochemical and physical characteristics of the PTME in the region. An examination of the available evidence for the nature and characteristics of the PTME, together with a review of the mechanisms most likely to have been the cause, was undertaken to establish the isotopic, geochemical and physical signatures that characterize each of the possible mechanisms. This also served to establish the most appropriate sampling regime and measurement techniques for the investigation. Four cores were chosen, two from the southern Sydney Basin and two from the northern Sydney Basin. Carbon isotopic data were used as the primary means for identifying the stratigraphic position of the PTME across the basin. Subsidiary measurements used were δ 15 N, δ 34 Spyrite, major elements, trace elements, rare earth elements and <b>petrographic</b> <b>examinations.</b> The isotopic and geochemical data, particularly their changes throughout the stratigraphic sequence and their statistical correlations, provided the basis for identifying the extinction trigger mechanism. X-ray diffraction results, used to quantify the major minerals and determine their changes throughout the stratigraphic sequence, and <b>petrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> were used to complement the isotopic and geochemical information. The new evidence gathered in this thesis shows that the PTME across the Sydney Basin occurs within ~ 1 m of the top of the last Permian coal and {{takes the form of a}} closely-spaced double negative δ 13 Corg excursion, a feature not observed before in the region. This result is complemented by coincident excursions in δ 15 N and δ 34 Spyrite, the first measurements of their kind for the PTME in the Sydney Basin. The interrelationships between C, N and S isotopic data indicate severe environmental disruption and increased weathering at the time of the extinction event with die off of terrestrial vegetation and the injection of sulphuric acid into the water column. The majority of the evidence presented here, including the results of their statistical analyses, indicate that the causal mechanism of the PTME was a massive injection of volcanic gases, possibly in closely-spaced multiple stages, resulting in severe environmental destabilization, including fluctuating oxygen levels. Geochemical evidence also shows that local conditions have the potential to mask the PTME signature and the data need to be interpreted carefully. The applicability of statistical analyses for gaining additional insight into the causal mechanism and the prevailing environmental conditions, and used for the first time for the PTME in the Sydney Basin, was also demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Lower Cretaceous {{sandstones}} of {{the type}} exposed in Israel, deposited over much of North Africa and Arabia as widespread sandstone sheets, typically are mineralogically and texturally mature. Previous <b>petrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> suggested that the Lower Cretaceous sandstones are at least partly a product of recycling and the present study supports this notion. The results of U-Pb Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro-Probe (SHRIMP) dating of detrital zircons from the Lower Cretaceous section exposed in Israel indicate that they are dominated by detrital zircons of Neoproterozoic age, mainly concentrated in the 0 Æ 55 to 0 Æ 65 Ga interval, with various amounts of older (pre-Neoproterozoic) zircons (of 0 Æ 95 to 1 Æ 10, 1 Æ 7 to 2 Æ 0 and 2 Æ 6 to 2 Æ 65 Ga age groups). The overall age signal is similar to detrital zircon age spectra previously obtained from the Cambrian–Ordovician sections of Israel and Jordan. Remarkably, the detrital zircon spectra remained almost unchanged for nearly 400 Myr. Thus, the most probable provenance of the Lower Cretaceous sandstone is the recycling of relatively proximal Palaeozoic sandstone. Since first unroofed from above pan-African terranes closer to the secession of orogeny, the ensuing siliciclastics were recycled repeatedly throughout the Phanerozoic with little additional basement denudation. The Lower Cretaceous sandstone comprises quartz sand that was first eroded from above pan-African orogens ca 400 Myr prior to deposition...|$|R
30|$|Cores {{removed from}} each deck {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} lightweight or normalweight coarse aggregate. <b>Petrographic</b> <b>examination</b> confirmed that the coarse aggregates for lightweight concrete mixtures were entirely lightweight aggregate (not partially blended with normalweight coarse aggregate). <b>Petrographic</b> <b>examination</b> also revealed that the lightweight aggregate utilized {{in each of the}} bridge decks was an expanded shale obtained from a local source. Typically, information on the mixture proportions, cement composition, placement conditions, and fresh and hardened concrete test results used on the bridge decks was not available. Therefore, analysis to evaluate the effect of different mixture parameters (such as water content, cement content, admixtures, and mixture components) could not be performed. However, the paired approach to this study allowed direct comparison of decks with similar environmental exposure, traffic, and age. Additionally, it can be assumed that the concrete comprising both types of decks met the requirements of the state highway agency’s standards and specifications for concrete used in bridge decks, as applicable at the time of construction. For bridge decks, this is typically designated as Class AA concrete, with a minimum 28 -day f′c of 31  MPa (4500 psi) with a maximum w/cm of 0.426 (angular aggregate) and a cement content ranging from 379 to 424  kg/m 3 (639 to 715 pcy). It is very important to note that adequate durability performance incorporates far more characteristics than resistance to cracking, and durability assessment should include resistance to weathering, chemical attack, abrasion, and other service conditions. Therefore, in addition to visual surveys to quantify extent of cracking, additional field and laboratory testing to evaluate durability performance was performed. Field tests included air permeability, surface resistivity, and rebound hammer. Sampling of drilled powders were obtained and tested to determine chloride content. Drilled cores were removed and returned to the laboratory for testing for compressive strength, sorptivity, and rapid chloride ion permeability. Additionally, <b>petrographic</b> <b>examination</b> was performed on cores from each deck to evaluate the characteristics of cracking.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that alkali {{aggregate}} reactions {{are one of the}} predominant causes of concrete deterioration. Swelling phenomenon in the form of expansion of the cement matrix by formation of ettringite due to sulfate-rich water and some external factors such as cycles of freezing and thawing or the attack on concrete by water in some forms such as extremely pure water, acidic water play a deleterious role for concrete durability. In alkali silica reaction, aggregates containing certain forms of silica will react with alkali hydroxide in concrete to form a gel that swells as it adsorbs water from the surrounding cement paste or the environment. These gels can swell and induce enough expansive pressure to damage concrete. Such damage has been reported in many countries, particularly in those with hot-wet climates. Quality of construction materials especially coarse and fine aggregates contribute towards durable structures. Several methods have been formulated to characterize the aggregates viz. mortar bar method, chemical method, <b>petrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> and accelerated mortar prism test methods.

The two inclusion mantles consisting of mainly olivine and plagioclase show a highly fractionated REE pattern with middle REE depletion and a large positive Eu anomaly (50 - 100 times chondritic) (V-shaped). A model calculation suggests that this remarkable REE fractionation was produced by thermal equilibration with the phosphate-rich cores of inclusions during the igneous formation and the metamorphic event. The Y- 794046 inclusion comprises abundant anhedral olivines (Fa_), fractured pyroxenes (Fs_) and microcrystalline plagioclase (An_ Ab_ Or_). The inclusion did not equilibrate with its host which has less Fe-rich olivines (Fa_) and more Fe in pyroxenes (Fs_). The inclusion shows an unfractionated REE pattern. We suggest that the three inclusions formed by melting of differentiated precursor materials carrying unfractionated REE. They were then incorporated into the L-or H-chondrite parent bodies and subjected to the early thermal metamorphism, which eventually overprinted the fractionated REE in the Y- 75097 and Y- 793241 inclusions by solid/solid equilibrium partitioning. The Y- 794046 inclusion was subjected to less extensive equilibration, so that REE abundances remained unfractionated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Petrographic</b> and electron-microprobe <b>examination</b> of {{the sample}} of 1 to 2 mm fines, Apollo 14166, 6, has {{revealed}} a fragment with the unique lunar mineralogy of plagioclase, olivine, diopside, a Ti-Fe-Zr phase, and a trace of ilminite. The second occurrence of diopside is reported together with the third occurrence of a recently identified Ti-Fe-Zr phase. Microprobe analyses of the principal phases of the fragment studied are presented in a table. The relatively pure diopside analyses reported represent the most Mg-rich calcic pyroxene found in lunar material...|$|R
