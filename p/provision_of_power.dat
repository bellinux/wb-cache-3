2500|$|The {{measurement}} of the impedance of devices and transmission lines is a practical problem in radio technology and other fields. Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example, in a radio antenna, the standing wave ratio or reflection coefficient may be more useful than the impedance alone. The {{measurement of}} impedance requires the {{measurement of the}} magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by [...] "bridge" [...] methods, similar to the direct-current Wheatstone bridge; a calibrated reference impedance is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the device under test. Impedance measurement in power electronic devices may require simultaneous measurement and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to the operating device.|$|E

5000|$|Around 1970, {{near the}} end of Project Apollo (1961-1972), Gerard K.

He hit upon the idea of assigning them feasibility calculations for large space-habitats. To his surprise, the habitats seemed feasible even in very large sizes: cylinders 8 km in diameter and 32 km long, even if made from ordinary materials such as steel and glass. Also, the students solved problems such as radiation protection from cosmic rays (almost free in the larger sizes), getting naturalistic sun angles, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> realistic pest-free farming and orbital attitude control without reaction motors. O'Neill published an article about these colony proposals in Physics Today in 1974. (See the above illustration of such a colony, a classic [...] "O'Neill Colony").
