5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxide</b> in a sealed package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container, holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxide.</b> A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package.

5|$|Plutonium shows enormous, and reversible, {{reaction}} rates {{with pure}} hydrogen, forming plutonium hydride. It also reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO2 {{as well as}} intermediate oxides; <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxide</b> fills 40% more volume than plutonium metal. The metal reacts with the halogens, giving rise to compounds with the general formula PuX3 where X can be F, Cl, Br or I and PuF4 is also seen. The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI. It will react with carbon to form PuC, nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.|$|E
5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxide</b> is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E

25|$|Even {{better than}} LWRs, CANDU can utilize {{a mix of}} uranium and <b>{{plutonium}}</b> <b>oxides</b> (MOX fuel), the plutonium either from dismantled nuclear weapons or reprocessed reactor fuel. The mix of isotopes in reprocessed plutonium is not attractive for weapons, but {{can be used as}} fuel (instead of being simply nuclear waste), while burning weapons-grade plutonium eliminates a proliferation hazard. If the aim is explicitly to burn plutonium or other actinides from spent fuel, then special inert-matrix fuels are proposed to do this more efficiently than MOX. Since they contain no uranium, these fuels do not breed any extra plutonium.|$|R
5|$|There are {{two aspects}} to {{the harmful effects}} of plutonium: the {{radioactivity}} and the heavy metal poison effects. Isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in bone marrow. Contamination by <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxide</b> has resulted from nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents, including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned. Studies of the effects of these smaller releases, {{as well as of the}} widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have provided considerable information regarding the dangers, symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning, which in the case of the Japanese Hibakusha/survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure.|$|E

40|$|In May 1994, The Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board (DNFSB) issued {{recommendation}} 94 - 1 to the Secretary of Energy {{indicating the}} need for improved remediation efforts within the defense nuclear facilities complex.

The DNFSB recommended that an integrated plan be formulated to convert the identified materials to forms or conditions suitable for safe interim storage. In addition, the DNFSB recommended that <b>plutonium</b> metal and <b>oxides</b> (> 50 weight-percent plutonium) be stabilized and packaged in accordance with the criteria stated in the DOE storage standard (DOE-STD- 3013).

40|$|To ensure safe storage, plutonium-bearing oxides are {{stabilized}} at 950 C for {{at least}} two hours in an oxidizing atmosphere. Stabilization conditions are expected to decompose organic impurities, convert metals to oxides, and result in moisture content below 0. 5 wt%.

50|$|Particles {{from air}} bursts {{are smaller than}} 10-25 micrometers, usually in the submicrometer range. They are {{composed}} mostly of iron oxides, with smaller proportion of aluminium oxide, and uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Particles larger than 1-2 micrometers are very spherical, corresponding to vaporized material condensing into droplets and then solidifying. The radioactivity is evenly distributed throughout the particle volume, making total activity of the particles linearly dependent on particle volume. About 80% of activity is present in more volatile elements, which condense only after the fireball cools to considerable degree. For example, strontium-90 will have less time to condense and coalesce into larger particles, resulting in greater degree of mixing in the volume of air and smaller particles. The particles produced immediately after the burst are small, with 90% of the radioactivity present in particles smaller than 300 nanometers. These coagulate with stratospheric aerosols. Coagulation is more extensive in the troposphere, and, at ground level, most activity is present in particles between 300 nm and 1 µm. The coagulation offsets the fractionation processes at particle formation, evening out isotopic distribution.|$|R

It is clear from the analysis that following discharge the plutonium is no longer of weapons-grade composition. The characteristics of the mixed-oxide fuel at various times following discharge indicate its behavior under long-term storage. As a counterpoint to the mixed-oxide fuel case, the situation with a similar reactor fueled with uranium oxide alone is analyzed.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} the scoping study performed {{to evaluate the}} use of a catalyzed electrolytic process for dissolving {sup 237 }Np oxide targets that had been irradiated to produce {sup 238 }Pu oxide. Historically, these compounds have been difficult to dissolve, and complete dissolution was obtained only by adding hydrofluoric acid to the nitric acid solvent. The presence of fluoride in the mixture is undesired because the fluoride ions are corrosive to tank and piping systems and the fluoride ions cause interferences in the spectrophotometric analyses. The goal is to find a dissolution method that will eliminate these issues and that can be incorporated into a processing system to support the domestic production and purification of {sup 238 }Pu. This study evaluated the potential of cerium(IV) ions, a strong oxidant, to attack and dissolve the oxide compounds. In the dissolution process, the cerium(IV) ions are reduced to cerium(III) ions, which are not oxidants. Therefore, an electrolytic process was incorporated to continuously convert cerium(III) ions back to cerium(IV) ions so that they can dissolve more of the oxide compounds.
