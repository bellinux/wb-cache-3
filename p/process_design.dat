40|$|Traditional process mining {{approaches}} {{focus on}} extracting process constraints or business rules from repositories of process instances. In this context, <b>process</b> <b>designs</b> or <b>process</b> models {{tend to be}} overlooked although they contain information that are valuable for the process of discovering business rules. This paper will propose an alternative approach to process mining {{in terms of using}} <b>process</b> <b>designs</b> as the mining resources. We propose a number of techniques for extracting business rules from repositories of business <b>process</b> <b>designs</b> or models, leveraging the well-known Apriori algorithm.

Business process optimisation is considered {{as the problem}} of constructing feasible business <b>process</b> <b>designs</b> with optimum attribute values such as duration and cost. This optimisation framework involves {{the application of a}} series of Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation Algorithms (EMOAs) in an attempt to generate a series of diverse optimised business <b>process</b> <b>designs</b> for given requirements. The optimisation framework is tested to validate the framework's capability in capturing, composing and optimising business <b>process</b> <b>designs</b> constituted of web services. The results from the web business process optimisation scenario, featured in this paper, demonstrate that the framework can identify business <b>process</b> <b>designs</b> with optimised attribute values...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>process</b> CAD <b>design</b> is the {{key part}} for steel casting {{production}} in general foundry enterprises. Formerly, for those parts with PDF file from customers, especially foreign customers, the <b>process</b> CAD <b>design</b> was done just by 2 D casting process CAD system depending on AutoCAD system; so the designer must spend much time drawing part by AutoCAD according the PDF file which cause low efficiency. In this paper, a new <b>process</b> CAD <b>design</b> method is proposed based on PDF file {{in order to avoid}} drawing part by AutoCAD. Fist, the framework of <b>process</b> CAD <b>design</b> is constructed. Second, as the base part of <b>process</b> CAD <b>design,</b> the practical 2 D CAD frame is established. Third, the part drawing with PDF file is resolved to be displayed clearly through the Mupdf rendering engine. Finally, the casting <b>processes</b> <b>design</b> of two actual steel castings, including a pump cover casting and a large gear casting, are presented to illustrate this new <b>process</b> CAD <b>design</b> method...|$|R

Its origins {{can be traced back to}} the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to these problems, software has been developed that enables the full business process (as developed in the <b>process</b> <b>design</b> activity) to be defined in a computer language which can be directly executed by the computer. The process models can be run through execution engines that automate the processes directly from the model (e.g. calculating a repayment plan for a loan) or, when a step is too complex to automate, Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) provides front-end capability for human input. Compared to either of the previous approaches, directly executing a process definition can be more straightforward and therefore easier to improve. However, automating a process definition requires flexible and comprehensive infrastructure, which typically rules out implementing these systems in a legacy IT environment.|$|E
25|$|Product and <b>process</b> <b>design</b> can {{be largely}} {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The key question in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E

500|$|The {{authority}} and {{position of the}} design management function has a large influence on what the design manager does {{in his or her}} daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function: design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a [...] "line function" [...] is directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited {{authority and}} the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a [...] "secondary" [...] organisational <b>process,</b> <b>design</b> management is seen as [...] "supportive function". In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the design manager as a creative specialist towards product management, brand management, marketing, R, and communication.
