This included membership of IATA's trade association as well as participation in tariff co-ordination with other member airlines in the organisation's annual traffic conferences. BUA also continued Airwork’s and Hunting-Clan’s participation in various pool agreements with foreign national airlines. On the East African routes, for example, BUA participated in a tripartite <b>pool</b> <b>agreement</b> with BOAC and East African Airways. Participating in revenue-sharing agreements with its foreign counterparts was a prerequisite for securing overseas traffic rights, especially in Africa.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} decided {{to build a new}} airport to replace the Lideta Airfield, unable to {{accommodate}} the Boeing 720 jetliner the company intended to acquire. This was the birth of Bole International Airport, where the company set its headquarters. In , the arrival of [...] Boeing 720s ordered directly from Boeing marked the carrier entrance into the jet age. These two aircraft were registered ET-AAG and ET-AAH and were named ″Blue Nile″ and ″White Nile″, respectively. The first jet service took place on [...] when one of these aircraft was deployed on the route to Nairobi. The following day, a new service to Madrid was flown using the new jet equipment, with Frankfurt joining the jet network soon afterwards. On 1 April, the Boeing 720 replaced the DC-6B on the Addis Ababa–Athens route; during that month, the West African corridor also benefited from jet operations. The airline entered into a <b>pool</b> <b>agreement</b> with Aden Airways and Sudan Airways on the Khartoum–Asmara–Aden service. A new flight to Conakry was launched on [...] Kano, which had been served since , was removed from the list of destinations that day. On 30 November 1963, the airline lost another DC-3 (ET-AAT) in a test flight at Addis Ababa; the crew of [...] suffered minor injuries.

500|$|The airline {{came into}} being on [...] under the name West African Airways Corporation Nigeria Limited (WAAC Nigeria), also known as Nigerian Airways, to succeed the folded West African Airways Corporation (WAAC); the title “WAAC” was {{retained}} due to the prestige this company had previously earned. Initially, the carrier was a tripartite entity in which the Nigerian government was the major shareholder (51%), and Elder Dempster Lines and BOAC held the balance (32⅔ and 16⅓, respectively). WAAC Nigeria inherited some aircraft previously owned by WAAC. Operations started on , with a BOAC Stratocruiser operated {{on behalf of the}} new airline linking London with Lagos, and DC-3s flying domestic services and a run to Dakar, the last one in conjunction with Ghana Airways. On the same day, WAAC Nigeria signed a 15-year agreement with BOAC to charter Stratocruisers and Britannias for serving long-haul flights between Nigeria and the United Kingdom. The contract also contemplated that these routes would be operated in a <b>pool</b> <b>agreement,</b> whereby tickets could be issued by one airline for flights operated by the other, with the revenues being shared.|$|E

On , the company was rebranded as Nigeria Airways. At this time the airline used aircraft leasing as a common practice: Boeing 707s that flew the Lagos–London route were leased from Laker Airways and Ethiopian Airlines until a new Boeing 707-320C was incorporated into the fleet and deployed on the route in August 1971, and in October 1971 a Boeing 737 was leased from Aer Lingus. Another Boeing 707-320C was ordered in 1972, along with two Boeing 737-200s. A Boeing 707 was leased from Aer Lingus in April 1972 for deployment mainly on the Lagos–London route, with the provision of crew and maintenance. [...] In October 1972, a Fokker F28 entered the fleet on a lease agreement with Fokker, and later on aircraft of this type were ordered. In late 1972, a contract for management assistance was signed with TWA, with the American carrier providing specialists in different managerial, commercial, and financial fields for five years, but the contract was never excersised. Nigeria Airways took delivery of three Boeing 707s in February 1973; they were put into service on the Lagos–London run immediately. Two Boeing 737s, with registrations 5N-ANC and 5N-AND, were delivered in the early 1970s.|$|E

The 1960s saw the carrier ordering the Avro 748 turboprop airliner. The aircraft started services on 15 February 1962 between Buenos Aires and Punta del Este. The first flight for the Caravelle in Aerolíneas colours was Buenos Aires–Santiago de Chile on 1 April 1962.

2500|$|The SAS {{cooperation}} initially only considered intercontinental traffic, and {{the three}} national airlines continued to compete on inter-Scandinavian and European traffic. All three were represented with sales offices {{in each of the}} other countries, and all three maintained sales offices in all foreign cities they served. Informal discussions to pool international routes started in 1947, after all three companies had suffered losses on these routes. After SILA and Aerotransport merged, negotiations started between the three. The brand name [...] "Scandinavian Airlines System" [...] was to be used on all flights, domestic and international, and the airlines would coordinate their services to avoid parallel flights. Domestic scheduling would remain at the discretion of each national airline. DNL would then close its Swedish and Danish offices, and retain Scandinavian offices in other European cities. The <b>pool</b> <b>agreement,</b> which became known as European Scandinavian Airlines System (EASA), was taken into use on 18 April 1948.|$|E
40|$|Under the {{jurisdiction}} of the EU competition law, the IG has been through two completed investigations, which were recorded as the 1985 Commission Decision and the 1999 Commission Decision. The <b>Pooling</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the IGA, after modification, were granted individual exemptions and ruled as compatible with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. The 1999 Commission Decision was valid till 2009 and from 2010 the Commission has reopened its third competition investigation to the <b>Pooling</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the IGA and it is still in process. It is of interest at this time to systematically review the pre- 1999 Commission’s competition measures to the IG and map out the prospects of the <b>Pooling</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the IGA under the Commission’s reopened probe. The dissertation seeks to offer a comparative analysis of the 1985 and 1999 Commission Decisions, in which approach divergences and deficiencies are addressed. Based on this retrospection, the post- 1999 variation of legal environments related to the ongoing Commission’s probe is illuminated and then a reappraisal of the <b>Pooling</b> <b>Agreement</b> associated with the IGA is made under the shifted analytic framework. The purpose of this dissertation is partly to look back at history, providing legal comments on the EU’s competition measures to the <b>Pooling</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the IGA, and partly to look to the future, offering prospects and suggestions in consideration of potential lobbying by the parties concerned...|$|R

50|$|Such {{anti-competitive}} {{practices were}} {{not confined to}} BCal's European operations. The bilateral agreements governing most of BCal's long-haul routes obliged the airline {{to enter into a}} <b>pool</b> <b>agreement</b> with the designated foreign flag carriers. These agreements stipulated that all revenues were to be equally shared by all carriers serving the same route. This usually meant that revenues were shared on a 50:50 basis, regardless of each carrier's actual market share. The only exceptions to this rule were the US as well as the Asian countries to which BCal flew. As far as the US was concerned, no US airline was allowed to enter into a <b>pool</b> <b>agreement</b> with any other airline — especially, a wholly/majority government-owned, foreign carrier — as this constituted a violation of that country's antitrust laws. With regard to the Asian countries that received scheduled services from BCal, the UK already had fully liberalised or fairly liberal bilateral air services agreements with these countries.|$|E

After a short refit in Bremerhaven in 1989 the Fantasia was again renamed Channel Seaway and began operating a freight service between Dover and Calais.

In 1989 ownership of the vessel transferred to Societé Nouvelle d'Armement Transmanche (SNAT) and then in 1990, SNCF transferred the operations to Societé Propietaire des Navaires (SPN). In August 1990, SPN and Sealink British Ferries signed an extension of 5 years to their <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement</b> on board the Fiesta in Dover harbour.
