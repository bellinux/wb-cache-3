The contributions to static pitching moment due to forebody and aftbody pressure distributions are broken out and considered separately.

The aftbody contribution to pitching moment is lagged by a phase angle of the natural oscillation period. This lag represents the time for aftbody wake structures to equilibrate while the body is oscillation. The characteristic equation of this formulation indicates that the lagged backshell moment adds a damping moment equivalent in form to a constant <b>pitch</b> <b>damping</b> term.

The model was flown over an angle-of-attack range from 10 to 35 deg. Static and dynamic force tests were made in the Langley free-flight tunnel. The investigation showed that the longitudinal stability and control characteristics were generally satisfactory with neutral or positive static longitudinal stability. The addition of artificial pitch damping resulted in satisfactory longitudinal characteristics being obtained with large amounts of static instability. The most rearward center-of-gravity position for which sustained flights could be made either with or without <b>pitch</b> <b>damper</b> corresponded to the calculated maneuver point.

Here, we use a dynamically scaled robot to gain insight into how flapping insects adjust stroke features to regulate and stabilize level forward flight. The results suggest that few changes to hovering kinematics are actually required to meet lift and thrust requirements, and the primary driver of equilibrium velocity is the aerodynamic pitch moment. This {{finding is consistent with}} prior hypotheses and observations regarding the relationship between body pitch and flight speed in fruit flies. We considered three different deformations of hovering wing kinematics, which were inspired by previous experimental studies and that result in the generation of a pitch moment: a shift in the mean stroke position, upstroke to downstroke differences in wing rotation angle, and upstroke to downstroke differences in stroke deviation. The results suggest that a shift in the mean stroke position is a likely candidate for trimming the pitch moment at all speeds, whereas shifts in the wing rotation angle are required only at high speeds. The results also show that the dynamics may be stabilized {{with the addition of a}} <b>pitch</b> <b>damper,</b> but the magnitude of required damping increases with flight speed. We posit that differences in stroke deviation between the upstroke and downstroke play a critical role in this stabilization. Fast mechanosensory feedback of the pitch rate enables active damping which becomes inherently gain scheduled with flight speed when pitch torque is generated by differences in deviation. This provides an elegant solution for flight stabilization across a wide range of flight speeds...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a general}} {{investigation}} {{to determine the effects of}} simulator motions on pilot opinion and task performance over a wide range of vehicle longitudinal dynamics, a cooperative NASA-AMAL program was conducted on the centrifuge at Johnsville, Pennsylvania. The test parameters and measurements for this program duplicated those of earlier studies made at Ames Research Center with a variable-stability airplane and with a pitch-roll chair flight simulator. Particular emphasis was placed on the minimum basic damping and stability the pilots would accept and on the minimum dynamics they considered controllable in the event of stability-augmentation system failure. Results of the centrifuge-simulator program indicated that small positive damping was required by the pilots over most of the frequency range covered for configurations rated acceptable for emergency conditions only (e. g., failure of a <b>pitch</b> <b>damper).</b> It was shown that the pilot's tolerance for unstable dynamics was dependent primarily on the value of damping. For configurations rated acceptable for emergency operation only, the allowable instability and damping corresponded to a divergence time to double amplitude of about 1 second. Comparisons were made of centrifuge, pitch-chair and fixed-cockpit simulator tests with flight tests. Pilot ratings indicated that the effects of incomplete or spurious motion cues provided by these three modes of simulation were important only for high-frequency, lightly damped dynamics or unstable, moderately damped dynamics. The pitch- chair simulation, which provided accurate angular-acceleration cues to the pilot, compared most favorably with flight. For the centrifuge simulation, which furnished accurate normal accelerations but spurious pitching and longitudinal accelerations, there was a deterioration of pilots' opinion relative to flight results. Results of simulator studies with an analog pilot replacing the human pilot illustrated the adaptive capability of human pilots in coping with the wide range of vehicle dynamics and the control problems covered in this study. It was shown that pilot-response characteristics, deduced by the analog-pilot method, could be related to pilot opinion. Possible application of these results for predicting flight-control problems was illustrated by means of an example control-problem analysis. The results of a brief evaluation of a pencil-type side-arm controller in the centrifuge showed a considerable improvement in the pilots' ability to cope with high-frequency, low-damping dynamics, compared to results obtained with the center stick. This improvement with the pencil controller was attributed primarily to a marked reduction in the adverse effects of large and exaggerated pitching and longitudinal accelerations on pilot control precision...|$|E

40|$|The {{handling}} qualities of an aircraft {{have always been}} a crucial field of study, being chiefly concerned with the safety and comfort of flight. Historically, the design-by-discipline approach has been used, thus relegating stability and control considerations to later stages of the design process. In recent years a new view emerged, which advocates the benefits of including {{handling qualities}} at earlier stages, such as conceptual and preliminary. The objective of the research is to develop a handling qualities optimization module to be fitted in the Initiator, a conceptual design tool developed at TU Delft. The module shall handle both unaugmented designs (bare airframe), as well as augmented design, in which a suitable stability augmentation system (SAS) is included. To this end, a common stability paradigm, based on a modified Routh-Hurwitz criterion, has been implemented as a set of nonlinear constraints on the design space. In essence, the criterion has been transformed from a test to a design procedure, taking the form of a general polynomial-based regional pole placement method. The methodology is concerned with conventional aircraft configurations, specifically by sizing the horizontal tailplane and positioning of the wing. Themodule is focused on designs that possess optimal short period damping ratio and Control Anticipation Parameter (CAP), while the objective functions to be minimized are tailplane induced drag, zero-lift drag, and weight. Static stability and controllability are ensured in the relevant flight regimes using Torenbeek’s X-plots, implemented in the form of additional constraints on the design space. Lastly, the stability augmentation system consists of a <b>pitch</b> <b>damper</b> and an angle of attack feedback. Two different methods have been investigated for the computation of the feedback gains: the first one entails the inclusion of such gains in the design vector. The second one makes use of an optimal control technique: the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), augmenting the design vector with three required weighting factors. Hence, the module accepts three user inputs which specify the methodology: unaugmented design, augmented with method 1 (gains in the design vector) and augmented with method 2 (LQR). The optimization has been run for the three different user-specified methods on an Airbus A 320 - 200. The results show that the procedure is successful, increasing the CAP by 100 % for the unaugmented and augmented (method 1) designs. By using the LQR, the CAP showed an increase in 150 %. Moreover the unaugmented design achieved the required short period damping of 0. 55, or a 34 % increase with respect to the baseline value, while the augmented designs were capable of achieving a damping ratio of 0. 76, which corresponds to an increase of 85 %. A convergence study has been done within the Initiator, to assess the performance of the optimized configurations concerning aerodynamic efficiency (L/Dmax) and maximum takeoff mass (MTOM). The investigation led to the definition of breakeven points, which are used to indicate the values of short period damping ratio for which, at a given CAP, the optimized designs have the same performance as the baseline aircraft. Two general design guidelines have been extrapolated: for unaugmented designs, the breakeven points move closer to the baseline values as the CAP increases. Furthermore, at the baseline short period damping ratio and CAP, the optimized configuration is more efficient. For augmented designs, it was revealed that the performance benefits achievable are substantially higher and independent of the required handling qualities. Hence, no breakeven points can be defined. Optimal values of L/Dmax andMTOMare achieved right from the baseline values of damping and CAP, while the gains are progressively increased to cope with the handling qualities demands. Due to the qualitative nature of these conclusions, it is deemed possible to extend them to other conventional configurations, thus providing general design guidelines.

The supersonic <b>pitch</b> <b>damping</b> properties of the MSL capsule were characterized between Mach 1. 35 and Mach 3. 5 and total angles-of-attack from 0 to 30 degrees. In flight, the MSL entry capsule will utilize a radial center-of-gravity offset to produce a non-zero trim angle-of-attack. This offset trim angle will produce lift, enabling the capsule to fly a guided entry and reducing the landing footprint dimensions to within 10 km of the desired landing site.

The analysis consists of a planar, four degree of freedom simulation. The aeroshell and the IAD are assumed to be separate, rigid bodies connected with a spring-damper at an interface point constraining the relative motion of the two bodies. Aerodynamic forces and moments are modeled using modified Newtonian aerodynamics. The analysis includes the contribution of static aerodynamic forces and moments as well as <b>pitch</b> <b>damping.</b> Two cases are considered in the analysis: constant velocity flight and planar free flight. For the constant velocity and free flight cases with neutral <b>pitch</b> <b>damping,</b> configurations with highly-stiff interfaces exhibit statically stable but dynamically unstable aeroshell angle of attack. Moderately stiff interfaces exhibit static and dynamic stability of aeroshell angle of attack due to damping induced by the pitch angle rate lag between the aeroshell and IAD. For the free-flight case, low values of both the interface stiffness and damping cause divergence of the aeroshell angle of attack due to the offset of the IAD drag force with respect to the aeroshell center of mass. The presence of dynamic aerodynamic moments was found to influence the stability characteristics of the vehicle. The effect of gravity on the aeroshell angle of attack stability characteristics was determined to be negligible for the cases investigated.

The control methods studied include reduction of coupled dynamics by implementation of a roll and <b>pitch</b> <b>damping</b> controller, optimal setpoint chasing based on a structural reliability criteron, and a backstepping control law {{based on the same}} reliability criterion. These three methods, combined with a nonlinear passive observer, have been studied and proved both stable and robust. Especially, a theoretical six degrees of freedom Lyapunov stability analysis is performed, which renders the combined PID, and roll and <b>pitch</b> <b>damping</b> controller globally asymptotically stable. Stability properties for all considered control methods have been clarified. A simulation model for testing of the different control methods is derived and implemented in Matlab Simulink. The simulation model is based on a typical full scale semi-submersible anchored with mooring cables in a circular anchor configuration. A nonlinear passive observer is implemented and tuned to give satisfactory estimates for all six degrees of freedom. Model tests are performed in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory at NTNU using the 1 : 100 model semi-submersible CyberRig I. Model tests are performed for regular and irregular waves, with and without thruster force input. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{stability}} testing {{was conducted on}} a 2. 5 % scale model of the X- 33 technology demonstrator sub-orbital flight-test vehicle. This testing was conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) l 6 -Foot Transonic Wind Tunnel with the LaRC High-speed Dynamic Stability system. Forced oscillation data were acquired for various configurations over a Mach number range of 0. 3 to 1. 15 measuring pitch, roll and yaw damping, {{as well as the}} normal force due to pitch rate and the cross derivatives. The test angle of attack range was from - 2 to 24 degrees, except for those cases where load constraints limited the higher angles of attack at the higher Mach numbers. A variety of model configurations with and without control surfaces were employed, including a body alone configuration. Stable <b>pitch</b> <b>damping</b> is exhibited for the baseline configuration throughout the angle of attack range for Mach numbers 0. 3, 0. 8, and 1. 15. Stable <b>pitch</b> <b>damping</b> is present for Mach numbers 0. 9 and 0. 6 with the exception of angles 2 and 16 degrees, respectively. Constant and stable roll damping were present for the baseline configuration over the range of Mach numbers up to an angle of attack of 16 degrees. The yaw damping for the baseline is somewhat stable and constant for the angle of attack range from - 2 to 8 degrees, with the exception of Mach numbers 0. 6 and 0. 8. Yaw damping becomes highly unstable for all Mach numbers at angles of attack greater than 8 degrees...|$|R
