40|$|Abstract Background Neurogenic <b>Para-Osteo-Arthropathy</b> (NPOA) {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of central nervous system injuries or some systemic conditions. They are characterized by bone formation around the main joints. Methods In order to define some biological features of NPOAs, histological and immunohistological studies of the soft tissue surrounding osteoma and Ultrasound examination (US) of NPOA before the appearance of abnormal ossification on plain radiographs were performed. Results We have observed a great number of ossifying areas scattered in soft tissues. US examination have also shown scattered ossifying areas at the early stage of ossification. A high osteogenic activity was detected in these tissues and all the stages of the endochondral process were observed. Mesenchymal cells undergo chondrocytic differentiation to further terminal maturation with hypertrophy, which sustains mineralization followed by endochondral ossification process. Conclusion We suggest that periosteoma soft tissue reflect early stage of osteoma formation and could be a model to study the mechanism of osteoma formation and we propose a mechanism of the NPOA formation in which sympathetic dystony and altered mechanical loading induce changes which could be responsible for the cascade of cellular events leading to cartilage and bone formation. </p...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, 60 – 70 {{thousand}} people {{are affected by}} spinal cord lesions, which have an incidence of 20 / 25 new cases per million per year and a male:female ratio of 4 : 1. The age group most affected is 10 – 40 years. In 65 % of cases {{the origin of the}} lesion is traumatic. According to the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment Scale (AIS), the lesion is defined complete or incomplete, depending on whether or not partial conservation of sensory and/or motor functions is found below the level of the lesion in the first 24 hours following the trauma. Patients with spinal injuries show alterations of phosphocalcic metabolism, with osteoporosis, neurogenic <b>para-osteo-arthropathy</b> and renal calculi. Even though post-lesion osteoporosis is traditionally considered secondary to reduced loading, it has characteristics different from those of primary osteoporosis and osteoporosis caused by endocrine disorders or by simple disuse. Indeed, there is usually no significant demineralisation of the bone segments above the level of the neurological lesion and the site and entity of the bone resorption are influenced by factors such as age, sex, muscle spasticity, but above all by lesion site, lesion severity, and post-lesion period...|$|E
40|$|Ectopic-bone {{formation}} in paraplegia {{has been a}} medical curiosity for at least fifty years 8 It has been described in multiple sclerosis, meningioma of the spinal cord, arachnoiditis 14, poliomyeitis 710, 12 epidural abscess 22, tetanus 18, burns, and hemiplegia 20 #{ 149 }No evidence and few clues regarding {{the cause of this}} condition are available, but it has been well documented that microscopically the lesion is corn-posed of mature bone and not simply soft-tissue calcification 2 #{ 149 }The bone formation has been given various names including <b>para-osteo-arthropathy,</b> a name suggested by Dejerine and Ceillier in 1918 to indicate that the location of the bone formation is adjacent to but not always continuous with the skeleton. Dejerine and Ceillier also pointed out that movements of nearby joints were often diminished. More recent {{studies have shown that the}} bone is not within the joint capsule and thus the lesion is not a true arthropathy. The serum alkaline phosphatase values have usually been reported to be within normal limits 16710, 14, 18 in patients with ectopic-bone formation. This finding seems inconsistent with other bone-forming diseases, such as Paget’s disease, which may cause elevated levels of the serum alkaline phosphatase 19. Therefore, in this study serial serum alkaline phosphatase measurements were performed on a group of paraplegic patients. These determinations were correlated with the demonstration of ectopic-bone formation by physical examination and roentgenograms. Radio-nucleide bone scans (strontium and fluoride) were done on four patients. The scans correlated with the roentgenographic examinations but will not be included in this report...|$|E
