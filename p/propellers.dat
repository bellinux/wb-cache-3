5|$|On October 4, 1955, the CAB {{released}} the final accident report, which concluded {{the reversal of}} the <b>propellers</b> and subsequent increase in power of the No. 4 engine had caused the accident.|$|E
5|$|The Dorniers were {{devoid of}} German equipment, {{including}} engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer {{to supply the}} powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was {{to be used in}} the Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, claiming it to have 649kW (870hp) and a speed of 420km/h (261mph) at 3,850m (12,320ft). The constant-speed <b>propellers</b> were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier <b>propellers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>propellers</b> {{themselves}} {{were also found}} to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the <b>propellers</b> was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the <b>propellers</b> was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propeller</b> Control - Used to set {{the desired}} <b>propeller</b> speed. Once the pilot has set the desired <b>propeller</b> speed, the <b>propeller</b> {{governor}} maintains that <b>propeller</b> speed by adjusting the pitch of the <b>propeller</b> blades, using the engine's oil pressure to move a hydraulic piston in the <b>propeller</b> hub.|$|R
40|$|The {{extension}} of a non-linear digital simulation {{model of a}} marine propulsion plant, to include an approximate equation for the <b>propeller</b> shaji torque, is considered. I t is then shown how linearized transferfunction matrix models can be deaeloped from the non-linear system model. The evaluation of theJirst. order partial derivatives, using the non-linear data in the simulation program, will then be described.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the simple calculation {{method of estimating}} the <b>propeller</b> scale effect corrections. The method is composed of formulas of computation of the zero lift pitch of a given <b>propeller,</b> the drag coefficient of the <b>propeller</b> based on the <b>propeller</b> Reynolds number and the lift coefficient of the <b>propeller</b> blade section for given <b>propeller</b> operating condition, computation of the lift coefficient of the <b>propeller</b> blade section etc [...] Using this method, {{it is possible to}} estimate the thrust and torque of a <b>propeller</b> of a real ship easily, when the values of the thrust and the torque of the model <b>propeller</b> were given. ...|$|R
5|$|When {{moving through}} a fluid, {{rotating}} systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) {{such as those}} experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas oscillating systems have the advantage at higher (inertia-dominated) Reynolds numbers. Whereas ship <b>propellers</b> typically have efficiencies around 60% and aircraft <b>propellers</b> up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered Gossamer Condor), much higher efficiencies, {{in the range of}} 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible foil like a fish tail or bird wing.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts were {{propelled}} by {{two to four}} screw <b>propellers.</b> Dreadnought herself, and all British dreadnoughts, had screw shafts driven by steam turbines. The first generation of dreadnoughts built in other nations used the slower triple-expansion steam engine which had been standard in pre-dreadnoughts.|$|E
5|$|Engines and <b>propellers</b> numbers 1 to 3 {{suffered}} substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and propeller number 4 suffered much less damage. The investigators determined {{that at the time}} of impact, <b>propellers</b> 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing power but propeller number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action was taken by the crew to unfeather propeller number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained evidence of any internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the results indicated normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E
40|$|The aspects {{related to}} <b>propeller</b> {{performance}} {{by means of}} a review of <b>propeller</b> methodologies are addressed. Preliminary wind tunnel <b>propeller</b> performance data are presented and the predominent limitations of existing <b>propeller</b> performance methodologies are discussed. Airfoil developments appropriate for <b>propeller</b> applications are also reviewed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Propeller</b> walk {{is caused}} by a {{difference}} in the overall force of one side of a <b>propeller</b> due to the angle of the <b>propeller</b> shaft versus the direction of travel. When a <b>propeller</b> shaft is perfectly aligned with the direction of travel there is no <b>propeller</b> walk.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the 42 m trawler as object, an {{ordinary}} <b>propeller</b> and a ducted <b>propeller</b> are designed and their open water hydrodynamic performance are simulated by using CFD software. The computed results and experimental results of ducted <b>propeller</b> {{are in good}} agreement, which verified the reliability of numerical calculation. Then the computed results of ordinary <b>propeller</b> and ducted <b>propeller</b> are compared with each other, {{it is found that}} the thrust and torque of ducted <b>propeller</b> is bigger th{{an ordinary}} <b>propeller</b> in trawling. This article also discusses the pressure distribution of their blade and the reason why ducted <b>propeller</b> has a better hydrodynamic performance is studied...|$|R
5|$|In a follow-up, to meet Specification O.21/44 for a two-seat strike fighter, the Spearfish was {{redesigned}} {{to accommodate}} a twin-coupled Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and contra-rotating <b>propellers.</b> A variety of other engines were considered and although a production order was placed for three examples in 1944, the programme was eventually shelved, remaining as an unfulfilled paper project.|$|E
5|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, {{heavy metals}} {{are used for}} ballast in boats, aeroplanes, and motor vehicles; or in balance weights on wheels and crankshafts, gyroscopes, and <b>propellers,</b> and centrifugal clutches, in situations requiring maximum weight in minimum space (for example in watch movements).|$|E
5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the <b>propellers</b> were {{reversed}} prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the <b>propellers</b> of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a systems study and ground test {{of the effects of}} <b>propeller</b> {{modulation}} on a time-multiplexed, scanning-beam microwave landing system (MLS) are presented. <b>Propeller</b> modulation effects are analyzed in terms of spacing between receiving antenna and <b>propeller,</b> <b>propeller</b> blade width, and <b>propeller</b> speed. Principal study conclusions: (1) scanning beam MLS is susceptible to errors due to synchronous <b>propeller</b> modulation; (2) the number of synchronous interference multiples increases as the number of <b>propeller</b> blades increases and as the data rate decreases; (3) the probability of synchronous interference decreases at higher data rates; and (4) MLS receiver susceptibility to <b>propeller</b> modulation depends upon the dynamic response of the receiver automatic gain control and the respective tracking loops...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{experimental}} results with numerical simulations using three different body-force <b>propeller</b> models. The results demonstrate {{that as long}} as the radial variation of axial and tangential momentum generated by the <b>propeller</b> are included, the influence of the unsteady <b>propeller</b> flow can be removed and calculations with a steady <b>propeller</b> model can be performed for the evaluation of the influence of the <b>propeller</b> on the rudder...|$|R
5|$|The Patrie {{was then}} {{deflated}} for alterations {{that included the}} addition of a 500cubic metre (17,660ft³) cylindrical section to the gas-bag, a change to the empennage (as mentioned above) and provision of new <b>propellers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} <b>propellers</b> and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel <b>propellers</b> that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the <b>propellers</b> during landing.|$|E
2500|$|One prototype, JF321, {{was fitted}} and tested with a Rotol six-bladed {{contra-rotating}} <b>propeller</b> unit; although this promised {{to eliminate the}} characteristic swing on take-off (caused by the <b>propeller</b> slipstream) the <b>propeller</b> unit was prone to failure. The pitch control mechanism controlled the pitch on the front <b>propeller,</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper aims {{to predict}} the {{hydrodynamic}} characteristics and structural analysis of the marine <b>propeller</b> under pressure hydrodynamic loading. Because of the loading on the <b>propeller</b> blade, it goes under significant deformation that may affect the hydrodynamic performance of the <b>propeller.</b> Thus, the blade deformation of a <b>propeller</b> due to fluid pressure should be analyzed, considering hydro-elastic analysis. The <b>propeller</b> was made of anisotropic composite materials, and the geometry of the <b>propeller</b> is for one skew angle. First, the hydrodynamic pressure loading is obtained by FVM and then the deformation of the blade due to this pressure was calculated. Next, the pressure load for deformed <b>propeller</b> is achieved; it is again repeated to obtain the new deformed <b>propeller.</b> This procedure is repeated to converge the thrust, torque and efficiency. We present all results of the pressure distribution, hydrodynamic characteristics, stress and deformation of the <b>propeller...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing <b>propeller</b> diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin <b>Propeller</b> is equipped with a pull <b>propeller</b> and a push <b>propeller.</b> The vortex street of the front pull <b>propeller</b> passes between the blades of the rear push <b>propeller</b> without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the pull <b>propeller</b> means that more water reaches the push <b>propeller</b> from the sides. The strut is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the <b>propeller</b> stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a lift component in the thrust direction, which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{perceived}} threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from North Vietnamese swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, Sydney was always escorted {{by at least one}} other RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, <b>propellers,</b> and anchor chain for explosives. On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but the first flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch <b>propellers</b> and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, {{the depot}} was {{responsible}} for the repair of vehicles and the conversion of aircrew coaches. Aircraft engines, <b>propellers</b> and radar equipment also continued to be repaired on the site, as were vehicles from the US Air Force's Third Air Force base at nearby RAF South Ruislip which began to be serviced from April 1949. The American vehicles were maintained in a dedicated shed, No. 5.|$|E
50|$|An azimuthing <b>propeller</b> is a <b>propeller</b> {{that turns}} around the {{vertical}} axis. The individual airfoil-shaped blades turn as the <b>propeller</b> moves {{so that they}} are always generating lift in the vessel's direction of movement. This type of <b>propeller</b> can reverse or change its direction of thrust very quickly.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an electronic instrument to measure the torque developed on the <b>propeller</b> shaft of fishing vessels at various speeds of the <b>propeller.</b> By measuring the torque, it is possible to determine the actual power transmitted from the engine gear-box unit to the <b>propeller</b> so that <b>propeller</b> efficiency can be evaluated and the optimum size of the <b>propeller</b> for a specific engine and vessel can be determined...|$|R
50|$|Morgan {{started working}} with UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II {{computers}} in 1954. He introduced computers into naval engineering and thereby revolutionized <b>propeller</b> design. He published numerous studies of sub-cavitating, super-cavitating, and contra-rotating propellers; annular airfoil and ducted <b>propeller</b> theory; <b>propeller</b> blade strength; hydrodynamic properties of blade sections; and <b>propeller</b> cavitation, ventilation and noise. Perhaps most significantly, he led development of the highly skewed <b>propeller</b> with its superior vibration and acoustic properties.|$|R
5|$|Large {{sections}} of the hull plating seem to have fallen off well before the wreck hit the bottom. One such section, {{thought to have been}} from the galleys, separated from the stern in one piece and landed nearby. The force of the water tore up the poop deck and folded it back on itself. The center propeller is totally buried, while the force of the impact caused the two wing <b>propellers</b> and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about 20°.|$|E
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the <b>propellers.</b> This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Pacific Fleet in 1943. She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage. They included the installation of special <b>propellers</b> with removable blades and the strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure. The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the German project "Buergernahes Flugzeug" (Citizen Friendly Aircraft), we are investigating the effect of installation on <b>propeller</b> sound. A nine-bladed <b>propeller</b> installed in front of a wing equipped with a Coanda flap is considered.

In this contribution, we present an implementation of an acoustic <b>propeller</b> model in a finite differences CAA (computational aeroacoustics) code.
