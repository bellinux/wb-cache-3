40|$|Interventions of central, {{top-down}} planning {{are serious}} limitations {{to the possibility}} of modelling the dynamics of cities. An example is the city of Paris (France), which during the 19 th century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the `Haussmann period'. In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789 - 2010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and <b>punctual</b> <b>changes</b> operating at large spatial scales.

40|$|Eight human {{herpesvirus}} 6 (HHV- 6) strains {{were studied}} by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction. DNA from infected cells was digested {{by a panel}} of restriction enzymes and hybridized with cloned BamHI fragments corresponding to about 30 % of the HHV- 6 strain SIE genome. In parallel, this DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pairs of primers derived from the strain SIE nucleotide sequence. Subsequently, amplification products were analyzed by hybridization, digestion with restriction endonucleases, and partial nucleotide sequencing. Overall results indicated that all strains were closely related to one another. However, concordant differences in restriction patterns allowed at least two groups to be distinguished, typified by strains SIE and HST, respectively. Differences between the two groups were found to reflect a limited number of <b>punctual</b> <b>changes</b> in nucleotide sequences. These results strengthen the idea of a unique HHV- 6 species with genetic polymorphism. In addition, this study provides useful markers for the diagnosis and molecular epidemiology of HHV- 6 infections...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{there are}} two motivations for an {{interest}} in reconstructing the history of language families. The obvious one is that through reconstructing the history of languages we can make inferences {{about the history of}} their speakers. This is particularly fruitful when carried out within an interdisciplinary framework, allowing triangulation with archaeological and genetic data, and providing methods of testing dates and migration paths. The second reason to be interested in the reconstruction of language families (and the one of particular interest to us as linguists) is that it enables us to reconstruct the processes of language change, with implications for linguistic typology, theories of grammar, psycholinguistics, and cognitive science. Rigorously formulated hypotheses about processes of language change provide us with testable predictions within an evolutionary framework. In this paper I will discuss methods for testing models of the evolution of language in order to (i) detect language contact between sister languages, (ii) investigate the mode of evolution of phonological systems (with focus on gradual versus <b>punctual</b> <b>changes),</b> and (iii) measure evolutionary dependencies between structural features of languages...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims The {{study of}} rapid {{evolution}} in invasive species has highlighted the fundamental {{role played by}} founder events, emergence of genetic novelties through recombination and rapid response to new selec-tive pressures. However, whether rapid adaptation of introduced species can be driven by <b>punctual</b> <b>changes</b> in genome organization has received little attention. In plants, variation in genome size, i. e. variation {{in the amount of}} DNA per monoploid set of chromosomes through loss or gain of repeated DNA sequences, is known to influence a number of physiological, phenological and life-history features. The present study investi-gated whether change in genome size has contributed to the evolution of greater potential of vegetative growth in invasive populations of an introduced grass. †Methods The study was based on the recent demonstration that invasive genotypes of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) occurring in North America have emerged from recombination between introduced European strains. The genome sizes of more than 200 invasive and native genotypes were measured and their genome size was related to their phenotypic traits measured in a common glasshouse environment. Population genetics data were used to infer phylogeographical relationships between study populations, and the evolutionary history of genome size within the study species was inferred. †Key Results Invasive genotypes had a smaller genome than European native genotypes from which they ar...|$|E
