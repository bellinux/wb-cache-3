25|$|Governments use {{different}} kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. They do this in order to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as the business sector, or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population. Historically, taxes on the poor supported the nobility; modern social-security systems aim to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working. In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the macroeconomic performance of the economy (a government's strategy for doing this is called its fiscal policy; see also tax exemption), or to modify <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.|$|E
2500|$|PV {{systems have}} the major {{disadvantage}} {{that the power}} output is dependent on direct sunlight, so about 10-25% is lost if a tracking system is not used, since the cell will not be directly facing the sun at all times. [...] Dust, clouds, and other things in the atmosphere also diminish the power output. Another main issue is the concentration of the production in the hours corresponding to main insolation, which don't usually match the peaks in demand in human activity cycles. Unless current societal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> and electrical networks mutually adjust to this scenario, electricity {{still needs to be}} stored for later use or made up by other power sources, usually hydrocarbon.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his most}} famous work, The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen writes {{critically}} of the leisure class for its role in fostering wasteful consumption. In this first work Veblen coined the term [...] "conspicuous consumption", which he defined as spending more money on goods than they are worth. The term originated during the Second Industrial Revolution when a nouveau riche social class emerged {{as a result of}} the accumulation of capital wealth. He explains that members of the leisure class, often associated with business, are those who also engage in conspicuous consumption in order to impress the rest of society through the manifestation of their social power and prestige, be it real or perceived. In other words, social status, Veblen explained, becomes earned and displayed by <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> rather than what the individual makes financially. Subsequently, people in other social classes are influenced by this behavior and, as Veblen argued, strive to emulate the leisure class. What results from this behavior, is a society characterized by the waste of time and money. Unlike other sociological works of the time, The Theory of the Leisure Class focused on consumption, rather than production.|$|E

A number of studies he authored for NBER became the subject of national attention and debate, including a 1925, he report on the size and strength of labor unions in the United States, a 1929 study on changes in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> and the effect on standards of living, and a 1930 report on the role of public works in helping reduce unemployment. Although he increasingly disassociated himself from the labor movement after the early 1930s, he still supported unions in certain circumstances.
