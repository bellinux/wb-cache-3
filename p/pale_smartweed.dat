It {{is closely related to}} Persicaria maculosa and as such is {{considered}} a weed in Britain and Europe. Other common names for the plant include <b>pale</b> <b>smartweed,</b> curlytop knotweed, and willow weed. It is a species complex made up of a great many varying forms, sometimes considered varieties. The environment also has a strong influence on the morphology of an individual plant.|$|E

For each “year-weed” combination, dose-response curves were applied to estimate the dose of foramsulfuron required to obtain 90 % and 95 % weed control (ED 90 and ED 95). Foramsulfuron phytotoxicity on maize and crop yield were assessed. Foramsulfuron at 1 / 3 of the recommended dose (20. 3 g a. i. /ha) provided 95 % efficacy against redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), green foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.), wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.) were satisfactorily controlled (95 % weed efficacy) with ED 95 ranged from 20 to 50 g/ha of foramsulfuron (about from 1 / 3 to 5 / 6 of the recommended dose) depending on growth stage. The recommended dose was effective against <b>pale</b> <b>smartweed</b> (Polygonum lapathifolium L.) at 2 - 4 true leaves (12 - 14 BBCH scale), but this dose did not kill plants larger than 2 - 4 true leaves. The ranking among weed species based on their susceptibility to foramsulfuron was: redroot pigweed = green foxtail = wild mustard = black nightshade > velvetleaf = common lambsquarters = barnyardgrass > <b>pale</b> <b>smartweed.</b> Dose of foramsulfuron can be reduced below recommended dose depending on weed species and growth stage. Foramsulfuron showed a good crop selectivity and had no negative effect on maize yield...|$|E
