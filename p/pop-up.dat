5|$|Chocobo Tales {{features}} {{a mix of}} three different types of gameplay; role-playing video game, exploration, and card battles. Players explore a 3D environment to find picture books. Upon finding them the player is transported into <b>pop-up</b> picture books to complete minigames and open {{the path to the}} next part of the story. The picture books take the form of Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are not located within <b>pop-up</b> books, do not affect the game-world and are not required to progress in the game.|$|E
5|$|Different tactics {{have been}} used on iOS devices, such as {{exploiting}} iCloud accounts and using the Find My iPhone system to lock access to the device.

5|$|Chocobo Racing borrows {{themes and}} {{elements}} from Final Fantasy I to Final Fantasy VI. The Story Mode is narrated by Cid and includes nine chapters in a <b>pop-up</b> book fashion with FMVs. To progress, the player needs {{to defeat the}} chapter's respective challenger. Before each chapter begins, the player is given the option of viewing the story or skipping to the race except when playing the Story Mode for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Electronics and toy lines {{inspired}} by the film were released during Fall 2010. A line of Tron-inspired jewelry, shoes and apparel was also released, and Disney even created a <b>pop-up</b> store to sell them in Culver City. Custom Tron branded gaming controllers have been released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii.|$|E
5000|$|Scripts for {{graphical}} IRC clients {{may contain}} <b>pop-ups,</b> which extend or replace the menus {{built into the}} client. Many scripts contain nothing but long lists of <b>pop-ups</b> that send humorous or cute canned messages to the channel; many of those messages {{take the form of}} a [...] "slap", ridiculing a victim chosen by the user.|$|R
40|$|Even {{professional}} baseball players occasionally {{find it difficult}} to gracefully approach seemingly routine <b>pop-ups.</b> This paper describes a set of towering <b>pop-ups</b> with trajectories that exhibit cusps and loops near the apex. For a normal fly ball, the horizontal velocity is continuously decreasing due to drag caused by air resistance. But for <b>pop-ups,</b> the Magnus force (the force due to the ball spinning in a moving airflow) is larger than the drag force. In these cases the horizontal velocity decreases in the beginning, like a normal fly ball, but after the apex, the Magnus force accelerates the horizontal motion. We refer to this class of <b>pop-ups</b> as paradoxical because they appear to misinform the typically robust optical control strategies used by fielders and lead to systematic vacillation in running paths, especially when a trajectory terminates near the fielder. In short, some of the dancing around when infielders pursue <b>pop-ups</b> can be well explained as a combination of bizarre trajectories and misguidance by the normally reliable optical control strategy, rather than apparent fielder error. Former major league infielders confirm that our model agrees with their experiences. Comment: 28 pages, 10 figures, sumitted to American Journal of Physic...|$|R

As of late 2017 Tory Sport has stores in several cities around the U.S. and an in-store boutique at the Tory Burch store in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Chocobo Tales was {{announced}} in the Summer of 2006. Initial details revolved around the main character, Chocobo, the opening sequence {{of the story and}} the picture book worlds. Further details included the <b>pop-up</b> duels and more information pertaining to the story. The game was produced by Yuki Yokoyama and took 20 staff members a year to create. The first decision made was to create a game about chocobos, market research showed that the characters are most popular with younger players, thus the game was designed for the Nintendo DS system, a popular system with that age group.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{complaint}} {{alleged that the}} defendants made numerous false statements in attempting to collect payments from consumers, claiming that the computer owner or someone else consented to receiving the <b>pop-up</b> payment demands until they paid, the owner of any computer that received the pop-ups was legally obligated to pay Movieland, and that the computer owner was obligated to satisfy any contract that any other person entered into while using the computer. The only customer service telephone number provided was a 900 number. When consumers called it, a recorded greeting {{told them that they}} would incur a $34.95 charge if they did not hang up within three seconds.|$|E

5|$|In late 2013, Improv Everywhere, the New York City {{initiative}} {{behind the}} annual No Pants Day in the subways and various flash-mob stunts, convened and filmed a re-enactment. While a look-alike couple performed the scene, 30 others joined {{as if it}} was contagious. Surprised staff and customers responded in appreciation. The film and follow-up interviews are public. In October of the same year, Katz Delicatessen invited Baron Von Fancy to display his ten-foot high mural quoting the famous line in its <b>pop-up</b> gallery next door, The Space.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb {{with the bases loaded}} and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a <b>pop-up</b> to short right field that Tony Gwynn was unable to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, but was unable to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5|$|The Parish was a Cajun, Louisiana Creole, {{and seafood}} {{restaurant}} in Portland, Oregon's Pearl District in the United States. It was opened by Tobias Hogan and Ethan Powell in 2012, and became {{known for its}} oysters.

The Palmetto was converted into a private event space and <b>pop-up</b> restaurant in February 2016, and The Parish closed abruptly in September of that year.|$|E

5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and <b>pop-up</b> restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the <b>pop-up</b> Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
