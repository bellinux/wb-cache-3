40|$|The {{asynchronous}} {{transfer mode}} (ATM) handles cells of different classes in various ways to provide the different services with their respective quality of service requirements. To decrease the loss probability of high priority cells {{at the expense of}} cells with lower priorities, two loss priority schemes have been proposed in the literature: capped threshold and <b>push</b> <b>out.</b> Since throughput is slightly greater in the <b>push</b> <b>out</b> scheme while buffer management complexity increases when passing from threshold to <b>push</b> <b>out,</b> it seems natural to prefer the threshold scheme. A limitation of the removal depth in the <b>push</b> <b>out</b> scheme, called L <b>push</b> <b>out,</b> is proposed.

40|$|ATM network handles {{cells of}} {{different}} classes {{in various ways}} {{in order to provide}} the different services with their respective QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. A possible way to provide this is to use buffers in nodes by giving priority to cells relating to the most demanding bearer capability. When time priority is used, the next cell to be transmitted, if more then one is waiting in a queue, is the one with highest priority. In order to decrease the loss probability of high priority cells at the expense of cells with lower priorities, two loss priority schemes have been proposed in literature: Threshold and <b>Push</b> <b>out.</b> Since throughput is slightly greater in the <b>push</b> <b>out</b> scheme while buffer management complexity increases when passing from threshold to <b>push</b> <b>out,</b> it seems natural to prefer the threshold scheme.

5|$|Under {{the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha, the {{grandson}} of Muhammad Ali, major public works projects were initiated {{with the aim of}} transforming Cairo into a European styled city. These projects, at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> Isma'il Pasha in 1879.|$|E
5|$|As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana {{and drove}} the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest {{regiment}} in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By {{the end of the}} three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. Slowly the Iron Brigade was <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen.

5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> small, independent booksellers. Johnson {{did not attempt to}} form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began to take over the daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E

40|$|AbsPuct- This paper {{presents}} {{three new}} push-out based queuing priority schemes, suitable for mobile cellular networks. In such schemes, named OC <b>Push</b> <b>out</b> (POC), OC Threshold <b>Push</b> <b>out</b> (T-FQC) and Partitioned OC <b>Push</b> <b>out</b> (P-FQC), Handoff Calls (HC) and Originating Calls (OC) are both queued and a service selection policy based on {{measurement of the}} received signal MBPS, in addition the simpler FIFO policy has been used. The proposed strategies are studied by means of simulations for Merent percentages of HC, selected according to the radius of the cells. The performance achieved is superior with respect to classic schemes based on only HC queuing and to the Non Prioritized Scheme (NPS). ...|$|R

When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force.

Bobby Bowden, who retired after 57years as a head coach, 34 at Florida State and 33consecutive winning seasons, was {{replaced}} by Jimbo Fisher. Immediately before the 2010 season began, Bowden claimed he had been <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> as head coach, causing a stir before Florida State's first game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the execution of King Louis XVI, revolutionary France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman forces from the Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, they were <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman forces from the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France.|$|E

Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E

The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him {{would have to be a}} much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and {{the symbolism of the}} fight between lawmen and the Cowboys.

Abkhaz {{artillery}} and aircraft began a bombardment against Georgian {{forces in the}} upper Kodori Gorge on 9 August. Three days later, a military offensive against the Kodori Gorge was officially initiated by Abkhaz separatists. Abkhaz defence official said that Georgian forces were <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> of the Kodori Gorge by the operation. Although he claimed that Russians {{did not participate in}} the battle, Russian military traffic headed for the gorge was witnessed by an Associated Press reporter. Casualties were light on both sides; Abkhaz fighters accidentally killed one of their comrades, and two Georgian soldiers were also killed. About 2,000 people living in the Kodori Gorge fled.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
