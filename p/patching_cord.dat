50|$|<b>Patch</b> <b>cord</b> cable {{differs from}} {{standard}} structured cabling cable in that patch cable is stranded for flexibility, whereas standard cable is solid copper. Because the <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> is stranded copper construction the attenuation (signal loss) is higher on <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> than solid cable so short lengths should be adhered to.|$|R
5000|$|A {{patch cable}} or <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> or <b>patch</b> lead is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect ("patch in") one electronic or optical device to another for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g., a switch connected to a computer, or a switch to a router) are connected with <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> <b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and are relatively short, perhaps no longer than two metres. Types of <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> include microphone cables, headphone extension cables, XLR connector, Tiny Telephone (TT) connector, RCA connector and ¼" [...] TRS phone connector cables (as well as modular Ethernet cables), and thicker, hose-like cords (snake cable) used to carry video or amplified signals. However, <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> typically refer only to short <b>cords</b> used with <b>patch</b> panels.|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure that}} {{specifications}} are met over FDDI-grade, OM1 and OM2 fibers, the transmitter should be coupled through a mode conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> No mode conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is required for}} applications over OM3 or OM4.|$|R
50|$|The GigaBIX {{system is}} {{primarily}} {{made up of}} mounts and connectors. The <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> topology utilizes GigaBIX PS6+ <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> which are 4 pair 23-AWG UTP cords with a channel bandwidth of 250 MHz or 300 MHz, depending on how they are employed. These <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> are typically used with the and the Cross-Connect topology utilizes GigaBIX cross-connect wire. Both topologies utilize the same mounts, connectors, distribution frames, and other accessories (such as designation strips, wire guards, covers, distribution rings, and many other accessories).|$|R
50|$|Armored {{fiber optic}} <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> uses {{flexible}} {{stainless steel tube}} inside the outer jacket as the armor to protect the fiber glass inside. It retains all the features of standard <b>patch</b> <b>cord,</b> but is much stronger. It will not get damaged even if stepped by an adult and they are rodent-resistant.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{conventional}} to {{have the}} top row of jacks wired at the rear to outputs and bottom row of jacks wired to inputs. Patch bays may be half-normal (usually bottom) or full-normal, [...] "normal" [...] indicating that {{the top and bottom}} jacks are connected internally. When a patch bay has bottom half-normal wiring, then with no <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> inserted into either jack, the top jack is internally linked to the bottom jack via break contacts on the bottom jack; inserting a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> into the top jack will take a feed off that jack while retaining the internal link between the two jacks; inserting a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> into the bottom jack will break the internal link and replace the signal feed from the top jack with the signal carried on the <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> With top half-normal wiring, the same happens but vice versa. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks.|$|R

50|$|The {{birth of}} {{progressive}} rock roughly {{coincided with the}} commercial availability of synthesizers. Early modular synthesizers were large instruments that used <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to route the signal flow. Programming the instruments meant placing the <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to connect the individual modules. The Minimoog, a smaller, simplified synthesizer that needed no <b>patch</b> <b>cords,</b> began production in 1971 and provided keyboardists with a more-easily programmed instrument that could imitate other instruments, could create new sounds of its own, and was highly portable and affordable. Progressive rock was the genre in which the synthesizer first became established as a common part of popular music. Synthesizers {{could be used to}} play the rapid, virtuosic lines that changed the perception of keyboard instruments.|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} analyze two {{pathways}} to produce commercial optical-fiber <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> with stable long-term transmission in the ultraviolet (UV) at powers up to ∼ 200 mW, and typical bulk transmission between 66 - 75 %. Commercial fiber <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> in the UV are {{of great interest}} across {{a wide variety of}} scientific applications ranging from biology to metrology, and the lack of availability has yet to be suitably addressed. We provide a guide to producing such solarization-resistant, hydrogen-passivated, polarization-maintaining, connectorized and jacketed optical fibers compatible with demanding scientific and industrial applications. Our presentation describes the fabrication and hydrogen loading procedure in detail and presents a high-pressure vessel design, calculations of required loading times, and information on <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> handling and the mitigation of bending sensitivities. Transmission at 313 nm is measured over many months for cumulative energy on the fiber output of > 10 kJ with no demonstrable degradation due to UV solarization, in contrast to standard uncured fibers. Polarization sensitivity and stability are characterized yielding polarization extinction ratios between 15 dB and 25 dB at 313 nm, where we find <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> become linearly polarizing. We observe that particle deposition at the fiber facet induced by high-intensity UV exposure can (reversibly) deteriorate <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> performance and describe a technique for nitrogen purging of fiber collimators which mitigates this phenomenon.

5000|$|Users create sounds by {{manipulating}} <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> {{to direct the}} signal through the modules above the keyboard. In other words, different combinations of <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> connections produced different sounds. Through all of the combinations available, the Modular System could produce any popular synthesizer sound in use at the time. Users could also save favored patch sequences using a [...] "firm-wire" [...] patch that connected to the instrument and could be swapped out at any time, recreating sounds without manipulating the <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> The Modular System was known to have a [...] "cleaner" [...] sound that its competitors, although that aspect was not always desired by users. It also had a unique aesthetic, featuring blue-lined modules rather than the traditional black and aluminum panels.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{design feature}} of the VCS3 (and later EMS systems) was that, rather than using <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to route audio and control signals between modules, Cockerell employed a small matrix plugboard into which the user stuck special conductive pins that connected an input (listed on the X-axis of the matrix) to an output (on the Y-axis). This matrix patchboard gave the VCS3 {{a high degree of}} inter-connectivity, comparable to that of much larger modular systems, and far greater than similar small synthesisers like the Minimoog. It was also much easier to examine than the tangle of <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> used to interconnect other modular systems of the day, such as the Moog modular synthesizer and was many times smaller than the cumbersome Moog patch bays, which used <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> leads capped with 1/4-inch 'phone' jacks.|$|R

50|$|A {{patch cable}} is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect one electronic or optical device to another or to building infrastructure for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g. a switch connected to a computer, or a switch connected to a router) are connected with <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> <b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and most are relatively short, no longer than a few meters. In contrast to on-premises wiring, patch cables are more flexible but may also be less durable.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal cross-connects {{provide a}} {{point for the}} {{consolidation}} of all horizontal cabling, which extends in a star topology to individual work areas such as cubicles and offices. Under TIA/EIA-568-B, maximum allowable horizontal cable distance is 90m of installed cabling, whether fibre or twisted-pair, with 100m of maximum total length including <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> No <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> should be longer than 5m. Optional consolidation points are allowable in horizontal cables, often appropriate for open-plan office layouts where consolidation points or media converters may connect cables to several desks or via partitions.|$|R
50|$|Bend {{insensitive}} fiber <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is widely}} used in FTTH. The fiber is not sensitive to stress and bending. Singlemode bend insensitive fibers include G657A1, G657A2, G657B2, and G657B3.|$|R
50|$|For MMF {{links the}} WDM output {{needs to be}} coupled through a SMF offset-launch mode-conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> This is {{explained}} in subclauses 53.6 and 38.11.4 of the IEEE 802.3 spec.|$|R
50|$|FTTO is {{a hybrid}} network {{involving}} fibre optic cabling (pre-terminated or extractable cables) and copper twisted pair <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> with 8P8C connectors. In an FTTO environment, fibre is laid up vertically {{from the central}} distribution switch right to the office floor, where it runs horizontally to active FTTO switches at the users' workplaces. The final distance of 3-5 m to the end user desk is bridged using standard 8P8C twisted pair <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> There are only two network levels: the core and the access with no aggregation or distribution level in between compared to traditional structured cabling networks.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is always}} fitted with {{connectors}} at both ends. A pigtail {{is similar to}} a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a connector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. In the context of copper cabling, these cables are sometimes referred to as blunt <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> and the non-connectorized end ("the pigtail") is intended to be permanently attached to a component or terminal. Optical fiber pigtails, in contrast to copper pigtails, can be more accurately described as a connector than a cable or cord. A fiber pigtail is a single, short, usually tight-buffered, optical fiber that has an optical connector pre-installed on one end and a length of exposed fiber at the other end. The end of the fiber pigtail is stripped and fusion spliced to a single fiber of a multi-fiber trunk. Splicing of pigtails to each fiber in the trunk [...] "breaks out" [...] the multi-fiber cable into its component fibers for connection to the end equipment.|$|R
50|$|Matrix systems use pin matrixes {{or other}} {{crosspoint}} switches rather than <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> Historic examples with pin matrixes include the EMS Synthi 100, EMS VCS-3, ETI International 4600, Maplin 5600. The ARP 2500 used a matrix switch.|$|R
50|$|Mode Conditioning <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> is {{required}} where Gigabit 1000 Base-LX and 10GBASE-LRM routers and switches are installed into existing multimode cable plants. The transceiver modules launch only singlemode 1300 nm signals but the existing network is built with multimode cables.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{flexible}} cords with plugs at their ends and sockets (jacks) to make temporary connections {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for telegraph circuits). Cords with plugs at both ends had been used for many decades {{before the advent of}} Moog's synthesizers to make temporary connections (patches) in such places as radio and recording studios. These became known as <b>patch</b> <b>cords,</b> and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} cables {{are used to}} carry {{electrical}} signals in sound recording studios and with electronic or electrical musical instruments. Microphones are typically connected to mixing boards or PA systems with XLR microphone cables which use three-pin XLR connectors. A huge range of electric or electronic instruments use 1/4 inch mono <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to connect the instrument to the amplifier, such as the electric guitar, electric bass, synthesizer, electric piano, or electronic drum machine. Musicians playing electric or electronic instruments often use longer cables (from 10 to 20 feet) between their instrument and their amplifier, and then use shorter <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> (from a few inches {{to one or two}} feet long) to connect chains of effects devices, [...] "stomp box" [...] pedals, or other signal processors.|$|R
40|$|In vivo optogenetic {{experiments}} commonly employ long {{lengths of}} optical fiber {{to connect the}} light source (commonly a laser) to the optical fiber implants in the brain. Commercially available <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> are expensive and break easily. Researchers have developed methods to build these cables in house for in vivo experiments with rodents [1 – 4]. However, the half-life of those <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> is greatly reduced when they are used with behaving rats, which {{are strong enough to}} break the delicate cable tip and to bite through the optical fiber and furcation tubing. Based on [3] we have strengthened the patch-cord tip that connects to the optical implant, and we have incorporated multiple layers of shielding to produce more robust and resistant cladding. Here, we illustrate how to build these <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> with FC or M 3 connectors. However, the design can be adapted for use with other common optical-fiber connectors. We have saved time and money by using this design in our optical self-stimulation experiments with rats, which are commonly several months long and last four to eleven hours per session. The main advantages are: • Long half-life. • Resistant to moderate rodent bites. • Suitable for long in vivo optogenetic experiments with large rodents...|$|R

50|$|In early {{telephone}} systems, connections {{were made}} in the central office by switchboard operators using <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to connect one party to another. A telephone call was initiated by operating a magneto hand generator, usually integral to the customer telephone, to alert the central office operator by the ringing of a switchboard bell or the activation of a drop. In response, the operator inserted a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> into the corresponding line jack and assisted the customer by voice. The other end of the <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> connected the caller to the destination telephone line. If the destination party belonged to another exchange, the operator established a connection to that exchange where another operator completed the call setup. As technology advanced, automatic electro-mechanical switches were introduced and telephones were equipped initially with rotary dials for pulse-dialing and then Touch-Tone key pads in the 1960s, which increased the speed of dialing and enabled other vertical telephone features. For telephone subscribers, prior to widespread use of area codes and the 10 digit phone number, the first 3 digits of the 7 digit telephone number were called the exchange, which used the first two letters of the exchange name and one digit, e.g., GLadstone 7 (an exchange in the Chicago area), which was 457 with all numeric representation of telephone numbers. Subscribers needed only 7 digits to make calls within their area.|$|R

5000|$|IBM {{removable}} {{control panels}} ranged {{in size from}} 6 1/4" [...] by 10 3/4" [...] (for machines such as the IBM 077, IBM 550, IBM 514) to roughly one to two feet (300 to 600 mm) on a side and had a rectangular array of hubs. Plugs {{at each end of}} a single-conductor <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> were inserted into hubs, making a connection between two contacts on the machine when the control panel was placed in the machine, thereby connecting an emitting hub to an accepting or entry hub. For example, in a card duplicator application a card column reading (emitting) hub might be connected to a punch magnet entry hub. It was a relatively simple matter to copy some fields, perhaps to different columns, and ignore other columns by suitable wiring. Tabulator control panels could require dozens of <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> for some applications.|$|R
