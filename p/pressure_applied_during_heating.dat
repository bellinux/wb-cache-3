50|$|Tablet {{diameter}} and shape {{are determined by}} the machine tooling used to produce them - a die plus an upper and a lower punch are required. This is called a station of tooling. The thickness is determined by the amount of tablet material and the position of the punches in relation to each other during compression. Once this is done, we can measure the corresponding <b>pressure</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> compression. The shorter the distance between the punches, thickness, the greater the <b>pressure</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> compression, and sometimes the harder the tablet. Tablets need to be hard enough that they don't break up in the bottle, yet friable enough that they disintegrate in the gastric tract.|$|R

Methods: Fifteen dentists (9 males, 6 females) formed a study group and 10 master dies in premolar shape and Turcom Cera all-ceramic crowns were prepared to measure the maximum finger <b>pressure</b> <b>applied</b> by dentists <b>during</b> cementation.

30|$|The {{previous}} studies [10, 11] {{reported that the}} THM process leaded to a smoother sample surface. The <b>pressure</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> the THM process would define {{the values of the}} surface roughness. Denser materials reduce the pore amount and exited pore size. Higher surface smoothness indicates lower porosity of open pore exposed to moisture in the air outside [10]. Furthermore, it was assumed that the THM conditions have varied effects on the anatomical changes on the wood surface [20]. Thus, the <b>heating</b> <b>during</b> THM treatment softens the wood material and the pressure compresses the surface, which mitigates the roughness of final product.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For {{accurate}} {{positioning of}} the prostate in external radiotherapy, transabdominal ultrasound localization and positioning systems are available. Reports have stated that probe <b>pressure</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> image acquisition causes clinically relevant prostate displacement. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prostate displacement due to the <b>pressure</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> transabdominal ultrasound image acquisition with the BAT ultrasound system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For ten patients who had undergone iodine- 125 seed implantation for brachytherapy of prostate cancer, X-ray simulations were performed before and during ultrasound image acquisition. The iodine seeds are visible on the X-ray images, representing the position of the prostate. The simulator's crosshair, indicating the isocenter, was used as reference coordinate system. For each patient the change in prostate position was calculated based on the seed positions during and after ultrasound examination. RESULTS: A maximum displacement of the prostate of 2. 3 mm in anteroposterior and 1. 9 mm in craniocaudal direction and a rotational change of up to 2. 5 degrees were observed. If the system was not handled correctly and too much <b>pressure</b> was <b>applied,</b> a shift of the prostate of up to 10 mm could be induced. CONCLUSION: Compared to the prostate displacement due to changes in rectal filling, which according to Crook et al. can be as much as 1. 7 cm, the maximum displacement of less than 0. 3 cm caused by the probe pressure is negligible. However, proper education of the staff and preparation of the patient are essential for the safe use of the system...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMn-Cu alloys develop a high damping capacity after a heat treatment {{of aging and}} subsequent quenching. The damping capacity developed is extremely sensitive to aging time at a given temperature or temperature for a fixed time. The optimum heat treatment developed for the commercial alloy Incramute was: 1) a 30 minute solutioning in the single phase δ(m) region, 2) a water quench, 3) an 8 hour age at 400 C, and 4 -) a water quench to ambient temperature. The effect of stress <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> the <b>heat</b> treatment of Incramute is significant. A tensile load precludes the development of high damping capacity for the aging times investigated (up to 50 hours in some cases). A compressive load only increases {{the time required to}} achieve the maximum damping capacity. A preliminary study of the effect of stress <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> <b>heat</b> treatment of Incramute indicates that the major disruption to development of high damping capacity occurs during the aging portion of the heat treatment. An endurance limit of 29, 000 psi can be expected for Incramute aged to its maximum damping condition. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} cuirass-assisted {{ventilation}} {{have been studied}} in 25 subjects with chest wall disease. Cuirass respirators increase ventilation {{in proportion to the}} peak negative pressure within the cuirass shell and the respiratory rate. Positive <b>pressure</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> expiration produces little additional ventilation. During cuirass-assisted ventilation end-expiratory volume increases, arterial carbon dioxide tension (Paco 2) falls and arterial oxygen tension (Pao:) rises. Cardiac output is unchanged. Paradoxical chest wall motion is corrected by cuirass-assisted ventilation and restriction of chest wall expansion by the cuirass shell is minimal. Jacket-type respirators can produce larger tidal volumes than the cuirass at the same peak negative pressure, but are associated with greater air leakage...|$|R

When the pressure extends locally to the bone implant interface, we hypothesized that it might have led to bone resorption. We developed an experimental implant model to study whether oscillating fluid <b>pressure,</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> 2 hours a day, can lead to osteolysis at the bone implant interface. 12 mature rabbits received a titanium implant, which was allowed to osseointegrate. Thereafter, fluid <b>pressure</b> was <b>applied</b> to a specific area of the titanium bone interface at the periosteal side of the cortex in 6 of the rabbits. The <b>pressure,</b> <b>applied</b> <b>during</b> 2 hours a day for 14 days, oscillated between 70 and 150 mm Hg, with a frequency of 0. 1 Hz. Bone resorption was not found in any of the control animals, but it occurred under 4 implants exposed to fluid pressure (p = 0. 03; Fisher's exact test). Localized osteolytic lesions had developed, with evidence of osteocyte death in the surrounding cortical bone. In 1 of the 2 specimens without osteolysis, there was evidence of fluid leakage into the soft tissues. In 4 specimens (3 with and 1 without osteolysis), bone formation was observed at the endosteal side opposite to the pressure zone. This did not occur in the controls. No signs of infection were observed. Our findings indicate that oscillating fluid pressure, even when present only during short periods, can lead to osteolysis and may be a cause of prosthetic loosening. Endosteal bone apposition may be a result of the interstitial flow that was created, giving false signals of mechanical load to the osteocyte...|$|R
