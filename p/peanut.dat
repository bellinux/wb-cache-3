5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made with <b>peanut</b> butter and marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include {{the substitution of}} wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients.

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} <b>peanut</b> butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to <b>peanut</b> butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the <b>peanut</b> butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of <b>peanut</b> butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|Nuts have a {{rich history}} as food. For many {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas, {{a wide variety of}} nuts, including acorns, American beech, and others, served as a major source of starch and fat over thousands of years. Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries. Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the <b>peanut.</b> Its usage was popularized by the work of George Washington Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of the <b>peanut</b> after employing <b>peanut</b> plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.|$|E

However, removing the desirable raisins from the <b>peanuts</b> does not purify the mixture, as one is left with undesirable <b>peanuts</b> (hence unrefined) not a refined component as before, and is thus permissible. Note that in this case there has not been any extraction of material from either the <b>peanuts</b> or raisins (Dosh), just the sorting of undesirable from desirable (Borer).|$|R

5|$|The term fluffernutter {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} other foods that feature <b>peanut</b> butter and marshmallow fluff, including Fluffernutter cookies, bars and cupcakes.

In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured <b>peanut</b> butter and Marshmallow Fluff in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also {{the name of a}} candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of <b>peanut</b> butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with <b>peanut</b> butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Peanut,</b> or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally from}} South America, {{has grown from}} a relatively minor crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, in part due to the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The short {{piece from}} SR 36 north to <b>Peanut</b> {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1907 as part of the <b>Peanut</b> Road, which became Route 35 in 1917. Route 35 was {{extended}} north from <b>Peanut</b> to Route 20 (SR 299) near Douglas City in 1933, and simultaneously a new Route 82 was created, running from Route 3 (I-5) in the Yreka area southwest to Etna and east to Montague. The gap between Douglas City and Etna was filled in 1959 with an extension of Route 82 south to Route 20 near Weaverville; at the same time, the portion between Weaverville and Yreka {{was added to the}} California Freeway and Expressway System, which identifies the main routes of transportation in the state of California. The State Route 3 designation was applied to the Peanut-Montague roadway in the 1964 renumbering. The overlap with temporary I-5 (along the portion where SR 3 runs concurrently with Interstate 5 today) near Yreka was removed when the new I-5 bypass was built; the legislative definition was updated to reflect this in 1974, soon after the building of the bypass.|$|E

5|$|In the Andes {{region of}} South America, with civilizations {{including}} the Inca, the major crop was the potato, domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. Coca, still a major crop to this day, was domesticated in the Andes, {{as were the}} <b>peanut,</b> tomato, tobacco, and pineapple. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Animals were also domesticated, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with <b>peanut</b> butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and <b>peanut</b> butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E
