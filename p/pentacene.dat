25|$|<b>Pentacene,</b> as well {{as other}} organic conductors, is subject to rapid {{oxidation}} in air, which precludes commercialization. If the <b>pentacene</b> is preoxidized, the pentacene-quinone is a potential gate insulator, then the mobility can approach that of rubrene – the highest-mobility organic semiconductor – namely, 40cm2/(V·s). This <b>pentacene</b> oxidation technique is akin to the silicon oxidation used in the silicon electronics.|$|E

Efficient alkynylation, followed by formation of four fused rings via a zirconacyclopentadiene intermediate, and then oxidation with DDQ gave <b>pentacenes</b> 1 a-c. The process was compatible with methyl, phenyl, and trimethylsilyl substituents, which have good solubility in various organic solvents...|$|R

25|$|<b>Pentacenes</b> {{have been}} {{examined}} as potential dichroic dyes. The pentacenoquinone displayed below is fluorescent and when mixed with liquid crystal E7 mixture a dichroic ratio of 8 is reached. Longer acenes align better in the nematic liquid crystal phase.|$|R
25|$|Structurally, <b>pentacene</b> {{is one of}} {{the linear}} acenes, the {{previous}} one being tetracene (four fused benzene rings) and the next one being hexacene (six fused benzene rings). In August 2009, a group of researchers from IBM published experimental results of imaging a single molecule of <b>pentacene</b> using an atomic force microscope. In July 2011, they used a modification of scanning tunneling microscopy to experimentally determine the shapes of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals.|$|E
25|$|Although pentacene's {{structure}} {{resembles that}} of other aromatic compounds like anthracene, its aromatic properties are poorly defined; as such, <b>pentacene</b> and its derivatives {{are the subject of}} much research.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pentacene</b> is {{a popular}} choice for {{research}} on organic thin-film transistors and OFETs, {{being one of the}} most thoroughly investigated conjugated organic molecules with a high application potential due to a hole mobility in OFETs of up to 5.5cm2/(V·s), which exceeds that of amorphous silicon.|$|E
40|$|Diisobutylaluminum hydride is {{utilized}} to reduce pentacene- 6, 13 -diones to the corresponding diols, useful precursors to functionalized <b>pentacenes.</b> This pathway is mild and efficient, and produces the cis-diols as major products.

Due to the cis and endo orientation, the cis-diols can be potential bidentates in catalysis, molecular propellers, and optoelectronic devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{isomeric}} diazadithiapentacenes (3) and (4) {{were obtained}} in reactions of 2 -chloro- 3 -bromoquinoline (5) with selected sulfur reagents in various conditions. The 1, 4 -dithiin ring opening in diazadithiapentacene (3) led to 2, 3 ’-diquinolinyl sulfide or (via the Smiles rearrangement {{stage of the}} S→S type) to 3, 3 ’-diquinolinyl sulfide or to diazadithiapentacene (4) depending on reaction conditions. The X-Ray study of <b>pentacenes</b> (3) and (4) revealed non-planar and folded structures along the central sulfur-sulfur axis. The central six-membered ring is in a boat conformation...|$|R
50|$|The {{molecules}} discussed {{thus far}} only exist diluted {{in the gas}} phase. A study exploring the properties of a compound formed in water from sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4.2H2O) and iminodiacetic acid also revealed evidence of aromaticity, but this compound has actually been isolated. X-ray crystallography showed that the sodium atoms are arranged in layers of hexagonal clusters akin to <b>pentacenes.</b> The sodium-to-sodium bond lengths are unusually short (327 pm versus 380 pm in elemental sodium) and, like benzene, the ring is planar. In this compound each sodium atom has a distorted octahedral molecular geometry with coordination to molybdenum atoms and water molecules. The experimental evidence is supported by computed NICS aromaticity values.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pentacene</b> {{reacts with}} {{elemental}} sulfur in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to the compound hexathiapentacene. X-ray crystallography shows {{that all the}} carbon-to-sulfur bond lengths are roughly equal (170 pm); from this, it follows that resonance structures B and C with complete charge separation are more significant than structure A.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pentacene</b> is a {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} consisting of five linearly-fused benzene rings. This highly conjugated compound is an organic semiconductor. The compound generates excitons upon absorption of ultra-violet (UV) or visible light; this makes it very sensitive to oxidation. For this reason, this compound, which is a purple powder, slowly degrades upon exposure to air and light.|$|E

40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{production}} of solar panels has prevented the widespread adoption of solar energy. A possible solution is to pursue solution-based solar cell technologies, since they can enable a low-cost and high-throughput manufacturing process. Both organic semiconductors and inorganic nanocrystals have emerged as promising solution-processable materials for solar cells. In this dissertation, I present my work on the investigation of both classes of materials for solar cell applications. Organic photovoltaics consist of donor and acceptor organic semiconductors. The mechanism of charge transfer between the donor poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and acceptor C 60 was studied by incorporating an inter-layer into the bilayer solar cell. Charge transfer was shown {{to take place in}} a two-step process whereby energy transfer of the photo-generated excitons in P 3 HT to C 60 is followed by a backward charge transfer step to P 3 HT. Novel ways to process these materials are also investigated. Solar cells from P 3 HT and a fullerene derivative, phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were fabricated by spray-deposition. Good power conversion efficiencies above 2 % were demonstrated, indicating the viability of spray deposition as a fabrication method. In a separate effort, a novel fluorinated resorcinarene photoresist was used to photolithographically pattern solar cells based on a blend of P 3 HT and PCBM for highvoltage applications. A 15 mm array of 300 solar cells connected in series achieved an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 90 volts. Three new classes of materials for organic solar cell acceptors are presented, namely <b>pentacenes,</b> hexacenes, and anthradithiophenes. Solar cells based on P 3 HT and <b>pentacenes</b> gave efficiencies as high as 1. 2 %. The hexacenes have the lowest bandgap, enabling hexacene-based solar cells to have photocurrent response up to 800 nm. The anthradithiophene-based solar cells achieved the highest VOC approaching 1. 1 Volts, and decent efficiencies of around 0. 8 %. Finally, a facile alcothermal method for the synthesis of dispersible CuO and Cu 2 O nanocrystals is presented. A bilayer CuO / PCBM solar cell demonstrated an efficiency of 0. 04 %, indicating the potential of these materials for light harvesting applications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and properties {{of a number}} of novel substituted 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrakis(amino) benzenes for which synthetic methods have only recently become available. Similar compounds have previously been observed as very electron rich systems; this thesis therefore explores some of the behaviour of these compounds that stems from this observed property. Chapter 1 details a proposed architecture for using single organic molecules as storage or processing units for single bits of binary data. This involves a bottom-up approach of creating single molecules, which could be used to fulfil the role of components in an integrated circuit. The design criteria that a molecule would need to fulfil in order to perform this task are discussed and substituted 1, 2, 4, 5 - tetrakis(amino) benzenes are suggested as possible candidates. Chapter 2 reports the results of a theoretical and computational study into the effects of ion-pairing on the observed electrochemical behaviour of tertiary 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrakis(amino) benzenes. Compounds 1 - 6 are modelled using Density Functional Theory in the gas phase, in solution and as ion-pairs with [PF 6] and [CI 04] anions. The results of this study provide some insight as to why some of the tertiary tetrakis(amino) benzenes exhibit two-electron oxidation processes under certain conditions. Chapter 3 goes on to explore the synthesis of a selection of novel secondary tetrakis(amino) benzenes 9 a - 11 a based on recently published methods employing palladium catalysis. These new compounds have aromatic substituents on the nitrogen atoms and methyl or methoxy groups on the 3 and 6 positions of the central benzene ring. The ease with which these compounds can be oxidised to the corresponding benzoquinonediimines 9 - 11 is noted. Chapter 4 reports the discovery that these benzoquinonediimines can be oxidatively cyclised to produce the novel riminophenazines 12 and 13 or tetra(aza) <b>pentacenes</b> 14 and 15. The oxidative synthesis of these compounds is optimised and the tetra(aza) <b>pentacenes</b> are observed to be stable with regard to further oxidation and can form dications. Chapter 5 explores the ability of the benzoquinone diimines to form stable coordination compounds with a variety of rhodium-containing fragments producing a selection of binuclear complexes. These compounds were observed to be redox active. The effect on the redox potentials caused by changes to substituents on the central ring as well as the ancilliary ligands was investigated. Chapter 6 summarises the conclusions drawn in each of the preceding chapters to give an overall picture of the properties and behaviour of the compounds studied. These observations are linked to the electron rich nature of these compounds. Some comments are offered regarding how the compounds studied would meet the specification laid out for 'molecular bits'. A number of interesting observed properties are highlighted. Potential future applications of the compounds detailed herein are explored, and a range of derivative compounds which would be worthy of further study are highlighted.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the noncovalent interactions in carbohydrate-aromatic interactions which are pivotal to the recognition of carbohydrates in proteins. We have employed quantum mechanical methods to study carbohydrate-aromatic complexes. Due {{to the importance of}} dispersion contribution to the interaction energy, we mainly use density functional theory augmented with an empirical correction for the dispersion interactions (DFT-D). We have validated this method with a limited number of high level ab initio calculations. We have also analysed the vibrational and NMR chemical shift characteristics using the DFT-D method. We have mainly studied the complexes involving β-glucose with 3 -methylindole and p-hydroxytoluene, which are analogues of tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively. We find that the contribution for interaction energy mainly comes from CH/π and OH/π interactions. We find that the interaction energy of complexes involving CH/π and OH/π interactions is reflected in the associated blue and red shifts of vibrational spectrum. We also find that the interactions involving 3 -methylindole are somewhat greater than those for p-hydroxytoluene. The C-H blueshifts are also in parallel with the predicted NMR proton shift. We have also tested different density functionals including both standard density functionals and newly developed M 0 x functionals and MP 2 method for studying carbohydrate-aromatic complexes. The DFT-D method and M 06 functionals of the M 0 x family are found to perform better, while B 3 LYP and BLYP functionals perform poorly. We find that the inclusion of a dispersion term to BLYP is found to perform better. The dispersion energy dominates over the interaction energy of carbohydrate-aromatic complexes. From the DFT-D calculations, we found that the complexes would be unstable without the contribution from dispersive energy. We have also studied the importance of noncovalent interactions in functionalization of nanotubes by nucleic acid bases and aromatic amino acids by using semi-empirical methods with dispersion term such asPM 3 -D and PM 3 -D*. We find that the both semi-empirical schemes give reasonable interaction energies with respect to DFT-D interaction energies. We have also used PM 3 -D method to study the adsorption of organic pollutants on graphene sheet and on nanotubes. We found that the semi-empirical schemes, which are faster and cheaper, are suitable to study these larger molecules involving noncovalent interactions and can be used as an alternative to DFT-D method. We have also studied the importance of dispersion interaction and the effect of steric hindrance in aggregation of functionalized anthracenes and <b>pentacenes.</b> We have also employed molecular dynamics simulation methods to study the aggregation of anthracene molecules in toluene solution.
