5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Sattelberg on 25 November, the 26th Brigade {{continued}} {{to advance to the}} north. Further fighting ensued as they <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December. After the Australians took Wareo, the Japanese began to fall back to Sio, where subsequent fighting took place throughout December 1943 and early 1944.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, Australian troops {{landed in}} Borneo, {{overrunning}} the oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> to reach Rangoon by 3 May. Chinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa {{by the end}} of June. At the same time, American submarines cut off Japanese imports, drastically reducing Japan's ability to supply its overseas forces.|$|E
5|$|Shifting {{subsequently}} to Okinawa, {{the battleship}} embarked homeward-bound GIs on 22 September 1945, {{as part of}} Operation Magic Carpet staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on 23 September, Wisconsin reached Pearl Harbor on 4 October, remaining there for five days before she <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> for the west coast on {{the last leg of}} her state-side bound voyage. She reached San Francisco on 15 October.|$|E
5000|$|If the come-out roll is 12, the bet is a push (neither won nor lost). In some casinos, the bet <b>pushes</b> <b>on</b> 2 {{and wins}} on 12 instead.

5|$|Under Ridgway's command, the Eighth Army pressed north {{again in}} January. He inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the Chinese, recaptured Seoul in March 1951, and <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> to the 38th Parallel. With the improved military situation, Truman now saw {{the opportunity to}} offer a negotiated peace but, on 24 March, MacArthur called upon China {{to admit that it}} had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both the Chinese and his own superiors. Truman's proposed announcement was shelved.|$|E
5|$|Young met {{mountain}} man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed routes into the Salt Lake Valley and {{the feasibility of}} viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. The company <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> through South Pass, rafted across the Green River, and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, {{they were joined by}} 12 more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.|$|E
5|$|After {{his injury}} healed, Orton joined the Evolution stable, which {{consisted}} of Ric Flair, Triple H, and relative newcomer, Batista. The group was <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> Raw from 2003 to 2004, with the height of their dominance occurring after Armageddon in 2003 {{when all of the}} men's titles on Raw were held by the members of Evolution. In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping Triple H overcome challenges for the World Heavyweight Championship. Orton joined Triple H in a six-man Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, involved primarily to secure Triple H's title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed to fulfill its purpose and Triple H went on to eliminate Goldberg and thus retain his title.|$|E

5|$|After local {{operations}} off the Virginia capes on 3–4 January 1957 and from 9–11 January, Wisconsin departed Norfolk on 16 January, reporting to Commander, Fleet Training Group, at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Wisconsin served as Admiral Henry Crommelin's flagship during the ensuing shore bombardment practices and other exercises held off the isle of Culebra, Puerto Rico, from 2–4 February. Sailing for Norfolk {{upon completion of}} the training period, the battleship arrived on 7 February and resumed {{local operations}} off Norfolk. On 27 March, Wisconsin sailed for the Mediterranean Sea, reaching Gibraltar on 6 April, she <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> that day to rendezvous with TF 60 in the Aegean Sea before reporting to Turkey for the NATO Exercise Red Pivot.|$|E
5|$|At 05:10 on August 22, {{an advance}} guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island {{under the command}} of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been {{stationed}} on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, the 15th Brigade IV Corps {{was sent to}} link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-La Haie area, with the brigade's horse {{artillery}} battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support. Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to stop the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past {{the rear of the}} Armee Du Nord's right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit.|$|E

5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May, the Germans {{continued}} to attack Soviet {{positions in the}} north in localized offensives and by then, the Luftwaffe had gained air superiority over the Kharkov sector, forcing Timoshenko to move his own air assets forward in order to effectively counter the bolstered Luftflotte 4. The Luftwaffe won air superiority over their numerically superior, but technically inferior opponents. The air battles depleted the Soviet fighter strength, allowing the German strike aircraft the chance to influence the land battle even more. Nonetheless, the Soviet forces <b>pushed</b> <b>on,</b> disengaging from several minor battles and changing the direction of their thrusts. However, {{in the face of}} continued resistance and local counterattacks, the Soviet attack ebbed, especially when combined with the invariably heavy air raids. By the end of the day, the 28th Army could no longer conduct offensive operations against German positions.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that his}} advance {{was going to}} be contested, Bowen {{requested}} reinforcements. Consequently, as an interim measure, 59men from Warrego and Yarra were landed under Lieutenant G.A. Hill, until infantry could arrive from Berrima, which was still steaming towards Kabakaul from Karavia Bay. Meanwhile, Bowen <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> and the Australians were again fired upon by the well concealed Germans and their Melanesian troops, as well as by snipers in the treetops. By 09:30the situation had become grave, and the Australians suffered their first casualty of the war, with Able Seaman Billy Williams mortally wounded. Also among the casualties was the medical officer, Captain Brian Pockley, who died of his wounds in the afternoon after being evacuated to Berrima.|$|E

5|$|The 25th Infantry Brigade {{advanced}} {{down the}} Markham Valley and entered Lae on 16 September. The division then advanced up the Markham Valley {{and down the}} Ramu Valley. A series of operations followed. First, commandos of the 2/6th Independent Company seized Kaiapit in the Battle of Kaiapit on 19 September. Vasey flew there on 21 September in a Piper Cub, followed by his 21st Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier Ivan Dougherty. The 21st Infantry Brigade advanced on Gusap and then Dumpu, where Vasey established his headquarters on 10 October. Finally, it <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> into the Finisterre Range, where it was halted by logistical difficulties. In the Finisterre Range campaign, the 7th Division captured Shaggy Ridge and advanced across the mountains towards Madang.|$|E
5|$|The Attack on Pearl Harbor and {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II stopped all work on the {{causeway}} {{and the development of}} Virginia Key. After the war, Crandon <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> with the development project. He got financier Ed Ball to buy six million (U.S.) dollars worth of bonds financing construction of the causeway. The causeway was named for Eddie Rickenbacker, World War I flying ace, and {{founder and president of the}} Miami-based Eastern Air Lines. Starting in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new homes on the island for US$9,540, with just US$500 down. A U.S. Post Office contract branch was opened, the Community Church started holding services, and the Key Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich {{to solve}} the railway crisis in 1935. Kaganovich first prioritised {{bottleneck}} areas over other less-traveled areas; his second priority was investing in heavy traffic lines, and thirdly, the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves. Another problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> by the authorities. The industrialisation {{proved to be a}} heavy burden on the railways, and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress. Even so, the Soviet Government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany, which became reality in 1941.|$|E

5|$|The Mud Bay force {{travelled}} in Arunta {{and came}} ashore at 23:00 in the Maclaren King, {{two of the}} ship's launches, the three Japanese landing craft and the two powered whaleboats. A base was established at Mud Bay, where a dressing station was prepared and heavy equipment, including all but one 2-inch mortar per company, was cached. The Australians then {{set out on a}} gruelling march to Kilia, guided by Papuan policemen. As they moved off, a violent thunderstorm broke, and it started to rain heavily. The force <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> toward Kilia, but made slow progress that night due to the steep terrain and heavy rain. They were still half a mile from Kilia at 08:30 on 23 October, when they encountered the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} third waves of castle {{building}} were led by the major magnates, {{and then by the}} more junior knights on their new estates. The apportionment of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a few key locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line of communication with Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they went and often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.|$|E
5|$|Under Vasey's command, the 7th Division recaptured Kokoda on 2 November. It <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> {{towards the}} north coast of Papua, only to be stopped by the Japanese short of their {{ultimate}} objective. The division was forced to fight a bloody battle around Buna, and, together with American troops under Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, ultimately defeated the Japanese and captured Gona. After the campaign, the 7th Division returned to Australia. The men went on leave before reassembling for training on the Atherton Tableland. Vasey went on leave in Melbourne but wound up being admitted to the Heidelberg Military Hospital for treatment for Malaria.|$|E
