5000|$|Tyndall was an {{experimenter}} {{and laboratory}} apparatus builder, not an abstract model builder. But in his experiments on radiation and the heat-absorptive power of gases, {{he had an}} underlying agenda to understand the physics of molecules. Tyndall said in 1879: [...] "During nine years of labour {{on the subject of}} radiation the 1860s, heat and light were handled throughout by me, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter." [...] This agenda is explicit in the title he picked for his 1872 book Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat. It is present less explicitly in the spirit of his widely read 1863 book Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion. Besides heat he also saw magnetism and sound propagation as reducible to molecular behaviours. Invisible molecular behaviours were the ultimate basis of all physical activity. With this mindset, and his experiments, he outlined an account whereby differing types of molecules have differing absorptions of infrared radiation because their molecular structures give them differing oscillating resonances. He'd gotten into the oscillating resonances idea because he'd seen that any one type of molecule has differing absorptions at differing radiant frequencies, and he was entirely persuaded that the only difference between one frequency and another is the frequency. He'd also seen that the absorption behaviour of molecules is quite {{different from that of the}} atoms composing the molecules. For example, the gas nitric oxide (NO) absorbed more than a thousand times more infrared radiation than either nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2). He'd also seen in several kinds of experiments that - no matter whether a gas is a weak absorber of broad-spectrum radiant heat - any gas will strongly absorb the radiant heat coming from a separate body of the same type of gas. That demonstrated a kinship between the molecular mechanisms of absorption and emission. Such a kinship was also in evidence in experiments by Balfour Stewart and others, cited and extended by Tyndall, that showed with respect to broad-spectrum radiant heat that molecules that are weak absorbers are weak emitters and strong absorbers are strong emitters. (For example, rock-salt is an exceptionally poor absorber of heat via radiation, and a good absorber of heat via conduction. When a plate of rock-salt is heated via conduction and let stand on an insulator, it takes an exceptionally long time to cool down; i.e., it's a poor emitter of infrared.) The kinship between absorption and emission was also consistent with some generic or abstract features of resonators. The chemical decomposition of molecules by lightwaves (<b>photochemical</b> <b>effect)</b> convinced Tyndall that the resonator could not be the molecule as a whole unit; it had to be some substructure, because otherwise the <b>photochemical</b> <b>effect</b> would be impossible. But he was without testable ideas as to the form of this substructure, and did not partake in speculation in print. His promotion of the molecular mindset, and his efforts to experimentally expose what molecules are, has been discussed by one historian under the title [...] "John Tyndall, The Rhetorician of Molecularity".|$|E

Methods. This effect was measured by determining the enantiomeric excesses (e. e. s) for two amino acids formed in the solid organic residues produced during the subsequent warm-up of the irradiated samples to room temperature: alanine, the most abundant chiral proteinaceous amino acid produced (both polarizations) and 2, 3 -diaminopropanoic acid (DAP), a non-proteinaceous amino acid (rightpolarization experiment). These excesses were compared to those measured for the same amino acids produced after unpolarized UV irradiation of the same ice mixtures (expected to be zero), {{in order to determine}} the contribution of CPL only. A careful estimate of all the associated uncertainties (statistical and systematic errors) was also developed. Results. It appears that the enantiomeric <b>photochemical</b> <b>effect</b> at this wavelength is weak, since both alanine and DAP e. e. s were found to be small, at most of the order of 1 % in absolute values, and tends to be inconclusive since the effects obtained for both amino acids and both polarizations are not those expected.

40|$|The {{stratosphere}} {{is thought}} to {{play a central role}} in the atmospheric response to solar irradiance variability. Recent observations suggest that the spectral solar irradiance (SSI) variability involves significant time-dependent spectral variations, with variable degrees of correlation between wavelengths, and new reconstructions are being developed. In this paper, we propose a simplified modelling framework to characterise the effect of short term SSI variability on stratospheric ozone. We focus on the pure <b>photochemical</b> <b>effect,</b> for it is the best constrained one. The <b>photochemical</b> <b>effect</b> is characterised using an ensemble simulation approach with multiple linear regression analysis. A photochemical column model is used with interactive photolysis for this purpose. Regression models and their coefficients provide a characterisation of the stratospheric ozone response to SSI variability and will allow future inter-comparisons between different SSI reconstructions. As a first step in this study, and to allow comparison with past studies, we take the representation of SSI variability from the Lean (1997) solar minimum and maximum spectra. First, solar maximum-minimum response is analysed for all chemical families and partitioning ratios, and is compared with past studies. The ozone response peaks at 0. 18 ppmv (approximately 3 %) at 37 km altitude. Second, ensemble simulations are regressed following two linear models. In the simplest case, an adjusted coefficient of determination R 2 larger than 0. 97 is found throughout the stratosphere using two predictors, namely the previous day's ozone perturbation and the current day's solar irradiance perturbation. A better accuracy (R 2 larger than 0. 9992) is achieved with an additional predictor, the previous day's solar irradiance perturbation. The regression models also provide simple parameterisations of the ozone perturbation due to SSI variability. Their skills as proxy models are evaluated independently against the photochemistry column model. The bias and RMS error of the best regression model are found smaller than 1 % and 15 % of the ozone response, respectively. Sensitivities to initial conditions and to magnitude of the SSI variability are also discussed...|$|E

A further series of experiments involving etching with filtered light and a focused laser beam of varying wavelengths (not presented here) suggests that the ESE is preserved for lower energies than the AlAs band gap and therefore any <b>photochemical</b> <b>effect</b> in HF cannot depend on light excitation of the AlAs material.

40|$|At {{middle latitudes}} the total column ozone {{and the lower}} stratospheric ozone mixing ratio exhibit natural variability. Models and {{statistical}} analyses of observations such as SAGE ozone profiles and TOMS column measurements show that seasonal cycle, solar cycle, and interannual dynamical variability and dynamical phenomena such as the quasi- biennial oscillation all contribute to ozone variability. These must be accounted for when deriving ozone trends. Systematic or random changes in the atmospheric circulation may also contribute to ozone trends. It is presently unclear {{how much of the}} ozone trend derived from observations is due to changes in the chemical composition of the stratosphere and how much is due to changes in the atmospheric circulation. We are attempting to resolve this issue by comparing a twenty-five year simulation of ozone with fixed source gas boundary conditions with an identical simulation with time dependent source gas boundary conditions. Both simulations are driven with output from a general circulation model that produces realistic interannual variability in dynamical forcing. The model trend in ozone due to changes in composition is determined from the difference in these simulations. We compare these trends with trends determined from observations and model output using the same analysis techniques. Initial results emphasize the complications to attribution of observed ozone trends to dynamical and <b>photochemical</b> <b>effects</b> that are due to interrelationships between trends in transport, temperature, and <b>photochemical</b> <b>effects.</b> It may not be possible to describe the ozone trend as a superposition of dynamical and photochemical contributions...|$|R

40|$|Selenium is a {{trace element}} and an {{essential}} microelement for humans, animals and microorganisms, whereas {{this has not}} been established for plants yet. It is widespread in the earth's crust and occurs in soil, seawater and freshwater as well as minerals and sediments. Climatic conditions, geological composition of the soil and numerous anthropogenic factors affect the presence of selenium in the environment. It can exist in four oxidation states. Selenite is the most important form of selenium in soil. It can convert into selenate due to microbiological activity. Being the most soluble inorganic forms of selenium, selenite and selenate are the most accessible to plants. The effect of selenium depends mainly on its form and concentration in plants. We studied the influence of different concentrations and forms of selenium on biochemical and morphological characteristics of common duckweed. Plants were exposed to various concentrations (1 mg/L, 2 mg/L and 5 mg/L) of sodium selenite solutions (Na 2 SeO 3), various concentrations (1 mg/L, 2 mg/L and 5 mg/L) of sodium selenate solutions (Na 2 SeO 4) and to a combination of selenite and selenate with a 2 mg/L concentration.
