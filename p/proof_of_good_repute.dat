60|$|The {{house of}} Heine Brothers, in Munich, was <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> {{at the time}} of which I am about to tell,--a time not long ago; and is so still, I trust. It was <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> in its own way, seeing that no man doubted the word or {{solvency}} of Heine Brothers; but they did not possess, as bankers, what would in England be considered a large or profitable business. The operations of English bankers are bewildering in their magnitude. Legions of clerks are employed. The senior book-keepers, though only salaried servants, are themselves great men; while the real partners are inscrutable, mysterious, opulent beyond measure, and altogether unknown to their customers. Take any firm at random,--Brown, Jones, and Cox, let us say,--the probability is that Jones has been dead these fifty years, that Brown is a Cabinet Minister, and that Cox is master of a pack of hounds in Leicestershire. But it was by no means so with the house of Heine Brothers, of Munich. There they were, the two elderly men, daily to be seen at their dingy office in the Schrannen Platz; and if any business was to be transacted requiring the interchange of more than a word or two, it was the younger brother with whom the customer was, as a matter of course, brought into contact. There were three clerks in the establishment; an old man, namely, who sat with the elder brother and had no personal dealings with the public; a young Englishman, of whom we shall anon hear more; and a boy who ran messages, put the wood on to the stoves, and swept out the bank. Truly he house of Heine Brothers was of no great importance; but nevertheless it was <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute.</b>|$|R
25|$|All these punishments were {{dependent}} on proof required for hadd being met. In practice the Hudd requirement—four Muslim men <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> testifying as {{witness to the}} crime—was seldom met. As of 2014, no one offenders have been stoned or had limbs amputated by the Pakistani judicial system. To be found guilty of theft, zina, or drinking alcohol by less strict tazir standards—where the punishment was flogging and/or imprisonment—was common, {{and there have been}} many floggings.|$|R
5000|$|In 1819, the Dublin Society of Artists, {{which had}} been for some years torn by {{internal}} dissensions, applied for a charter of incorporation.This was actively opposed, and Comerford was selected by the opposers, as being a man <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> and much respected, to write to Sir Robert Peel, then chief secretary for Ireland, explaining the reason for opposition.The controversy ended in the complete defeat of Comerford and his friends, and the society obtained their charter in 1821.|$|R

[Sidenote: Sir Kay and Sir Dagonet {{come to the}} forest] Now, you are to {{know that}} though Sir Dagonet was the King's jester, and though he was slack of wit, yet {{he was also a}} knight of no mean prowess.

So Sir Dagonet always went armed; though he bore upon his shield the device of a cockerel's head as a symbol of his calling.|$|R

Since only two sons were named, it might have been Gun, father of Yu the Great or Qiongchan, the {{ancestor}} of Shun. Yao had also criticized Gun for being incompetent and ruinous. The Shiji labelled Qiongchan an insignificant commoner though it does not mention how he fell from grace. He also had eight unnamed sons <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> that later worked for Shun.|$|R

50|$|Ever {{since the}} Restoration {{there had been}} great {{difficulty}} in finding a suitable Irish Lord Chancellor: MIchael Boyle, Archbishop of Armagh, held the office for twenty years simply because no professional judge <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> was prepared to do so. Boyle, despite his lack of legal training, was a conscientious and incorruptible judge, but in old age his mental and physical powers declined.Despite the objections of the Lord Lieutenant, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, who was a <b>good</b> friend <b>of</b> Boyle, {{it was decided to}} replace him with Porter, who was knighted and appointed Lord Chancellor in April 1686.|$|R

5000|$|The {{school was}} opened on 1 October 1855, once a teacher had been found. Apart from {{establishing}} a building, the chief obstacle in running a school {{had been the}} inability to procure a fit and proper teacher. Ticket-of-leave men <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> often filled the role as schoolmasters. The School Committee thought itself fortunate indeed in obtaining the services of Reverend Alfred Grey, a schoolmaster who seemed well qualified.

6000|$|Most judicious persons {{would have}} here dropped the conversation; {{but it was}} one of Wildrake's marked peculiarities, that he could never let matters stand when they were well.

60|$|The auctioneer's table {{had been}} set up in the open with the ticketed {{implements}} arranged behind it and the stock and horses in the wire-fenced corral close beside. He was <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>repute</b> in his business, and I felt assured of fair play from him, at least, though I could see Lane's purpose in bringing him out from Winnipeg. The latter was too clever to spoil a well-laid scheme by any superfluous petty trickery, and with that man to conduct it nobody could question the legitimacy of the sale.
