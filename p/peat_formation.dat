40|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{preservation}} of old <b>peat</b> <b>formations</b> and the limited research developed on them, the contribution of peat oxidation to the global C cycle at geological scales is poorly understood. Iron duricrusts containing abundant well-preserved plant structures have been reported above Humic Gleysols in the Uberaba Plateau (Brazil). We show that the iron accumulation results from an in-situ impregnation of peat, fast enough to preserve the plant structures. The formation of iron oxides results from two processes: precipitation in the pores and C/Fe replacement. The iron duricrusts were probably triggered by oxidation of the peatland following dry climatic events during the last 50 kyr. The large amount of iron dissolved in peatland waters was immobilized contemporaneously with the destruction of organic matter. The oxidation of organic matter from the lower peat, dated at ca 24 - 27 kyr BP, may have released between 0. 08 and 2. 26 kg CO 2 m(- 2) yr(- 1) in the atmosphere. These rates are in a good agreement with present-day measurements of CO 2 release from drained peatlands.

Such techniques demonstrate that the various humic fractions were very different {{not only in terms}} of molecular weight but also in their composition and structural characteristics, showing well differentiated patterns in the relative distribution of alkyl, O-alkyl and aromatic moieties in each humic fraction. To a large extent, selectively preserved lignin accumulates in the humic acid (HA) fraction, whereas the fulvic acid (FA) consists of a colloidal carbohydrate with a substantial peptidic moiety and the humin includes the noteworthy concentration of insoluble, macromolecular polyalkyl structures. A diagnostic lignin signature in the resolution-enhanced infrared spectra of the HA points to processes of selective preservation of macromolecular substances derived from vascular plants. In general, the humic fractions were not extensive sources of chemotaxonomic descriptors of previously documented biodiversity changes along the period of the <b>peat</b> deposit <b>formation.</b> This is in harmony with a substantial homogenising effect of diagenetic transformations throughout the whole sedimentary record with peat stratigraphy recording mostly the authigenic processes of bog formation and development.

Here we report ‘‘hotspots’’ of organic matter decomposition {{as a result of}} rewetting a drained peatland in Wales, at the field-scale, in the medium/long-term with implications for water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Low soil moisture levels, that characterise these hotspots before rewetting, regenerate electron acceptors and provide carbon and nutrients which stimulate phenol oxidase-mediated release of phenolic compounds from the peat matrix upon waterlogging. Electron acceptors are then consumed sequentially, eventually favouring CH 4 production and rising pH, despite accumulating SO 4 levels.

Their characteristics make them different from other types of peat bogs. String-bogs {{are found in the}} Québec-Labrador peninsula inside a zone of which the Southern limit is the 50 th parallel and the Northern limit is approximately the 55 th parallel.

In order to explain the formation of string-bogs, the author envisions a combination of processes in which either one or the other can dominate locally.

In Malaysia, peat soils are considered as a soil with little economic benefit, apart from it being used for agricultural activity. The total world coverage of peat soil is about thirty million hectares with Canada and Russia having the largest distribution of peat (Zainorabiddin, 2010). More than sixty percent of the world’s tropical peat lands are found in South-East Asia (Lette, 2006). Most notable are the large peat land on the islands of Borneo (belonging to Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei) and Sumatra (Indonesia). However, there are also significant occurrences in other parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. The main contributory functions and benefits of peat soil are within the engineering disciplines of hydrology, agriculture, social-economics, biodiversity habitats and carbon sequestration. Peat was used in temperate climates (especially in Finland, Ireland, Sweden and UK) as a fuel to generate electricity and heat. Therefore peat can be considered as a renewable energy source but this will be very detrimental to the market of genuine renewables. The western coastal lowlands of Malaysia (such as Kukup) are mangroves that represent the initiation of <b>peat</b> soil <b>formation.</b> Such areas provide the natural habitat of mangrove forests. It also fixes more carbon from the atmosphere than is released and approximately one-quarter of the carbon stored in land plants and soils. On the other hand, peat is one of the problematic or challenging foundation soil of poor quality due to it’s very high water content, high compressibility and low shear strength. Peat consists of decomposed plant fragments and the unfavourable characteristics of peat soil deposits make them unsuitable for making sustainable infrastructure development for varied engineering projects. This paper therefore gives an overview of the pros and cons debate of sustainability aspects and {{in the light of the}} challenges it poses to infrastructure development in Malaysia. &# 13; st 1 :*{behavior:url(#ieooui) }&# 13; &# 13; /* Style Definitions */&# 13; table.

The plateau of the Corton Formatioq which is locally covered by up to rather more than a metre of cover silt, produces excellent agricultural land, neither too heavy nor too li&t. Large crops of wheat, barley, sugar beet and potatoes are grown, and owing to the water-retentive properties of the cover silt, little artificial irrigation is required despite the low rainfall in this part of the country. However, the land underlain by the Crag and Upper Chalk are very well draiied and form relatively poor arable land, requiring much artificial irrigation. Much of this land is wooded and used for commercial shooting. The floodplain of the Bure is given over to pemnanent pasture, which is largely grazed by cattle. This floodplain lies at an artificially low level as a result of shrinkage of the ground owing to drainage: the peats within the Breydon Formation are particularly prone to shrinkage and oxidation on drying. National Grid References in this report are given in square brackets; these all fall within 100 - kilometre square TG. All depths and thicknesses in the report are given in metres. The nonconfidential water wells and boreholes in the district are shown on Figure 2; identification numbers quoted are those of the BGS records collection, in which they are prefmed TG 21 NE. Complete logs of the non-confidential wells and boreholes can be obtained fiom BGS Information Services (Geological Records) at Keyworth...|$|R
