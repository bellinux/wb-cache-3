40|$|Chlorpropham (CIPC) is {{the main}} sprout {{inhibitor}} used by potato industry. There is concern about the residues of CIPC and its degradation product 3 -chloroaniline, 3 -CA; hence, analytical methods are required to analyse their residues in potato samples. An HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for the separation and quantification of these compounds using <b>propham</b> (IPC) as an internal standard. The chromatographic conditions required to achieve good separation were 60 % mobile phase of methanol, 15 -minute run time at a flow rate of 1. 5 [*]mL/min, and a detection wavelength of 210 [*]nm using Phenomenex (ODS- 2 250 [*]mm × 4. 60 [*]mm 5 [*]µm Sphereclone) column at an ambient temperature. The method was validated for precision, linearity, the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ), producing high precision through RSD ≤ 0. 03 %, and acceptable criteria of the coefficient of determination (R 2) of the calibration curves (0. 990). LOD values of CIPC and 3 -CA were approximately 0. 01 [*]µg/mL whereas the LOQ values were approximately 0. 04 [*]µg/mL using repeated injection approach. The proposed HPLC method was compared with the standard GC method of the CIPC residues extracted showing good agreement R 2 = 0. 99. Despite using the same extract, the recovery results for the proposed HPLC method were 13 % higher than GC analysis...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, {{samples of}} treated {{effluent}} were collected at {{point of discharge}} to the environment from 39 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located across Victoria, Australia grouped by treatment type. Sample genotoxicity was assessed with a high-throughput luminescent umu test method using Salmonella typhimurium TL 210 strain, with and without addition of a commercially available metabolic activation system. Samples were also screened using a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric mass-structure database recognition method. A genotoxic response was observed in half of the samples tested without metabolic activation system (<LOR - 0. 19 µg/L 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide equivalents). On addition of metabolic activation system, 75 % of samples elicited a genotoxic response, the majority of responses were stronger than without metabolic activation (<LOR - 2. 97 µg/L benzo[a]pyrene equivalents). The type of WWTP {{had no effect on}} genotoxicity. A large number of chemicals were identified in the effluents, although none could be unambiguously tied to the genotoxicity observed. Chemicals observed in one or more effluents included food additives (e. g. dibenzylether), various alkyl phenols, tyre leachates (e. g. 2 (3 H) - benzothiazolone), antioxidants, flame retardants (e. g. tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate), insect repellents (e. g. diethyltoluamide), stimulants (e. g. caffeine) and anticonvulsants (e. g. carbamazepine). Of the 451 pesticides screened, carbamate insecticides (e. g. bendiocarb, propoxur), plant growth regulators (e. g. <b>propham)</b> and herbicides (e. g. atrazine, metolachlor, simazine) were amongst the compounds observed...|$|E
40|$|N-acetylanthranilate amidase (Amq), a 32. 8 -kDa monomeric amide hydrolase, is {{involved}} in quinaldine degradation by Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus Rü 61 a. Sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions indicated that Amq is related to carboxylesterases and belongs to the α/β-hydrolase-fold superfamily of enzymes; inactivation of (His 6 -tagged) Amq by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and diethyl pyrocarbonate and replacement of conserved residues suggested a catalytic triad consisting of S 155, E 235, and H 266. Amq is most active towards aryl-acetylamides and aryl-acetylesters. Remarkably, its preference for ring-substituted analogues was different for amides and esters. Among the esters tested, phenylacetate was hydrolyzed with highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 208 mM− 1 s− 1), while among the aryl-acetylamides, o-carboxy- or o-nitro-substituted analogues were preferred over p-substituted or unsubstituted compounds. Hydrolysis by His 6 Amq of primary amides, lactams, N-acetylated amino acids, azocoll, tributyrin, and the acylanilide and urethane pesticides propachlor, <b>propham,</b> carbaryl, and isocarb was not observed; propanil was hydrolyzed with 1 % N-acetylanthranilate amidase activity. The catalytic properties of the cysteine-deficient variant His 6 AmqC 22 A/C 63 A markedly differed from those of His 6 Amq. The replacements effected some changes in Kms of the enzyme and increased kcats for most aryl-acetylesters and some aryl-acetylamides by factors of about three to eight while decreasing kcat for the formyl analogue N-formylanthranilate by several orders of magnitude. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the cysteine-to-alanine replacements resulted in significant change of the overall fold, especially an increase in α-helicity of the cysteine-deficient protein. The conformational changes may also affect the active site and {{may account for the}} observed changes in kinetic properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of 46 herbicides, 17 fungicides and 15 insecticides on transformations of urea nitrogen in soil was studied by determining {{the effects of}} different amounts of each pesticide on the amounts of urea hydrolyzed and the amounts of nitrite and nitrate produced when samples of two coarse-textured and two fine-textured soils were incubated aerobically at 20 (DEGREES) C for various times after treatment with urea. The pesticides tested are commonly used for control of weedy plant species, plant pathogens and soil insects {{in a range of}} cropping situations;When the 46 herbicides tested were applied at the rate of 5 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, they had little or no effect on urea hydrolysis or nitrification of urea nitrogen in the four soils. When they were applied at the rate of 50 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, only dinoseb retarded urea hydrolysis in all four of the soils, but all except siduron retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in one of the coarse-textured soils and ten (2, 4 -D amine, 2, 4 -D ester, propanil, chlorpropham, alachlor, amitrole, dinoseb, <b>propham,</b> fenoxaprop ethyl and tridphane) retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in all four soils;When the 17 fungicides tested were applied at the rate of 1 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, only maneb retarded hydrolysis of urea and only terrazole retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in the four soils used. When they were applied at the rate of 50 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, most of them retarded urea hydrolysis in the two coarse-textured soils and all except anilazine, benomyl, chloroneb, fenarimol, iprodione and PCNB markedly retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in all four of the soils;When the 15 insecticides tested were applied at the rate of 5 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil, none of them retarded urea hydrolysis in the four soils used, but five (carbaryl, lindane, trimethacarb, diazinon and fenitrothion) retarded nitrification of urea nitrogen in the two coarse-textured soils.

40|$|Several {{automated}} reversed-phase HPLC {{methods have}} been developed to determine trace concentrations of carbamate pesticides (which are of concern in Ontario environmental samples) in water by utilizing two solid sorbent extraction techniques. One of the methods is known as on-line pre-concentration'. This technique involves passing 100 milliliters of sample water through a 3 cm pre-column, packed with 5 micron ODS sorbent, at flow rates varying from 5 - 10 mUmin. By the use of a valve apparatus, the HPLC system is then switched to a gradient mobile phase program consisting of acetonitrile and water. The analytes, Propoxur, Carbofuran, Carbaryl, <b>Propham,</b> Captan, Chloropropham, Barban, and Butylate, which are pre-concentrated on the pre-column, are eluted and separated on a 25 cm C- 8 analytical column and determined by UV absorption at 220 nm. The total analytical time is 60 minutes, and the pre-column can be used repeatedly for the analysis of as many as thirty samples. The method is highly sensitive as 100 percent of the analytes present in the sample can be injected into the HPLC. No breakthrough of any of the analytes was observed and the minimum detectable concentrations range from 10 to 480 ng/L. The developed method is totally automated for the analysis of one sample. When the above mobile phase is modified with a buffer solution, Aminocarb, Benomyl, and its degradation product, MBC, can also be detected along with the above pesticides with baseline resolution for all of the analytes. The method can also be easily modified to determine Benomyl and MBC both as solute and as particulate matter. By using a commercially available solid phase extraction cartridge, in lieu of a pre-column, for the extraction and concentration of analytes, a completely automated method has been developed with the aid of the Waters Millilab Workstation. Sample water is loaded at 10 mL/min through a cartridge and the concentrated analytes are eluted from the sorbent with acetonitrile. The resulting eluate is blown-down under nitrogen, made up to volume with water, and injected into the HPLC. The total analytical time is 90 minutes. Fifty percent of the analytes present in the sample can be injected into the HPLC, and recoveries for the above eight pesticides ranged from 84 to 93 percent. The minimum detectable concentrations range from 20 to 960 ng/L. The developed method is totally automated for the analysis of up to thirty consecutive samples. The method has proven to be applicable to both purer water samples as well as untreated lake water samples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In the UK, up to {{six million}} tonnes of {{potatoes}} are produced annually {{and more than half}} of this production is stored for the fresh market and food processing. To maintain potato quality from sprouting, chlorpropham (CIPC) is currently used as the main sprout suppressant in commercial potato stores. Questions have been raised about the safety of application of this compound in potato stores due to increasing concern about the toxicity of its residue and degradation products mainly 3 -chloroaniline (3 -CA) on the potato tubers. To date, there is no realistic replacement of CIPC for inhibiting sprouting of potatoes destined for processing. Searching for alternatives is crucial particularly as most supermarkets demand foods free of chemicals. The sprout inhibitor 1, 4 -dimethylnaphthalene (1, 4 -DMN) can be a suitable replacement for CIPC as it is naturally occurring in the potato and currently used in many countries in the world. To introduce this compound to the UK for commercial use, many investigations must be conducted to ensure its safety for human health and the environment. This study intended to focus on the determination of the residue level of 1, 4 -DMN, CIPC and its metabolite 3 -CA in potato and water samples, hence developing analytical methods was required as a preliminary step. In this study, three HPLC systems were used for validating a separation method for the analysis of 1, 4 -dimethylnaphthalene and its internal standard 2 -methylnaphthalene (2 -MeN). Under the same chromatographic conditions, all these systems achieved excellent separation on a Jones-ODS column (Hypersil ODS 5 µm, 250 mm x 4. 6 mm) at ambient temperature isocratically using 70 % acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min, 20 µL injection volume, a run time of 10 minutes and a detection wavelength of 228 nm. All three systems showed high precision (RSD% < 1 %), good linearity of the calibration curves at two concentration ranges (0. 02 – 0. 1 and 0. 2 – 1. 0 µg/mL) of each 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN with coefficient of determination (R 2) of the regression line of 0. 990 or more. The best system SpectraSERIES UV 100 -autosampler system was selected for the remainder of this research as it offered lower values for both the limit of detection (LOD) (0. 001 – 0. 004 µg/mL) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) (0. 002 – 0. 013 µg/mL) for both compounds. A second isocratic reversed phase HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for analysis of 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN using methanol as a substitute solvent for standards and mobile phase preparations to overcome the problem of a global shortage of acetonitrile during 2008 – 2009. The best separation was achieved on the Phenomenex® (ODS- 2 250 mm x 4. 60 mm 5 µm Sphereclone) column using 90 % methanol as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min and a 6 minute run time. The method was validated producing good precision, linearity and low values of LOQ (~ 0. 001 µg/mL). A straightforward and rapid isocratic HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of both CIPC and its degradation product 3 -CA using methanol as a solvent and <b>propham</b> (IPC) as an internal standard. To achieve high resolution of the three compounds, the chromatographic conditions selected were: Phenomenex® column (ODS- 2 250 mm x 4. 60 mm 5 µm Sphereclone), 62 % methanol at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min, detection wavelength of 210 nm and a 15 minute run time. Method validation confirmed good precision, acceptable linearity and low values of LOD (~ 0. 01 µg/mL) and LOQ (~ 0. 04 µg/mL) for CIPC and 3 -CA. These proposed HPLC methods are suitable to apply for the determination of the studied compounds in both potatoes and water samples. Quantitative laboratory analysis of 1, 4 -DMN, 2 -MeN, CIPC and 3 -CA in water solutions showed acceptable standard preparations in water with good precision and linearity and lower values of LOD and LOQ close to those obtained in organic solvent preparations. An adsorption study of 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN on laboratory ware showed that glass materials were acceptable to use whereas there was a considerable adsorption to plastic containers and filters. In contrast, 3 -CA showed no adsorption onto any of the laboratory ware tested. CIPC also showed good recoveries with most of the materials tested. In reviewing the literature, no suitable published method for the simultaneous determination of CIPC and its metabolite 3 -CA in potato peel was found. A simple analytical method was developed based on methanol-soaking overnight extraction coupled with HPLC-UV for analysis of CIPC and 3 -CA in potato samples using IPC as internal standard. The method was validated and the calculated limit of quantification was 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 02 µg/g in whole tuber for CIPC, IPC and 3 -CA respectively. The efficiency of the method reported recovery values of up to 90 % for both CIPC and IPC through spiking organic potato peel at three spiking levels of 0. 8, 8. 0 and 80 µg/g. By contrast, 3 -CA recoveries offered very low values of 10 and 23 % at concentration levels of 8. 0 and 80 µg/g respectively and no peak was detected at the lower level of 0. 8 µg/g. This method was compared with the routine Soxhlet-GC method used for the analysis of the residues of CIPC in potato samples at the University of Glasgow laboratory and gave results approximately 23 % higher residues of CIPC. This new method at this stage was suitable to extract CIPC in 20 potato samples daily. Nevertheless, an interesting finding was that despite the low recovery of 3 -CA it was identified in treated potato samples. This unanticipated low recovery is noteworthy and indicates that the actual residue may be much higher. A comprehensive study was made to improve the extractability of 3 -CA from potato samples investigating parameters including potato variety, extracting solvent, extraction method, spiking procedure and different treatments for potato samples. All these experimental trials showed no recovery improvements, thus four possible mechanisms were suggested for poor recovery of 3 -CA including volatilisation, reaction with potato components, enzymatic activity and ion exchange related to pH. Under the laboratory work experimental conditions, no measurable loss of 3 -CA by volatilisation was found. No reaction of 3 -CA was found to occur with other potato components under the experimental conditions used. However, the Schiff base reaction and/or hydrogen bonding may link the amino group of 3 -CA and some functional groups abundant in potatoes (e. g. carbonyl, quinone). This study also showed a potential role for enzymatic activity in the poor recovery of 3 -CA. Using antioxidants or acidity to inhibit this enzymatic activity was shown to enhance the extractability of 3 -CA. Binding of 3 -CA to potato peel substrates by ion exchange is unlikely as the pKa value of 3 -CA is lower than the pH of the potato. However, using sulphuric acid combined with methanol as an extracting solution improved the recovery. Optimising the extraction process showed that using a mixture of 1 M H 2 SO 4 in 50 % methanol as an extracting solution for 24 hours at 50 ºC improved the extraction recovery of 3 -CA up to 85 %. This final extraction method was applied for the determination of the residues of both CIPC and 3 -CA in commercial potato samples which had received many applications of CIPC, thus reporting high residue values. Additionally, potato samples were taken from different UK stores for the storage season 2010 – 2011 which had received CIPC application at high and low temperature (450 ºC and 270 ºC respectively) fogging. Analysis of these potato samples showed no significant difference between high and low temperature for the first application of CIPC for both residues of 3 -CA and CIPC. A significant increase in both compounds was found between the first and second application at 270 ºC indicating a possible build up with time during storage.
