5000|$|By having Fritz and Clerval with Frankenstein, {{there is}} a {{diffusion}} {{of responsibility for the}} creation of the Hobgoblin. Fritz states to Clerval, [...] "Now my shrewd guess, sir, is that, like Dr. Faustus, my master is raising the devil," [...] sharing that he has a good idea of what Frankenstein is up <b>to</b> (<b>Presumption,</b> <b>Act</b> 1, Scene 1). Neither Clerval nor Fritz try to stop Frankenstein {{in the midst of his}} work, even though they show concern for his welfare. The creation of the Creature happens off stage, during which the audience hears Victor Frankenstein cry 'it lives!', and then run on stage as his creation breaks out of the laboratory and reveals itself to the audience. Frankenstein draws a sword and points it at the Creature, who promptly snatches it and breaks it in two. Throwing Victor Frankenstein to the floor, the Creature runs up the staircase and exits the building through a window.|$|R

Earlier literature suggested that it can be explained as an attempt to counter collusion, or alternatively through the general least-cost avoider logic. The principal difficulty in agency relationships is with supervision. This suggests opportunism as an explanatory factor. We examine the particular features of opportunism that would distinguish it amongst the sources of transaction costs: importance of disclosure rules, <b>presumptions</b> <b>to</b> facilitate evidence in cases of possible covert opportunism, need <b>to</b> sanction covert <b>acts</b> more severely than readily observable ones. The rules of mandate can comfortably be accounted for in the anti-opportunism logic. Most of them fit, equally comfortably, in the more general and straightforward cost-avoidance logic...|$|R
