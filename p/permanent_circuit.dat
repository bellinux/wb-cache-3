25|$|The cost of {{building}} a brand new <b>permanent</b> <b>circuit</b> can be up to {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars, while the cost of converting a public road, such as Albert Park, into a temporary circuit is much less. Permanent circuits, however, can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races, such as MotoGP. The Shanghai International Circuit cost over $300million and the Istanbul Park circuit cost $150million to build.|$|E
500|$|In May 2010, it was {{announced}} that Austin, Texas would host the return of the United States Grand Prix, the first since Indianapolis in 2007. Known as the Circuit of the Americas, the venue will be a brand-new, purpose-built <b>permanent</b> <b>circuit</b> designed by event promoter Tavo Hellmund and 1993 Grand Prix Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz with the assistance of German architect and circuit designer Hermann Tilke. In November 2011, Bernie Ecclestone expressed [...] "minor" [...] doubt over the race going ahead after what he described as [...] "disagreements inside the [...] company" [...] and gave the circuit owners and race organisers a deadline of 7 December – coinciding with the meeting of the FIA World Motorsports Council and the release of the final 2012 calendar – to sort out their differences or else risk losing the event entirely. The final calendar included the race, with Ecclestone confirming that a new arrangement had been made, and that the event organisers had paid their circuit sanctioning fees for 2012. The race was originally scheduled to be held in June, but was moved back to become the penultimate event of the season in response to concerns over the heat of the Texas summer and its effects on teams, drivers and spectators, and the failure of race organisers to meet a key deadline for the race sanctioning fees.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 {{prominent}} Melbourne businessman Ron Walker {{began working}} with the Kennett government to make Melbourne {{the host of the}} event. After the government of Jeff Kennett spent an undisclosed amount, it was announced in late 1993 (days after the South Australian election) that the race would be shifted to a rebuilt Albert Park street circuit in Melbourne. The race moved to Melbourne in 1996. The decision to hold the race there was controversial. [...] A series of protests were organised by the [...] "Save Albert Park" [...] group, which claimed that the race turned a public park into a private playground for one week per year. [...] Additionally, they claimed that the race cost {{a great deal of money}} that would be better spent, if it were to be spent on motor racing, on a <b>permanent</b> <b>circuit</b> elsewhere. Finally, they said that the claimed economic benefits of the race were false or exaggerated. The race organisers and the government claimed that the economic benefits to the state, although unquantifiable, outweighed the costs, and highlighted that the park's public amenities have been greatly improved from the World War II vintage facilities previously located at Albert Park; the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre (scene of many Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games events) being the centre piece and best known of the revitalised facilities. Opponents of holding the race in the park point out that the Aquatic Centre adds nothing to the Grand Prix, is effectively closed for weeks surrounding the event and could have been built independent of the car race.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the tracks, the main {{emphasis}} is on real-world <b>permanent</b> <b>circuits</b> which make up the majority of the courses in the game. These range from classics, such as Spa-Francorchamps, Brands Hatch, Mount Panorama and Indianapolis, to more modern facilities, like the Circuit of the Americas, Sepang, the Red Bull Ring and the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. City locations with fictionally lined, but mostly real-world streets of San Francisco, Paris, Dubai etc., and - as DLCs - fictional point-to-point tracks in authentic settings complete the picture. In all, players are able to race on 15 real-world <b>permanent</b> <b>circuits,</b> 2 fictional <b>permanent</b> <b>circuits,</b> 7 street circuits, and 4 point-to-point tracks, including additional content, for a total of 28 locations with over 130 configurations.|$|R
40|$|One {{hospital}} {{sought to}} study the differences in using resterilizable permanent versus disposable ventilator circuits and changing the circuits on a 24 -h versus a 48 -h basis. Over a period of 13 months 656 condensate samples from 92 permanent and 72 disposable circuits were collected and plated by a loop dilution technique. Two samples were collected from the inspiratory limb (humidifier; tubing or nebulizer), and two were collected from the expiratory limb (tubing and trap) of each circuit. Contamination rates were higher for disposable <b>circuits</b> than for <b>permanent</b> <b>circuits</b> and for 48 -h changes than for 24 -h changes. Results of chi 2 testing by site indicated there was more contamination on the inspiratory and expiratory limbs each with use of disposable circuits than {{with the use of}} <b>permanent</b> <b>circuits.</b> The total results (chi 2 analysis) showed significantly greater microbial growth with the use of disposable <b>circuits</b> (<b>permanent</b> versus disposable, P less than 0. 001) and extension of time to 48 -h changes (24 h versus 48 h, P less than 0. 05). In the experience of this hospital <b>permanent</b> <b>circuits</b> proved more advantageous from the standpoint of contamination risk and cost...|$|R
