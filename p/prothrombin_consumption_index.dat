40|$|Serial {{changes in}} {{coagulation}} and fibrinolysis studied among 42 patients admitted to {{hospital with a}} wide variety of injuries are reported. The first hours after trauma are dominated by an acceleration of fibrinolysis (clot lysis) and clotting time which are often followed by an abrupt rebound to prolonged fibrinolysis and normal clotting. Evidence is presented that acceleration of fibrinolysis is due to flooding of the circulation by plasminogen activator and that prolongation is probably due to an inhibitor. A prolonged prothrombin time, increased <b>prothrombin</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>index,</b> an acceleration of the heparin-retarded clotting time, and a fall in the platelet count are also frequent during the first hours after injury. There is evidence also of an early deficiency in factor V and the onset of a fall in factor VII and prothrombin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{investigate}} the characteristics of severe form of influenza A (H 1 N 1) pdm 2009 with a fatal outcome, given the comorbidities. Materials and methods. Medical histories of 105 people who died in hospitals of St. Petersburg for the period of the epidemic of 2015 / 16 served as material for analysis. The lethality caused by the pandemic virus type A/ H 1 N 1 / 2009 pdm was higher in males. Most of the patients had concomitant chronic diseases in the anamnesis. Obesity was observed in 44. 8 % (47 / 105) of patients, diabetes mellitus — 28. 5 % (30 / 105), isolated heart disease — 19. 0 % (20 / 105), combined pathology — 48. 6 % (51 / 105). In the first biochemical analysis of blood, creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase were increased, total protein and <b>prothrombin</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>index</b> were reduced. The patient's death occurred after 5 days of illness in 88. 6 % cases, in 11. 4 % — up to 5 days of illness (inclusive). The analysis of fatal cases up to 5 days of a disease and death from complications (2 — 4 week) didn't find significant differences in the character and frequency of comorbidity. Specific antiviral therapy has been assigned to all patients, but 48 hours later. Bilateral subtotal viral and bacterial pneumonia was identified on the section, in the majority of cases, in 70. 5 % with hemorrhagic component. 30 % patients had cerebral oedema, 41 % patients had severe toxic parenchymatouse degeneration of miocardium, liver and kidneys. The pathology of the cardiovascular system, diabetes and obesity worsen the prognosis of the disease. Increased creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and reduced total protein and <b>prothrombin</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>index</b> can be considered as markers of severe influenza. The ineffectiveness of antiviral therapy due to its late appointment, thus timely initiation of etiotropic treatment is very impotent.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The propositus is a 4 -year-old boy who {{presented}} {{with a history of}} excessive bleeding after surgical procedures as well as haematomas and epistaxis. The defect in haemostasis consisted in an anomaly of the prothrombin consumption tests as the only abnormality while all the other conventional coagulation and fibrinolysis tests as well as platelet function tests were normal. The father of the propositus had no previous history of excessive bleeding but was found to have an abnormal <b>prothrombin</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>index.</b> The reaction to prothrombin conversion, normal at onset, slowed down to less than normal and did not reach completion until 24 h. The in vivo studies suggest that the effect does not act on the interaction between platelet phospholipid and plasma. The factor II dosage and the electrophoretic mobility of prothrombin of the plasma were normal; nevertheless when studying the purified prothrombin by means of crossed immunoelectrofocusing there appeared an anomaly of pI. This result suggests the possible existence of an abnormal prothrombin molecule responsible for a slow prothrombin conversion...|$|E

40|$|Prompted by {{previous}} observations of defective blood clotting in rabbits deficient {{in the sixth}} component of complement (C 6), an evaluation {{was made of the}} hemostatic functions of the homozygous proband of a newly recognized human kindred with hereditary C 6 deficiency. This human subject, who had no clinical evidence of a bleeding disorder, exhibited a total lack of C 6 by functional and immunoprecipitin assays of serum or plasma. Standard tests of hemostatic function were normal; however, when the whole blood clotting time was measured at 25 degrees C in plastic tubes, it was at the upper range of our normal values. In confirmation of this observation, <b>prothrombin</b> <b>consumption,</b> when performed at 37 degrees C in plastic tubes, was at the lower range of normal. Inulin and endotoxin, in concentrations shown to cause activation of human complement, had little or no effect on clotting times or <b>prothrombin</b> <b>consumption</b> of normal or C 6 -deficient human blood. These observations indicate that absence of C 6 does not {{have a significant effect on}} hemostatic function in man. In the light of other investigations, the observed differences in clotting function between C 6 -deficient human blood and C 6 -deficient rabbit blood could be due to species differences governing the susceptibility of platelets to complement activation...|$|R

40|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the one- and two-stage methods for determining prothrombin, it was noted that while the results obtained by the two procedures generally agreed fairly well, marked discrepancies occurred in certain specific instances. Particularly puzzling has been the observation that the prothrombic activity of human blood as compared with dog blood, when measured by the two tests, is markedly different. Warner, Brink-hous and Smith (1) reported that the prothrombin concentration in dog blood is 350 units per cc. and in human blood 295 units. More recently Murphy and Seegers (2) found 190 to 205 units in dog and 290 to 315 in human blood. Mann and his as-sociates (3, 4) reported that the average for dog blood is 183 units per cc. and for human blood 319 units. These findings indicate that the prothrom-bin concentration as measured by the two-stage method is approximately the same in the two spe-cies. When determined by the one-stage method, the prothrombic activity of dog blood, in marked contrast, is many-fold higher than in human blood (5). The reason for this divergency has not been satisfactorily explained, but obviously as long as this problem remains unsolved, a marked gap in the knowledge concerning prothrombin remains. In the present investigation human and dog bloods were studied by means of the prothrombin con-sumption test and by the adsorption and elution technique for determining prothrombin with the aim of obtaining new data that might be helpful in arriving at a better understanding of what consti-tutes prothrombic activity.

40|$|ObjectiveEffects of {{ventricular}} restraint on {{the left}} ventricle are well documented, but effects on the right ventricle are not. We hypothesized that restraint affects {{the right and left}} ventricles differently. MethodsWe studied acute effects of restraint on left and right ventricular mechanics in healthy sheep (n = 14) with our previously described technique of adjustable and measurable restraint. Transmural pressure, myocardial oxygen <b>consumption</b> <b>indices,</b> diastolic compliance, and end-systolic elastance were assessed at 4 restraint levels for both ventricles. We then studied long-term effects of restraint for 4 months in an ovine model of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 6). Heart failure was induced by coronary artery ligation, and polypropylene mesh was wrapped around the heart to simulate clinical restraint therapy. All subjects were followed up with serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess left and right ventricular volumes and function. ResultsRestraint decreased left ventricular transmural pressure (P <. 03) and myocardial oxygen <b>consumption</b> <b>indices</b> (P <. 05) but not left ventricular diastolic compliance (P =. 52). Restraint had no effect on right ventricular transmural pressure (P =. 82) or myocardial oxygen <b>consumption</b> <b>indices</b> (P =. 72) but reduced right ventricular diastolic compliance (P <. 01). In long-term studies, restraint led to reverse left ventricular remodeling with decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (P <. 006) but did not affect right ventricular end-diastolic volume (P =. 82). ConclusionsVentricular restraint affects the left and right ventricles differently. Benefits of restraint for right ventricular function are unclear. The left ventricle can tolerate more restraint than the right ventricle. With current devices, the right ventricle may limit overall therapeutic efficacy...|$|R
