40|$|Background and Objectives <b>Partial</b> {{thickness}} <b>drainage</b> channels can {{be created}} with femtosecond lasers in the translucent sclera for the potential treatment of glaucoma. We present a 3 D finite element model (FEM) that can predict {{the effect of these}} channels on aqueous humor (AH) outflow and intraocular pressure (IOP). Study Design/Materials and Methods A 3 D model was developed based on a 2 D model for the intact eye using COMSOL (Comsol, Inc., MA) finite element software. Different values of permeability were entered into the 3 D model for the AH pathway and for the partial thickness channel. To obtain experimental data for model validation, one partial thickness channel was created in each of three enucleated rabbit eyes with a femtosecond laser tuned to 1. 7 µm wavelength. Aqueous outflow rates were measured with the perfusion method before and after the laser treatments at different levels of IOP and then compared to IOP values predicted by the model. Results The experiments indicated that the rate of the AH outflow was increased in each of three eyes after the laser treatment. Assuming a constant rate of AH production the 3 D model predicted IOP reductions ranging from 67. 2 % to 80. 6 % as the effect of the laser created channels. These predictions were in reasonable agreement with experimentally adjusted IOP values during the perfusion measurements. Conclusions The developed 3 D FEM has the potential to predict IOP reduction caused by <b>partial</b> thickness <b>drainage</b> channels created with the femtosecond laser in the sclera. Such a model may also be used to determine optimal channel dimensions for a specified increase in outflow facility and reduction in IOP. Laser Surg.

50|$|As {{quoted from}} Charles Lyells Principles of Geology:Strabo... enters largely, in the Second Book of his Geography, into the {{opinions}} of Eratosthenes and other Greeks {{on one of the}} most difficult problems in geology, viz., by what causes marine shells came to be plentifully buried in the earth at such great elevations and distances from the sea.He notices, amongst others, the explanation of Xanthus the Lydian, who said that the seas had once been more extensive, and that they had afterwards been partially dried up, as in his own time many lakes, rivers, and wells in Asia had failed during a season of drought. Treating this conjecture with merited disregard, Strabo passes on to the hypothesis of Strato, the natural philosopher, who had observed that the quantity of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine was so great, that its bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still continued to pour in an undiminished quantity of water. He therefore conceived that, originally, when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had by this means become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near Byzantium, and formed a communication with the Propontis, and this <b>partial</b> <b>drainage</b> had already, he supposed, converted the left side into marshy ground, and that, at last, the whole would be choked up with soil. So, it was argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for itself by the Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic, and perhaps the abundance of sea-shells in Africa, near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, might also be the deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length forced a passage and escaped.But Strabo rejects this theory as insufficient to account for all the phenomena, and he proposes one of his own, the profoundness of which modern geologists are only beginning to appreciate. It is not, he says, because the lands covered by seas were originally at different altitudes, that the waters have risen, or subsided, or receded from some parts and inundated others. But the reason is, that the same land is sometimes raised up and sometimes depressed, and the sea also is simultaneously raised and depressed, so that it either overflows or returns into its own place again. We must therefore ascribe the cause to the ground, either to that ground which is under the sea, or to that which becomes flooded by it, but rather to that which lies beneath the sea, for this is more moveable, and, on account of its humidity, can be altered with great celerity. It is proper, he observes in continuation, to derive our explanations from things which are obvious, and in some measure of daily occurrence, such as deluges, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea; for the last raise up the sea also, and when the same lands subside again, they occasion the sea to be let down. And it is not merely the small, but the large islands also, and not merely the islands, but the continents, which can be lifted up together with the sea; and both large and small tracts may subside, for habitations and cities, like Bure, Bizona, and many others, have been engulfed by earthquakes.In another place, this learned geographer Strabo, in alluding to the tradition that Sicily had been separated by a convulsion from Italy, remarks, that at present the land near the sea in those parts was rarely shaken by earthquakes, since there were now open orifices whereby fire and ignited matters and waters escaped; but formerly, when the volcanoes of Etna, the Lipari Islands, Ischia, and others, were closed up, the imprisoned fire and wind might have produced far more vehement movements. The doctrine, therefore, that volcanoes are safety valves, and that the subterranean convulsions are probably most violent when first the volcanic energy shifts itself to a new quarter, is not modern.The very first written definition/discussion on the fossil formation (mentioning Nummulite quoted from A.M.

To determine {{the prevalence of}} echocardiographically detected anomalous connection or drainage, or both, of pulmonary veins in patients with this syndrome, preoperative two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler color flow mapping studies of 317 patients who underwent the stage I Norwood procedure were reviewed. The term “connection” was {{used to describe the}} precise anatomic attachment of the pulmonary veins and the term “drainage” to describe the physiologic end point of pulmonary venous flow. Twenty patients (6. 3 %) had anomalous connection or drainage, or both, of the pulmonary veins by preoperative echocardiographic and Doppler examination. The subcostal and suprasternal scans best showed the anatomic details of the pulmonary veins. All these patterns were confirmed intraoperatively and could be grouped as follows: 1) partial anomalous connection and drainage (two patients); 2) total anomalous connection and drainage (eight patients); 3) normal connection with total anomalous drainage (eight patients); and 4) normal connection with <b>partial</b> anomalous <b>drainage</b> (two patients).

Case reportThis is a 16 -year old male patient, ASA II, with a diagnosis of superior sinus venosus interatrial communication (IAC) with <b>partial</b> anomalous <b>drainage</b> of the pulmonary veins scheduled for the surgical correction of the cardiopathy. After induction of general anesthesia, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed initially a dilation of the right cardiac chambers, a 17 -mm superior sinus venosus IAC, anomalous drainage of the right superior pulmonary vein draining into the right superior vena cava (SVC), and dilation of the coronary sinus raising the possibility of persistent left superior vena cava.

40|$|The pressuremeter is a {{promising}} in situ device for {{the determination of}} strength and modulus parameters. However, the past experience in clays indicate that the pressuremeter yields unreasonably high undrained strength values.

The pressuremeter expansion curve for a disturbed soil is predicted using an anisotropic constitutive model, and the strength parameters are derived using the conventional interpretation procedures. A parametric study is conducted by varying the amounts of disturbance. An attempt has been made to evaluate the use of pore size distribution analysis to determine the thickness of the disturbed annulus. A curve fitting equation is developed to describe the pressuremeter expansion curve. A methodology is developed to analyse the effect of strain rate on the stress-strain curve derived from the pressuremeter test. The effects of <b>partial</b> <b>drainage</b> on the pore pressure distribution around the pressuremeter probe and the pressuremeter expansion curve are studied by using a linear-elastic model. ^ The results of this study show that disturbance is the most important factor affecting the pressuremeter test results. The effect of unloading of the borehole during the drilling overwhelms the effect of the presence of a remolded annulus when the initial unloading is large. The undrained strength can be over-estimated by as much as 100 % and the modulus can be underestimated by 40 %, depending on the amount of initial unloading. Highly anisotropic and strain softening soils are affected most by disturbance compared to relatively insensitive soils. The proposed curve fitting equation describe the experimental and theoretical pressuremeter curves very well. The higher strain rate used in the pressuremeter test and the variation of strain rate across the soil mass are shown to significantly affect the stress-strain curve derived from the pressuremeter expansion curve. <b>Partial</b> <b>drainage</b> significantly affects the pore pressure generated in the soil mass during the pressuremeter test; however, the pressuremeter expansion curve is not significantly affected. ...|$|E

Presentation of case: We present {{a case of a}} 15 -year-old boy with a large splenic abscess. He underwent successful partial splenectomy with resolution of his symptoms thereafter. Discussion: Standard surgical treatment for splenic abscess is antibiotics and drainage. Spleen-preserving options include percutaneous <b>drainage,</b> <b>partial</b> splenectomy, subtotal splenectomy and splenic auto-transplantation. Spleen-preserving techniques should be used where possible to achieve best outcome in clearing infection and to ensure the immunologic role of the spleen is not compromised. Conclusion: Splenic abscess is rare conditions seen in paediatric practice with high mortality and partial splenectomy can be a useful spleen-preserving technique in treating this condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{influence of}} a set of watershed characteristics on surface water nutrient concentrations was examined in 173 watersheds within two subcatchments (Upper- Scheldt and Nete) of the River Scheldt Basin (Flanders, Belgium). Each watershed was described by seasonal rainfall, discharge loading of point sources, morphological characteristics (area, average slope, drainage density, elongation), land use and soil properties (soil texture and <b>drainage).</b> <b>Partial</b> regression analysis revealed that soil drainage variables had the strongest influence on nutrient concentrations. Additional influence was exerted by land use and point source loading variables. Nitrate concentrations were positively correlated with effluent loadings coming from wastewater treatment plants and with the area of agricultural land. Phosphate concentrations were best explained by effluent loadings of industrial point sources and by the area of urban land. Land use close to the river was not a better predictor of nitrate and phosphate concentrations than land use away from the river. This suggests that the mediating impact of riparian zones is rather explained by the hydrologic pathways within the buffer strip. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{monotypic}} cave carabid genus Darlingtonea {{is widely}} distributed {{along the eastern}} band of the Mississippian/Pennyroyal plateau in Kentucky and northern Tennessee. DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was collected from one to four individuals from 27 populations, and patterns of phylogeography and population structure were inferred from COI haplotypes. A hierarchical analysis of molecular variance found low nucleotide diversity within populations and statistically significant variation among geographically-defined groups tested based on two a priori hypotheses of structure. Population structure among five distinct genetic clusters identifies approximate locations of barriers to gene flow among closely grouped caves in the upper Rockcastle River <b>drainage.</b> <b>Partial</b> sequences of one mitochondrial (COI) and one nuclear (wingless) gene were gathered from 60 to 106 terminal taxa, including representatives of all five genera of cave trechines from Kentucky and Tennessee. Alignments were analyzed using maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum likelihood methods of phylogenetic inference. Comparison of analyses demonstrates conflicting tree topologies among individual markers and different reconstruction methods. Despite a lack of consensus regarding genus-level relationships, most analyses supported each genus as natural (monophyletic) {{with the exception of}} Pseudanophthalmu...|$|R
