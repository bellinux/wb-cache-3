5|$|Prost {{finished}} the 1987 season in fourth {{place in the}} championship behind <b>Piquet,</b> Mansell and Lotus driver Ayrton Senna. Prost finished 30 points behind champion Nelson <b>Piquet.</b> Other than his debut season in 1980, and , it was the furthest away he would finish a season from the championship lead.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 {{appeared}} for {{the last}} time in the Formula One World Championship at {{the first round of the}} 1979 season in the hands of Nelson <b>Piquet.</b> Niki Lauda also used the car to qualify for that race, as the new BT48 was proving troublesome, although he did race the new car. <b>Piquet</b> retired on the first lap after a multi-car collision that wrecked the BT46.|$|E
5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season <b>Piquet</b> scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with <b>Piquet</b> second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid ride height limitations intended to reduce downforce. <b>Piquet,</b> who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E

5|$|Coulthard and Button {{collided}} on lap18 when Button {{attempted to}} pass the Red Bull on the inside at turn eight; the Honda lost its front wing and retired a lap later after two pit stops. Hamilton continued his climb back through the field; he moved from 18th, passing <b>Piquet,</b> Davidson, Sutil and Bourdais in separate manoeuvres, to sit in 14th {{by the time he}} pitted on lap31. <b>Piquet</b> retired on lap42 with transmission failure, requiring a gearbox change before the next race.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Prost formed a fierce rivalry mainly with Ayrton Senna, but also Nelson <b>Piquet</b> and Nigel Mansell. In 1986, {{at the last}} race of the season, he beat Mansell and <b>Piquet</b> of Williams to the title after Mansell retired late on in the race, and <b>Piquet</b> was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two {{had a series of}} {{controversial}} clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out. Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After a sabbatical in 1992, Prost joined the Williams team, prompting reigning Drivers' Champion Mansell to leave for CART. With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship and retired from Formula One driving {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the ePrix, Lucas di Grassi {{was leading}} the Drivers' Championship by four points over Nelson <b>Piquet,</b> Jr., while e.dams Renault led the Teams' Championship in front of second placed Audi Sport ABT.|$|E

50|$|The FOCA team bosses {{claimed that}} their {{boycott of the}} 1982 San Marino Grand Prix was in {{response}} to the disqualification of Nelson <b>Piquet's</b> Brabham and Keke Rosberg's Williams from the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|R
5|$|The {{mandatory}} pit stops, {{during which}} all drivers {{need to change}} into a second car, started on lap 17. Everyone came in at this point except the two NEXTEV TCR drivers <b>Piquet</b> and Charles Pic. D'Ambrosio managed {{to get ahead of}} Buemi into second place thanks to swift work from his crew. <b>Piquet</b> benefited from his late stop by moving ahead into eighth after everyone had pitted and having more power left to use {{towards the end of the}} race. Heidfeld ran into additional trouble during the second half of the race, losing two positions during the final laps to both Loïc Duval (Dragon Racing) and the fast running <b>Piquet,</b> who managed to finish fifth from thirteenth on the grid, even closing on Duval on the final lap. Meanwhile, di Grassi won comfortably from d'Ambrosio, the gap being more than twelve seconds.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Lieb, Jani and Dumas {{became the}} leaders of the Drivers' Championship with 25 points, seven ahead of their nearest rivals Sarrazin, Conway and Kobayashi, and a further three in front of Kraihamer, Imperatori and <b>Piquet.</b> Their {{teammates}} Nico Prost, Nick Heidfeld and Nelson <b>Piquet</b> Jr. were fourth on 12 points with Senna, Albuquerque and González rounding out the top five with ten points. Toyota claimed the Manufacturers' Championship lead with 33 points, eight ahead of their rival Porsche in second; the third-placed manufacturer Audi had scored one point with eight races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} {{protest against}} the car at the Argentine Grand Prix, objecting to {{the flexibility of the}} fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the flexible skirts. Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which <b>Piquet</b> won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front spring and cylinder were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA many cars were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres again from the sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye believes this cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent ride height, which put components under greater strain, <b>Piquet</b> built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure. <b>Piquet</b> finished fifth at the final race of the season—the Caesars Palace Grand Prix—to take the title from Carlos Reutemann in a Williams FW07 by one point.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, BMW {{announced}} their {{development of a}} turbocharged motor for the Brabham F1 team. The BMW M12 engine first raced in the 1982 season. The M12/13 engine won at the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix {{at the hands of}} Nelson Piquet; Riccardo Patrese was the team's other driver. The following season, BMW supplied engines to the ATS team; the factory-backed Brabham took four victories on its way to <b>Piquet's</b> championship win. Two more victories came in 1984, and BMW added Arrows to its list of teams who received its engines. In 1985, <b>Piquet's</b> Brabham, who was now teamed with Marc Surer, managed only one win.|$|R
50|$|It {{was only}} in 1986 that the song started {{to be used for}} every victory by a Brazilian driver. The song marked Nelson <b>Piquet's</b> {{achievement}} of third championship in 1987 and Ayrton Senna's championships in 1988, 1990 and 1991.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Piquet's</b> {{story was}} {{published}} in Louisa Picquet, the Octoroon, or, Inside Views of Southern Domestic Life. The story is about her life in slavery as octoroon with attention to the sexual exploitation that she and other female slaves experienced {{at the hands of}} their owners.|$|R
5|$|Jarno Trulli {{started the}} race from pole position, but {{eventually}} retired. The race was initially won by championship leader Lucas di Grassi. After di Grassi's car {{was found to}} have used a modified front wing, the victory was handed to second-placed Jérôme d'Ambrosio. As a result of the race, Nelson <b>Piquet,</b> Jr. took the lead in the drivers' championship.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{made the}} worst {{start in the}} field because of an {{incorrect}} power setting, moving from ninth to 14th {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Heidfeld made four positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap <b>Piquet</b> led from teammate Turvey, who was followed in turn, by Bird, Buemi, López, Heidfeld, Rosenqvist, Duval, Vergne, Abt, Engel, Félix da Costa, Evans, Prost, Sarrazin, Carroll, di Grassi, d'Ambrosio, Frijns and Ma. <b>Piquet</b> pulled away from the rest of the field as Buemi started to close the gap to Bird and Turvey. López fell down to eighth on the second lap after he was overtaken by Mahindra drivers Heidfeld and Rosenqvist along with Duval. Both di Grassi and Abt were shown a black flag with an orange circle, requiring the pair to make pit stops for repairs to their cars. Ma switched to a second car but became the race's first retirement shortly afterwards because of an battery issue. Bird placed Turvey under pressure which allowed <b>Piquet</b> to open up a two-second advantage by lap four. Di Grassi moved to the outside line heading into the chicane on the fifth lap and overtook Sarrazin and López leaving the turn and moved in front of Carroll heading into the second corner. Bird overtook Turvey for the second position on lap six, and Buemi overtook Turvey by taking the inside lane in turn one on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|The BT49's racing career {{got off to}} an {{unsettled}} {{start when}} Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, abruptly quit the sport after 10 laps of the first practice session at the penultimate race of the 1979 season, the Canadian Grand Prix. The car soon showed promise: <b>Piquet</b> ran third in the race on the high speed Circuit Île Notre-Dame before retiring with a broken gearbox. Lauda's replacement, Argentine novice Ricardo Zunino, was seventh of the nine who completed the race. At the season finale in wet conditions at the Watkins Glen International circuit, Zunino spun off although <b>Piquet</b> set the fastest lap before a driveshaft failed, putting his {{car out of the}} race.|$|E

5000|$|In 1844, discontent erupted among rural {{farmers and}} cultivaters over {{economic}} conditions within the country. These disaffected groups formed bands of armed men known as [...] "piquets". The <b>piquets</b> were gradually brought {{under the command}} of a former army officer, Louis Jean-Jacques Acaau, who used them to disrupt government control over the south of Haiti. Eventually with their increasing success, the <b>piquets</b> acquired political aspirations. The foremost of these were the dismantling of mulatto power over the government and a return to black rule. These goals were believed to have been met when in May 1844, President Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged black general Philippe Guerrier, who assumed the presidency on May 3, 1844. Guerrier held office for only 11 months before he died on April 15, 1845.|$|R
50|$|During qualifying, <b>Piquet's</b> Williams-Honda {{recorded}} the highest speed trap {{of the season}} when he was timed at 218.807 mph (352.135 km/h), some 5 mph faster than Mansell could manage in the conventional suspension car. This was the fastest ever speed that a turbo powered Formula One car achieved in the first turbo era of the sport (1977-1988).|$|R
5|$|The result {{extended}} Ferrari's {{lead over}} McLaren in the Constructors' Championship from seven to 11points. Third-placed in the Drivers' Championship, Robert Kubica's sixth {{place at the}} Grand Prix eliminated his hopes of winning the Championship, and reduced his lead over fourth-placed Räikkönen to six points. Nelson <b>Piquet</b> Jr. scored his last ever world championship points at this race.|$|E
5|$|When {{the safety}} car {{came in on}} lap42, Hamilton led, while Heidfeld and <b>Piquet</b> were running second and third. Behind them were Massa, Kubica, Kovalainen, Trulli, Vettel, Alonso, Webber, Rosberg and Räikkönen. Webber's Red Bull had been {{dripping}} oil {{for a couple of}} laps after picking up debris from Glock's crash, and on lap40 he pulled out of the race. Räikkönen quickly passed Rosberg, and then overtook the squabbling Vettel and Alonso on {{the way down to the}} hairpin, while Hamilton desperately tried to pull away at the front. Räikkönen passed Trulli twolaps later, while Kovalainen overtook Kubica for fifth place. Coulthard and Barrichello collided on the 48thlap with both cars pitting for repairs. Barrichello retired threelaps later due to damage sustained as a result of the incident. Hamilton pitted on lap50, coming out behind Heidfeld, <b>Piquet,</b> Massa and Kovalainen. Kovalainen let his teammate past at the hairpin one lap later, meaning that Hamilton was now fourth. On lap52, Heidfeld set a new fastest lap time of 1:15.987. He was the only driver to go under one minute 16 seconds during the Grand Prix. At the end of the following lap, Heidfeld entered the pits with a sizeable gap over <b>Piquet,</b> returning to the field comfortably ahead of Kovalainen, but behind Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|A BT46 {{competed in}} 'B' {{specification}} {{once again in}} 1979 in the Gunnar Nilsson Trophy race at Donington Park. This was an event held {{to raise funds for}} the Gunnar Nilsson Cancer Fund. Originally intended as a non-championship Formula One race, without FIA sanction it was instead run in a time trial format, with victory going to the fastest single lap recorded. As it was not an FIA event, the car's illegality was not a factor. Nelson <b>Piquet</b> drove, coming fourth of the five cars competing.|$|E
50|$|Nelson <b>Piquet's</b> {{season of}} {{disappointment}} continued with a 4th-place finish in his Lotus-Honda, again one lap {{down on the}} McLarens. After qualifying 6th, the reigning World Champion was passed early on by ex-teammate Nigel Mansell's Williams-Judd, and then spent many laps fighting offthe AGS-Ford of Philippe Streiff until the Frenchman suffered suspension failure on lap 41.|$|R
50|$|During {{the latter}} half of the nineteenth century, the army either failed to protect the central {{government}} or directly caused the government's collapse. Rural insurgent movements led by <b>piquets</b> and cacos limited the central government's authority in outlying areas. These groups carried on war into the twentieth century; they were finally put down by the United States Marines in 1919.|$|R
50|$|The only mis-step of <b>Piquet's</b> weekend {{came in the}} Sunday morning warmup when he and Derek Daly {{collided}} {{entering the}} corner after the pits. The Brabham was vaulted {{into the air and}} landed heavily on all four tires, while Daly's Tyrrell went down the escape road. After careful examination, the Brabham crew decided that the car was fine and ready to race.|$|R
5|$|At {{the first}} night race in Formula One, the , Webber {{qualified}} in 13th position. Red Bull pulled in both Webber and David Coulthard for their pit stops {{as soon as they}} could when the safety car came on track, due to Nelson <b>Piquet,</b> Jr. crashing, giving them both great track position. This led to Webber running in 2nd place before a gearbox issue put him out of the race on lap 29.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{had been}} working with the German engine {{manufacturer}} BMW since 1980 on the development of a turbocharged engine for Formula One. The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured turbocharged cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next two races. <b>Piquet</b> finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced underweight due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before coolants were topped up, resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside <b>Piquet</b> in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next two races, taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} race from Monaco two weeks earlier, Lucas di Grassi (Audi Sport ABT) was leading the {{championship}} with 93 points, four ahead of his compatriot Nelson <b>Piquet,</b> Jr. (NEXTEV TCR). Another six points adrift, third placed Sébastien Buemi (e.dams Renault) was the only driver who scored two victories {{over the course of}} the season, but less consistent outings prevented him from placing higher up in the standings. In the teams' championship, e.dams Renault on 160 points had a 45-point lead over Audi Sport ABT.|$|E
50|$|While Salomon fixed some of Haiti's problems, he also drained {{resources}} to pay Haiti's debt to France. During 1881-1882, {{an outbreak of}} smallpox spread {{throughout the country and}} consumed most of the finances in those years. In April 1883, the infamous Cacos from the north rebelled against Salomon and his administration, but were crushed by government troops mixed with former <b>piquets.</b>|$|R
