Streamer lines were an innovation of Japanese tuna fishermen to prevent bait loss to birds. They are inexpensive, simple and require no modification to fishing gear. What are streamer lines? A streamer line (also called a tori or <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> line) is a line with streamers that is towed from a high point near the stern as baited hooks are deployed (Figure 1). As the vessel moves forward, drag on the line creates an aerial segment (extent) from which streamers are suspended at regular intervals. With streamer lines, the aerial extent is critical when attempting to <b>scare</b> <b>birds</b> away from baited hooks. A towed object is used to create additional drag to maximise the aerial extent.

40|$|When {{falconry}} {{is employed}} at airfields, not all birds can be induced to leave. Most do, but some {{do not go}} far, then return soon after the patrolling falconer drives away. There is evidence that falcon silhouettes cause fear responses in passerines, some corvids and waterfowl. Dr. Conrad Lorenz towed a silhouette of a goose over young fowl with little response. When the same silhouette was towed in a reverse direction, these same chicks exhibited fear response. Falcon decals are placed on windowpanes to prevent wild birds from colliding into them. Dr. Jeffrey R. Jenkins D. V. M. indicated that since the decals were installed that bird collisions with his office windows had ceased. Hunters use huge plastic goose decoys to attract wild geese. These decoys are so large that they also are blinds for two hunters. The large size of the decoys have on most occasions been found to attract more geese than the standard 2 ̆ 2 spread 2 ̆ 2 of life size goose decoys. The converse could be true also. A large falcon silhouette/kite could be flown towed behind the falconers vehicle in between live falcon flights. Because of the large size and increased visibility of the <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> kite, it need not be towed at such a height that it would become a navigational hazard to aircraft. Twenty five feet may be high enough. There is currently a <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> kite/helium balloon on the market employed in agriculture.

40|$|NERICA, a {{new group}} of high-yielding and stress-tolerant upland rice {{varieties}} developed by the Africa Rice Center, is changing production strategies of many Ugandan households. This article contributes a better understanding of processes leading to NERICA-related household outcomes in Hoima District, Uganda, by examining patterns of intrahousehold production relations and their consequences for household members' individual wellbeing. Research presented here provides a timely illustration of the impact that the introduction of NERICA in Hoima District has had on gendered labor dynamics in grower households. Drawing on a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, the analysis is grounded in the local context and the embodied and gendered subjectivities of smallholder women, men and children. Findings reveal that, while households that have adopted NERICA have become better off in economic terms, the extreme labor burden that NERICA demands in <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> and weeding affects women and children's wellbeing negatively by exacerbating their time poverty and energy expense. The article makes a case for more comprehensive assessments of agricultural intensification processes that involve diffusion of new production technology, arguing that such assessments should also contain an analysis of gendered labor dynamics within households...|$|R

40|$|Granivorous birds, {{mainly the}} Red-billed Quelea, have subsisted on cereal crops in Africa for centuries and have caused {{substantial}} damage. There is, however, limited recent evidence on their impact. We propose an indirect method to estimate bird-inflicted crop losses by fitting a production function with a damage abatement component and pest intensity slope dummies {{on a panel}} database of rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley. This allows us to estimate both bird damage and marginal productivity of bird control {{at different levels of}} bird pressure. Annual bird damage is found to average around 13. 2 % of the potential rice production during the wet seasons of 2003 – 2007, which translates into an average annual economic loss of 4. 7 billion FCFA (€ 7. 1 million). Our results are consistent with farmers’ perceived bird-inflicted crop losses, averaging 15. 2 %. More alarmingly, we observe declining marginal productivities of bird control under increasing bird pressure. Farmers indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficacy of traditional <b>bird</b> <b>scaring</b> methods is inadequate, which suggests that predictive (monitoring), preventive (population control) and protective (insurance) measures against massive invasions are more urgent than improving the average efficacy of curative measures (pest control). These findings are especially relevant to farmers and policy-makers who are currently struggling to implement an ambitious food self-sufficiency programme in Senegal. status: publishe...|$|R
