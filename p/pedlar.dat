5|$|In {{the same}} year, his journalistic mentor <b>Pedlar</b> Palmer moved to The Sydney Morning Herald and Fingleton became disenchanted. He was coaxed by cricketer-journalist {{to move his}} publication, the Telegraph Pictorial where he worked for several years before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. However, Fingleton's initiation into his new workplace was difficult as the Telegraph Pictorial had just merged with the Daily Telegraph and around half the workforce were to be made redundant. Fingleton was demoted from the main staff to a freelance correspondent covering events in the inner-city suburbs of Redfern and Newtown. In such crime-ridden and turbulent working-class area, Fingleton was productive in break stories and was soon restored to the regular staff.|$|E

She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, {{and a few minutes}} later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon was summoned to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30March 1612. Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained, Nowell committed Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol to be tried at the next assizes for maleficium, causing harm by witchcraft.|$|E

5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a <b>pedlar,</b> who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a <b>pedlar</b> from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E

Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's [...] "mentally sub-normal" [...] brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches. Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York.|$|E

Then, tearing off the disguise, Polixenes angrily intervenes, threatening the Old Shepherd and Perdita with torture and death and ordering his son never to see the shepherd's daughter again. With the aid of Camillo, however, who longs to see his native land again, Florizel and Perdita take ship for Sicilia, using the clothes of Autolycus as a disguise. They are joined in their voyage by the Old Shepherd and his son who are directed there by Autolycus.|$|E

2500|$|Margit lived a happy {{childhood}} {{until the}} age of eight, when she fell victim to rape. This was the first of three and perhaps the mildest one. She was an adventurous tomboy, who was pleased to do long rambles far away from home. She often took the family dog the long walks, but unfortunately it never accompanied her the times she fell victim to violences. The second rape occurred when she was ten years old and was exceptionally brutal. The rapists used the handle of an axe during the rape, thus causing lifelong injury to her. In other words, damaged her urethra, and after this she has to [...] "trot to a water closet" [...] every half an hour. The rape was performed by three (to her) unknown men in the ages 40 – 60 years old. Margit hid this terrible thing from everyone, including her own mother, until in the age of 60 when she took a close friend into confidence. Sandemo has dealt with these events in the 38th volume of the novel series Sagan om Isfolket, Små men kastar långa skuggor (in English: Small Men Throw Long Shadows). This time from a character's point of view. In October 2004, she stated in her interview given to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she killed her third rapist. He was a wandering <b>pedlar,</b> to whom she fell victim to at the age of twelve. [...] In her own words, she killed this man by throwing a big rock at his head and then lugged the dead body down a hill and put and hid it in a ditch.
