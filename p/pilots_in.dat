5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced <b>pilots.</b> <b>In</b> mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of Tappanaga, the endemic, larger form of short-finned pilots {{found in}} {{northern}} Japan, with similar characteristics to the whales found along Vancouver Island and northern USA coasts, have been {{indicated that the}} geniture of this form could be caused by the extinction of long-finned <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> north Pacific in the 12th century where Magondou, the smaller, southern type possibly filled the former niches of long-finned pilots, adapting and colonizing into colder waters. Some claims that the Tappanaga, alternatively called Shiogondou, are not adapted form of short-finned pilots but a distinctive species of their own. Today, Tappanaga and Magondou differentiate their respective distributions by the border at around the oceanic front off Chōshi, Chiba.|$|E
5|$|Finucane was {{now one of}} the 45 <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> {{his class}} to have {{completed}} 100 hours of piloting time on aircraft since he joined the RAF.

With effect from the following day, he was granted a short-service commission as an acting pilot officer (on probation) and sent to 8 Flying Training School, RAF Montrose in Scotland. On 12 November, he left King's Cross railway station travelling on the Flying Scotsman to Glasgow, arriving at Montrose after a 10-hour journey.|$|E
