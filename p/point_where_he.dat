5|$|The {{first house}} on the site was built as a hunting lodge in 1717 for the Duke of Schomberg, a British army {{commander}} of German origin. He {{is said to have}} been very argumentative, to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> would argue with all those around him bar the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{immediately}} assumed {{use of his}} stepfather's surname, {{it was not until}} Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather. Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.|$|E

Later in that year, he joined up with the apparel company Athletic DNA.|$|R

5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{ultimately}} {{crosses the}} line when, in a cocaine-induced rage, {{he gets into}} a confrontation with girlfriend Tracee and beats her to death. She may have been pregnant with his child at the time. This infuriates Tony to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> violates traditional mafia code by striking him repeatedly {{in front of the}} entire family. Bad blood temporarily surfaces between the two but is shortly resolved after Gigi Cestone dies of an aneurysm, thereby forcing Tony to reluctantly promote Ralph to capo.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from football Young had many different jobs, including removals, managing a sports shop, delivering milk, {{working in a}} supermarket, and selling insurance. In his spare time he maintained his fitness by playing badminton, and after winning local tournaments, played the sport for Cheshire. During much of this period he struggled financially, to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had to sell the family home and move in with his mother. Deeply depressed {{at this point in}} his life, at one point he attempted suicide. From the mid-1990s Young coached school football teams in the area around his Cheshire home.|$|E

5|$|After the Indonesian film {{industry}} crashed in 1992 Umboh directed two television serials: Pahlawan Tak Dikenal (Unknown Hero; 1994) and Apsari. The crash, {{along with his}} long illness, led his finances to destabilise, to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lived in government housing. In 1994 Suara Pembaharuan (now Suara Pembaruan), inaccurately reported him having died, a claim which Umboh publicly refuted. Umboh died at 4:45am WIB (UTC+7) on 24January 1996 in Jakarta of complications from diabetes and a stroke. He was buried in Jeruk Purut Cemetery, South Jakarta. Three weeks before his death, he was reportedly in good health and preparing to film a new serial entitled Gejolak Kampus Muda (Symptoms of a Youth Campus).|$|E

His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> could not get out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|In December 1988, the Ramones {{recorded}} {{material for}} their eleventh studio album, Brain Drain; co-produced by Beauvoir, Rey, and Bill Laswell. However, the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators' Andy Shernoff. Dee Dee Ramone would only record the additional vocals {{on the album}} citing that {{the other members of}} the band (including himself) were going through personal troubles and changes to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> didn't want to be in the band anymore. After the band finished their Halfway to Sanity tour in February 1989, Dee Dee became sober and left the band.|$|E

But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture." ...|$|R
5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark World to the Light World {{at almost any}} outside {{location}} by using the Magic Mirror, and can travel back to the Dark World again from the same location using a temporary portal left behind on the map at the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light World to the Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|Pohl's {{tenure as}} fleet {{commander}} was brief; by January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened {{him to the}} <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was {{no longer able to}} carry out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5 to 7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. Kaiserin was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2 to 3 April. The fleet conducted another sortie on 21 to 22 April.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{would not have been able}} to continue racing.|$|E
5|$|Warhol {{subsequently}} {{produced a}} wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans theme is generally used in reference to the original set of paintings as well as the later Warhol drawings and paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was not only the most-renowned American pop art artist, but also the highest-priced living American artist.|$|E
5|$|When The Great Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F.

The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten months}} of combat duty, Schwarzkopf was {{pulled from the}} front by MACV and reassigned as senior staff adviser for civil affairs to the ARVN Airborne Division. Then, he {{returned}} to the United States and finished his teaching assignment at West <b>Point,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was {{an associate professor in the}} Department of Mechanics. In 1968, he attended the Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, completing the course in June 1969. In this time back home, he also met Brenda Holsinger, a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines. They were introduced at a West Point football game in 1967 and married the next year. The couple would later have three children: Cynthia, born in 1970; Jessica, born in 1972; and Christian, born in 1977.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able {{to take control of the}} system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E

In his main object—the recovery of the southern states—Greene succeeded by the close of the year, but not without hard fighting and repeated reverses.

He was full of the trip to Holland, and had already pushed Kenby, as Kenby owned, {{beyond the bounds of}} his very general {{knowledge}} of the Dutch language, which Rose had plans for taking up after they were settled in Schevleningen. The boy scoffed at the notion that he was not perfectly well, and he wished to talk with March on the <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had found Kenby wanting.|$|R
