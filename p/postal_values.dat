This has meant more responsibilities, which the department has taken promptly. The customers get disappointed and lose confidence in the postal department. Customers do not stand in a queue to get their needs attended to by the postal employees. The study has been made with the following set of objectives, To analyse opinion on the availability of speed post services with reference to Salem district. Methodology of this study, The primary data have been collected directly from the post offices of Salem west division in Salem District and the customers of post offices through a pretested interview schedule. The Secondary data have been collected from the published documents like, Annual reports, Information booklets, Hand book of postal products and services, Hand books of postal Training College and other relevant books and journals. Important findings of this study, Looking at the mean ranks, it could be understood that the highest preference was given to the ‗Increasing working hours‘ and the lowest preference was given to ‗Acknowledgement for the delivery‘ and ‗Incentive for the booking staff‘. The moderate level of preferences was given to ‗Incentive to the pick-up agents‘ and ‗Delivery on the immediate next day‘. Suggested this study, Advertisement is a silent way of sales promotion.

40|$|The {{focus of}} our paper is on the {{competitive}} effects of the proposed VAT regime relative to selected alternatives. We also highlight the welfare effects of various VAT scenarios. While an exempt operator cannot reclaim VAT paid on inputs (relevant for non-labor inputs only) and therefore faces higher costs ceteris paribus, an important fraction of customers of non-exempt operators {{will not be able}} to deduct VAT themselves. Hence, the exempt incumbent operator has on the one hand a cost disadvantage, and on the other, a price advantage. The net effect will depend on the fraction of non-labor inputs relative to the fraction of non-rated customers. We report market shares, optimum prices, tax revenue and welfare in a liberalized postal market. The various scenarios differ by the operators’ VAT status. We also take into account the fraction of non-rated customers that cannot deduct VAT themselves. The paper sheds light on the main competitive impact of VAT policies while showing the consequences on overall welfare. We show that the results are very sensitive to the operators’ labor policies. Consequently, VAT exemptions have a different impact in countries with different labor regulations. The comprehensive treatment of competition and welfare enables us to provide guidance on how to resolve the policy trade-off between consumer surplus, government tax revenue, and a level playing field in liberalized <b>postal</b> markets. <b>Value</b> Added Taxation, Regulation, Post, Competition, Welfare...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the literature and current discussions on the European postal markets and the universal service obligations (USO). It consists of three independent chapters. In chapter one, we investigate the consumers' preferences for various kinds of postal services. As such, we begin by reviewing the market and regulatory conditions for Europe and for our case study, Belgium. Then using data provided by the incumbent provider, the Belgian post (Bpost), we estimate demand price elasticities. The data comprises customer transactional information on letter mail, direct mail, parcels & express services, press delivery and value added services for the 2008 - 2009 period. These categories constitute not only the important lines of services that Bpost offers to its clients but also the main segments that constitute the whole Belgian postal market. As such, and using standard methods, we estimate for each service an equation that explains demand by prices, product varieties (i. e. mixes or combinations of volume, weight, priority and destination, inter alia), income, regulation proxies and other socioeconomic variables. The estimated price elasticities for regulated and partially regulated services are around - 1. 1, whereas for unregulated segments they fluctuate between - 2. 1 and - 2. 8. The lowest price elasticity is obtained for direct mail services (- 1. 0); the highest ones are associated with value added services (- 2. 1) and registered mail (- 3. 3). Price elasticities may be influenced by the cyclical effects during the period of analysis. Therefore, elasticities are higher when compared with the empirical evidence obtained for other countries and through the various methodologies applied over the last decades. The fact that technological substitutes, such as expenditures on telephony and internet access for daily and administrative mail services and, radio and television advertising for direct mail services, could not be accounted for (because there were no data available) may however be considered as a major limitation for the scope of our results. In the second chapter, we explore theoretically the effects of the USO on unregulated markets. In particular, we are interested in investigating its welfare effects when the provision of services cannot be technologically separated. We present a model in which there is an incumbent who provides two services: a universal service and a non-USO service, the latter opened to competition. This is the case of letter mail and direct (or bulk) mail, services which have quite different purposes and regulatory frameworks (i. e. the former is fully regulated whereas the latter is liberalized under the current European Internal Market framework), but are jointly produce at some stages of the <b>postal</b> <b>value</b> chain. The USO is simplified to two dimensions, affordability and quality, implemented as a price cap and a minimum quality standard (MQS) for the provision of letter mail services. The latter involves the technological aspects that we are interested in. We find that the definition of the USO {{plays an important role in}} organizing markets that are open to competition. When it imposes few quality requirements (low MQS), the incumbent is not cost efficient enough to provide the high-quality variant of bulk mail, allowing its competitors to cream-skim the segment. However, because there are cost economies, the firm's participation in the segment yields a higher average quality of mail services at lower prices. When the USO is too comprehensive (high MQS), the incumbent exhibits large cost economies that ensure a dominant position in the provision of bulk mail services. Consumers are worse off as competition induces too much service differentiation in order to make profitable the provision. Relaxing the definition of the USO mitigates the competitive advantage of the USP and so, yields improvements in welfare. In the absence of access costs, firms will find profitable to participate in the bulk mail segment. However, foreclosure happens if the USO induces the incumbent to exhibit significant fixed costs. Therefore, the USP may end up as the sole supplier of bulk mail services if the definition of the USO imposes too many quality requirements (high MQS). In that case, the authority must balance the welfare gains of defining USO with the welfare losses of the consumers of the contested service. Finally, in the third chapter we consider the ownership aspect of the provision of universal services as an incentive to introduce competition. One can further segment the provision between services for customers located in high-cost areas and services for customers located in low-cost areas. Additionally, under the current EU legislation, the supply is divided between upstream activities (e. g. collection and sorting) and downstream activities (i. e. delivery). The provision of upstream activities in high-cost areas remains in hands of the incumbent firm or the owner of the downstream (delivery) network. The upstream provision in low-cost areas is open to competition, but a retailer may be vertically integrated/separated or legally unbundled with the downstream firm. Legal unbundling means, in our model, that the downstream firm and one upstream firm located in the low-cost area belong legally to the same entity entitled to all profits, whom does not have full control rights over the firms' decisions. That is to say, upstream activities and the downstream services will be managed separately under the same ownership. In this framework we analyze the firm's boundaries in terms of competition development and welfare. We implement two criteria to answer questions like, does vertical separation promotes competition (entry of firms) while covers a larger demand than vertical integration? Does vertical integration demand less public funds to cover demand? Does legal unbundling is worse than ownership separation to promote competition? The first criterion is the probability of entry (of the potential upstream firm), which we determine for each modes of ownership. The second criterion is the cost of public funds. It is implemented by defining a loss function as the difference between the expected consumer surplus when the downstream firm chooses an access fee that maximizes its profits and the consumer surplus when access is priced at marginal cost. The use of both criteria let us conclude that efficient entry occurs when the downstream firm is vertically separated or legally unbundled of the retailer providing services in the low-cost area. However, it is under legal unbundling that the access charge takes its lowest value. The highest cost of public transfers is obtained when firms are vertically separated, but the lowest one is attained when firms are legally unbundled. Therefore legal unbundling constitutes the preferred organizational form to induce competition and to reduce the cost of public funds.

40|$|Perceived {{value is}} {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} focal construct in marketing and often described as a key determinant of sustainable competitive advantage and superior performance. Despite these interests, little research has addressed the perceived value construct, {{and there is no}} well-accepted perceived value measure. This thesis aims at developing, testing, and applying a perceived value measure, while demonstrating its application in management. It also sets out to test a set of antecedent and consequent relationships to explore influences on, and behavioural outcomes of perceived value in the parcel <b>postal</b> industry. Perceived <b>value</b> is defined in this thesis as the judgement by the consumer of the associated perceived benefits offered by (or linked to) a product or service, when the associated sacrifices have been evaluated or assessed (assuming that through the evaluation process one may either reduce, eliminate or ignore any associated sacrifices). Using perceived risk as a focal measure of associated sacrifices to determine perceived value, the various dimensions of perceived value were researched. Data were collected using a questionnaire which assessed the various dimensions of perceived risk. Since these dimensions provide a perceived risk measure, this measure was then used to assess perceived value and other service evaluation constructs. A model is suggested which shows the relationships between perceived risk, perceived value, satisfaction, and behavioural intentions. It was found that there is an average, and direct negative relationship between perceived risk and perceived value. Also, there is a strong, direct and positive relationship between perceived value and satisfaction, and an average, and direct positive relationship between perceived value and behavioural intentions. The relationships between perceived risk and satisfaction, perceived risk and behavioural intentions were found to be partially mediated by perceived value. Also, the effect of perceived value on behavioural intentions was found to be partially mediated by satisfaction. This thesis provides academics with a new conceptualisation and framework for further research into the perceived value concept. It demonstrates to marketing practitioners especially involved in planning, how perceived value can be used in strategic marketing planning. It particularly demonstrates to practitioners involved in control how non financial indicators can be used in control...|$|R
