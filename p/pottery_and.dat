5|$|Ancient Greek art, {{as found}} in <b>pottery</b> <b>and</b> other remains, {{frequently}} depicts scenes associated with Troilus' death: the ambush, the pursuit, the murder itself and the fight over his body. Depictions of Troilus in other contexts are unusual. One such exception, a red-figure vase painting from Apulia c.340BC, shows Troilus as a child with Priam.|$|E

They formed the first settled rural communities, thus forging the most fundamental civilizational advance.|$|E

5|$|Purebred Arabians never carry {{dilution}} genes. Therefore, purebreds {{cannot be}} colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or buckskin. However, there is pictorial evidence from <b>pottery</b> <b>and</b> tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E

5|$|Various {{artefacts}} {{have been}} uncovered representing the {{long period of}} occupation of the site at Dolebury Warren. These include flintwork from the Palaeolithic, bronze spearheads, Bronze Age <b>pottery,</b> <b>and</b> Roman <b>pottery</b> <b>and</b> coins. There is evidence of occupation of the site during the Iron Age. The defences and Celtic field systems there {{date back to the}} 7th century−3rd century BCE, though they might mask earlier developments. The hillfort was occupied until approximately 100BC, though it is possible that it was reoccupied in the Roman and post-Roman periods. The archeological consultant Peter Leach has suggested there may even have been a Roman Temple built within the hillfort, while aerial photographs suggest the probable remains of an Iron Age or Roman coaxial field system. Local historian Robin Atthill also suggests that Dolebury may have re-emerged as an important centre of population in the 5th century.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Raymond's {{practice}} with Tuttle, Seelye and Place was dissolved. He formed {{a new company}} with Slovak architect, Ladislav Leland Rado (1909–1993), and named it Raymond & Rado. Although this company lasted until Raymond's death in 1976, they practised apart, with Rado in the New York office and Raymond in Tokyo. Whilst Raymond explored <b>pottery</b> <b>and</b> sculpture (making friends with Tarō Okamoto and Ade Bethune), Rado pursued an orthogonal rationalism that Raymond would eventually distance himself from.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of <b>pottery</b> <b>and</b> tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E

5|$|By about 5500BC, small tribes {{living in}} the Nile valley had {{developed}} {{into a series of}} cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their <b>pottery</b> <b>and</b> personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badari, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, stone tools, and its use of copper.|$|E
5|$|During the pre-Columbian era of Mesoamerican history, some Mayan {{languages}} {{were written}} in the logo-syllabic Maya script.

5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 years ago, it deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension from the system, which formed present-day Green Lake. <b>Pottery</b> <b>and</b> burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the brackish water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{developed}} their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when {{this era of}} Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC.
