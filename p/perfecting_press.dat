Since the blanket-to-blanket press has two blanket cylinders per colour, making it possible to print on both sides of a sheet, there is no impression cylinder.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a screening experiment {{designed to determine}} which of seven paper characteristics influence dot gain in web offset lithography. Dot gain is the enlargement of halftone dots during printing from plate to paper with a resultant increase in dot area. The variability of dot gain during a press run and from run to run is detrimental {{to the quality of}} black and white and color reproductions. The seven paper characteristics: gloss, smoothness, absorption, physical density, caliper, opacity, and formation are measurable characteristics used to describe the printability of a paper. Using one unit of a four-unit web offset <b>perfecting</b> <b>press,</b> four papers were printed and dot gain 2 ̆ 7 s two components, slur and fill-in, calculated. Correlation, regression analysis and graphic illustration were used to analyse data. The thesis concludes that smoothness is the main contributor to slur and absorption has the greatest influence on fill-in. Other paper characteristics shown to influence slur and fill-in are caliper and physical density. Also included are discussions of future experiments required to test the relationship between paper and dot gain and why certain paper properties may influence slur and fill-in...|$|E

Richard March Hoe had invented the rotary press in 1843, but Bullock's press was an improvement over Hoe's design. Bullock's press allowed for continuous large rolls of paper to be automatically fed through the rollers, eliminating the laborious hand-feeding system of earlier presses. The press was self-adjusting, printed on both sides, folded the paper, and a sharp serrated knife that rarely needed sharpening cut sheets with rapid precision. The press could print up to 12,000 sheets an hour; later improvements raised the speed to up to 30,000 sheets an hour.|$|R

The arrangement was intended to improve tone and stability, and it became known as the sweep scale because it distributed the strings much farther apart on the sounding board than more conventional methods of stringing.|$|R

In 1919 NAC became {{champion}} of this competition and was allowed to play the Dutch Champions’ Competition (a small competition in which the champions from the regional divisions would play for the Dutch title). During this competition NAC finished in the last place. In 1920, NAC {{was one of the first}} clubs to play international matches. NAC played a couple of friendly matches, including a match against Real Madrid CF. NAC won this match with 0–4 and the Spanish newspapers called NAC ‘Los muchacos del Breda, maestros del futbol’ (English: The boys from Breda, masters in football). In 1921, NAC celebrated one of its greatest achievements, when they became Dutch football champion. In the Dutch Championship competition, NAC defeated Ajax, Be Quick 1887 and Go Ahead.

500|$|Riddles had {{frequently}} {{argued the}} case for the inclusion of a Standard Class 8 Pacific into the standard range of locomotives being introduced by British Railways. However, these proposals were rejected by the Railway Executive on the grounds of cost in attempting to develop a form of steam motive power that was not necessarily required for use on Britain's railways, as there were enough class 8 locomotives already available for use. However, opportunity came out of adversity when the short-lived rebuild of The Turbomotive, 46202 Princess Anne, was destroyed in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail disaster of 1952.

6000|$|Again, at that intense soft {{bitterness}} in her voice, he felt stifled, and got up, {{leaning in}} the window. The air {{out there was}} free from the smell of dust and stale perfume. He felt her fingers slip between his own, and stay unmoving. Since she was so hard, and cynical, why should he pity her? Yet he did. The touch of that hand within his own roused his protective instinct. She had poured out her heart to him--a <b>perfect</b> stranger! He <b>pressed</b> it a little, and felt her fingers crisp in answer. Poor girl! This was perhaps a friendlier moment than she had known for years! And after all, fellow-feeling was bigger than principalities and powers! Fellow-feeling was all-pervading as this moonlight, which she had said {{would be the same}} in Germany--as this white ghostly glamour that wrapped the trees, making the orange lamps so quaint and decoratively useless out in the narrow square, where emptiness and silence reigned. He looked around into her face--in spite of bistre and powder, and the faint rouging on her lips, it had a queer, unholy, touching beauty. And he had suddenly the strangest feeling, as if they stood there--the two of them--proving that kindness and human fellowship were stronger than lust, stronger than hate; proving it against meanness and brutality, and the sudden shouting of newspaper boys in some neighbouring street. Their cries, passionately vehement, clashed into each other, and obscured the words--what was it they were calling? His head went up to listen; he felt her hand rigid within his arm--she too was listening. The cries came nearer, hoarser, more shrill and clamorous; the empty moonlight seemed of a sudden crowded with footsteps, voices, and a fierce distant cheering. [...] "Great victory--great victory! Official! British! Defeat of the 'Uns! Many thousand prisoners!" [...] So it sped by, intoxicating, filling him with a fearful joy; and leaning far out, he waved his cap and cheered like a madman; and the whole night seemed to him to flutter and vibrate, and answer. Then he turned to rush down into the street, struck against something soft, and recoiled. The girl! She stood with hands clenched, her face convulsed, panting, and even in the madness of his joy he felt for her. To hear this--in the midst of enemies! All confused with the desire to do something, he stooped to take her hand; and the dusty reek of the table-cloth clung to his nostrils. She snatched away her fingers, swept up the notes he had put down, and held them out to him.|$|R
40|$|The Frankfurt Book Fair (Frankfurter Buchmesse), {{the largest}} trade show of its kind, turned messy this year {{before it had}} even started. At {{the center of the}} brouhaha: China, the {{official}} guest of honor of the book fair 2009. Or, to be more precise, the row over the revoked invitation of two Chinese “dissidents,” Dai Qing and Bei Ling, to a symposium {{in the run-up to the}} Book Fair. The incident had an air of tragicomedy, and turned into a public relations disaster for the organizers as well as an embarrassment for about all those involved. In a larger sense, the debacle illustrates the paradoxes in the public perception of China in Germany; it also raises questions about the status of China-related knowledge in Europe and its ability to reach and influence decision makers in politics and business. In comparison with the fallout, the story itself seems simple. During the planning stages of a symposium on “China and the World: Realities and Perceptions,” the hosts decided to invite, apart from representatives selected by the Chinese co-organizers, two intellectuals well-known for their critical opinions. The participation of Dai Qing and Bei Ling was announced to the press, only to be revoked a few days later after protests from the Chinese side: The Chinese co-organizers had threatened to withdraw from the event if Dai and Bei were allowed to participate in the planned symposium. After an internal debate (the actual process of the deliberations that took place remain unclear) the German side withdrew their earlier invitations and asked Dai and Bei not to come. Predictably, the revocation of the invitations caused a public outcry and allegations in the press that the organizers of Germany’s most time-honored cultural event were bowing to bullying from a Communist Chinese regime. Once the incident spilled over into the international arena – with reports that the two Chinese intellectuals had been “banned” from the Book Fair (patently untrue of course: they had been disinvited from the symposium, but not barred from participating in the book fair, which will be held four weeks later, from 14 - 18 October) – Dai and Bei were under pressure to react. Initially annoyed by the flip-flop of the German event management, both decided to attend the symposium nonetheless. Dai secured a visa with sponsorship of the German P. E. N. club (miraculously, she found her ticket to Frankfurt cancelled despite reassurances from the travel agency), while Bei flew to Germany at his own expense. Amidst enormous press attention, Dai and Bei attended the symposium as audience members, and – predictably – triggered a walk-out from the Chinese delegation, who agreed to return only after Dai Qing and Bei Ling had left the conference venue.
