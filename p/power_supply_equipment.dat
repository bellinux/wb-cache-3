50|$|On 15 August 2017 at 4:52 p.m., the six {{generators}} of {{the power}} plant fully tripped due to operation technical error, disrupting the supply of 4 GW of electricity.

Electricity rationing was implemented at 6:00 p.m. and ended at 9:40 p.m. The outage hit northern half of Taiwan Island, affecting 6.68 million households.

Since Donnell had a large turbo-electric generator, but {{was not able to}} sail by herself because of the damage she had sustained, the ship was converted to an electric power barge and reclassified IX-182 on 15 July 1944. Donnell was towed to Plymouth, England, in July to embark passengers, take on cargo, and have electric power cables installed in place of her torpedo tubes. Donnell was towed in August to Cherbourg, France, where she supplied electric power to shore installations.

30|$|With {{accordance}} to PN- 93 /N- 50191 document, reliability {{is a set}} {{of characteristics}} that describe the readiness of the facility and affecting it: reliability, service and provide proof functionality of service. Reliability is a relative concept, because there are different requirements for an object, and the reliability of these same objects can be based on several factors (depending on the requirements in different operating conditions) (Elliot and Hill 1999; Fajkiel et al. 2008). From the theory standpoint of the operation of machinery and equipment, each technical unit within the company requires manual service. It has a specific purpose of use, has a determined destiny and determined permanence, surrenders to damage and can be improved, but first of all it should not pose a threat to man. Optimal operating conditions are determined according to the elemental life of the equipment, which consists of the device tested, the crew of the device, subject to the operating device, the position of use and handling <b>equipment,</b> environment and <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>supplies</b> and <b>equipment</b> performance information (Elliot and Hill 1999).|$|R

Each segment of truss is given a designation of P or S, indicating whether the segment is on the port or starboard side, and a number which indicates its position on its respective side. The truss system itself consists of 12 total segments - four on each side, and one central segment - which are connected to the ISS by attachment points on the Destiny module. The thirteenth piece, known as the Zenith-1 (Z1) truss segment, is attached to the Unity module, and was originally used to hold the P6 solar arrays to provide power to the USOS. The Z1 segment now houses the Ku-band antennas and serves as a routing point for power and data cables on {{the exterior of the}} ISS. The Integrated Truss Structure houses four sets of solar arrays. Each set of solar arrays contains four arrays for a total of 16 solar arrays. Each of the four sets of arrays also has an associated cooling system and radiator for cooling the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>equipment.</b> The Integrated Truss Structure also houses the main cooling system for the ISS, which consists of two pumps, two radiator arrays, and two ammonia and two nitrogen tank assemblies. There are also several payload attachment points located on the Integrated Truss Structure. These points host the External Stowage Platforms, External Logistics Carriers, Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and the Mobile Base System for the Canadarm2. The Z1 truss was delivered by the STS-92 mission in October 2000. The P6 segment was installed on STS-97 in December 2000. The S0 truss was delivered to the ISS on STS-110, with the S1 segment following on STS-112. The P1 segment of the truss was brought to the ISS by STS-113, followed by the P3/P4 segment on STS-115, and the P5 segment on STS-116. The S3/S4 truss segment was delivered by STS-117, followed by the S5 segment STS-118. The last component of the truss segment, the S6 segment, was delivered by STS-119.|$|E
