It {{may be a}} liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or a <b>polar</b> <b>solvent</b> such as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated.

25|$|This almost-correct {{molecule}} {{possesses a}} tricyclic guanidine group (rings A, B & C), {{along with a}} uracil ring (D). The zwitterionic nature of the molecule makes this highly water-soluble, {{as the presence of}} charged areas within the molecule creates a dipole effect, suiting the <b>polar</b> <b>solvent.</b> Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR spectrum to small changes in pH suggested that the uracil ring exists in a keto/enol tautomeric relationship, where a hydrogen transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2). It was originally proposed that a hydrogen bond between the uracil and guanidine groups in the enol tautomer would make this the dominant form.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis of {{the upper}} part of the NanoPutian chain begins with 1,3-dibromo-2,4-diiodobenzene as the {{starting}} material. Sonogashira coupling with 4-oxytrimethylsilylbut-1-yne produces 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-1,4-di-bromobenzene. One of the bromine substituents is converted to an aldehyde through an SN2 reaction with the strong base, n-BuLi, and THF in the aprotic <b>polar</b> <b>solvent,</b> DMF to produce 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-4-bromobenzaldehyde. Another Sonogashira coupling with 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-ethynylbenzene attaches the lower body of the NanoPutian. The conversion of the aldehyde group to a diether “head” occurs in two steps. The first step involves addition of ethylene glycol and trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) in CH2Cl2 solvent. Addition of TBAF in THF solvent removes the silyl protecting group.|$|E

Large differences are {{observed in the}} photoluminescence (PL) spectra between <b>polar</b> and non-polar <b>solvents.</b> Narrow bandwidths characterize the PL bandshape in non-polar solvents in contrast to <b>polar</b> <b>solvents,</b> while in CCl 4, a significant contribution is observed from a blue-shifted species, possibly formed owing to a reaction between the solvent and the molecule that breaks the π-conjugation. Variation of the 0 - 0 band intensity in the PL spectrum {{as a function of}} solvent suggests that longer H-aggregates have a larger contribution in the case of <b>polar</b> <b>solvents.</b> Franck-Condon analysis suggests that the solvent {{dependence of}} PL bandshape is owed to the presence of two emissive species in <b>polar</b> <b>solvents.</b> We propose that the second emissive species observed in <b>polar</b> <b>solvents</b> could be due to a stabilized charge-transfer state.

25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less <b>polar</b> <b>solvent</b> (e.g. hexane). Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. Instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on gas chromatograph (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS).

25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The terminal group is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other nanostructure. In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen nanolithography was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The <b>polar</b> <b>solvent</b> that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E

Synthesis was done by precipitation using different acids, namely, orthophosphoric acid and nitric acid which yielded nanosilica. The effect of different acids and different <b>solvents</b> (<b>polar</b> and non-polar) on the size and degree of agglomeration of the silica particles were studied.

The use of non-polar solvents (toluene and diethyl ether) resulted in silica particles that were irregular in shape {{and in the case of}} orthophosphoric acid, a high degree of agglomeration was also noted. The degree of agglomeration was less when orthophosphoric acid was used with <b>polar</b> <b>solvents</b> as compared to nitric acid in conjunction with <b>polar</b> <b>solvents.</b> As regards the size, it ranged from approximately 70 nm to 400 nm when either acid was used in conjunction with <b>polar</b> <b>solvents.</b> When non-polar solvents were used, the silica particles were irregular in shape and the particle size was not estimated...|$|R

2500|$|For many solids {{dissolved}} in liquid water, the solubility increases with temperature up to 100°C. [...] In liquid water at high temperatures, (e.g., that approaching the critical temperature), the solubility of ionic solutes tends to decrease {{due to the}} change of properties and structure of liquid water; the lower dielectric constant results in a less <b>polar</b> <b>solvent.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Solvents {{also have}} an effect on allylic strain. [...] When used in {{conjunction}} with knowledge of the effects of polarity on allylic strain, solvents can be very useful in directing the conformation of a product that contains an allylic structure in its transition state. [...] When a bulky and <b>polar</b> <b>solvent</b> is able to interact with one of the substituents in the allylic group, the complex of the solvent can energetically force the bulky complex out of the allylic strain in favor of a smaller group.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrophobic {{interactions}} between proteins and the chromatographic matrix can be exploited to purify proteins. In hydrophobic interaction chromatography the matrix material is lightly substituted with hydrophobic groups. These groups {{can range from}} methyl, ethyl, propyl, octyl, or phenyl groups. At high salt concentrations, non-polar sidechains on the surface on proteins [...] "interact" [...] with the hydrophobic groups; that is, both types of groups are excluded by the <b>polar</b> <b>solvent</b> (hydrophobic effects are augmented by increased ionic strength). Thus, the sample {{is applied to the}} column in a buffer which is highly polar.

2500|$|Since {{the water}} {{molecule}} is not linear and the oxygen atom {{has a higher}} electronegativity than hydrogen atoms, it is a polar molecule, with an electrical dipole moment: the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. [...] Water is a good <b>polar</b> <b>solvent,</b> that dissolves many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as ethanol. [...] Most acids dissolve in water to yield the corresponding anions. [...] Many substances in living organisms, such as proteins, DNA and polysaccharides, are dissolved in water.

2500|$|RP-HPLC {{operates}} {{on the principle}} of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for [...] "cavity-reduction" [...] around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the surface tension of the eluent (water: 7.3J/cm², methanol: 2.2J/cm²) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less <b>polar</b> <b>solvent</b> (methanol, acetonitrile) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water.
