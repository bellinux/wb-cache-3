25|$|In January 2008 the South African {{government}} {{announced that it}} would introduce electricity rationing. On 25 January 2008 the country's deepening power crisis was such that South Africa's (and the world's) largest gold and platinum mining companies were forced to shut down operations. Eskom (the national power supplier) and the government both apologised for the blackouts and in his next-to-last State of the Nation speech Mbeki devoted nearly three pages to the electricity crisis, repeating the apologies of Eskom and the government. Mbeki blamed the power shortages on increased demand caused by years of economic growth and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> to black townships that were not connected in the apartheid era. But Mbeki also admitted the government had failed to heed warnings from Eskom (the earliest 10 years previously) that without new power stations Eskom {{might not be able to}} meet demand by 2007. Each year over the preceding 10 years, Eskom had produced annual Integrated Strategic Electricity Plans each setting out scenarios of future investment requirements to cope with projected increased demand, but although projections of average demand growth in the period 2001–2005 had been accurate, no investment had been forthcoming. Mbeki failed to respond to allegations that the government's black empowerment strategy had been a root cause of the problem in that small and medium sized black entrepreneurs, in preference to large corporations, had been awarded coal supply tenders. The policy of giving preference to small suppliers had caused problems in securing reliable supplies of coal, and had also, because small suppliers did not have the capital to invest in rail or conveyor belts infrastructure but used coal trucks, accelerated the wear and tear damage to the roads around the power stations. Warnings highlighted in several of Eskom's annual reports, starting in 2003, had been ignored not only by the Eskom board but also its political masters, Mbeki's government.|$|E

40|$|This talk {{will focus}} on one {{important}} dimension of existing poverty and inequalities – the inadequate <b>provision</b> and distribution <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> infrastructure. Despite dramatic advances {{in science and technology}} and rapid economic growth, over 40 % of the globe’s population still struggles to meet even basic needs, and inequalities persist and are even rising. Inequalities in income mirror those in final energy use and inequalities in electricity access and use are even starker. Finding effective ways to eliminate extreme deprivations and inequalities begs for the application of new approaches that better integrate across multiple perspectives and dimensions and for advances in methods that better represent existing heterogeneities and distributions. Past approaches to electrification that have taken singular perspectives have, in general, been less successful than approaches that have integrated the <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> within wider developmental and poverty alleviation efforts. The effective implementation of such integrated policy approaches, in turn, can result in synergies and co-benefits by way of improvements in additional dimensions of human well-being. Identifying and estimating the multiple benefits of even single interventions like improved electricity access are crucial. These insights and issues will be illustrated by means of examples from recent and ongoing IIASA research...|$|R

50|$|The {{position}} is that as per available records, the first diesel Power Station was established in Delhi in the year 1905 when a private English Company by name M/s. John Fleming was given permission to generate <b>electricity</b> under the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> the Indian <b>Electricity</b> Act 1903. The above-mentioned Company was given the responsibility both of generation and distribution of power in a limited manner. That Company after obtaining license under the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Electricity</b> Act 1903 {{had set up a}} small 2 MW Diesel set at Lahori Gate in Old Delhi. Later on, this very Company was converted as Delhi Electricity Supply and Traction Company. In the Year 1911, the power generation was augmented by Steam Generation Station. In the year 1932, the management of Central Power House was handed over to New Delhi Municipal Committee (NDMC). In the field of power generation and distribution, a major break through was achieved in 1939 when Delhi Central Electricity Power Authority (DCEPA) was established. This Company was responsible for the supply of power to the areas covered by Local Bodies, namely, the Municipal Committees of Delhi, West Delhi and South Delhi, the Notified Area Committees of Red Fort, Civil Lines, Mehrauli, Najafgarh, and the District Board of Delhi. The supply <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> to the Municipal Committees of Delhi-Shahdara and the Notified Area of Narela was done by different private agencies. In 1947 DCEPA took over a Private Limited Company by name Delhi electric Supply & traction Company Limited.|$|R
40|$|The project {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> blackouts on women time use using Emakhandeni suburb as a case study. The study was carried out because they was an outcry by {{the residents of the}} suburb that the frequency of blackouts had turned into a crisis. The study focused on understanding the impact of blackouts on women in their households given that they bear the burden of carrying out the reproductive roles in their families. Caroline Moser and other scholars argue that women are constrained on time due to the triple roles they perform in societies. A qualitative approach was used in this study. Data was collected from a convenient sample of predominantly female respondents through use of focus discussion, face to face individualâ€™s interviews and observations. This study has shown that blackouts negatively affect womenâ€™s ability to plan for the day, disrupt their activities and worsens their time constraints. <b>Provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> should be viewed with gender lens as blackouts have tendered to affect women more than men at household leve...|$|R
