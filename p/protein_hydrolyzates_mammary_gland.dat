40|$|The {{importance}} of small ruminants to the dairy industry {{has increased in}} recent years, especially in developing countries, where it has a high economic and social impact. Interestingly {{and despite the fact}} that the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> is the specialised milk production organ, very few authors studied the modifications occurring in the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> through the lactation period in production animals, particularly in the small ruminants, sheep (Ovis aries) and goat (Capra hircus). Nevertheless, understanding the different <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> patterns throughout lactation is essential to improve dairy production. In addition, associating these patterns with different milking frequencies, lactation number or different diets is also of high importance, directly affecting the dairy industry. The <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> is commonly composed of parenchyma and stroma, which includes the ductal system, with individual proportions of each changing during the different periods and yields in a lactation cycle. Indeed, during late gestation, as well as during early to mid-lactation, <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> expansion occurs, with an increase in the number of epithelial cells and lumen area, which leads to increment of the parenchyma tissue, as well as a reduction of stroma, corresponding macroscopically to the increase in <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> volume.

In general, common <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> patterns have been shown for both goats and sheep throughout the several lactation stages, although the number of studies is limited.

Surviving grafts had the histological appearance of nonnalmammary glands and func-tioned like the nOrJDal <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of the recipients. The grafts showed extensive lobular-alveolar growth, secreted milk when the graft-bearing rats were pregnant, and atro...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the embryonic <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> involves communication between the epidermis and mesenchyme and is coordinated temporally and spatially by various signaling pathways. Although many more genes are likely to control <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development, functional roles have been identified for Wnt, fibroblast growth factor, and parathyroid hormone-related protein signaling. This review describes {{what is known about}} the molecular mechanisms that regulate embryonic <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development...|$|R
40|$|Transforming growth factor- � (TGF-�) regulates proliferation, morphogenesis, and {{functional}} differentiation in the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> and plays complex roles in mammary tumorigenesis. Here {{we show that}} the signaling mediators Smad 1 –Smad 5 are expressed at all stages of <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development. To begin to investigate which Smads mediate which TGF- � responses, we have analyzed <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development in Smad 3 null mice. Smad 3 null virgin females showed delayed <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development. However, this phenotype was secondary to ovarian insufficiency because Smad 3 null mammary epithelium developed normally in hormonally supplemented Smad 3 null mice or when transplante...|$|R

The dissertation first describes the process, which macrophages evolve from haematopoietic cell through blood monocyt to mature macrophage and their activation. Briefly describes {{different types of}} macrophages and their paths to tissues. Next part of the bachelor's thesis discusses macrophages of the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> themselves. First is described their structure, ultrastructure and death, then their own role in the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland.</b> Important roles of the macrophages of the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> of cattle are phagocytosis, resolution of inflammation {{and the production of}} cytokines...|$|R
