Monolithic poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (GMA-co-EDMA) was prepared in 15 mm long cylindrical polypropylene tubing and quarternized. 160 nm silica nanoparticles with a 20 nm poly(methacrylic acid-co-tert-butyl methacrylate) brush layer were flushed through the monolith and electrostatically trapped.

40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} functionalised polymeric latex particles were coated {{onto the}} wall of a fused-silica capillary or onto a methacrylate monolithic bed synthesised inside the capillary in order to create ion-exchange stationary phases of varying ion-exchange capacity. These capillaries were coupled in-line to a separation capillary and used for the solid-phase extraction (SPE), preconcentration and subsequent separation of organic anions by capillary electrophoresis. A transient isotachophoretic gradient was used for the elution of bound analytes from the SPE phase using two modes of separation. The first comprised a low capacity SPE column combined with a fluoride/octanesulfonate discontinuous electrolyte system in which peak compression occurred at the isotachophoretic gradient front. The compressed anions were separated electrophoretically after elution from the SPE preconcentration phase and resolution was achieved by altering the pH of the electrolyte in which the separation was performed. In the second approach, a latex-coated monolithic SPE preconcentration stationary phase was used in combination with a fluoride/perchlorate electrolyte system, which allowed capillary electrochromatographic separation to occur behind the isotachophoretic gradient front. This method permitted the removal of weakly bound anions from the SPE phase, thereby establishing the possibility of sample clean-up. The effect {{of the nature of the}} strong electrolyte forming the isotachophoretic gradient on the separation and also on the preconcentration step was investigated. Capillary electrochromatography of inorganic and organic species performed on the latex-coated monolithic methacrylate column highlighted the presence of mixed-mode interactions resulting from the incomplete coverage of latex particles onto the <b>monolithic</b> <b>surface.</b> Analyte preconcentration prior to separation resulted in compression of the analyte zone by a factor of 300.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a systematic {{study on the}} use of latex-coated stationary phases for on-column ion-exchange preconcentration of anions by capillary electrochromatography with elution by a transient isotachophoretic gradient. Fully functionalised quaternary ammonium latex particles were electrostatically bound to open tubular (OT) capillaries and porous monolithic capillary columns. These columns were characterised and provided a reproducible and simple means for creating ion-exchange stationary phases with reversed electroosmotic flow. Monolithic columns provide a chromatographic support of high surface area, high phase ratio and are highly permeable. Adsorption of latex-particles provides superior mass-transfer properties ideal for ion-exchange preconcentration and ion-exchange capillary electrochromatography (IE-CEC). The prepared columns were characterised by their retention in IE-CEC when the ion-exchange interaction was varied through manipulating the strength and nature of the competing ion. Porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterise the <b>monolithic</b> <b>surface</b> and architecture. Up to 300, 000 plates/column were achieved using latex-coated silica monolithic columns and 164, 000 plates/column were achieved on methacrylate analogues. Both silica and methacrylate latex-coated monolithic columns were of similar capacity and around 20 times greater when compared to OT counterparts. A monolayer coverage of latex particles was not evident on the monolithic columns created and resulted in mixed mode interaction for the separation of organic anions on a polymer support. Multi-mode columns were created using zero-dead volume unions to attach a second capillary segment for the purpose of separation and detection and allowed individual optimisation of the discrete segments. Decoupling of the preconcentration column allowed in situ preconcentration of a river water sample, which was brought back to the laboratory for analysis. Novel discontinuous electrolyte combinations were used to increase the range of analytes which could be preconcentrated and detected. Alkylsulfonates were found to be ideal strong electrolytes of low electrophoretic mobility and were able to efficiently elute a large range of inorganic and organic anions. Further efforts to increase the range of anions which can be preconcentrated and detected included the use of a miniaturised capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector and indirect UV detection. High capacity monolithic columns were suitable for sample-cleanup procedures and were applied to the preconcentration of iodide in Southern Ocean seawater. Detection limits of 11 pM were achieved for iodide when selective focusing occurred at the isotachophoretic boundary using IE-CEC...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{electrochromatography}} (CEC) {{has developed}} rapidly {{in recent years}} and is considered a promising separation technique due to its high efficiency and peak capacity in the microscale separations. In CEC, the electroosmotic flow (EOF) is the driving force of the mobile phase and the flow velocity of the mobile is mainly depended on the EOF and the applied separation voltage. The stronger EOF and higher applied separation voltage will lead to the higher flow velocity, which is required for fast separations. However, the bubble formation is the major disadvantage for using higher applied voltage in CEC. Herein, we present a new organic-silica hybrid monolithic column prepared with (3 -chloropropyl) tri- methoxysilane (CTMS) and tetramethoxysilane (TMOS). Then, it was used as starting material reacted with 1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 10 -hexamethyltriethyl-enetetramine (HMTETA). The formation of the quaternary ammonium groups from this reaction would generate an anodic EOF from cathode to anode in CEC.

40|$|In this thesis, novel {{approaches}} to the preparation and characterisation of nanoagglomerated polymer monoliths are described. Polymer monoliths in various formats were prepared by availing of in-situ photopolymerisation techniques, with the modification of surface chemistry achieved via grafting selected amine-reactive monomers, facilitating the subsequent attachment of metal nano-materials. Traditional destructive characterisation methods such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provided the qualitative confirmation {{of the presence of}} the nano materials. A very dense coverage of bimetallic Pd/Pt nano-flowers was achieved upon the surface of such polymer monoliths. The macro-porous structure of the monoliths and the high coverage of nano-particles facilitated catalytic applications, such as the oxidation of NADH to NAD+, in flow-through configuration. The rate of reaction was found to be dependant on the initial NADH concentration. Other polymer monoliths were functionalised with gold nano-particle (AuNPs) of various sizes in order to evaluate the effects of nano-particle size on catalytic efficiency. The catalytic properties of the immobilised AuNPs were retained following immobilisation, as demonstrated by the reduction of ferrocyanide from Fe(ІІІ) to Fe(ІІ). A 57 % conversion rate was obtained when the reaction was performed on <b>monolithic</b> <b>surfaces</b> which had been functionalised with 16 nm AuNPs. Higher reaction yields (95 %) were obtained when 7 nm AuNPs were used. Non-invasive and non-destructive scanning capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (sC 4 D) was applied to monitor the temporal stability of surfactant and polyelectrolyte coatings in capillary columns which would traditionally be applied in capillary electrophoresis. The benefits of this technique were further illustrated by confirming the presence of AuNPs and PAA-grafted silica nano-particles (SiNPs) on previously aminated or quaternary ammonium functionalised monoliths. The movement of the nanoparticle’s plug was monitored at mm increments as it progressed along the column. Finally, an evaluation of the chromatographic properties of nano-agglomerated stationary phases was performed. Reversed-phase applications of AuNP functionalised monoliths were demonstrated upon further modification of the nanoparticles with alkylthiol and alkylamine chains. However, poor chromatographic performance was observed with a test mixture of alkylbenzenes due to the limited hydrophobicity of the stationary phase. Ion-exchange applications were also possible upon modification of the immobilised AuNPs with sulphonate groups, which was demonstrated by the retention of Ca 2 + ions. PAA-grafted SiNPs were immobilised on the surface of a quaternary ammonium-functionalised polymer monolith and the anion-exchange properties of the stationary phase demonstrated by separating a mixture of Cl- and H 2 PO 4 -. The immobilisation of negatively charged PAA-grafted SiNPs however, lead to the formation of a cation-exchange stationary phase as confirmed by the retention of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} unique optical properties, {{metallic}} nanoparticles offer a {{great potential for}} important applications such as disease diagnostics, demanding highly integrated device solutions with large refractive index sensitivity. Here we introduce {{a new type of}} <b>monolithic</b> localized <b>surface</b> plasmon resonance (LSPR) waveguide sensor based on the combination of an adiabatic optical fiber taper and a high-density ensemble of immobilized gold-reinforced silver nanoprisms, showing sensitivities up to 900 nm/RIU.

The particle density is so high (approx. 210 particle/μm 2) that neighboring particles are able to interact, boosting the sensitivity, as confirmed by qualitative infinite element simulations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} the {{preparation}} of hybrid, organic−inorganic porous materials derived from polyhedral oligomeric vinylsilsesquioxanes (vinylPOSS) via a single-step molding process. The <b>monolithic,</b> large <b>surface</b> area materials are studied with a particular focus on morphology and porous properties. Radical vinyl polymerization of the nanometer-sized POSS building blocks is therefore utilized via a thermally initiated route and in porogenic diluents such as tetrahydrofuran and polyethylene glycols of varying composition. Careful choice of these porogenic solvents and proper choice of initiator concentration lead to highly porous monolithic building entities which show a rigid, 3 D-adhered, porous structure, macroscopically adapting {{the shape of a}} given mold. The described materials reflect Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface areas of 700 m 2 /g or more and maximum tunable mesopore volumes of up to 2 cm 3 /g.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with new modes of ephemeral, relational practice for the Australian public art audience. It uses visual art models to investigate the use of everyday activities as an aesthetic premise for temporary public art activities in Australia and results {{from a lack of}} cohesive models/frameworks for a temporary public art practice. Public art, usually publicly commissioned work for a specific site and intended for public viewing, {{is in a state of}} change: in Australia, the transition from the production of <b>permanent,</b> <b>monolithic</b> and monumental works is recent but this transformation is already well established in Europe. I have surveyed various models of public art-making in Europe and have expanded upon the possibilities of employing these models in Australia. My research has been informed by a number of contemporary theorists and artists that, since the early 1980 s, have been concerned with practices, variously termed social sculpture (Deuys), new-genre public art (Lacy),functional site (Meyer) and relational (Bourriaud), that dissolve the distinction between public art, community art, art education and such avant-garde practices as performance and conceptual art. Since the 1990 s, artists working in public have begun to depart sharply from the dominant, abstract, ego-driven, Modernist mode of production. Rather than defining private, autonomous systems of representation, they have begun to use the vernacular: sites and social structures that directly relate to the personal experiences of the public. Instead of producing discrete objects, the focus has shifted to the infiltration of, or interventions into, the flow of the daily lives within the community. These interactions promise more profound revelations of sites and the creation (or recreation) of a sense of community. Such practices, to which the ephemeral nature of experience is fundamental, bear a clear lineage from early conceptual practice of the early 1960 s that generate interactive relationships between artists and the community. This project studies the relationship between art, the artist and the community through participation in twelve events in Europe and Australia; of these, seven were chosen to exemplify the key factors that help make a project successful or, in some cases, unsuccessful. Throughout this research the objective was to identify, describe and salvage from the social space, a temporary ongoing and sustainable justification for supporting relational practice into public art-making and programming in Australia. This, in turn, will support and provide an alternative to permanent public art that is currently favoured by major public commissioners. Methodologies have included situational observations, collections of stories, living in situ, performance-based activities, video, art in situ and permanent and temporary commissioned public art works. Each has facilitated a personal understanding of public art-making. The project concludes that the connection of people and their everyday activities, although often tenuous, is directly related to what binds communities together. Furthermore, this research suggests that 'Relational Public Art', that is, projects where artists have meaningful access to community, facilitate the free flow of a more diverse and open discourse. Despite the conclusions I have drawn, the project is not aimed to present a definitive solution to public art-making. Rather, it has been driven by the need to understand how contemporary site has changed the way in which we, as community, as artists, and as art agencies, can participate wholly within public art. This research has produced a series of national and international projects; the accompanying exhibition includes components of the final project, The Making of Curtains and informative panels that illustrate a selection of the projects that best exemplify the research topic. The exegesis includes documentation of the practical and conceptual investigations together with the research underlying the historical and contemporary themes associated with site-based art practice...|$|R
40|$|VCSEL {{growth is}} {{initiated}} at 420 C with a 50 A ˚ AlSb nucleation layer, then {{the temperature is}} ramped from 420 to 500 C for the device growth. We note that excellent material quality is achieved at growth temperature ranging from 420 to 500 C. <b>Monolithic</b> vertical cavity <b>surface</b> emitting lasers (VCSELs) on Si are demonstrated. The GaSb multi-quantum well active region embedded in an Al(Ga) Sb half-wave cavity spacer layer enables lasing under room-temperature optically-pumped conditions. The 13 % lattice mismatch is accommodated by a spontaneously formed 2 -D array of 90 misfit dislocations at the AlSb=Si interface. This growth mode produces very low defect density (8 10 5 =cm 2) and relaxed materials growth (98 %) {{without the use of}} a buffer layer. Presented are VCSEL lasing spectra, light-in against light-out curves along with defect density measurements performed by microscopy and etch-pit density. A threshold excitation density of Ith 0. 1 mJ=cm 2 and...|$|R
40|$|Don Stookey was {{a special}} person by any measure: an unassuming optimist, eminent {{scientist}} and inventor, adventurer, and a beloved family man. Don Stookey, the father of glass-ceramics, was a pioneer in inducing and understanding internal nucleation phenomena in glass. His early work on dense opal glasses and photosensitive precipitation of gold and silver in glass led to an amazing series of inventions: Fotalite®, a photosensitive opal, chemically machined Fotoform® and Fotoceram®, and TiO 2 -nucleated Pyroceram™ products including missile nosecones and oven-proof cookware. He received a basic patent on glass-ceramics which was contested and affirmed in court. Don was able to demonstrate a clear photochromic glass that showed reversible darkening for thousands of cycles. This material became a fixture in the ophthalmic industry. He went on to invent a full-color polychromatic glass capable of yielding a <b>permanent</b> patterned and <b>monolithic</b> stained glass. In his life outside science, Don chaired an interfaith group that founded {{a home for the}} elderly in Corning. He was also a wilderness enthusiast, surviving a plane crash in the Arctic and two boat capsizings. Even In his later years, he continued fishing off the coast of Florida and on Lake Ontario, and went solo on a trip to the Patagonian Andes...|$|R
40|$|The use of high <b>surface</b> <b>monolithic</b> carbon {{as support}} for {{catalysts}} offers important advantage, such as {{elimination of the}} ohmic drop originated in the interparticle contact and improved mass transport by ad-hoc pore design. Moreover, the approach discussed here has the advantage that it allows the synthesis of materials having a multimodal porous size distribution, with each pore size contributing to the desired properties. On the other hand, the monolithic nature of the porous support also imposes new challenges for metal loading. In this work, the use of Hierarchical Porous Carbon (HPC) as support for PtPd nanoparticles was explored. Three hierarchical porous carbon samples (denoted as HPC- 300, HPC- 400 and HPC- 500) with main pore size around 300, 400 and 500 nm respectively, are used as porous support. PtPd nanoparticles were loaded by impregnation and subsequent chemical reduction with NaBH 4. The resulting material was characterized by EDX, XRD and conventional electrochemical techniques. The catalytic activity toward formic acid and methanol electrooxidation was evaluated by electrochemical methods, and the results compared with commercial carbon supported PtPd. The Hierarchical Porous Carbon support discussed here seems to be promising for use in DFAFC anodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{bachelor}} work is new building of Student housing in Brno in the street Leitnerova in the city part of Old Brno. The aim {{was to create a}} building with the main function of housing for students combined with use for public. The proposed building is divided into 2 buildings with shape sequence to adjacent buildings. The idea was to create a comfortable common housing that will balance the need for individuality of students and the collective use of common spaces. Parter buildings used for public interest activities and facilities for students. There is a cafe, a fitness center and a commercial area along with a self-service laundry. In other floors are situated apartments for students of different disposition. The buildings are interconnected by connecting overground neck, underneath are created public spaces and entrances to individual parts of the building. The concept of the architectural design is the purest and minimalist form composed of square masses of launched and inserted into the building creating a varied facade blended into one <b>monolithic</b> mass lateral <b>surface.</b> The building envelope consists mainly of exposed concrete complemented by glass and alubond boards...|$|R
