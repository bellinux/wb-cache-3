40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the classical coefficient et test reliability, parallel measurements are needed. H. Gulliksen's matched random subtests method, which is a graphtcal method for splitting a test into parallel test halves, has practical relevance because it maximizes the alpha coefficient as a lower bound of the classical test reliability coefficient. This paper formulates this same problem as a zero-one programming problem, the advantage being {{that it can be}} solved by algorithms already existing in computer code. Focus is on giving Gulliksen's method a sound computational basis. How the procedure can be generalized to test splits into components of an / length is shown.

40|$|As {{devices that}} produce audio become more commonplace and {{increasingly}} portable, {{situations in which}} two competing audio programs are present occur more regularly. In order to support the design of systems intended to mitigate the effects of interfering audio (including sound field control, noise cancelation or source separation systems), it is desirable to model the perceived distraction in such situations. Distraction ratings were collected {{for a range of}} audio-on-audio interference situations including various target and interferer programs at three interferer levels, with and without road noise. Time-frequency target-to-interferer ratio (TIR) maps of the stimuli were created using a simple auditory model. A number of feature sets were extracted from the TIR maps, including combinations of mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum TIR taken across the duration of the <b>program</b> <b>item.</b> In order to predict distraction ratings from the features, linear regression models were produced. The models were evaluated for goodness-of-fit (RMSE) and generalizability (using a K-fold cross-validation procedure). The best model performed well, with almost all predictions falling within the 95 % confidence intervals of the perceptual data. A validation data set was used to test the model, suggesting areas for future improvement...|$|E

40|$|I {{am writing}} {{on behalf of}} the Port Orford Ocean Resource Team (POORT), a nonprofit {{community}} fisheries organization, to encourage the Pacific Fishery Management Council to consider our proposal for creating a halibut bycatch fishery for the longline sablefish fishery off the southern Oregon Coast. The fishing community of Port Orford, Oregon {{has a long history of}} participation in the Pacific halibut fishery. Management changes over time have diminished the opportunity for our fishermen to access the halibut fishery. The combination of short opening periods and small vessel trip limits in the halibut fishery, and RCA restrictions in the groundfish fishery have almost eliminated Port Orford’s ability to catch halibut. Port Orford is a small community that depends on fishery resources for a significant proportion of its income. Small amounts of fish make a big difference for our community. Currently halibut taken incidentally with sablefish must be discarded south of Pt. Chehalis, Washington. National Standard 9 of the Magnuson-Stevens Acts states that “Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable: (1) Minimize bycatch; and (2) To the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch. ” Our proposal would support this national standard reducing bycatch and bycatch mortality of halibut.
