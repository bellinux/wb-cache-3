25|$|By {{definition}} of a function, {{the image of an}} element x of the domain is always a single element y of the codomain. However, the <b>preimage</b> of a singleton set (a set with exactly one element) may in general contain any number of elements. For example, if f(x) = 7 (the constant function taking value 7), then the <b>preimage</b> of {5} is the empty set but the <b>preimage</b> of {7} is the entire domain. It is customary to write f−1(b) instead of f−1({b}), i.e.|$|E

25|$|A {{cellular}} automaton is reversible if, for every current {{configuration of the}} {{cellular automaton}}, there is exactly one past configuration (<b>preimage).</b> If one thinks of a cellular automaton as a function mapping configurations to configurations, reversibility implies that this function is bijective. If a cellular automaton is reversible, its time-reversed behavior can also {{be described as a}} cellular automaton; this fact is a consequence of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata. For cellular automata in which not every configuration has a <b>preimage,</b> the configurations without preimages are called Garden of Eden patterns.|$|E

25|$|A {{function}} is surjective (onto) if every possible image is mapped to {{by at least}} one argument.

We will show first that σ(Th) coincides with the essential range of h and then examine its various parts.|$|E

The <b>preimages</b> of a configuration s are those configurations which evolve to s within a single time step. We present two methods of finding {{the total number of}} <b>preimages</b> for a given homogeneous configuration. The first is more intuitive, and gives a clear picture of how the number of <b>preimages</b> varies with the number of cells on which the CA operates, but it is only workable for elementary CAs (1 -dimensional binary state CAs with neighbourhood size 3).

40|$|One of {{the central}} results in {{holomorphic}} dynamics in several variables is the equidistribution of <b>preimages</b> theorem, which constructs invariant probability measures for a large class of interesting dynamical systems, namely the class of polarized dynamical systems. This {{opens the door to}} studying the dynamics of these systems via ergodic theoretic methods, an approach that has proved to be fruitful. In recent years, as interest in nonarchimedean dynamics has grown, it has become apparent that an analogue of the equidistribution of <b>preimages</b> theorem should hold for polarized dynamical systems over nonarchimedean fields, and, indeed, an analogue has been shown for endomorphisms of the projective line over these fields. In this dissertation we formulate a precise conjectural statement of a nonarchimedean equidistribution of <b>preimages</b> theorem, and supply further evidence for it by proving it for generic polarized nonarchimedean dynamical systems with good reduction, in any dimension. In the case when the nonarchimedean field is trivially valued, these results give a exact analogue of the equidistribution of <b>preimages</b> theorem for generic polarized dynamical systems in every dimension...|$|R

We give here a combinato-rial characterization of the maximal <b>preimages</b> of N-block presentations. Using this characterization, we show that, being given two subshifts of finite type X and Y, the existence of two numbers N and M such that the N-block presentation of X is similar to the M-block presentation of Y, which implies that X and Y are conjugate, is decidable...|$|R
