40|$|An {{electronic}} {{position sensor}} {{for use with}} a <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> vehicle accessory, such as a power liftgate. The position sensor includes an elongated resistive circuit that is mounted such that it is stationary and extends along {{the path of a}} track portion of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory. The position sensor further includes a contact nub mounted to a link member that moves within the track portion such that the contact nub is slidingly biased against the elongated circuit. As the link member moves under the force of a motor-driven output gear, the contact nub slides along the surface of the resistive circuit, thereby affecting the overall resistance of the circuit. The position sensor uses the overall resistance to provide an electronic position signal to an ECU, wherein the signal is indicative of the absolute position of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory. Accordingly, the electronic position sensor is capable of providing an electronic signal that enables the ECU to track the absolute position of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the investment of a selected agro-machinery <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> Maize Sheller {{in the course of}} mechanization of Bangladesh. The analysis considers different types of Maize Sheller, and inter-regional differences in agro-economic factors that influence the business rationale for investment. Maize Shellers are increasingly needed to serve demand from poultry sector because manual shelling is very laborious. Comparing with manual shelling, results indicate that <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> Maize Shellers look like a wise investment (5 – 8 acres for 25 % internal rate of return or IRR). However, it makes economic sense to operate shellers at higher capacities, and along with the high capital cost (Tk 1 18, 000 – 22, 000) to save large numbers of labours to farmers and maize traders. Therefore, <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> Maize Sheller can able to overcome the shortage of expensive labour during peak harvesting season...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considered}} the <b>power</b> <b>operating</b> mode of a high-power arc steelmaking furnaces (ASMF) {{in the period of}} the flat bath. It is revealed that electric energy is mainly spent for heating and overheating the foamed slag. Heat transferring from slag to metal is carried out by the convective agitation of the bath. For agitation there is used intensive purging of the bath with oxygen that causes increased iron losses with the running foamed slag.
