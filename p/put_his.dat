5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E

With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
