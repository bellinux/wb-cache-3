40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a compact network called CUNet (compact {{unsupervised}} network) {{to counter the}} image classification challenge. Different from the traditional convolutional neural networks learning filters by the time-consuming stochastic gradient descent, CUNet learns the filter bank from diverse image patches with the simple K-means, which significantly avoids the requirement of scarce labeled training images, reduces the training consumption, and maintains the high discriminative ability. Besides, we propose a new <b>pooling</b> method <b>named</b> weighted <b>pooling</b> considering the different weight values of adjacent neurons, which helps to improve the robustness to small image distortions. In the output layer, CUNet integrates the feature maps gained in the last hidden layer, and straightforwardly computes histograms in non-overlapped blocks. To reduce feature redundancy, we implement the max-pooling operation on adjacent blocks to select the most competitive features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art classification performances with CUNet on CIFAR- 10, STL- 10, MNIST and Caltech 101 benchmark datasets...|$|R
