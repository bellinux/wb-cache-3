40|$|Demonstration of the {{performance}} of adaptive structures on air vehicles in general has been a rather difficult subject. Different reasons such as cost, risk, actuator capability, time and possibly others have prevented performance of adaptive aeronautical structures to be demonstrated exhaustively. Although operating at lower Reynolds numbers a means to alleviate some of the reasons preventing smart technologies to be applied is to demonstrate those adaptive structures' capabilities on a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) which is what is presented along this article. Based on a modular MAV design it is shown how within minutes if not even seconds wings, tails or the propulsion systems can be easily changed resulting in differences of the MAV's performance. Principally based on the same fuselage this allows different features of adaptive structures to be performance and analyzed such as a change in a wing's thickness, aspect ratio, stiffness or angle of attack, or a vector thrust propulsion system, before an adaptive structures' solution is practically realized. The performance of all these features has been demonstrated in flight tests and the results obtained have been validated through analytical and numerical analysis, mainly from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> performance stability and manoeuvrability which will be described and explained throughout the article. The effects of passive versus active adaptive wing will be briefly explained.

40|$|Precise {{attitude}} estimation {{is important}} for navigation, guidance and control of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) as they are mostly equipped with low integrity sensors due to the constraints on MAV payload and able power. The MAY sensors such as accelerometer and magnetometer are prone to noise as they are placed in proximity to the motor due to constraints on centre of gravity (CG). Data from a single sensor are not reliable for all operating <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> envelope as the motor vibration and magnetic flux due to the motor vary with RPM. Hence accurate attitude estimation of MAV is achieved through multisensor data fusion. In this paper, a modification to the classical cascade Kalman filter is proposed. Modified Cascade Kalman Filter (MCKF) has better estimation performance {{as it is a}} single Kalman filter similar to measurement fusion technique and also it restores the flexibility and computational efficiency of state vector fusion method. A numerical example is presented wherein the derived MCKF is implemented for the attitude estimation of MAV in the 6 DOF simulation model developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK and also for a set of calibrated accelerometer and magnetometer sensor data With motor noise acquired from the autopilot mounted on the rate table of the notion simulator. It was found that MCKF exhibits substantially improved performance compared to extended Kalman filter with only accelerometer data with motor noise.
