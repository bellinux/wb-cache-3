40|$|Graduation date: 2009 To remain competitive, {{the forest}} {{products}} industry {{needs to look}} for new and innovative processes and technologies to not only reduce costs but also to recover more value through the entire seedling-to-customer forest products supply chain. It is well recognized that measuring wood properties of logs in real time during harvesting would lead to improved log allocation decisions and increased value recovery. Wood stiffness {{is certainly one of}} the attributes defining the quality of forest products such as veneer and lumber. Accurately assessing stiffness in realtime can be a challenge for log supply managers requiring logs segregated into different product classes based on stiffness. Acoustic technology {{has proven to be a}} well established non-destructive technique for assessing potential product performance by identifying logs with high stiffness. Launched by the worldwide trend towards increased mechanization of forest harvesting operations, providing a platform for innovative measurement systems, the interest in incorporating technologies for measuring internal stem features into a harvester head is rapidly growing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide forest products stakeholders with comprehensive scientific information on the potential capabilities, limitations, and applicability of acoustic technology to improve value recovery from Douglas-fir stands by means of in-forest sorting of veneer quality logs. This dissertation: • Demonstrated that recovery of high quality green veneer from Douglas-fir <b>peeler</b> <b>logs</b> could be accurately predicted using resonance-based acoustic velocity measurements, • modeled the predictive capabilities of spatial as well as internal and external log and tree characteristics in terms of veneer quality and analyzed their effects on acoustic velocity measurements of Douglas-fir wood stiffness, • determined whether time of flight acoustic technology could be used for pre-harvest veneer quality assessment of Douglas-fir stands in terms of stiffness requirements, • described influential factors arising from incorporating acoustic instruments on a mechanized harvester head and suggested optimal procedures for scanning in terms of feasibility and harvester productivity, • presented a general methodology to estimate breakeven prices of Douglasfir <b>peeler</b> <b>logs</b> based on the net return obtained when logs from stiffness graded stands using acoustic technology are processed and converted into end products...|$|R

40|$|Fast-growing {{tree species}} of Populus spp.,Salix spp. and Eucalyptus spp. are {{cultivated}} to produce wood {{in a short}} time. Poplars are cultivated with cycles of 15 - 18 years to obtain saw timber and <b>peeler</b> <b>logs,</b> but when grown as short -rotation coppice(SRC) to produce biomass, planting density increases and rotation is considerably reduced (3 - 5 years). In this regard, research efforts are focused {{in the identification of}} traits and loci that allow the generation of improved SRC biomass-yielding genotypes. Biomass yield is a highly complex trait as it is the combined outcome of many other complex traits, each under separate polygenic control. Among profitable biomass yield-related traits are the amount of sylleptic branching and the length of winter dormancy. In poplar and in a few other Salicaceae species some lateral buds grow out sylleptically, the same season in which they form without the need of an intervening rest period. Sylleptic branching in poplar increases branch number, leaf area and general growth of the tree in its early years, and is a reasonable predictor of coppice yield. On the other hand, the length of winter dormancy determines the extent of the growth period. Our group has characterized the RAV 1 gene of Castanea sativa (CsRAV 1), encoding a transcription factor of the subfamily RAV (Related to ABI 3 /VP 1). CsRAV 1 expression shows a marked seasonal pattern, being higher in autumn and winter both in stems and buds. We generated transgenic lines of the hybrid clone Populus tremulax P. alba INRA 717 1 B 4 constitutively expressing CsRAV 1. These CsRAV 1 -expressing poplars develop sylleptic branches only a few weeks after potting. In addition to the sylleptic branching phenotype, these trees show phenological features that could give rise to an extended growth period. We are currently assessing the phenotype and behavior of these transgenic trees in a field trial, and ultimately, we will evaluate the impact on lignocellulosic biomass quality and production...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A {{changing}} {{raw material}} supply and smaller, generally lower quality <b>peeler</b> <b>logs,</b> are causing surface characteristics in veneer that can adversely affect glue-bond performance. When lower quality logs are peeled, rougher veneer is usually produced. The typical response by plywood manufacturers {{is to increase}} adhesive spread when using rough veneer. The effectiveness of increasing adhesive spread rates has not been quantified. To do so, a method to quantify roughness is needed {{so that it can}} be correlated with percent wood failure, the standard for defining glue-bond quality. The objectives of this research were to define the relationships between seven traditional 2 - dimensional measures of surface roughness and glue-bond performance in order to determine if a measure or combination of measures could be used to develop a glue-bond performance prediction model. Rotary peeled, 1 / 8 inch thick Douglas-fir veneer was visually categorized as being smooth, intermediate, or rough. Samples on each sheet were selected at random and their locations tracked throughout the study. The surface roughness of each sample was measured on the tight and loose sides using a modified laser scatter/optical imaging system. The scanning data were used to calculate seven roughness measures. Three-ply plywood panels were manufactured using the measured samples as core material and smooth veneer as face and back plys. Each panel was cut into standard shear specimens according to U. S. Product Standard 1 - 95. The test area for each shear specimen was the measured sample selected prior to panel assembly. The shear specimens were tested and evaluated for load at failure and percent wood failure. Each of the roughness measures and visual categories were compared to load at failure and percent wood failure data. Each shear specimen was also examined to determine the nature of the failure and with the failure being categorized into one of seven types. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression tests indicated no statistically significant relationship between any of the seven roughness measures or combination of measures and load at failure or percent wood failure. There was also no significant difference in roughness between the tight and loose side of the veneer, except for the skewness, kurtosis, and 3 rd highest peak measures. Analysis of the visual categories showed there was strong evidence that an increase in surface roughness was associated with a decrease in load at failure and percent wood failure. This indicates that a 3 - dimensional measure of surface roughness may be more effective for modeling glue-bond performance. Analysis of the nature of failure data indicated that the samples tended to fail on the loose side of the veneer. This trend was noted across all roughness categories. It is believed that this may be associated with lathe check depth and that an interaction between lathe check depth and veneer roughness may determine glue-bond performance...|$|R
40|$|Background Plantations of Populus spp, Salix spp. or Eucalyptus spp. are {{established}} to produce wood in a reduced {{space and a}} short time. Poplars are cultivated with cycles of 15 - 18 years to obtain saw timber and <b>peeler</b> <b>logs,</b> and when grown for biomass production as short-rotation coppice (SRC), cutting back/coppicing cycles are reduced to 2 ? 5 -years intervals. Syllepsis is among the valuable traits that can be targeted to enhance biomass yield of SRCs. Syllepsis, i. e. the outgrowth of lateral buds into branches the same season in which they form without an intervening rest period, increases carbon fixation and allocation in the shoot and hence the general growth of the tree. A high degree of sylleptic branching {{is known to be}} positively correlated with biomass yield when these plantations are grown under optimal conditions [1]. In 2012 we established in Madrid (Spain) a SRC field trial with genetically engineered poplars, previously shown to develop sylleptic branches when cultivated in growth chambers, under optimal conditions [2]. The aim of starting up this field trial was to test whether a plastic trait as syllepsis was maintained over time under natural conditions and eventually resulted in an enhanced biomass production Methods In vitro culture rooted cuttings were initially potted in 3. 5 L containers with blond peat and grown in the greenhouse as previously described [2]. The field trial was established in July 2012 in the experimental plot, and included five groups of hybrid poplar Populus tremula x P. alba INRA clone 717 1 B, the wild-type genotype as control, transgenic events # 37 and # 60 carrying the 35 S:: 3 xHA:CsRAV 1 cassette (3 xHA:CsRAV 1 OX), and events # 1 and # 22 carrying the 35 S::PtaRAV 1 -hpiRNA cassette (PtaRAV 1 & 2 KD). 30 individuals per group were planted into three blocks of 10 plants each. The experimental plot area was 204 m 2, and the plantation density 10000 trees/ha. It consisted of 12 x 17 rows with a tree spacing 2 x 0. 5 m. The border rows were occupied by P. x euramericana clone I- 214 individuals, planted as 25 cm-long cuttings. Irrigation and weed/pests control were applied, and the first coppicing cycle was done after the second growing season [3]. Several productivity determinants (stem height and diameter, syllepsis and phenology) were monitored, wood anatomy and chemistry analyzed, and aerial biomass yield and calorific value determined. Results and Conclusions CsRAV 1 over-expressing event # 60 showed an advantageous performance in the field regarding stem diameter and biomass production after the first coppicing cycle. In this event, sylleptic branches grew from the main shoot during the first growing seasons, after the plantation establishment and after coppicing. None of the other traits under study such as phenology, wood anatomy and chemistry were noticeably altered when compared to the wild type genotype. These results show that in woody species RAV 1 is a highly valuable target gene that can be used as biotechnological tool to enhance biomass yield of poplar SRC plantations without detrimental side-effects in tree development and characteristics...|$|R
