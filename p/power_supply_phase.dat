This could give an array that is as large as the ship itself, with 360 degrees coverage. It has advantages in the areas of survivability and adaptability, and the profile of the ship could be kept low for better maneuverability and smaller radar cross section. The array elements are stand-alone transmit-receive (T/R) modules controlled over a wireless media, with no hardwire connection other than <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> <b>Phase</b> and time synchronization are critical for the successful operation of the array.
