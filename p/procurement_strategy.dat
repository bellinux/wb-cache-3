A selection method developed using multi-attribute utility technology (MAUT) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed.

Against these criteria, utility factors corresponding to various <b>procurement</b> <b>strategies</b> were then assigned by the experts to create a utility factor table.

This tool is shown to provide guidance to assist in adequately rewarding prime contractors who invest in innovative activities while fulfilling their IRB obligations...|$|R

It was {{presented}} at the International Symposium on Procurement Systems (2005 : University of Nevada, Las Vegas) and the proceedings are available from: [URL] remains highly desirable yet unattainable. Sustainable construction is about application of sustainable development in the construction industry. The traditional focus of sustainability literature was on environmental issues due to its more tangible nature. Sustainability, in its broader meaning, incorporates many different but interrelated dimensions, including social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Nevertheless, the interpretation of the issues underpinning the different dimensions of sustainability depends significantly on the context as the needs and the conditions of the developed countries are widely {{different from those of the}} developing world. In the context of the UK construction industry, the need to address sustainability in construction <b>procurement</b> <b>strategies</b> is increasingly acknowledged. This paper draws upon review and synthesis of the relevant literature, discussion with professionals and experience of authors on various projects. The paper explores the issues underpinning the social dimension of sustainable construction in the context of developed countries and in particular the UK. It also proposes potential directions that <b>procurement</b> <b>strategies</b> could take in attaining the objectives of the social dimension of sustainable construction and presents some constraints to taking such actions. The paper provides a theoretical framework for further research to realise social objectives of sustainable construction through <b>procurement</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R
