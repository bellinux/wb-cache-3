Although {{the shape of the}} {{building}} after its initial phase cannot be determined, Paillet <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> its size likely corresponded to that of the current building. The small salient bastion that juts out of the northern wall dates to the first phase.|$|E
5|$|This {{decompression}} {{model was}} developed by D.E. Yount {{and others at the}} University of Hawaii to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure variations. It <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of surface-active molecules with variable gas permeability. These skins resist the effect of surface tension, as surface tension tends to collapse a small bubble by raising internal pressure above ambient so that the partial pressure gradient favours diffusion out of the bubble in inverse proportion to the radius of the surface.|$|E

25|$|Another theory <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> {{microscopic}} bubble nuclei always {{exist in}} aqueous media, including living tissues.

25|$|While in Securitate custody, {{the former}} Jewish Commissioner was {{subjected}} to several inquiries. His written statements were kept under key, in special files. Romanian-born Israeli historian Jean Ancel <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> the Securitate had vested interest in allowing Lecca to produce a personal version of Romania's World War II history. The Securitate, Ancel notes, shared Lecca's goal of shifting focus from Romania's Holocaust complicity.|$|E
25|$|RBV <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> {{firms are}} bundles of {{heterogeneous}} resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile across firms. This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy. They concluded that managers {{can determine the}} appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting cost benefit analysis {{in the same way}} that they analyze other investments.|$|E
25|$|Tide tables list each day's {{high and}} low water heights and times. To {{calculate}} the actual water depth, add the charted depth to the published tide height. Depth for other times {{can be derived from}} tidal curves published for major ports. The rule of twelfths can suffice if an accurate curve is not available. This approximation <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> the increase in depth in the six hours between low and high water is: first hour — 1/12, second — 2/12, third — 3/12, fourth — 3/12, fifth — 2/12, sixth — 1/12.|$|E

25|$|The only {{project for}} which there was forward motion was towards {{accomplishing}} his long-planned Re Lear, an opera {{to be based on}} King Lear, for which his new librettist (following Salvadore Cammarano's death) was Antonio Somma. But a year later, when overseeing a revival of La traviata at La Fenice, he agreed to a new opera for that house for the 1856/7 season, and he proposed the Gutiérrez play, which Budden presumes he had read in translation. Budden also <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> the translation had been done by Strepponi, because she had been the translator of Gutiérrez' other play which had become Il trovatore.|$|E
25|$|The {{duty of care}} {{requires}} control {{persons to}} act on an informed basis after due consideration of all information. The duty includes a requirement that such persons reasonably inform themselves of alternatives. In doing so, they may rely on employees and other advisers {{so long as they}} do so with a critical eye and do not unquestionably accept the information and conclusions provided to them. Under normal circumstances, their actions are accorded the protection of the business judgment rule, which <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> control persons acted properly, provided that they act on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was {{in the best interests of}} the company.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin {{returned}} at {{the head}} of a Crusading force from Western Europe, variously estimated to include as few as thirty thousand men or as many as sixty thousand. This force was joined by a contingent of Cumans, combining to besiege Tzurulum, a Nicaean strongold in Thrace. The city fell in 1240 but this seems to have been the only success of this force. They are not mentioned afterwards. John V.A. Fine <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> most of them returned to their homes in Western Europe, only a few of them joining the existing garrison of Constantinople. For the moment, the Latin Empire had ensured its continued survival. Marie was approximately fifteen-year-old at the time her husband returned to his capital.|$|E

25|$|Having {{received}} the first TCR/CD3 signal, the naïve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure {{to ensure that}} a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming anergic (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth in}} {{usage of the}} Panama Canal {{over the past few}} years has been almost entirely driven by {{increased}} US imports from China passing through the canal en route to ports on the US East and Gulf coasts. But it is increasingly recognized in both the US and China that this imbalance in trade is unsustainable and will be reduced via some sort of adjustment in the coming years (although such an imbalance need not be made up by physically shipped goods, but could be made by other trade such as intellectual property as China upgrades its intellectual property protection laws). The ACP, however, <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> trade will continue to grow for a generation as it has for the past several years.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{has kept}} his {{personal}} history an almost absolute secret, revealing only one story about his pre-Corwood years: he wrote seven novels but burned them upon rejection from New York publishers. Aside from that anecdote, virtually nothing {{is known about}} his life. He was rumored to have grown up, or at least spent time, in Providence, Rhode Island. A handful of early Jandek songs mention either the state itself or the Rhode Island town of Point Judith. It has also been suggested that he is well traveled, as several album sleeves depict locations that have been formally identified as being outside the United States. This hypothesis, however, <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> all pictures that do not depict Smith were taken by him.|$|E

25|$|Bartlett's studies {{relating}} to the nosology of mental illness and his critique of the assumption that psychological normality should be equated with good mental health led him to examine the psychology of creative individuals. The psychology of artists and other highly creative people has been studied from the diagnostic perspective of DSM's psychiatric classification of mental disorders, {{with the result that}} some outstanding creative individuals may be considered to have various degrees of psychopathology. Bartlett has argued that this is not only short-sighted, but it questionably <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> the psychology of normality should serve as arbiter for mentally healthy emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive characteristics and abilities. In a group of further publications, Bartlett has described in detail how it is possible to enrich and deepen our understanding of both the psychology of creativity and the psychology of normality.|$|E
25|$|Likewise the new labour historians {{believe that}} {{the rise of the}} Knights of Labor caused the Orange and Catholic Irish in Toronto to resolve their generational hatred and set about to form a common working-class culture. This theory <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> Irish-Catholic culture was of little value, to be {{rejected}} with such ease. Nicolson (1985) argues that neither theory is valid. He says that in the ghettos of Toronto the fusion of an Irish peasant culture with traditional Catholism produced a new, urban, ethno-religious vehicle - Irish Tridentine Catholism. This culture spread from the city to the hinterland and, by means of metropolitan linkage, throughout Ontario. Privatism created a closed Irish society, and, while Irish Catholics cooperated in labour organizations for the sake of their families' future, they never shared {{in the development of a}} new working-class culture with their old Orange enemies.|$|E
25|$|Japanese scholar Miya Noriko <b>presumes</b> <b>that</b> {{the year}} 1402 was a {{landmark}} for the reigning King Taejong {{of the newly}} founded Joseon Dynasty. After a bloody succession struggle, Taejong ascended to the throne in 1400. In 1401, he was officially recognized as King of Joseon by the Chinese Emperor {{for the first time}} in the dynasty's history. In the 6th month of 1402, Yi Hoe's map of Korea was offered in a ceremony to celebrate his birthday. Then the project to combine it with Chinese and Japanese maps reportedly started in the summer (4th-6th months). This would be of symbolic significance in demonstrating royal power. This hypothesis also explains the factual error about the map of Japan. It was during the reigns of Taejo (1st king) and Jeongjong (2nd) that the map was obtained in Japan, but the date was altered to Taejong's reign.|$|E
