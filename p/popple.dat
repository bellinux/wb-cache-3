500|$|Deviating from a {{tradition}} of the Mario franchise, Superstar Sagas central antagonist is not Bowser, but the Beanish witch Cackletta. Bowser aids the protagonists {{during a period of}} the game, but Bowser's body becomes possessed by the consciousness of Cackletta to form the creature Bowletta. Cackletta is aided by the assailant Fawful, who is often characterized by his comical use of language, as evidenced by his famous quote [...] "I HAVE FURY!" [...] and who is also the antagonist in the sequel [...] Additionally, Mario and Luigi have recurring incidents with a thief named <b>Popple</b> and his sidekick Rookie (amnesiac Bowser), who engages both protagonists in conflict at various times throughout the game. In one case, <b>Popple</b> fights alone. In another, he uses Birdo instead of Rookie.|$|E
500|$|M-105 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with M-53 (Van Dyke Road) {{in the small}} community of <b>Popple,</b> just before M-53 curved east towards Bad Axe.

After solving {{numerous}} puzzles the brothers arrive too late, but the Beanstar {{is exposed to}} Peach's voice, which causes it to go berserk and flee. Mario and Luigi then battle Cackletta and defeat her. Cackletta is severely incapacitated from the battle, so Fawful sucks up her essence into his [...] "vacuum helmet" [...] to save her life. Cackletta then commands Fawful to attack, but he is stopped by Prince Peasley. The brothers locate the Beanstar but encounter <b>Popple</b> and Rookie again. After battling them, the Beanstar is again exposed to Peach's voice. The four grab onto the Beanstar {{in an effort to}} keep it under control, but it shoots into the sky. The Beanstar explodes into four pieces, which scatter across Beanbean Kingdom, and the brothers become separated from <b>Popple</b> and Bowser. Mario and Luigi backtrack after landing at Oho Oasis and obtain Firebrand and Thunderhand techniques respectively and meet Peach as she arrives in Beanbean Kingdom, who inexplicably has her own voice. They discover that Prince Peasley had learned of Cackletta's plot and warned the Princess beforehand and Birdo, disguised as Peach, had her voice stolen instead. Bowser's arrival and presence at her castle had prevented Peach from revealing the plan to Mario and Luigi. Meanwhile, Fawful imbues a weak Bowser with Cackletta's soul, resulting in the twisted Bowletta.|$|E

2500|$|Criticism of {{the play}} in {{the first decades of}} the 18th century {{continued}} to be dominated by the neoclassical conception of plot and character. Even the many critics who defended Hamlet took for granted the necessity of the classical canon in principle. Voltaire's attack on the play is perhaps the most famous neoclassical treatment {{of the play}}; it inspired numerous defenses in England, but these defenses did not at first weaken the neoclassical orthodoxy. Thus Lewis Theobald explained the seeming absurdity of Hamlet's calling death an [...] "undiscovered country" [...] not long after he has encountered the Ghost by hypothesizing that the Ghost describes Purgatory, not death. Thus William <b>Popple</b> (in 1735) praises the verisimilitude of Polonius's character, deploring the actors' tradition of playing him only as a fool. Both Joseph Addison and Richard Steele praised particular scenes: Steele the psychological insight of the first soliloquy, and Addison the ghost scene.|$|E
2500|$|In 1735, Aaron Hill sounded {{an unusual}} but prescient note when he praised the seeming contradictions in Hamlet's {{temperament}} (rather than condemning them as violations of decorum). After midcentury, such psychological readings {{had begun to}} gain more currency. Tobias Smollett criticized {{what he saw as}} the illogic of the [...] "to be or not to be" [...] soliloquy, which was belied, he said, by Hamlet's actions. More commonly, the play's disparate elements were defended as part of a grander design. Horace Walpole, for instance, defends the mixture of comedy and tragedy as ultimately more realistic and effective than rigid separation would be. Samuel Johnson echoed <b>Popple</b> in defending the character of Polonius; Johnson also doubted the necessity of Hamlet's vicious treatment of Ophelia, and he also viewed skeptically the necessity and probability of the climax. Hamlet's character was also attacked by other critics {{near the end of the}} century, among them George Steevens. However, even before the Romantic period, Hamlet was (with Falstaff), the first Shakespearean character to be understood as a personality separate from the play in which he appears.|$|E
2500|$|The team's first Princess Theatre {{show was}} an {{adaptation}} of Paul Rubens' 1905 London show, Mr. <b>Popple</b> (of Ippleton), called Nobody Home (1915). [...] The piece ran for 135 performances and was a modest financial success. [...] However, it did little to fulfill the new team's mission to innovate, except that Kern's song, [...] "The Magic Melody", was the first Broadway showtune with a basic jazz progression. [...] Kern and Bolton next created an original piece, Very Good Eddie, which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season. [...] The British humorist, lyricist and librettist P. G. Wodehouse joined the Princess team in 1917, adding his skill as a lyricist to the succeeding shows. Oh, Boy!
