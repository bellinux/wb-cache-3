5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, <b>positional</b> <b>cloning</b> (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB.

One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E

25|$|Molecular cloning {{refers to}} the process of making {{multiple}} molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes, {{but it can also be}} used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in <b>positional</b> <b>cloning.</b> In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication, which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow protein production, affinity tagging, single stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGrasses have highly {{specialized}} flowers and their outer floral organ identity remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized rice mutants that specifically disrupted {{the development of}} palea, one of the outer whorl floral organs. The depressed palea 1 (dp 1) mutants show a primary defect in the main structure of palea, implying that palea is a fusion between the main structure and marginal tissues on both sides. The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp 1 mutants. In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in dp 1 mutants at low penetration. Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA 1 (SDP 1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size. E function and presumable A function floral homeotic genes were found suppressed in the dp 1 – 2 mutant. We identified the DP 1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development.

25|$|All {{researched}} psychological {{traits are}} influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees. These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother {{in his or her}} (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior. Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studies. One goal of such research is similar to that in <b>positional</b> <b>cloning</b> and its success in Huntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic, where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder. Active research continues to understand the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} methods for detecting QTL in outbred commercial pig populations. Several QTL for back fat and growth rate, previously detected in experimental resource populations, were examined for segregation in 10 different populations. Two hundred trait-by-population-by-chromosome tests were performed, resulting in 20 tests being significant at the 5 % level. In addition, 53 QTL tests for 11 meat quality traits were declared significant, using a subset of the populations. These results show that a considerable amount of phenotypic variance observed in these populations can be explained by major alleles segregating at several of the loci described. Thus, despite a relatively strong selection pressure for growth and back fat traits in these populations, these alleles have not yet reached fixation. The approaches used here demonstrate that it is possible to verify segregation of QTL in commercial populations by limited genotyping of a selection of informative animals.

Raf. Ctv was physically mapped to a 282 -kb region using a P. trifoliata bacterial artificial chromosome library. This region was completely sequenced to about 8 × coverage using a shotgun sequencing strategy and primer walking for gap closure. Sequence analysis predicts 22 putative genes, two mutator-like transposons and eight retrotransposons. This sequence analysis also revealed some interesting features of this region of the P. trifoliata genome: a disease resistance gene cluster with seven members and eight retrotransposons clustered in a 125 -kb gene-poor region.

40|$|With the {{availability}} of dense, highly informative marker maps, it has recently become feasible to map genes (Quantitative Trait Loci or QTL) accounting {{for part of the}} heritability of continuously distributed traits in experimental crosses as well as outbred populations. QTL mapping efforts have almost invariably revealed a limited number of loci with effects of a magnitude clearly departing from the predictions of the infinitesimal model (a model introduced to facilitate mathematical treatment of quantitative traits rather than to truly reflect their underlying biology). As most experimental designs would have limited detection power, which could lead to an overestimation of the identified gene effects, interpretation of results from QTL mapping studies must be viewed with caution. However, numerous independent confirmation studies leave little doubt that most quantitative traits indeed involve a limited suite of loci with major effect. This assertion seems to hold not only for QTL mapped in crosses between divergent lines, but—more importantly—for QTL segregating in outbred populations as well (for review, see Paterson 1995). Despite the sometimes unexpected magnitude of the identified QTL effects, the lack of simple correspondence between genotype and phenotype in complex trait analysis precludes the unambiguous identification of recombinant individuals. This may limit the achievable mapping resolution of QTL, posing a serious threat to the efficacy of <b>positional</b> (candidate) <b>cloning</b> for QTL considerably.
