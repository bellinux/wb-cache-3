50|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} tandemly repeated (i.e. adjacent) DNA motifs that range in length {{from two to}} five nucleotides, and are typically repeated 5-50 times. For example, the sequence TATATATATA is a dinucleotide microsatellite, and GTCGTCGTCGTCGTC is a trinucleotide microsatellite (with A being Adenine, G Guanine, C Cytosine, and T Thymine). Repeat units of four and five nucleotides {{are referred to as}} tetra- and <b>pentanucleotide</b> motifs, respectively. Microsatellites are distributed throughout the genome. Many are located in non-coding parts of the human genome and therefore do not produce proteins, but they can also be located in regulatory regions and within the coding region.|$|E

50|$|Di- to <b>pentanucleotide</b> {{usage and}} {{the list of the}} most {{abundant}} octa- to tetradecanucleotides are useful measures of the bacterial genomic signature. The P. putida KT2440 chromosome is characterized by strand symmetry and intrastrand parity of complementary oligonucleotides. Each tetranucleotide occurs with similar frequency on the two strands. Tetranucleotide usage is biased by G+C content and physicochemical constraints such as base stacking energy, dinucleotide propeller twist angle, or trinucleotide bendability. The 105 regions with atypical oligonucleotide composition can be differentiated by their patterns of oligonucleotide usage into categories of horizontally acquired gene islands, multidomain genes or ancient regions such as genes for ribosomal proteins and RNAs. A species-specific extragenic palindromic sequence is the most common repeat in the genome that can be exploited for the typing of P. putida strains. In the coding sequence of P. putida, LLL is the most abundant tripeptide.|$|E

40|$|We have {{determined}} the complete nucleotide sequence of a 3564 bp EcoRI fragment which represents {{a major component}} of the human Y-chromosome specific repeated DNA family (DYZ 1). Sequencing result showed a tandem array of <b>pentanucleotides</b> after five nucleotides were inserted or deleted at four positions. 229 out of the 713 <b>pentanucleotides</b> were TTCCA, and 297 were its single-base substituents. Southern hybridization analyses of male genomic DNAs showed that several endonuclease cleavage sites were located at intervals of 3. 56 kb in the DYZ 1 locus. This indicates that the DYZ 1 repeated DNA family evolved and expanded by unequal crossovers which occurred at distances of 3. 56 kb. As there is a uniformly distributed array of <b>pentanucleotides</b> on this locus, it is not a sequence homology that determines the distance of unequal crossovers.

50|$|Sequences {{within the}} 3'-UTR {{also have the}} ability to degrade or {{stabilize}} the mRNA transcript. Modifications that control a transcript's stability allow expression of a gene to be rapidly controlled without altering translation rates. One group of elements in the 3'-UTR that can help destabilize an mRNA transcript are the AU-rich elements (AREs). These elements range in size from 50-150 base pairs and generally contain multiple copies of the <b>pentanucleotide</b> AUUUA. Early studies indicated that AREs can vary in sequence and fall into three main classes that differ in the number and arrangement of motifs. Another set of elements that is present in both the 5' and 3'-UTR are iron response elements (IREs). The IRE is a stem-loop structure within the untranslated regions of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in cellular iron metabolism. The mRNA transcript containing this element is either degraded or stabilized depending upon the binding of specific proteins and the intracellular iron concentrations.|$|E
40|$|Using subfragments of the {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) core origin, we {{demonstrate}} that two alternative modules {{exist for the}} assembly of T-antigen (T-ag) double hexamers. Pentanucleotides 1 and 3 and the early palindrome (EP) constitute one assembly unit, while pentanucleotides 2 and 4 and the AT-rich region constitute a second, relatively weak, assembly unit. Related studies indicate that on the unit made up of <b>pentanucleotide</b> 1 and 3 and the EP assembly unit, the first hexamer forms on <b>pentanucleotide</b> 1 and that owing to additional protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, the second hexamer is able to form on <b>pentanucleotide</b> 3. Oligomerization on the unit made up of <b>pentanucleotide</b> 2 and 4 and the AT-rich region is initiated by assembly of a hexamer on <b>pentanucleotide</b> 4; subsequent formation of the second hexamer takes place on <b>pentanucleotide</b> 2. Given that oligomerization on the SV 40 origin is limited to double-hexamer formation, {{it is likely that}} only a single module is used for the initial assembly of T-ag double hexamers. Finally, we discuss the evidence that nucleotide hydrolysis is required for the remodeling events that result in the utilization of the second assembly unit...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} {{components that}} direct high-affinity binding of simian virus 40 (SV 40) T antigen to SV 40 origin region I {{are composed of}} two recognition pentanucleotides separated by a spacer. This region has binding sites for two T-antigen monomeric units. We extended the tripartite region I sequence by one and two sets of spacers and pentanucleotides and also shortened the region by one <b>pentanucleotide.</b> Our T-antigen-binding studies with these constructs show that the protein has a strong preference for binding to an even rather than an odd number of pentanucleotides separated by spacer sequences. Gel retardation assays reveal {{that the size of}} the complex formed between the 17 -base-pair region I sequence and T antigen did not increase when the sequence was extended with one spacer-pentanucleotide sequence but did increase with two such units. DNase I footprinting and fragment assay experiments indicate that the protein did not protect a <b>pentanucleotide</b> that was not paired with another <b>pentanucleotide.</b> The unpaired <b>pentanucleotide</b> resumed its binding activity when it was paired with a spacer and another <b>pentanucleotide</b> sequence.

40|$|During {{transcription}} of {{the late}} strand of polyomavirus DNA, RNA polymerase II stalls and accumulates nearby the binding sites on viral DNA recognized by polyomavirus large T antigen. Stalling by RNA polymerases is eliminated when thermolabile large T antigen is inactivated by using a temperature-sensitive virus mutant (J. Bertin, N. -A. Sunstrom, P. Jain, and N. H. Acheson, Virology 189 : 715 - 724, 1992). To determine whether stalling by RNA polymerases is mediated through the interaction of large T antigen {{with one or more}} of its binding sites, viable polyomavirus mutants that contain altered large-T-antigen-binding sites were constructed. Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the multiple, clustered G(A/G) GGC <b>pentanucleotides</b> known to be the target sequence for large T-antigen binding. Mutation of the G(A/G) GGC <b>pentanucleotides</b> in the first two binding sites encountered by RNA polymerases in the intergenic region (sites C and B) had no detectable effect on stalling as measured by transcriptional run-on analysis. However, mutation of the two GAGGC <b>pentanucleotides</b> in binding site A, which lies adjacent to the origin of viral DNA replication, eliminated stalling by RNA polymerases. We conclude that binding of large T antigen to site A blocks elongation by RNA polymerase II. Further characterization of virus containing mutated site A did not reveal any effects on early transcription levels or on virus DNA replication. However, the mutant virus gave rise to small plaques, suggesting impairment in some stage of virus growth. Stalling of RNA polymerases by large T antigen bound to the intergenic region of viral DNA may function to prevent transcription from displacing proteins whose binding is required for the normal growth of polyomavirus...|$|R

40|$|The {{simian virus}} 40 origin of {{replication}} contains a 27 -base-pair palindrome with the sequence 5 '-CA-GAGGC-C-GAGGC-G-GCCTC-G-GCCTC-TG- 3 '. The four 5 '-GAGGC- 3 '/ 5 '-GCCTC- 3 ' pentanucleotides are known contact sites for simian virus 40 T-antigen binding in vitro. We used oligonucleotide-directed cassette mutagenesis to identify features of this palindrome that are important for the initiation of DNA replication in vivo. Each base pair of a <b>pentanucleotide</b> is crucial for DNA replication. In contrast, sequences adjacent to pentanucleotides {{have little or no}} effect on replication. Thus, the <b>pentanucleotide</b> is the basic functional unit, not only for T-antigen binding but also for DNA replication. All four pentanucleotides are indispensable in the initiation process. The spacing of pentanucleotides is crucial because duplication of the single base pair between binding sites has a far greater effect on replication than does substitution of the same base pair. Inversion of any <b>pentanucleotide</b> blocks DNA synthesis. Thus, the <b>pentanucleotide</b> is not a functionally symmetrical unit. We propose that each <b>pentanucleotide</b> positions a monomer of T antigen at the proper distance, rotation, and orientation relative to other T-antigen monomers and to other origin domains and that such positioning leads to subsequent events in replication...|$|E
40|$|Specific binding of {{simian virus}} 40 large T antigen to origin region DNA {{requires}} {{the interaction of}} T antigen with multiples of a consensus recognition <b>pentanucleotide</b> sequence (5 '-G[T]-A[G]-G-G-C- 3 ').

Methylation of {{a subset of the}} cytosine residues in the <b>pentanucleotide</b> sequences resulted in enhanced binding of T antigen to origin region DNA. Enhanced binding to the methylated pentanucleotides indicates that the methyl groups introduced on this subset of <b>pentanucleotide</b> cytosine residues could not have sterically interfered with the interaction of T antigen with the recognition sequences. This lack of steric interference suggests that T antigen does not make close contact in the major groove with these particular cytosine residues during normal binding...|$|E

40|$|A set of <b>pentanucleotides</b> was {{investigated}} by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with {{the focus on}} the fragmentation mechanism. Results reveal new aspects of the fragmentation mechanism of modified and unmodified oligonucleotides and demonstrate the influence of the nucleobases on the decomposition of oligonucleotides. Adenine-rich oligonucleotides fragment easily resulting in abundant peaks corresponding to the DNA-typical a-B- and w-ions. On the other hand, thymine was found to have a stabilizing effect, which is reflected by the preferred formation of the w 4 -ions and the relatively low abundance of shorter w-ions upon dissociation of <b>pentanucleotides.</b> Data from investigation of the formation of w 4 -ions support a β-elimination mechanism. Results obtained by investigation of oligonucleotides with an abasic site confirm this mechanism, which is independent of nucleobase loss. Experiments with methylphosphonate oligonucleotides show a remarkable change in the fragmentation pattern due to the modification. It was found that charges are located on the nucleobases and initiate the fragmentation mechanism. The stability of the oligonucleotide is reduced and no a-B-fragment ions are formed wherever there is a methylphosphonate group within the backbone. This fact also demonstrates that fragmentation is locally controlled...|$|R

The enzyme affinity for specific sequence <b>pentanucleotides</b> of the scissile (GACTT, Ki = 2 μM) and non-cleaved chain (AAGTC, Ki = 110 μM) is about 2 – 4 orders of magnitude higher than that for non-specific oligonucleotides. This specific sequence affinity increases in several cases: lengthening of single-stranded oligonucleotides, formation of stable duplexes between complementary oligonucleotides and preincubation of the enzyme with ligands before addition of supercoiled DNA.

All {{organisms that}} have been studied until now {{have been found to}} have {{differential}} distribution of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), with more SSRs in intergenic than in coding sequences.

Different from what has been found for other groups of organisms, there is an abundance of SSRs in coding regions of the genome of some Archaea. Dinucleotide repeats were rare and CG repeats were found in only two Archaea. In general, trinucleotide repeats are the most abundant SSR motifs; however, <b>pentanucleotide</b> repeats are abundant in some Archaea.

The ability of these sequences to terminate transcription was attributed to the shared <b>pentanucleotide</b> motif 3 ′-UGUCG- 5 ′. Taking advantage of our plasmid-based rescue system to generate recombinant viruses, we re-evaluated the importance of both <b>pentanucleotide</b> motifs {{as well as that}} of two other conserved sequences in transcription termination in vivo. Analysis of the 3 ′ ends of positive-stranded viral RNAs derived from the S segment revealed that only the region around the upstream <b>pentanucleotide</b> motif mediated transcription termination in cells infected with wild-type BUNV, leading to mRNAs that were about 100 nt shorter than antigenome RNA.

The L- 5 ′ UTR contained two 13 -nucleotide-long complete complementary sequences, and their sequence complementarities were important for L mRNA termination. A computer-mediated RNA secondary structure analysis further suggested that RNA secondary structures formed by the sections of the two 13 -nucleotide-long sequences and by the sequence between them may have a role in L mRNA termination.

40|$|We {{performed}} transcriptome {{sequencing of}} canine retinal tissue by 454 GS-FLX and Ion Torrent PGM platforms. RNA-Seq analysis by CLC Genomics Workbench mapped expression of 10, 360 genes. Gene ontology analysis of retinal transcriptome revealed abundance of transcripts {{known to be}} involved in vision associated processes. The de novo assembly of the sequences using CAP 3 generated 29, 683 contigs with mean length of 560. 9 and N 50 of 619 bases. Further analysis of contigs predicted 3, 827 full-length cDNAs and 29, 481 (99 %) open reading frames (ORFs). In addition, 3, 782 contigs were assigned to 316 KEGG pathways which included melanogenesis, phototransduction, and retinol metabolism with 33, 15, and 11 contigs, respectively. Among the identified microsatellites, dinucleotide repeats were 68. 84 %, followed by trinucleotides, tetranucleotides, <b>pentanucleotides,</b> and hexanucleotides in proportions of 25. 76, 9. 40, 2. 52, and 0. 96 %, respectively. This study will serve as a valuable resource for understanding the biology and function of canine retina...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The {{phenomenon}} of strand symmetry, which may provide clues to genome evolution, exists in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes studied. Several possible mechanisms for its origins have been proposed, including: no strand biases for mutation and selection, strand inversion and selection of stem-loop structures. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms to strand symmetry are not clear. In this article, we studied specifically {{the role of}} stem-loop potential of single-stranded DNA in strand symmetry. Results: We analyzed the complete genomes of 90 prokaryotes. We found that most oligonucleotides (<b>pentanucleotides</b> and higher) {{do not have a}} reverse complement in close proximity in the genomic sequences. Combined with further analysis, we conclude that the contribution of the widespread stem-loop potential of single-stranded genomic DNA to the formation and maintenance of strand symmetry would be very limited, at least for higher-order oligonucleotides. Therefore, other possible causes for strand symmetry {{must be taken into account}} to a deeper degree...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of styrene oxide with DNA components was studied using separation by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and detection by negative-ion electrospray mass spectrometry (MS). The CZE-MS interface {{was built for}} a sector field mass spectrometer. The {{reaction of}} styrene oxide with mononucleotides (dGMP, dAMP) was used to optimize the relevant separation parameters and to gather the first information about the behaviour of the possible products. With these mixtures, sample stacking procedures were developed and the scope of collision-induced dissociations were studied. From the fragments recorded, information about the reaction sites in the nucleotides was obtained. Further, the reaction with intact calf thymus DNA was investigated. The DNA was digested into oligonucleotides using the previously described approach with Benzonase, an unspecific nuclease, and alkaline phosphatase. Styrene oxide mono-adducts in dinucleotides, trinucleotides and tetranucleotides were detected, whereas <b>pentanucleotides</b> exhibit mono- and discernible amounts of di-adducts. The hexanucleotides were generally modified twice. The alkylated species moved faster than the unmodified oligomers...|$|R
