Recent development of real-time, three-dimensional (3 -D) color Doppler allows one to obtain an entire cross-sectional velocity distribution of the LVOT, which is not possible using conventional 2 -D echo. In an animal experiment, the cross-sectional color Doppler images of the LVOT at peak systole were derived and digitally transferred to a computer to visualize and quantify spatial velocity distributions and <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Markedly skewed profiles, with higher velocities toward the septum, were consistently observed. Reference <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> by electromagnetic <b>flow</b> meter correlated well with 3 -D <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> (r = 0. 94), but with an anticipated underestimation.
