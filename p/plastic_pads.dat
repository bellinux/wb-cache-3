Our analytical investigation showed that the unusual discoloration process of the flint tools {{is caused by the}} surface presence of at least three previously unknown pigmenting molecules of the triphenylmetane dyes class: 6 -(bis(2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinolin- 6 -yl) methylene) - 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 2, 6 -dihydroquinolinium and its hydrogenated derivatives 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 6 -((2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroquinolin- 6 -yl) (2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinolin- 6 -yl) methylene) - 2, 6 -dihydroquinolinium and 6 -(bis(2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroquinolin- 6 -yl) methylene) - 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 2, 6 -dihydroquinolinium. The peculiar formation of the molecules is possibly catalyzed within the silica pore surface starting from a well-known rubber stabilizer 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinoline released by the <b>plastic</b> <b>pads</b> flooring the storing cabinets.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{environmental}} control practices and problems for greenhouses in Saudi Arabia was conducted. The data were collected in Riyadh, Qaseem and Eastern regions {{during the period of}} September 2003 to May 2004. The study was carried out on greenhouses covering approximately an area of 443 ha. Theo¬retical analysis were made to evaluate the performance of ventilation and cooling system for common greenhouses designs. The results showed that most of surveyed greenhouses were Quonset-style structure with lengths ranging from 30 m to 56 m, and a width of 9 m. Gutter-connected structures is the second popular houses design, which can be either ridge-and- furrow or arch-roof with lengths ranging from 110 m to 150 m, and widths ranging from 35 m to 40 m. All gutter-connected greenhouses were evaporatively cooled by fan and pad system, while Quonset-style houses were either naturally or mechanically ventilated. Galvanized metal were commonly used to build frame of greenhouses. Three types of covering materials were used including polyethylene, glass and fiberglass. The result indicated that most of greenhouses in Riyadh region were evaporatively cooled during summer period by fan and pad system, whereas most greenhouses in Qaseem and Eastern regions were naturally ventilated. Ventilation rates for each fan were between 40000 and 44000 m 3 /hr. Fans were either manually or automatically operated. Fans operation were based on air temperature inside greenhouses. It was found that in some farms, fans were switched off during night to save electrical energy consumption. The average distance between cooling pads and fans was 39. 5 m. The results showed that there were three types of pad materials; they are cross-fluted cellulose pads, excel¬sior (wood fiber), <b>plastic</b> <b>pads</b> and palm dates fiber pads. During periods of high solar radiation, greenhouse shading was commonly used. Several shading systems are used by many greenhouse growers including: white shading mix¬ture sprayed on the exterior greenhouse covering and variable shading (internal or external) using different materials such as plastic nets rated at 20 % to 80 % shading. Another approach for reducing greenhouses overheating during summer was to spray water droplets in greenhouses by low- or high-pressure systems. Summer air exchange rates were ranged from 1. 21 to 1. 84 air changes per minute (ACM), which was higher than the recommended rate of 0. 75 to 1. 0 ACM. Greenhouses in Qaseem have the lowest predicted inside air temperature, while greenhouses in Dhah¬ran have the highest predicted inside air temperature. Greenhouses in Dhahran have the highest predicted inside relative humidity, while the lowest values were predicted in Riyadh. Predicted temperatures and relative humid¬ities inside the greenhouses were in the permissible ranges for good production practice of greenhouse crops. Shade was predicted to reduce air temperature, and to increase relative humidity inside the greenhouses. Results showed that naturally ventilated greenhouses were Quonset structure with lengths ranging from 30 m to 56 rn, and width of 9 m. The common method for natural ventilation was done by opening doors and roof vents between poly¬ethylene cover. The results indicated that 61 %, 31 % and 26 % of greenhouses in Riyadh, Qaseem and Eastern regions, respectively, were heated during winter. Heating system were of two types; Diesel burning heaters and water heating pipes. Some major obstacles of greenhouses environment control were salt precipitation and dust accumulation in the cooling pad, non-uniform temperature in the greenhouse, low efficiency of cooling and heating systems, and high costs of covering materials. Some recommendations to improve the performance of the environmental con¬trol systems for greenhouses were presented...|$|E
40|$|Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) is a high-precision {{radiotherapy}} technique {{based on}} the use of a multi-leaf collimator, placed at the output of the accelerator. The modulation is adapted to the patient's anatomical structures and obtained by leaves movement during the beam administration. To ensure that the delivered fluence is consistent with the expected one, a control is necessary. In clinical routine, this control isn't achieved on the patient, but on a phantom, before the beginning of the treatment New emerging solutions make possible an online control, done during the treatment of the patient. They can be divided into three classes: those which use data acquired by the accelerator, those which exploit the portal imager and those which use a dedicated detector placed at the exit of the head of the accelerator, upstream of the patient. The thesis work presented here relate {{to the development of a}} detector of this third class, Tradera (Transparent Detector for Radiotherapy). The choice was made to use a segmented plane ionization chamber. The first phase of the project was to design the detector thanks to studies made by Monte Carlo simulations. For this it was necessary to model the photon beam. The choice of a point source of photons, quick to set up, has been retained. The characteristics of the particles at the detector input obtained with our model were compared with those obtained with a more complex model: a phase space obtained from the database of the IAEA. Once the model validated, Geant 4 code was used to size the various elements of our detector. A innovative geometry has been proposed. It consists in introducing material in the sensitive volume of the detector to limit the lateral travel of the electrons from the interaction of photons, and thus improve the spatial resolution of the detector. In practice, a checkerboard with <b>plastic</b> <b>pads</b> is introduced in the sensitive volume. The benefit of this solution has been shown by simulations. The second phase was to assess a prototype in a clinical beam with radiation equipment and test the performance of various associated acquisition electronics. For a long time, reading was made at the output of a single channel at a time. First, a picoammeter was used to measure the average output current. Then the ionization current has been studied at the time scale of a pulse of the beam, allowing the development of a charge preamplifier dedicated to our application. This charge preamplifier permit to know, for a single beam pulse, the electrical charge measured by one channel of the prototype with a uncertainty of 5 %, and thus makes it possible to study the evolution of the charge pulse as a function of irradiation time. Once the choice of this readout electronics was validated, the charge preamplifier was realized in small series : the acquisition in multi-channels on an area of ​​ 3 cm square was possible. The first beam images could then be obtained for static and dynamic beam. La Radiothérapie Conformationnelle avec Modulation d'Intensité (RCMI), aussi dénommée IMRT, est une technique avancée de radiothérapie de haute précision qui repose sur l'utilisation d'un collimateur multi-lames, placé en sortie de l'accélérateur, dont les lames vont se déplacer pendant la séance d'irradiation afin de produire un faisceau d'intensité modulée, adaptée à la forme des structures anatomiques du patient. Un tel dispositif permet d'obtenir une répartition de dose homogène dans le volume cible et d'épargner au mieux les tissus sains environnants 1, ouvrant la voie à l'escalade de dose et donc à l'amélioration des résultats thérapeutiques. Néanmoins, la mise en œuvre d'une telle technique nécessite la réalisation d'un contrôle du système de délivrance de la dose de manière à s'assurer que la fluence délivrée par l'appareil de traitement est bien conforme à la fluence attendue...|$|E

The electric current oscillates between the active electrode and the dispersive electrode with the entire patient interposed between the two. Since the concentration of the RF current reduces with distance from the active electrode the current density rapidly (quadratically) decreases. Since the rate of tissue heating is proportional to the square of current density, the heating occurs in a very localized region, only near the portion of the electrode, usually the tip, near to or in contact with the target tissue.|$|R
