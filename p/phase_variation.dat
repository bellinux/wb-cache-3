25|$|The genome {{of strain}} MC58 (serogroup B) has 2,272,351-base pairs. When sequenced in 2000, {{it was found}} to contain 2158 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, a {{biological}} function was predicted for 1158 (53.7%). There were three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved in pathogenicity. The third island only codes for hypothetical proteins. They also found more genes that undergo <b>phase</b> <b>variation</b> than any pathogen then known. <b>Phase</b> <b>variation</b> is a mechanism that helps the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{birefringence}} Δn {{may vary}} slightly due to dispersion, this is negligible {{compared to the}} variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (λ0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured {{to work for a}} particular range of wavelengths. The <b>phase</b> <b>variation</b> can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the fast axis of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a quarter-wave plate, one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one-fourth plus an integer. This is called a zero-order waveplate.|$|E
2500|$|To {{retrieve}} the phase shift {{out of the}} interference patterns; a technique called phase-stepping or fringe scanning is used: a phase shifter (with {{the shape of a}} wedge) is introduced in the reference beam. The phase shifter creates straight interference fringes with regular intervals; so called carrier fringes. When the sample is placed in the other beam, the carrier fringes are displaced. The phase shift caused by the sample corresponds to the displacement of the carrier fringes. Several interference patterns are recorded for different shifts of the reference beam and by analyzing them the phase information modulo 2 can be extracted. This ambiguity of the phase is called the phase wrapping effect and can be removed by so-called [...] "phase unwrapping techniques". These techniques can be used when the signal-to-noise ratio of the image is sufficiently high and <b>phase</b> <b>variation</b> is not too abrupt.|$|E
40|$|The {{far-field}} spatial {{distributions of}} high-order harmonics in an ionized medium {{have been investigated}} using a computer model that includes both the single atom effects and the collective effects of the medium. The results show that depletion of the non-linear medium due to ionization and radial <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> across the gas jet cause broadening and complicated structures in the far-field spatial distributions. These <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> are due to three factors: focusing, ionization, i. e. depletion of the non-linear medium and electron dispersion, and intensity-dependent <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> of the atomic dipoles...|$|R
30|$|Summing up {{the results}} {{presented}} in this section, various <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> were identified in the region containing and surrounding the pn-junction of two different solar cells, e.g., <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> were located in the ZnO layer, whose positions correlate with the transition between the differently doped layers i-ZnO and ZnO:Al. Further, <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> at the ZnO/CdS/CIGS interface region and in CIGS were observed. Comparing the two CIGS layers of different Cu content, slightly different <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> were observed, i.e., the phase image of the Cu-poor CIGS revealed additional, disordered short-range variations. However, {{the difference between the}} two CIGS layers is most probably related to compositional changes and not mainly to electronic inhomogeneities. Cu-poor growth conditions not only affect the GGI variation in CIGS but may also enhance the growth of smaller, disordered grains below the CIGS/CdS interface. Thus, these differences do not necessarily reflect changes in electronic properties, but rather depend on Δ MIP and diffraction effects.|$|R
40|$|An active {{wide-band}} {{fiber optic}} frequency distribution system employing a thermally controlled phase compensator to stabilize <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> induced by environmental temperature changes is described. The distribution system utilizes bidirectional dual wavelength transmission to provide optical feedback of induced <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> of 100 MHz signals propagating along the distribution cable. The phase compensation considered differs from earlier narrow-band phase compensation designs {{in that it}} uses a thermally controlled fiber delay coil rather than a VCO or phase modulation to compensate for induced <b>phase</b> <b>variations.</b> Two advantages of the wide-band system over earlier designs are (1) that it provides phase compensation for all transmitted frequencies, and (2) the compensation is applied after the optical interface rather than electronically ahead of it as in earlier schemes. Experimental results on the first prototype shows that the thermal stabilizer reduces <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> and Allan deviation {{by a factor of}} forty over an equivalent uncompensated fiber optic distribution system...|$|R

50|$|In biology, <b>Phase</b> <b>variation</b> is {{a method}} for dealing with rapidly varying environments without {{requiring}} random mutation. It involves the variation of protein expression, frequently in an on-off fashion, within different parts of a bacterial population. As such the phenotype can switch at frequencies that are much higher (sometimes >1%) than classical mutation rates. <b>Phase</b> <b>variation</b> contributes to virulence by generating heterogeneity. Although it has been most commonly studied {{in the context of}} immune evasion, it is observed in many other areas as well and is employed by various types of bacteria, including Salmonella species.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{interactions}} of {{a beam of}} hard and spatio-temporally coherent X-rays with a soft-matter sample primarily induce a transverse distribution of exit <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> delta phi (retardations or advancements in pieces of the wave front exiting the object compared to the incoming wave front) whose free-space propagation over a distance z gives rise to intensity contrast g(z). For single-distance image detection and vertical bar delta phi vertical bar 0 and dynamically unbroken up to vertical bar delta phi vertical bar similar to 1, suggests a filtering of gz in Fourier space, preserving non-iterative quasi-linear phase retrieval for <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> up to order unity if induced by multi-scale objects inducing <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> delta phi of a broad spatial frequency spectrum.

40|$|A current problem {{encountered}} in holographic interferometry systems is the <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> {{that arise from}} vibrations, {{from the use of}} optical fiber in one arm, by air convection or by unwanted movement between the object and the measurement device. The holographic device developed by CSL based on photorefractive BSO crystals has the advantage of high resolution fringes with the capability of self-processing and indefinite reusability. The weakness of the technique is a response time that is often slow compared to external perturbations. For applications outside the laboratory, we decided to find solutions adapted to the holographic camera and which tend to limit or to eliminate the effect of such <b>phase</b> <b>variations.</b> An error signal is measured from one or another technique which measure the <b>phase</b> <b>variations</b> and which counteracts on an active element in the interferometer to stabilize the phase during recording. Different solutions have been analysed and are presented here. Interferograms were obtained with and without implementation of the phase control system that show the interest of such approach.
