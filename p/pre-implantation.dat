25|$|Sex {{selection}} is {{the attempt to}} control the sex of offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post-implantation of an embryo, {{as well as at}} birth. <b>Pre-implantation</b> techniques include PGD, but also sperm sorting.|$|E
25|$|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis: Genetic testing {{procedures}} that are performed on human embryos {{prior to the}} implantation {{as part of an}} in vitro fertilization procedure. <b>Pre-implantation</b> testing is used when individuals try to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. Eggs from the woman and sperm from the man are removed and fertilized outside the body to create multiple embryos. The embryos are individually screened for abnormalities, and the ones without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-implantation</b> genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD or PIGD) {{refers to the}} genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. PGD is considered {{in a similar fashion}} to prenatal diagnosis. When used to screen for a specific genetic disease, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to assisted reproductive technology, and requires in vitro fertilization (IVF) to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Usually, the {{diagnosis}} of ADPKD is initially performed by renal imaging using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. However, molecular diagnostics can be necessary in the following situations: 1- when a definite diagnosis is required in young individuals, such as a potential living related donor in an affected family with equivocal imaging data; 2- in patients with a negative family history of ADPKD, because of potential phenotypic overlap with several other kidney cystic diseases; 3- in families affected by early-onset polycystic kidney disease, since in this cases hypomorphic alleles and/or oligogenic inheritance can be involved; and 4- in patients requesting genetic counseling, especially in couples wishing a <b>pre-implantation</b> genetic diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The Yeshiva University Medical Ethics Society (MES), is an {{undergraduate}} student-run organization of Yeshiva University {{which was founded}} by students {{in the fall of}} 2005 {{with the help of the}} Center for the Jewish Future toward the goal of promoting education and awareness of Jewish medical ethics in the university itself and the community at large. Since that time, MES working with the CJF has grown from a small group of students with common interests to running events with university-wide participation. In the first several years, they hosted a program of on-campus lectures by experts in the field of medical ethics and Halakha (Jewish law). Topics covered have included stem cell research, cloning, do not resuscitate orders, genetic testing, <b>pre-implantation</b> genetic diagnosis, and birth control. They also host genetic testing events to help combat the high incidence of various genetic diseases in the Jewish community. The Society hosts events throughout the year, including an annual conference focused on a chosen medical ethics topic. The events are open to all those who have an interest in learning more about Jewish medical ethics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pre-implantation</b> {{blastocyst}} {{development is}} a controlled cascade of gene regulation and intercellular signaling. Extracellular perlecan has been observed at the blastocyst stage of mouse embryonic development, specifically upregulated at the point when the embryo reaches “attachment competence”. This finding was upheld at both the mRNA level and the protein level, shown by RT-PCR and immunostaining. Later embryonic development is just as precisely regulated as <b>pre-implantation</b> development, and is more complicated due to differentiation of all tissues. The first study of perlecan expression during embryonal development found that the protein was first expressed during development of the cardiovascular system, and later correlates with maturation {{of the majority of}} tissues in the body, i.e. separation of epithelial layers from endothelia and stroma by basement membranes. Again, this upregulation during cardiovascular development is concomitant with the role of perlecan's C-terminus as endorepellin.|$|E

50|$|In addition, it {{is quite}} {{plausible}} for anxiety expression to manifest. Individuals may experience <b>pre-implantation</b> feelings of fear and nervousness. To this end, individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness, particularly in a socialized setting, due to their post-operative, technologically augmented bodies, and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion.

50|$|After {{fertilization}} the paternal {{and maternal}} genomes {{are once again}} demethylated and remethylated (except for differentially methylated regions associated with imprinted genes).

50|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ES cells) are {{pluripotent}} stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, an early-stage preimplantation embryo. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4-5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50-150 cells. Isolating the embryoblast or inner cell mass (ICM) results in destruction of the blastocyst, which raises ethical issues, including whether or not embryos at the <b>pre-implantation</b> stage should be considered {{to have the same}} moral or legal status as embryos in the post-implantation stage of development.|$|E
50|$|In {{medicine}} and (clinical) genetics <b>pre-implantation</b> genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) (also known as embryo screening) is a procedure performed on embryos prior to implantation, sometimes even on oocytes prior to fertilization.

The IVF procedure is {{carried out by the}} removal of one or two cells when the embryo is at a specific stage in development. The PGD uses the IVF technique to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation of the organism's genome.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{inheritance}} of CMTX, affected males will pass the GJB1 gene mutation to all female children and none of their male children, whilst females who are carriers will have a 50% chance of passing on the mutation to each of their offspring. [...] With the development of genetic testing, it is possible to perform both prenatal and <b>pre-implantation</b> testing elected by the patient, when their type of mutation has been identified. Results from genetic testing can then be used to prevent the transmission of this disease to their offspring.|$|E
50|$|If {{both parents}} are {{carriers}} of a BRCA mutation, then <b>pre-implantation</b> genetic diagnosis is sometimes {{used to prevent}} {{the birth of a}} child with BRCA mutations. Inheriting two BRCA1 mutations (one from each parent) has never been reported and is believed to be a lethal birth defect. Inheriting one BRCA1 mutation and one BRCA2 mutation has been reported occasionally; the child's risk for any given type of cancer is the higher risk of the two genes (e.g., the ovarian cancer risk from BRCA1 and the pancreatic cancer risk from BRCA2). Inheriting two BRCA2 mutations produces Fanconi anemia.|$|E
