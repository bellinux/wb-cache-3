40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to clarify the changes of agriculture in mountainous regions under the Common Agricaltural Policy (CAP) by focusing on the relationship between farm management and agricultural policy in the mountainous regions of France. In particular, a composition of income from subsidies that accounted for the total agricultural income and an investigation on the perspectives of farm households were emphasized. Since the 1960 s, structural policy has differentiated between dairy husbandry management and other Mézenc operations, decreased the agricultural population, increased the number of corporation management companies, and increased productivity by agricultural production engineering and the breed improvement of livestock and grain. Meanwhile, production control policy promoted management differentiation between dairy farmers of Mézenc and diversified management types by <b>preferential</b> <b>measures</b> for beef cattle and sheep. As for agricultural income, it was clarified that the dependence of beef cattle farmers and farmers of mixed sheep on subsidies was high because of payment for the number of livestock and because dairy farmers who could not receive payment connected directly to production were disadvantaged in receiving a subsidy. However, it was clarified that cross-compliance (environment compliance rules) for subsidy requirements increased the burden of farm households and, as a result, decreased the motivation for farming operations; hence, there exists a backlash against the system and the government...|$|R

Additional insights may be derived by data integration and cross-platform comparisons of expression profiles. However, database meta-analysis is complicated by differences in experimental technologies, data post-processing, database formats, and inconsistent gene and sample annotation. Results We have analysed expression profiles from three public databases: Gene Expression Atlas, SAGEmap and TissueInfo. These are repositories of oligonucleotide microarray, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and Expressed Sequence Tag human gene expression data respectively. We devised a method, <b>Preferential</b> Expression <b>Measure,</b> to identify genes that are significantly over- or under-expressed in any given tissue. We examined intra- and inter-database consistency of <b>Preferential</b> Expression <b>Measures.</b> There was good correlation between replicate experiments of oligonucleotide microarray data, but there was less coherence in expression profiles as measured by Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and Expressed Sequence Tag counts. We investigated inter-database correlations for six tissue categories, for which data {{were present in the}} three databases. Significant positive correlations were found for brain, prostate and vascular endothelium but not for ovary, kidney, and pancreas. Conclusion We show that data from Gene Expression Atlas, SAGEmap and TissueInfo can be integrated using the UniGene gene index, and that expression profiles correlate relatively well when large numbers of tags are available or when tissue cellular composition is simple. Finally, in the case of brain, we demonstrate that when PEM values show good correlation, predictions of tissue-specific expression based on integrated data are very accurate. </p...|$|R
40|$|The year 1990 {{not only}} marks the twenty-seventh year of Sarawak {{securing}} her independence within Malaysia, but also signals {{the ending of}} the twenty long years of the implementation of an affirmative action called the New Economic Policy. The policy was primarily conceived to provide the indigenous people with a wider opportunity to participate in trade and industry. So far, however, the available statistics do not convince the author that the policy has achieved the desired objective, at least in Sarawak. Scholars are divided on the importance of the influence of culture and structure on the entrepreneurial success or failure of a particular group, and therefore on the varying policy implications produced therefrom. This study explored the problems and entrepreneurial nature of the indigenous businesses in Sarawak, and has shown that their economic backwardness is attributed more to the structural factors than to the cultural ones. This thesis defines its scope through the historical analysis and empirical investigation of the persistent underachievement of the indigenous business as compared to those of other ethnic groups in Sarawak. The study has not only unveiled the problems of Bumiputra small businesses in Sarawak, but has also outlined some policy recommendations.

These SSA countries have experienced tremendous growth in the clothing industry mainly because of AGOA duty-free benefits, but also due to advantageous exchange rates with the US dollar. However, on 31 December 2004, the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA), the quota system that restricted Chinese exports to developed countries ended, freeing China and other large producers from binding quotas. Dire predictions were made {{about the end of}} the clothing industry in SSA, which accounted for 3 % of global garment exports in 2004. The winners would be China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, where global garment production would concentrate. Indeed, eight factories in Lesotho have closed, leaving 5, 800 unemployed. Their closure has been attributed to a lack of orders as retailers source their garments elsewhere and to the appreciation of the Rand against the dollar. With layoffs at other factories, the total number of jobs lost is 10, 700.

Preferences over goals in the goal model are then used to specify criteria for selecting alternatives that fit specific contexts, situations and strategies.

Nevertheless, to be amenable to such automated processing, goals and preferences need to be specified in a formal language, making automated processing inaccessible to the very bearers of goals and preferences, i. e., the stakeholders.

40|$|Professor Reichman uncovers {{a paradox}} {{at the heart}} of the debate about {{bringing}} international intellectual property relations within a GATT Code of Conduct. On the one hand, the industrialized countries that subscribe to free-market principles at home want to impose a highly regulated market for intellectual goods on the rest of the world, one in which authors and inventors may 2 ̆ 2 reap where they have sown. 2 ̆ 2 On the other hand, the developing countries that restrict free competition at home envision a totally unregulated world market for intellectual goods, one in which 2 ̆ 2 competition is the lifeblood of commerce. 2 ̆ 2 To unravel this paradox, he identifies a set of postulates for negotiators on both sides. Included in this list is the lack of an international norm against misappropriation; a long-term need to assimilate intangible alien property to the international law of state responsibility; the duty to respect soveriegn rights of both rich and poor states to control their own economic destinies; and the emergence of preferential treatment for developing countries as a principle of international economic law. Armed with these postulates, Professor Reichman derives a set of analytical propositions to guide a TRIPs negotiation conducted in the spirit of cooperation and good faith. A crucial move in this analysis is to distinguish between defensive proposals to institute transitional legal barriers to imports of nonqualifying intellectual goods and offensive proposals to establish universal standards of protection that could limit the development strategies even of states that do not export intellectual goods to major markets. As regards proposals for a defensive alliance bolstered by common border control measures and by the dispute settlement machinery of the GATT, Professor Reichman offers a new interpretation of Article XX(d) that minimizes conflict with the basic GATT disciplines. However, Contracting Parties that participate in a defensive alliance must strictly respect their obligations to provide national treatment under the Paris, Berne, and Geneva (U. C. C) Conventions, and they may find the transaction costs of implementing the scheme too high in the end. As regards offensive proposals that pit universal standards of protection against national developmental strategies, Professor Reichman finds that basic GATT rules cannot be overcome unless <b>preferential</b> <b>measures</b> favoring the developing counties are combined with trade concessions off-setting the costs of economic dislocation. Given such an approach, Professor Reichman suggests that Contracting Parties that already adhere to intellectual property conventions can be persuaded to provid adequate, not maximum, levels of protection for the traditional subject matters of those Conventions, and they should renounce systematic misappropriation of applied scientific know-how. Contracting Parties that do not adhere to one or more intellectual property conventions pose a harder case, but Professor Reichman argues that these states cannot expect indefintely to exploit the most valuable alien property of all without paying compensation in one form or another. Professor Reichman fears, however that maximalist illusions will cause the Uruguay Round to produce fewer positive results than could have been attained in a spirit of moderation and compromise. He warns thet continued insistence on universalist these unacceptable to the developing countries risks provoking these countries to form a 2 ̆ 2 Union 2 ̆ 2 of their own in order to curtail rights that the industrialized countries currently enjoy under existing intellectual property conventions. He points out that the real losers in such a confrontation would be those authors, inventors and trademark proprietors whose livelihood depends on the day-to-day operations of the international system that the Paris and Berne Conventions set in place over a century ago...|$|R

Four small adjacent watersheds draining into a riparian wetland and first-order stream at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD are being studied with this protocol. The spatial location of some preferential flow pathways for chemicals exiting these agricultural watersheds to the neighboring ecosystems have been identified.

This {{dissertation}} {{takes as}} its subject the national system of college preparatory classes (yuke ban) for ethnic minority students in China, provided {{on the basis}} of ‘preferential policy’ measures. The measures are implemented to address educational and economic disparities and to incorporate minority students from rural, autonomous areas into the system of Chinese higher education. The primary focus of this study is not the specifics of policy itself, but rather how policy is understood in the domain in which it is operational, and how it attains its own logic. This approach to policy is not from the viewpoint of the policy makers, but rather from the viewpoint of the policy affected. Based on fieldwork conducted in Qinghai province, an area that forms a Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Muslim crossroads, I lay out two levels at which the preparatory program operates: 1) the level of rhetoric about the program and 2) the level of external reality in which the policy is implemented. At the level of rhetoric, a tautologous rationale, which does not acknowledge structural discrimination or differentiate between Han and other ethnic groups, presents education as a composite and arbitrary set of skills which are deemed to be of cultural value; students who do not have or do not acquire such skills are construed to be less educated. On another level, however, institutional discourse comes up for challenge at the level of locally-specific enactments. Resolution with institutional models is still elusive in minority autonomous spaces, and zones of contradiction open up. In this dissertation, I argue that the <b>preferential</b> policy <b>measures</b> function to address contradictions that are concealed at the level of rhetoric...|$|R

There {{is a tremendous}} progress in both the scientific understanding and applications of self-assemblies of single-type identical particles. Forming superstructures in which the colloidal particles occupy predesigned sites and remain in these sites despite thermal fluctuations represents a major challenge of the current state-of-the art. Here we propose a versatile approach to direct placement of colloids using nematic liquid crystals with spatially varying molecular orientation pre-imposed by substrate photoalignment. Colloidal particles in nematic environment {{are subject to the}} long-range elastic forces originating in the orientational order of the nematic. Gradients of the orientational order create an elastic energy landscape that drives the colloids into locations with preferred type of deformations. As an example, we demonstrate that colloidal spheres with perpendicular surface anchoring are driven into the regions of maximum splay, while spheres with tangential surface anchoring settle into the regions of bend. Elastic forces responsible for <b>preferential</b> placement are <b>measured</b> by exploring overdamped dynamics of the colloids. Control of colloidal self-assembly through patterned molecular orientation opens new opportunities for design of materials and devices in which particles should be placed in pre-designed locations...|$|R

In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Article 8 of the Charter must be regarded as a source of authority for reasonable efforts to improve the status of women. It would be anomalous indeed if this unsatisfactory history had to remain unremedied for an unduly long period. Unless affirmative action measures are taken towards ameliorating the effects of this past history, they will, without doubt, be perpetuated for many years. This is incompatible with the objectives of Article 8, as recognized by the General Assembly.

[...] The Tribunal added that, [...] "as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable <b>measure,</b> <b>preferential</b> treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates; obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior". The Tribunal, however, cautioned that affirmative action, however laudable, did not justify any weakening of the requirements of Article 101 (3) of the Charter that officials of the Organization be of [...] "the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity": [...] "In evaluating the reasonableness of affirmative action measures, pertinent provisions of the Charter may not be ignored.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{investigated}} the body composition and prevalence of hypertension in maroon women from the State of Alagoas and compared these variables with those of non-maroon women from the same state. METHODS: The {{data were collected from}} two cross-sectional surveys done in 2005 and 2008. The first study included a representative sample of mothers of children aged 0 to 5 years from the State of Alagoas, and the second study included all women aged 18 to 60 years living in maroon communities (n= 39) in the same state. Data were collected during home interviews. The prevalence ratio and respective 95 % confidence interval given by the Poisson regression with robust adjustment of variance was used as the measure of association. RESULTS: The study assessed 1, 631 maroon women and 1, 098 non-maroon mothers. Maroon women had lower education level, more children, higher prevalence of hypertension and stunting, and higher age at menarche, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and waist-to-hip ratio. After adjustment for age, the following prevalences remained higher in maroon women: hypertension (PR= 1. 81; 95 %CI: 1. 49; 2. 21), WC > 80 cm (PR= 1. 23 95 %CI: 1. 11; 1. 37), WHtR > 0. 5 (PR= 1. 11; 95 %CI: 1. 02; 1. 21), and WHR > 0. 85 (PR= 1. 64; 95 %CI: 1. 43; 1. 88).

40|$|Key Findings and Policy Suggestions While {{much of the}} {{discussion}} on economic transformation centres on transforming agriculture and moving into manufacturing, services are an underexplored component of economic transformation strategies. Services {{play a vital role}} in economic transformation and job creation in poor countries, but the effects are different from those in agriculture or manufacturing. Services affect developing countries, directly in the form of significant shares in gross domestic product, trade and foreign exchange, but also indirectly through productivity growth and enabling linkages with other sectors. Trade in services can support economic transformation. Notable examples of successful expansion of trade in services include the development of diversified financial services hubs in Kenya, health and business tourism in Mauritius, information and communication technology services in India, air transport in Ethiopia, and hydropower transmission services in Lesotho. Donors should focus more on enhancing their knowledge and understanding the relevance of a competitive services sector for the achievement of development goals, specifically through economic transformation and job creation. They can do this by supporting improvements in market intelligence, trade and regulatory data related to services; developing national export strategies in services; building a conducive policy environment in developing countries, including by setting up public-private dialogue and coalitions supporting services reform; and strengthening country capacity to collect data on services. The lack of quality data is a particular hindrance to policy-making in the area of services. Some data have begun to be available, including through recent support by donors, but further improvements on trade in services should focus on: -capturing all the modes of trade in services; -tracking south-south trade in services; -reconciling firm-level and national-level data; and -improving information on applied services policies. Trade policy is important. Openness leads to higher productivity in services firms, especially in least developed countries (LDCs), especially with appropriate domestic regulation. International negotiations in services can also support services trade in the poorest countries, including by giving preferential access to LDC exports (for example, facilitating market access by reducing the cost of visas and putting in place domestic support mechanisms to assist LDC providers to deal with administrative requirements). However, very few meaningful <b>preferential</b> trade <b>measures</b> have so far been offered in areas of comparative advantage of LDCs such as tourism, travel, construction and Mode 4. Aid for Trade for services is generally limited as a share of total aid. Targeting more aid to facilitate trade in services has great potential to be effective. Chapter Abstract: The promotion of economic transformation and economy-wide productivity and employment effects in services requires the availability of reliable and consistent data on at least the macro dimensions of services – output, employment, trade – to enable successful monitoring of any aid efforts towards this end.

We first identified HIV- 1 strains that were intrinsically resistant to inhibition by AMD 3100 through use of the drug-bound coreceptor. Chimeric constructs of drug resistant and sensitive Env proteins showed that {{for two of the}} resistant viruses, DH 12 and TYBE, the V 1 /V 2 loop of Env was necessary and sufficient to confer AMD 3100 resistance. Chimeras between CXCR 4 and CXCR 2 showed that only the AMD 3100 resistant viruses were able to interact and fuse through the N-terminal domain of CXCR 4. Since differential CXCR 4 domain use could alter primary cell targeting, CD 4 + T cells were infected with TYBE in the presence and absence of AMD 3100. In the presence of the drug, central memory T cells (TCM) were preferentially infected in all donors tested. This trend was seen using replication competent virus as well as pseudotypes. As a potential explanation of this <b>preferential</b> targeting, we <b>measured</b> the exposure of the CXCR 4 N-terminus on the various subsets, since it is this domain that is utilized by TYBE in the presence of drug. We found that the TCM subset not only had the highest expression of CXCR 4 but the best exposure of the N-terminus. This preferential infection is troubling as the infection and eventual destruction of this subset has been shown to correlate with an advanced rate of progression to AIDS. Taken together, this data suggests that differential coreceptor use, perhaps through coreceptor antagonist resistance, could lead to an altered primary cell tropism that would be detrimental to HIV-infected patients in the long run. These observations {{must be taken into account}} when considering the development and use of novel anti-HIV strategies that involve blockade of CXCR 4. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{agricultural}} grassland soils have inherently {{high rates}} of net nitrogen (N) mineralization, they often have soil concentrations of soluble organic N that are comparable to inorganic N. We set out to examine in situ the significance of organic N for plant nutrition in grasslands of differing management intensity and soil fertility. Using in situ dual-labeling techniques (glycine- 2 - 13 C- 15 N) we <b>measured</b> <b>preferential</b> uptake of amino-acid N vs. inorganic N [(15 NH 4) 2 SO 4] in early and late season in low-productivity Agrostis capillaris–Festuca ovina grassland and in agriculturally improved, high-productivity Lolium perenne-dominated grassland. The dominant soluble-N form differed greatly between grasslands. Inorganic N (especially nitrate N) dominated the soluble N pool of the highly productive improved grassland whereas amino acid N was the dominant soluble N form in the low-productivity unimproved grassland. There {{was no difference in}} the amount of 15 N taken up by plants from the two N forms in either grassland. However, our data indicate that amino-acid N was taken up directly by plants of both grasslands and that more N was captured in this way by plants of low-productivity grassland where amino acids were the dominant soluble N form in soil. Our data from both grasslands also indicate significant microbial competition for added 15 N from both N sources, but especially in the low-productivity grassland where the bulk of 15 N added was sequestered by the microbial biomass. A significantly greater amount of added 15 N was captured by the microbial biomass in the unimproved than in the improved grassland, and substantially more 15 N was detected in the microbial biomass than in plant tissue in the unimproved grassland. On the basis of our findings, we predict that subsequent microbial turnover and release of this N into the plant–soil system is the major pathway for plant N capture in these temperate grasslands. Microbial sequestration of added N might be an important mechanism of N retention in these grasslands, especially in the low-productivity systems where microbial N sink strength is greater and organic matter slowly accumulates...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} empirical {{investigation is}} carried out to ascertain the import-reducing effect of trade protection barriers. We first present a statistical summary {{of the status of}} global trade protection. Then, based on a monopolistic competition trade model and 1994 cross-country data on trade barriers, trade flows, and production, we estimate the import-reducing effect of trade barriers including both tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). We use the disaggregated cross-country, cross-industry data on manufactured goods and, unlike previous studies, our sample covers a broad range of countries-more than 70 in total-including countries from the most developed ones like those in the Group of Seven to the least developed one, Bangladesh. We specify an empirical model that captures the stylized facts well and helps generate sensible estimates. Our econometric framework is designed to control for the simultaneous determination of trade flows, trade barriers, and production. We find that both tariff and NTBs are quite significant in restricting imports.
