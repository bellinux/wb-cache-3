5|$|In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School {{was opened}} to train navigators for both fishing boats and {{merchant}} ships. It {{is now the}} only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003. The private school Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} Pokémon games, Black and White both {{follow a}} linear storyline; the main events {{occur in a}} fixed order. The protagonist of Pokémon Black and White is a teenager who sets out on a journey through Unova to become the Pokémon master. At {{the beginning of the}} games, the player chooses either Snivy, Tepig, or Oshawott as their starter Pokémon as a gift from Professor Juniper. The protagonist's friends, Cheren and Bianca, are also rival Pokémon Trainers who occasionally battle the player; Cheren will choose the Pokémon with a type advantage against the player's, while Bianca will choose the Pokémon with a type disadvantage. The player's <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to obtain the eight Gym Badges of Unova and ultimately challenge the Elite Four of the Pokémon League, and its Champion, to win the game.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to find blood {{and then to}} reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E

25|$|The SemEval {{exercises}} {{provide a}} mechanism for examining issues in semantic analysis of texts. The topics of interest fall short of the logical rigor that is found in formal computational semantics, attempting to identify and characterize the kinds of issues relevant to human understanding of language. The <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to replicate human processing by means of computer systems. The tasks (shown below) are developed by individuals and groups to deal with identifiable issues, as they take on some concrete form.|$|E
25|$|Lactation {{consultants}} are {{health care}} professionals whose <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to promote breastfeeding and assist mothers with breastfeeding on an individualized or group basis. They work {{in a variety of}} health care settings, including hospitals, private doctor's offices, and public health clinics. Lactation consultants are board-certified by the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners. The majority of lactation consultants hold a certification in another healthcare profession, often as a nurse, midwife, dietician or physician. However, there is no specific post-secondary education required to become a lactation consultant.|$|E

25|$|Geobiochemistry {{is similar}} to biogeochemistry, but differs by placing {{emphasis}} {{on the effects of}} geology on the development of life’s biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth’s cycles. Its <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to link biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to understand when and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded on the notion that life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet.|$|E
25|$|The {{main task}} is {{monitoring}} all ship traffic {{along in the}} mandated zone {{with the goal of}} detecting irregularities.

It is also responsible for issuing extreme weather warnings, as well as coordinating messages in Navarea XIX. This covers the waters between Greenland and the Norway–Russia border north of the 65th parallel north. NOR VTS also records statistics on traffic, including single-hull tankers. The VTS retains information exchange with Iceland and a mutual notification of acute pollution with Russia. The center is manned around the clock.|$|E
25|$|Quality of Citizenship Jamaica (QCJ), {{founded by}} Jalna Broderick and Angeline Jackson in 2013, is an {{organisation}} that works toward creating safe spaces to empower the LGBT community.

25|$|The {{greatest}} issue {{related to}} Internet privacy internationally {{is that of}} data collection. At this point in time, the U.S. and the European Union had separate sets of privacy policies, making it increasingly difficult for companies such as Google to exist globally without violating such policies. Google {{is just one example}} of a large company whose <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to make money by serving their product, web browsing, to consumers. Consumers, however, are concerned with the quality of that product and their privacy. Online data collection by search engines allows Internet businesses to track consumer’s online roadmap, everything from the sites they visit to the purchases they make. This poses problems globally to those who are web users around the world, especially in a world where there is no overarching privacy policy. The general consensus of this issue regarding international privacy violations at the time of Fleischer’s U.N. address is that, since the Internet is global, the privacy policies should also be global and unified.|$|E
25|$|One {{area where}} data access {{is likely to}} be {{difficult}} is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the man-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> salvage. For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as {{a means to an end}} will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.|$|E
25|$|Although jazz is {{considered}} highly difficult to define, {{at least in}} part because it contains so many varied subgenres, improvisation is consistently regarded as being one of its key elements. The centrality of improvisation in jazz is attributed to influential earlier forms of music: the early blues, a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of the African-American slaves on plantations. These were commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early blues was also highly improvisational. European classical music performance is evaluated by its fidelity to the musical score, with much less discretion over interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment: the classical performer's <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to play a composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized as the product of group creativity, interaction, and collaboration, which places varying degrees of value on the contributions of the composer (if there is one) and performers. In jazz, the skilled performer will interpret a tune in very individual ways, never playing the same composition the same way twice; depending on the performer's mood and personal experience, interactions with other musicians, or even members of the audience, a jazz musician may alter melodies, harmonies or time signature at will.|$|E
