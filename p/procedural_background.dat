40|$|OBJECTIVES In {{the present}} {{prospective}} controlled study, we measured {{blood levels of}} cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in patients undergoing radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation (RFA), and we sought to investigate the degree of myocardial injury incurred by the application of RF energy and determine its <b>procedural</b> correlates. <b>BACKGROUND</b> Measurement of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels after RFA may underestimate the degree of myocardial injury due to its thermal inactivation by RFA. Cardiac troponin I is a newer, more specific marker of myocardial injury, which may circumvent this limitation; its use in this setting has rarely been studied. METHODS In 118 consecutive patients, 67 men and 51 women aged 38 6 19 years undergoing RFA {{for a variety of}} arrhythmias, cTnI and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) levels were measured before, immediately after and 4 to 24 h after RFA. Cardiac troponin I was also measured in 39 patients (control group) having only electrophysiologic studies (EPS) without RFA. RESULTS All RFA procedures were uncomplicated, lasted 3. 2 6 2. 0 h and included delivery of 16 6 22 (median: 9) RF current applications. Baseline cTnI levels averaged 0. 17 6 0. 18 ng/ml, rose to 0. 88 6 1. 12 at the end of RFA and to 2. 19 6 2. 46 at 4 – 24 h later. Creatine kinas...|$|R

40|$|Objective. This study {{evaluates the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} dexmedetomidine in neonates for short-term <b>procedural</b> sedation. <b>Background.</b> In the neonatal intensive care unit, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures requiring sedation are often performed. Dexmedetomidine has become a more popular treatment option due to its sedative properties and shorter duration of action. Methods. A comprehensive literature evaluation was conducted. All randomized controlled trials, case series, and case reports {{were included in the}} evaluation. The literature search produced 112 articles of which 6 articles were selected to evaluate the usefulness of dexmedetomidine as an effective and safe agent for short term procedural sedation in neonates. Results. A prospective study compared dexmedetomidine to midazolam during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 1 μg/kg over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0. 5 μg/kg/hr. One study evaluated the role of dexmedetomidine as a sole sedative agent for procedures. High dose dexmedetomidine (loading dose of 3 μg/kg with a subsequent infusion rate of 1. 5 - 2 μg/kg/hr) was given. This study found reduced requirement for other adjuvant benzodiazepine sedatives. A study evaluating the hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine revealed that IV dexmedetomidine was associated with modest fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure requiring no pharmacologic intervention. Conclusion. Dexmedetomidine provided adequate sedation with loading doses of 1 μg/kg and maintenance infusion of 0. 5 - 0. 7 μg/kg/hr without affecting hemodynamics and respiratory status. Thus, dexmedetomidine may be a suitable agent for procedural sedation in neonates. Grants. N/...|$|R

40|$|Biotechnology {{development}} in agriculture has raised challenging intellectual property issues. These issues are {{framed in the}} context of a three-prong plant patent statutory scheme, involving the Utility Patent Act, the Plant Variety Protection Act, and the Plant Patent Act. The agricultural community, which includes agricultural biotechnology companies, seed companies, and agricultural producers, has debated whether utility patents are excluded from the scope of the Utility Patent Act. Producers contended that Congress superceded the Utility Patent Act when it created the Plant Variety Protection Act and the Plant Patent Act and that sexually reproducing plants (seeds and seed grown plants) are protected exclusively by federal law under the provisions of the Plant Variety Protection Act. Seed companies, on the other hand, retorted that sexually reproducing plants are within the scope of the Utility Patent Act and that neither the Plant Protection Act nor the Plant Variety Protection Act superceded the Utility Patent Act. The dispute was resolved in December 2001, by the United States Supreme Court in J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, holding that utility patents may be issued for plants under the Utility Patent Act, despite distinct protections available under the Plant Variety Protection Act and the Plant Protection Act.

40|$|Abstract <b>Background</b> <b>Procedural</b> {{pain relief}} is sub-optimal in infants, {{especially}} small and vulnerable ones. Tetracaine gel 4 % (Ametop ®, Smith-Nephew) provides pain relief {{in children and}} larger infants, but its efficacy in smaller infants and for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) remains uncertain. The objective of this trial {{was to assess the}} safety and efficacy of tetracaine gel on the pain response of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants during insertion of a PICC. Methods Medically stable infants {{greater than or equal to}} 24 weeks gestation, requiring a non-urgent PICC, were included. Following randomization and double blinding, 1. 1 g of tetracaine or placebo was applied to the skin for 30 minutes. The PICC was inserted according to a standard protocol. Pain was assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP). A 3 -point change in the pain score was considered clinically significant, leading to a sample size of 54 infants, with 90 % statistical power. Local skin reactions and immediate adverse cardiorespiratory events were noted. The primary outcome, PIPP score at 1 minute, was analysed using an independent Student's t-test. Results Fifty-four infants were included, 27 +/- 2 weeks gestation, 916 +/- 292 grams and 6. 5 +/- 3. 2 days of age. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The mean PIPP score in the first minute was 10. 88 in the treatment group as compared to 11. 74 in the placebo group (difference 0. 86, 95 % CI - 1. 86, 3. 58). Median duration of crying in non-intubated infants was 181 seconds in the tetracaine group compared to 68 seconds in the placebo group (difference - 78, 95 % CI - 539, 117). Local skin erythema was observed transiently in 4 infants (3 in the treatment and 1 in the placebo group). No serious harms were observed. Conclusion Tetracaine 4 % when applied for 30 minutes was not beneficial in decreasing procedural pain associated with a PICC in very small infants. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Background</b> <b>Procedural</b> {{pain relief}} is sub-optimal in neonates. Topical {{tetracaine}} provides pain relief in children. Evidence of its efficacy and safety in neonates is limited. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the efficacy and safety of topical tetracaine on the pain response of neonates during a venipuncture. Methods Medically stable infants greater than or equal to 24 weeks gestation, requiring a venipuncture, were included. Following randomization and double blinding, 1. 1 g of tetracaine or placebo was applied to the skin for 30 minutes. Participants received oral sucrose if they met local eligibility criteria. The venipuncture was performed according to a standard protocol. A medium effect size in the pain score (corresponding to about 2 point difference in the PIPP score) was considered clinically significant, leading to a sample size of 142 infants, with 80 % statistical power. Local skin reactions and immediate adverse cardiorespiratory events were noted. The primary outcome, PIPP score at 1 minute, was analysed using an independent Student's t-test. Results One hundred and forty two infants were included, 33 +/- 4 weeks gestation, 2100 +/- 900 grams and 6 +/- 3 days of age. There was almost no difference in PIPP scores at 1 minute between groups (mean difference - 0. 09; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: - 1. 68 to 1. 50; P =. 91). Similarly, there were no differences in PIPP scores during the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th minute. Duration of cry did not differ between the groups (median difference, 0; 95 % CI, - 3 to 0; P =. 84). The majority of infants in both groups received sucrose 24 %. Sucrose had a significant effect on the PIPP score, as assessed by an ANOVA model (p = 0. 0026). Local skin erythema was observed transiently in 11 infants (7 in the tetracaine and 4 in the placebo group). No serious side effect was observed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether trust in {{supervisor}} and trust in senior management enhance employees job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and whether trust mediates the relationship between perceived justice and these outcomes. Trust in supervisor was expected to mediate the effects of distributive justice and interactional justice, and trust in senior management was expected to mediate the effects of <b>procedural</b> justice. Theoretical <b>background</b> of the study is based on the framework for trust in leadership developed by Dirks and Ferrin (2002). According to the framework, perceived fairness of leaders actions helps employees to draw inferences about the basis of the relationship and about leaders characters. This allows trust formation. Reciprocation of care and concern in the relationship and confidence in leaders characters are likely to enhance employees job satisfaction and organizational commitment. This study was conducted with cross-sectional data (A/ = 960) of employees from social and health care sector. Hypotheses were studied using correlation analysis and several hierarchical regression analyses. Significances of the mediations were assessed using the Sobel test. Results partially supported the hypotheses. Trust in leadership was positively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Trust in senior management mediated the relationship between procedural justice and the outcomes. Some support was also found for the mediating effect of trust in supervisor in the relationship between distributive justice and organizational commitment. Due to high correlation between trust in supervisor anil interactional justice, it wasn’t possible to study the mediating e fleet of trust in supervisor in the relationship between interactional justice and the outcomes. Against expectations, results indicated that trust in senior management had a mediating effect in the relationship between distributive justice and organizational commitment, and in the relationship between interactional justice and organizational commitment.

40|$|<b>Background</b> <b>Procedural</b> {{sedation}} and analgesia (PSA) is used {{to attenuate}} the pain and distress that may otherwise be experienced during diagnostic and interventional medical or dental procedures. As the risk of adverse events increases with the depth of sedation induced, frequent monitoring of level of consciousness is recommended. Level of consciousness is usually monitored during PSA with clinical observation. Processed electroencephalogram-based depth of anaesthesia (DoA) monitoring devices provide an alternative method to monitor level of consciousness {{that can be used}} in addition to clinical observation. However, there is uncertainty as to whether their routine use in PSA would be justified. Rigorous evaluation of the clinical benefits of DoA monitors during PSA, including comprehensive syntheses of the available evidence, is therefore required. One potential clinical benefit of using DoA monitoring during PSA is that the technology could improve patient safety by reducing sedation-related adverse events, such as death or permanent neurological disability. We hypothesise that earlier identification of lapses into deeper than intended levels of sedation using DoA monitoring leads to more effective titration of sedative and analgesic medications, and results in a reduction in the risk of adverse events caused by the consequences of over-sedation, such as hypoxaemia. The primary objective of this review is to determine whether using DoA monitoring during PSA in the hospital setting improves patient safety by reducing the risk of hypoxaemia (defined as an arterial partial pressure of oxygen below 60 mmHg or percentage of haemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen [SpO 2] less than 90 %). Other potential clinical benefits of using DoA monitoring devices during sedation will be assessed as secondary outcomes. Methods/design Electronic databases will be systematically searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the use of depth of anaesthesia monitoring devices with clinical observation of level of consciousness during PSA. Language restrictions will not be imposed. Screening, study selection and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion. Meta-analyses will be performed if suitable. Discussion This review will synthesise the evidence on an important potential clinical benefit of DoA monitoring during PSA within hospital settings...|$|R

As Al-Jawary reflects, adhering to proper channels to apprehend criminals permits the United States to strengthen continued mutual cooperation in legal matters with its allies and encourages a uniform approach to the political offense doctrine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Background</b> <b>Procedural</b> burn pain is {{the most}} intense acute pain and most likely type of burn injury pain to be undertreated due to the physician’s fear of the adverse effect of {{analgesia}} and lack of anesthetist present. At our institution, {{in most of the}} cases, local burn detersion and debridement were performed at the ward level without any analgesics. This article describes a study designed to test the analgesia effect of a fixed nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture on burn dressing pain. Methods/design The experiment was carried out in three centers. The patients were given a number from 1 to 240. A randomization list was produced by a statistician according to our preliminary study. Due to the severity of the pain suffered, ethically it was decided to help as many as possible, so patients given the letters A, B or C were treated using a canister with the appropriate letter containing preprepared nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture (NOOM). Those with D were given oxygen only, from an identical-looking canister labeled D. Neither patients, nor doctors, nor nurses, nor data collector knew what was in each canister, thus they were all blind. The nursing officer who implemented the intervention handed the doctors envelopes containing the patients’ name and allocation of A, B, C or D. Thus, patients receiving NOOM or oxygen were in the ratio 3 : 1. Parameters, including pain severity, blood pressure, heart rate, digital oxygen saturation and the Chinese version of the burn specific pain anxiety scale (C-BSPAS), were taken before, during and after dressing for each group. A video and audio record was taken individually for later communication coding and outcome analysis. Rescue analgesic was recorded. Discussion Based on the findings from our previous qualitative study that physician’s reluctance to order narcotic analgesia is due to its adverse effect and from our pilot experiment, this study aims to test the hypothesis that a fixed nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture will promote better burn dressing pain alleviation and outcomes. Analyses will focus on the effects of the experimental intervention on pain severity during dressing (primary outcomes); physiological parameters, C-BSPAS and acceptance of both health care professionals and patients (secondary outcomes). If this model of analgesia for burn pain management implemented by nurses proves successful, it could potentially be implemented widely in hospital and prehospital settings and improve patients’ satisfaction and quality of life.

40|$|This Comment will {{trace the}} history of Merck, {{culminating}} in the Supreme Court’s extension of {{the statute of limitations}} periods for private security fraud suits, and discuss the impact this holding will have on future security fraud litigation, both for investor-plaintiffs and issuer-defendants. Part I will examine the facts and procedural history of Merck, which began in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and ultimately reached the Supreme Court of the United States. This <b>procedural</b> <b>background</b> will illuminate the various interpretations existing prior to Merck regarding the events that trigger the statute of limitations period. Part II identifies the core regulations decidedly interpreted by the Supreme Court in Merck, their application to security fraud suits, and the extent of the existing circuit split. Part III extricates the essential holdings of Merck, namely the discovery requirement of scienter as a fact constituting a violation, and the rejection of inquiry notice as “discovery” so as to trigger the statute of limitations. Finally, Part IV advances several potential implications for the decision, including increased numbers of private security fraud suits and difficulty for corporations in assessing risk for purposes of D 2 ̆ 6 O liability insurance...|$|E
40|$|In 2006, Bronsen v. Dawes County {{stripped}} away the protection {{which the government}} had enjoyed under the RLA by overruling twenty-five years of judicial precedent. This complete reversal of liability is what caused sledding hills, skate parks, and other recreational facilities across the State to begin shutting down. Fearing increased liability and insurance premiums, many political subdivisions closed down various publicly owned recreation sites. Subsequently, a firestorm of debate ensued which inevitably led to new legislation re-granting the government partial immunity. Part II of this Note focuses {{on the development of}} the judicial interpretation of the government 2 ̆ 7 s role in the RLA, beginning with Watson v. City of Omaha. Next, Part III traces the factual and <b>procedural</b> <b>background</b> of Bronsen, overviews the case itself, and expounds the legislative reaction. Part IV analyzes the reasoning used by the Nebraska Supreme Court in its pivotal decision in Bronsen. Additionally, this Note analyzes the legislative reaction to Bronsen, discussing the competing interests to the legislation. Finally, Part V concludes that the reasoning in Bronsen is justifiable, but subject to several important counterarguments. However, any attempt to overturn Bronsen will likely fail due to new legislative intent. Moreover, the state of the law today is probably a good compromise for all interested parties...|$|E
