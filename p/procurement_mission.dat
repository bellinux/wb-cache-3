40|$|The {{water board}} Velt en Vecht is a Best Value (BV) client {{who used the}} Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS) process to select {{professional}} services in 2012. The client had a <b>procurement</b> <b>mission</b> of integrity, transparency, objectivity, and non-discrimination that aligned them with the BV PIPS system. With a strategic plan of leadership instead of management and control, the water board {{is an example of}} a visionary owner that can be successful with BV PIPS. Lessons learned from the water board implementation of PIPS are that BV PIPS is a change of paradigm, even for a visionary owner. Both the owner who selects and the contractors who compete for the award must learn the new paradigm of minimized decision making, proactive planning, and risk management...|$|E
40|$|The Lockheed Martin Orbital Space Plane System {{provides}} crew {{transfer and}} rescue for the International Space Station more safely and affordably than current human space transportation systems. Through planned upgrades and spiral development, {{it is also}} capable of satisfying the Nation's evolving space transportation requirements and enabling the national vision for human space flight. The OSP System, formulated through rigorous requirements definition and decomposition, consists of spacecraft and launch vehicle flight elements, ground processing facilities and existing transportation, launch complex, range, mission control, weather, navigation, communication and tracking infrastructure. The concept of operations, including <b>procurement,</b> <b>mission</b> planning, launch preparation, launch and mission operations and vehicle maintenance, repair and turnaround, is structured to maximize flexibility and mission availability and minimize program life cycle cost. The approach to human rating and crew safety utilizes simplicity, performance margin, redundancy, abort modes and escape modes to mitigate credible hazards that cannot be designed out of the system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Perhaps {{you have}} noticed some {{inconsistencies}} in your company too. A salesperson brings {{in a million}} in revenue and receives a hero’s acclaim while a purchasing agent saves a million and no one notices. Senior executives seem {{to believe in the}} power of the purchasing process and in your team but maverick spending remains out of control, business units (and even suppliers) find ways to circumvent the Purchasing Department and Purchasing is the last to get needed resources. If you observe these symptoms, perhaps you have the same malady that I’ve diagnosed at my company: the purchasing value proposition conflicts with the corporate culture. Using the illustration of Organizational Judo as a framework to help better understand and adapt to the culture of your company, you can help the Purchasing organization be more successful. By determining and prioritizing the business objectives that are important to you and viewing them in light of your culture, you can develop strategies that align with the values of your company. Ancient Wisdom. The martial art Judo illustrates an effective technique for purchasing leaders to advance the <b>procurement</b> <b>mission</b> in an organization. The word Judo means “th...|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of World War II in 1939, MacGregor {{went to work for}} the Ministry of Supply on the {{development}} of tanks. Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook was the next to spot his talent and commandeered him to travel to Canada and the US on <b>procurement</b> <b>missions</b> for aviation amour. He was then seconded to the British military mission in the US where he started to become familiar with US industry, including work on the development of the Sherman tank.|$|R
50|$|The project {{involves}} the procurement of seven Maritime Disaster Response (MDR) helicopters for the Philippine Coast Guard to strengthen and expand their MDR capabilities during maritime incidents and natural disasters and calamities. The project will also involve {{the training of}} pilots and technical crew, <b>procurement</b> of <b>mission</b> equipment, <b>procurement</b> of maintenance tools and spare parts for five years, {{and the construction of}} hangars for the helicopters and offices for the pilots and technical crew. It was supposed to be funded by the Credit Agricole of Germany.|$|R
40|$|The {{students}} have been assigned a task from Consid, were {{they are supposed to}} develop a web based platform for handling the company’s consult CV:s. The key features of the system are to simplify the administration part at <b>mission</b> <b>procurements</b> towards customers and to match qualified consultants to certain missions. Consid is an international it-consult company and have about 1000 consults working for them. When Consid makes <b>mission</b> <b>procurements</b> towards a customer they have to manually match the best consult against a certain mission, this is both time consuming and complicated. The students started the project with big visions and thoughts about how the work would be performed and how the system would be developed. After the initial meetings and the closer it came to the beginning of programming {{it became clear that the}} expectations were too big. This is the biggest lesson learned during the project and something that has come to influence the rest of the development. The {{students have}} been compelled to learn a totally new way of structuring the code by the three tier architecture. They have also been able to get a deeper understanding of how system development is performed by companies. Before the project begun the students and the company made a requirement specification for the system. The goals for the system and early limitations were made. Along the project those goals and limitations have been changed. The report handles the work with the development and read up on problems and solutions. It ends with a discussion and is summarized so the reader gets a better picture of the system and the work around it...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{experience}} of engineering psychologists advising the U. K. Ministry of Defense (MoD) on the procurement of advanced aviation systems that conform to good human engineering (HE) practice. Traditional approaches to HE in systems procurement focus on the physical nature of the human-machine interface. Advanced aviation systems present increasingly complex design requirements for human functional integration, information processing, and cognitive task performance effectiveness. These developing requirements present new challenges for HE quality assurance (QA) and risk management, requiring focus on design processes as well as on design content or product. A new approach to the application of HE, recently adopted by NATO, provides more systematic ordering and control of HE processes and activities {{to meet the challenges of}} advanced aircrew systems design. This systematic approach to HE has been applied by MoD to the <b>procurement</b> of <b>mission</b> systems for the Royal Navy Merlin helicopter. In MoD procurement, certification is a judicial function, essentially independent of the service customer and industry contractor. Certification decisions are based on advice from MoD's appointed Acceptance Agency. Test and evaluation (T&E) conducted by the contractor and by the Acceptance Agency provide evidence for certification. Certification identifies limitations of systems upon release to the service. Evidence of compliance with HE standards traditionally forms the main basis of HE certification and significant non-compliance could restrict release. The systems HE approach shows concern for the quality of processes as well as for the content of the product. Human factors certification should be concerned with the quality of HE processes as well as products. Certification should require proof of process as well as proof of content and performance. QA criteria such as completeness, consistency, timeliness, and compatibility provide generic guidelines for progressive acceptance and certification of HE processes. Threats to the validity of certification arise from problems and assumptions in T&E methods. T&E should seek to reduce the risk of specification non-compliance and certification failure...|$|R
40|$|We use {{original}} survey data and administrative data from post-war Liberia {{to test a}} theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping. The theory proposes that {{through the creation of}} local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace. This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace. We identify local impacts of deployment bases by exploiting the fact that peacekeepers had limited information when selecting base localities, using coarsened exact matching to identify sets of communities that should have been equally likely to receive bases, and then using regression to clean up residual imbalances. Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory. We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure. Nonetheless, we find that deployments do seem to stimulate local markets, leading to better employment possibilities and substantially higher incomes. The result is something of a puzzle, suggesting that more work needs to be done on other types of direct assistance by peacekeeping contingents—e. g. the impact of <b>mission</b> <b>procurement</b> and routine spending by those associated with the mission. Also, the findings with respect to NGO activities suggest that this is an important factor that past case studies and cross-national studies have not taken into account sufficiently.
