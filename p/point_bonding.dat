40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} sheath voltage limiter(SVL) {{transient characteristics}} by switching overvoltage considering single <b>point</b> <b>bonding</b> in underground transmission cables. The crossbonding system is generally used for grounding methods of underground transmission system. However, the single <b>point</b> <b>bonding</b> system {{is used in}} selective area which is difficult to consist of crossbonding major section. The sheath voltage limiters are connected between joints in the single <b>point</b> <b>bonding.</b> Specially, the high overvoltage might be generated in that section {{as well as the}} aging of sheath voltage limiter might be progressed by various electrical stress including lightning overvoltage, switching overvoltage and power frequency overvoltage. Therefore, in this paper, the switching overvoltage characteristics in underground cables are firstly analysed using EMTP simulation. Then, the switching overvoltage of sheath voltage limiter is also studied in single <b>point</b> <b>bonding.</b> Finally, the reduction method of sheath voltage limiter switching overvoltage is proposed by various simulation studies including circui...|$|E

The most common adhesive {{used to create}} the bond between CFRP and concrete is two part epoxy resin. However, the epoxy adhesive used in Civil Engineering constructions is very sensitive to elevated temperature. In general the bond properties deteriorate rapidly around the glass transition temperature of polymeric resin (Gamage et at, 2006).

40|$|Abstract: In this work, electrospun {{tubes of}} {{interest}} for vascular tissue engineering were fabricated and evaluated for burst pressure and suture retention strength (SRS) in the same context as tensile strength providing a direct, novel comparison. Tubes could be fabricated displaying average burst pressures up to 4000 mmHg—well above the standard of 2000 mmHg—and SRS values matching those of relevant natural tissues. Surprisingly, highly ori-ented fiber and maximal tensile properties are not abso-lutely necessary to attain clinically adequate burst pres-sures. The ability to resist bursting is clearly related to both initial solution solids loading and electrospinning deposition time. We make novel in situ observations of the relative microstructural characteristics of failure during bursting, and connect this to the conditions used to fabri-cate the graft. Processes typically thought to promote fiber alignment are, in fact, highly condition-dependent and do not always provide superior properties. In fact, electro-spun structures displaying no discernable alignment could achieve burst pressures regarded clinically sufficient. The properties of individual electrospun fiber clearly do not fully dictate macroscale properties. Normal background levels of <b>point</b> <b>bonding</b> are enhanced by increased rota-tional speeds, and can have effects on properties more dominant than those of alignment. 2008 Wiley Periodi...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} was exposed some {{research}} institute from important specialists in textile domain, concerning an unconventional assembly method – ultrasonic weld. An alternative to the classic sewing assembly, with thread and needles is ultrasonic seaming. In ultrasonic welding, there are no connective bolts, nails, soldering materials, or adhesives necessary to bind the materials together. Ultrasonic is defined as acoustic frequencies above the range audible to the human ear. Ultrasonic frequencies are administered to the fabric from the sonotrode of bonding machine. The high frequency and powerful energy produced, when is release in one special environment, the ultrasound heating this environment. The ability to ultrasonic weld textiles and films depend on their thermoplastic contents and the desired end results. The paper defines the weld ability of more common textiles and films. The welding refers to all types of bonding and sealing, as in <b>point</b> <b>bonding</b> of fabric, or continuous sealing of film. With the whole environment gone highly technical and specialized, industrial fabrics are used widely today for making many products such as inflatable boats, sewn technical clothing, tents, awnings, truck tarpaulins, filter bags, airships, bag & luggage, inflatable toys, advertising banners etc. Sewing, seam taping, gluing etc. have gone obsolete for sealing such fabrics {{that have to be}} ultra safe and efficient.

Ultrasonic systems being frequently utilized have many advantages on semi products of synthetic textile and technical textile. First of all, sewing – cutting process can be accomplished under high speeds and rate of losses can be minimized. Cutting seal applications are frequently used for underwear and sportswear. Slicing and unit cutting machines, as well as portable sealing machines are available for labeling sector. Products such as bag, pocket and cover can be sewed in a seamless manner for promotion purposes. All objects in terms of accessories are obtained in same standard. Our quilting machines are preferred in worldwide due to its threadless, high quality sealing. An alternative to the classic sewing assembly, with thread and needles is ultrasonic seaming.

40|$|In {{thermally}} bonded bi-component fibre nonwovens, {{a significant}} contribution is made by <b>bond</b> <b>points</b> in defining their mechanical behaviour formed {{as a result of}} their manufacture. <b>Bond</b> <b>points</b> are composite regions with a sheath material reinforced by a network of fibres’ cores. These composite regions are connected by bi-component fibres — a discontinuous domain of the material. Microstructural and mechanical characterization of this material was carried out with experimental and numerical modelling techniques. Two numerical modelling strategies were implemented: (i) traditional finite element (FE) and (ii) a new parametric discrete phase FE model to elucidate the mechanical behaviour and underlying mechanisms involved in deformation of these materials. In FE models the studied nonwoven material was treated as an assembly of two regions having distinct microstructure and mechanical properties: fibre matrix and <b>bond</b> <b>points.</b> The former is composed of randomly oriented core/sheath fibres acting as load-transfer link between composite <b>bond</b> <b>points.</b> Randomness of material’s microstructure was introduced in terms of orientation distribution function (ODF). The ODF was obtained by analysing the data acquired with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro computed tomography (CT). <b>Bond</b> <b>points</b> were treated as a deformable two-phase composite. An in-house algorithm was used to calculate anisotropic material properties of composite <b>bond</b> <b>points</b> based on properties of constituent fibres and manufacturing parameters such as the planar density, core/sheath ratio and fibre diameter. Individual fibres connecting the composite <b>bond</b> <b>points</b> were modelled in the discrete phase model directly according to their orientation distribution. The developed models were validated by comparing numerical results with experimental tensile test data, demonstrating that the proposed approach is highly suitable for prediction of complex deformation mechanisms, mechanical performance and structure-properties relationships of composites...|$|R

30|$|Even {{after many}} <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> among strands were {{destroyed}} by exposure, nails still passed through the strands, and the strand strength due to fiber strength was manifested. In other words, the density of OSB(aspen) was 0.63  g/cm 3 before exposure, and then decreased to 0.51  g/cm 3 after 5  years (Table  1). The thickness change increased to 15.6  % (Table  1). The reduced density and increased thickness change suggest the destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points.</b> However, the strand strength was effectively manifested and showed high nail resistance, and thus OSB retained high levels of shear load in one-plane even when only a few <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> remained. On the other hand, particleboard is manufactured from particles that are much smaller than strands, and nails rarely pass through the particles. Therefore, particle strength due to fiber strength is rarely manifested. Before exposure, PB(PF) showed the highest shear load in one-plane because PB(PF) had a higher density than the other boards (Table  1). However, the density of PB(PF) was reduced to 0.66  g/cm 3 after 5  years, and the thickness change increased to 15.2  % (Table  1). The reduced density and increased thickness change suggest the destruction of <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> between particles. Unlike strands, particles lack the fiber strength. This is why shear load in one-plane decreased in PB(PF). On the other hand, MDF is manufactured from fibers that are as small as particles, but the fibers are intertwined and have mutually high adhesion [17]. As a result, the <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> were not destroyed, and MDF maintained both high density (Table  1) and nail resistance even after exposure.|$|R

30|$|The fiberboards showed {{much lower}} {{thickness}} change than particleboards and strandboards for 5 -year outdoor exposure (Table  6). Our previous reports have {{mentioned that the}} high durability of fiberboard against outdoor exposure is presumably because of its smooth surface, which prevents rainwater from penetrating and deteriorating the board [5, 6]. However, in this study, the F-MUF board showed large reduction in MOR and IB after the JIS Test B. Rainwater did not penetrate the board, but water penetrated the board when it was immersed in boiling water for 2  h, which destroyed the <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> and reduced its MOR and IB. MUF resin is not durable for boiling water and <b>bonding</b> <b>points</b> were destroyed. However, because the F-MDI board uses MDI resin, which is durable for boiling water [23], boiling water penetrating the board did not destroy its <b>bonding</b> <b>points.</b> Therefore, the MOR and IB of the F-MDI board did not reduce.|$|R

This paper addresses how one may use a bicomponent fiber technology to overcome the shortcomings of the thermal bonding and obtain high strength spunbond fabrics. In particular, we present the utility of islands-in-the-sea (I/S) bicomponent fibers for optimizing the strength of thermally bonded fabrics. To examine the role of various bonding temperatures on the fabric performance, pre-consolidated webs were formed and subsequently, thermally bonded. Thus, any influence introduced by potential variations in the structure was minimized. Point-bonded bicomponent samples made up of nylon- 6 (N 6) as the islands and low density polyethylene (PE) as the sea showed great promise with respect to their mechanical properties, suggesting that the use of bicomponent fibers can be beneficial for strength optimization of thermally bonded spunbond nonwovens...|$|R
