This research has investigated whether horizontal heat flux in the mould can be controlled by manipulating the interface between the copper mould plate and the slag film.

It was noticed that such pre-deformation improves the hot ductility significantly.

Hydraulic oscillation enables, in comparison to ordinary used electromechanical oscillation, flexible set-up of basic parameters of the oscillation cycle (negative strip time and its ratio).

40|$|The loss of hot {{ductility}} (HD) {{of steel}} during continuous casting is usually {{attributed to the}} intergranular precipitation of V and Nb (C, N) as well as segregation of atoms to grain boundaries. This loss of hot ductility in the temperature range 700 [...] 1100 °C in carbon and low alloy steels is related to transverse surface cracks during the straightening operation of the continuous casting process of steel. An additional problem, found in peritectic steels, is its very coarse as cast structure, which is very prone to cracking during the straightening stage. In this regard, two major solutions have been suggested to date to improve hot ductility, adjusting the straightening stage to be below or above the low hot ductility region and chemical composition modification. However, both the solutions have limitations {{and the problem of}} cracking during continuous casting is still persistent. In this study, a <b>peritectic</b> <b>steel</b> was melted in-situ and the hot ductility trough was quantified at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1100 °C. It was also subjected to very high temperature deformation in the single phase austenite region (1400 [...] 1300 °C) during cooling from the solidus temperature. It was noticed that such deformation can improve the hot ductility, which could alleviate cracking problem during continuous casting. Microstructural studies showed that such improvement can be attributed to grain refinement owing to dynamic recrystallization during the deformation applied after solidification. Fracture analysis revealed that the deformation altered the grain boundary segregation as well. The Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements showed that the very high temperature deformation lowered the concentration of detrimental elements, such as S, N, Mn and C, at grain boundaries. This also contributed to the HD improvements. The steel specimens were also reheated to temperatures below the solidus and subjected to the very high temperature deformation prior to HD testing. As was expected, the reheated specimens showed better HD than the melted ones. Microstructural examination showed that the very high temperature deformation encouraged recrystallization and grain refinement.

40|$|A finite-element {{model has}} been {{developed}} to predict the evolution of temperature, stress, and shape of 10 -mm diameter molten steel droplets solidifying against a water-cooled copper chill plate. The elastic-viscoplastic stress model accounts for thermal linear expansion / contraction behavior, creep, and phase transformations that vary with carbon content. Thermal contraction causes the quenched surface of the impinged droplet to bend away from the chill plate. This creates interfacial resistance that greatly lowers heat transfer. The droplet shape is predicted to evolve almost entirely during the first 0. 1 second, when a thin solid skin first forms and becomes strong enough to contract. The final shape of the droplet interface predicted by the model agrees both qualitatively and quantitatively with previous measurements reported by Dong and coworkers. The most deformation, {{as indicated by the}} final curvature of solidified droplets, is found in high purity iron (0. 003 %C) and in <b>peritectic</b> <b>steels</b> (0. 12 %C). This deformation can be reduced by lowering heat transfer coefficient and avoiding sudden large drops in h. Large drops in heat transfer coefficient also cause reheating of the droplet surface, despite the neglect of nonequilibrium undercooling effects in the model.

The optical binocular microscope Axio Imagez A 2 m (production of the German company Zeis AG) was used to analyze the samples for the chemical composition of the elements and for the microstructure(ferrite and pearlite amount). It makes it possible to determine ferrite-to-pearlite relation in steel by means of the special program Thixomet Pro. Experimental percentage of ferrite was compared with the equilibrium percentage of ferrite calculated from the carbon content in the sample from the Fe-C phase diagram.

40|$|This thesis work {{deals with}} the volume changes during the {{solidification}} of cast irons and peritectic steels. The volume changes in casting metals {{are related to the}} expansion and/or contraction of the molten metal during solidification. Often, different types of shrinkage, namely macro- and micro-shrinkage, affect the casting quality. In addition to that, exposure of the metal casting to higher contraction or expansion during the solidification might also be related to internal strain development in samples, which eventually leads to surface crack propagation in some types of steel alloys during continuous casting. In consequence, a deep understanding of the mechanisms and control of the solidification will improve casting quality and production. All of the experiments during the entire work were carried out on laboratory scale samples. Displacement changes during solidification were measured {{with the help of a}} Linear Variable Displacement Transformer (LVDT). All of the LVDT experiments were performed on samples inside a sand mould. Simultaneously, the cooling curves of the respective samples during solidification were recorded with a thermocouple. By combining the displacement and cooling curves, the volume changes was evaluated and later used to explain the influence of inoculants, carbon and cooling rates on volume shrinkages of the casting. Hypoeutectic grey cast iron (GCI) and nodular cast iron (NCI) with hypo-, hyper- and eutectic carbon compositions were considered in the experiments from cast iron group. High nickel alloy steel (Sandvik Sanbar  64) was also used from <b>peritectic</b> <b>steel</b> type. These materials were melted inside an induction furnace and treated with different types of inoculants before and during pouring in order to modify the composition. Samples that were taken from the LVDT experiments were investigated using a number of different  methods in order to support the observations from the displacement measurements:  Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), to evaluate the different phase present; Dilatometry, to see the effect of cooling rates on contraction for the various types of alloys; metallographic studies with optical microscopy; Backscattered electrons (BSE) analysis on SEM S- 3700 N, to investigate the different types of oxide and sulphide nuclei; and bulk density measurements  by applying Archimedes' principle. Furthermore, the experimental volume expansion during solidification was compared with the theoretically calculated values for GCI and NCI. It was found that the casting shows hardly any shrinkage during early solidification in GCI, but in the eutectic region the casting expands until the end of solidification. The measured and the calculated volume changes are close to one another, but the former shows more expansion. The addition of MBZCAS (Si, Ca, Zr, Ba, Mn and Al) promotes more flake graphite, and ASSC (Si, Ca, Sr and Al) does not increase the number of eutectic cells by much. In addition to that, it lowers the primary austenite fraction, promotes more eutectic growth and decreases undercooled graphite and secondary dendritic arm spacing (SDAS). As a result, the volume expansion changes in the eutectic region. The expansion during the eutectic growth increase with an increase in the inoculant weight percentage. At the same time, the eutectic cells become smaller and increase in number. The effect of the inoculant and the superheat temperature shows a variation in the degree of expansion/contraction and the cooling rates for the experiments. Effective inoculation tends to homogenize the eutectic structure, reducing the undercooled and interdendritic graphite throughout the structure. In NCI experiments, it was found that the samples showed no expansion in the transversal direction due to higher micro-shrinkages in the centre, whereas in the longitudinal direction the samples shows expansion until solidification was complete.    The theoretical and measured volume changes agreed with each other. The austenite fraction and number of micro-shrinkage pores decreased with increase in carbon content. The nodule count and distribution changes with carbon content. The thermal contraction of NCI is not influenced by the variation in carbon content at lower cooling rates. The structural analysis and solidification simulation results for NCI show that the nodule size and count distribution along the cross-sections at various locations are different due to the variation in cooling rates and carbon concentration. Finer nodule graphite appears in the thinner sections and close to the mold walls. A coarser structure is distributed mostly in the last solidified location. The simulation result indicates that finer nodules are associated with higher cooling rate and a lower degree of microsegregation, whereas the coarser nodules are related to lower cooling rate and a higher degree of microsegregation. As a result, this structural variation influences the micro-shrinkage in different parts. The displacement change measurements show that the <b>peritectic</b> <b>steel</b> expands and/or contracts during the solidification. The primary austenite precipitation during the solidification in the metastable region is accompanied by gradual expansion on the casting sides. Primary δ-ferrite precipitation under stable phase diagram is complemented by a severe contraction during solidification. The microstructural analysis reveals that the only difference between the samples is grain refinement with Ti addition. Moreover, the severe contraction in solidification region might be the source for the crack formation due to strain development, and further theoretical analysis is required in the future to verify this observation.

40|$|<b>Peritectic</b> carbon <b>steels,</b> {{produced}} by conventional continuous casting, show slab surface defects {{as a consequence}} of the shrinkage caused by the delta-gamma transformation. Unsteady heat flux conditions between strand shell and mould plate leads to an irregular solidification. By following the hypothesis, that the cooling rate has an effect to the peritectic reaction, twin roll strip cast trials were done at a pilot strip caster at RWTH Aachen University. Local cooling rates of - 1000 K/s in combination with an eightfold higher heat flux compared to continuous casting are typical for strip casting process. The indication for effects from the strip casting process to the peritectic reaction was on the one hand the steady heat flux and on the other hand the strip surface quality. Trials were performed in 3 campaigns with the chemical analyses of <b>peritectic</b> carbon <b>steels</b> known from continuous casting. The campaigns just distinguish between the casting roll surfaces structure and the range of carbon content. All other process parameters were constant. The casting roll surface was developed from a fine, hexagonal open structure to a coarse hexagonal structure. The structure is regular and was {{produced by}} knurling. The carbon range was 0. 06 to 0. 17 wt %. The result of the 1 st campaign was that nearly all strips were attack by many cracks. The number of cracks rises to higher carbon content up to 0. 17 wt %. The maximum of defects around 0. 1 wt % of carbon, known from continuous casting, was not found. By proofing the strip surfaces, it was found out that the steel melt didn’t wet the roll surface intensive. An unsteady solidification process was the result. The results of the 2 nd campaign were different. Just very few cracks were remaining at the strip surfaces. No dependence between carbon content and number of crack were found. Once again the critical range around 0. 1 wt % carbon wasn’t noticeable by strips produced with the twin roll casting process. The important different in comparison to the first campaign was an excellent wetting behaviour between steel melt and roll surface. An imprint of the roll surface structure was found at all strip surfaces. A homogenous heat flux and solidification condition exists. The results of the 3 rd series, performed with a further regular roll surface structure, confirm the above explained facts. The geometric shape and adjustment were again diversifying to coarser values. The work could demonstrate that the twin roll process is suitable for the production of <b>peritectic</b> carbon <b>steel</b> grades. The key factor for solidification and heat flux is the wetting condition at the roll surface. Steel specific roll surface structures are required...|$|R

40|$|Volume {{change during}} {{solidification}} {{is an important}} concept in achieving of casting soundness. The solidification shrinkage can cause different defects in the ingot casting {{as well as the}} shape casting. The volume change due to phase transformation during solidification is the other concept which has to be studied. In addition, the solidification shrinkage can be affected by the volume change of liquid metals due to the structure change of liquid. In this work, first, the solidification shrinkage was measured in copper-lead base alloys by a dilatometer which was developed to use for melting and solidification processes. The volume change was measured during primary solidification and monotectic reaction. The macrostructure evaluation of samples was used to explain the volume change results. A shrinkage model was used to explain the volume changes during solidification. In addition, the microsegregation of alloying elements was studied in the alloys.   In the second part, the solidification of brass alloys was investigated in different cooling rates. Microstructure evaluation showed that the peritectic transformation occurred as diffusionless (partitionless) as well as the diffusion-controlled transformation. In addition, the volume change was measured in the peritectic alloys. A theoretical analysis was developed to evaluate the volume change effect on the peritectic reaction.   Hot crack formation was investigated during the solidification of <b>peritectic</b> <b>steels</b> as a volume change concept during the transformation of ferrite to austenite. A series of in situ solidification experiments was performed using a MTS tensile testing machine combined with a mirror furnace to measure the sample temperature and the force change during solidification. It was observed that a rise in tensile force began with the start of solidification and suddenly dropped. The sudden drop of force, which occurred around the peritectic temperature of the alloy, was accompanied by a crack or a refilled crack in the microstructure. Furthermore, the peritectic reaction types were studied theoretically and experimentally to understand their effects on the force change during solidification. The analyses showed that the volume change due to the peritectic transformation is a reason for crack formation. In addition, when the peritectic reaction occurred as a diffusionless manner (partitionless), the crack formation is more probable.   In the last study, the effect of cooling rate and super heat temperature were studied on the precipitation of primary silicon in Al-Si hypereutectic alloys. The liquidus temperature was found to decrease with cooling rate. In addition, the fraction of primary silicon decreased with increasing the cooling rate and the super heat temperature. Furthermore, the morphology of the primary silicon changed as an effect of cooling rate and super heat temperature. It was concluded that the solidification characteristic and silicon morphology relate to the liquid structure. QC 2010072...|$|R

40|$|The high {{temperature}} ductility of steel increases as the grain size is decreased. However, in microalloyed steels this interdependence of grain size and hot-ductility is generally less pronounced because of the overriding effect of precipitation of carbo-nitrides of alloying elements at grain boundaries. Nevertheless, many types of crack {{have been shown to}} be associated with coarse austenite grains, and the tendency to crack is reduced when the formation of coarse austenite grains is prevented by the use of suitable secondary cooling. To our knowledge, a systematic study, to isolate the contribution of grain size on hot-ductility has not been reported and hence, under these circumstances, it is important to define clearly the contributing role of grains size to hot-ductility and therefore it is necessary to separate the effect on hot ductility of microalloying precipitates from that of grain size. The materials used for study were Fe- 0. 05 %C, Fe- 0. 18 %C and Fe- 0. 45 %C alloys, prepared in an experimental facility. Carbon was the only alloying element deliberately added to the melt and tramp elements and impurities were kept to as low a value as experimentally possible. A GLEEBLE 3500 thermomechanical simulator was used to conduct hot-tensile tests and from these results the relationship between austenite grain size and hot-ductility could be determined. The hot-ductility tensile tests in this study were performed in the temperature range 1100 to 700 degrees celsius. Hot-tensile test specimens were either solution treated or melted in-situ (direct cast) and cooled to the test temperature in order to simulate the microstructural characteristics of commercially as-cast slab which contains coarse austenite grains at the base of oscillation marks. In order to obtain different grain sizes, the specimens were solution treated at temperatures between 1100 degrees celsius and 1350 degrees celsius for 10 minutes. The specimens were then rapidly cooled to the test temperature, in the range 1100 degrees celsius to 700 degrees celsius at a rate of 200 degrees celsius min (superscript � 1) and then pulled to fracture at a low strain rate of 7. 5 � 10 (superscript � 4) s(superscript � 1). Specimens that were cast in-situ (referred to as the �direct casting condition�) were cooled at rates of 100 degrees Celsius min (superscript � 1) and 200 degrees Celsius min- 1 respectively in order to study the effect of cooling rate on hot ductility. It was found that grain size increased almost linearly with increasing solution treatment temperature in all the Fe-C alloys and in case of specimens solution treated at 1350 degrees celsius an average austenite grain size of ~ 4 mm in diameter was obtained. Increasing the grain size resulted in ductility loss under all testing conditions. The existence of a ductility trough between Ar(subscript 3) and Ae(subscript 3) temperature was considered to be due to the formation of deformation induced ferrite as evidenced by a constant peak stress region between these two temperatures. However, convincing experimental evidence of the ductility trough extending beyond the Ae(subscript 3) temperature well into the austenite was found. The mechanism of this interesting, and important observation for low carbon alloy below 0. 3 %C has not been explored as yet and at present it has to be assumed that it is related to the occurrence of grain boundary sliding because in the high austenite temperature region the grain boundary sliding is favored in a coarse grained structure. For specimens cast in-situ, the largest grains were found in the Fe- 0. 18 %C alloy for both cooling rates. This important observation is attributed to the higher austenitizing temperature of a Fe- 0. 18 %C alloy compared to that of the other Fe-C alloys studied. Moreover, the formation of columnar austenite grains were observed in this alloy on cooling, whereas equi-axed grains were formed in the other two Fe-C alloys. By such columnarization, the surface cracking susceptibility of the <b>peritectic</b> grade <b>steel</b> will be accelerated. The hot-ductility of the Fe-C alloy of near-peritectic composition was the lowest of the alloys studied and the inferior ductility in this alloy is attributed to the coarse grain size and columnar shape of the grains. The Fe- 0. 45 %C alloy had the smallest grain size at any specimens cast in-situ but the hot-ductility was much lower than would have been expected in an alloy of such small grain size. This much reduced ductility may be due to increased grain boundary sliding. At a higher cooling rate of the in-situ melted specimens, smaller grains were produced in all the Fe-C alloys resulting in ductility improvement. This grain refinement obtained at higher cooling rates have important implications for near-net shape casting operations such as thin-slab casting or strip-casting where much higher cooling rates are realized than in the conventional casting process, if the factors related with precipitation are removed. An important insight derived at through this study was that enlarged grain contributed more to reduced ductility at {{high temperature}} than did cast structure, at least under the pertaining experimental conditions. This observation has important practical implications because it means that efforts in industry could be concentrated on reducing the chances of forming large austenite grains, such as at the roots of oscillation marks due to a decreased cooling rate, without undue regard to the effect of these measures on cast structure. This study has provided convincing new experimental evidence of the extremely detrimental effect of large austenite grains on hot-ductility in plain carbon steels. The very large columnar shaped grains that can form in alloys of near-peritectic composition is particularly disconcerting. However, the influence of AlN precipitation on austenite grain boundaries on hot-ductility was not studied and it is recommended that this important topic should be included in subsequent investigation. The experimental data on these Fe-C alloys, provided in this study, may now be used to benchmark and further analyse the much larger body of information on low-alloyed steels available in the literature...|$|R

A further aim was to explore the potential of countermeasures aimed at avoiding or at least minimizing surface defects that originate as a result of the occurrence of the peritectic phase transition. Several experimental techniques were employed to simulate various aspects of solidification events that occur in the meniscus region of an operating continuous caster. In-situ observations of solidification in addition to subsequent solid-state phase transformations were made by employing a concentric solidification technique in a high-temperature laser-scanning confocal microscope (HTLSCM) in real time and at temperature. It is possible by this technique to effectively simulate early solidification events occurring in an operating continuous caster and the solidification behaviour of a series of steel of near-peritectic composition and of industrial importance have been assessed and compared. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to determine the exact phase relationships in the selected steels as a function of temperature as an aid to the interpretation of the outcomes of the solidification studies. A potential countermeasure that can be taken in industrial practice to counteract uneven solidification is to texture the mould surface. In order to explore and evaluate the effect of different mould surface textures on reducing the unevenness of the solidifying, a simple dip-test was developed, followed by more sophisticated experiments and analyses in a continuous casting mould simulator. In parallel to the texture studies in the mould-simulator certain aspects of the interaction between mould, strand and mould-flux have also been assessed. The stresses encountered in and development of these stresses in the course of solidification, were assessed by the use of a submerged split-chill contraction (SSCC) technique. In an attempt to relate the fundamental studies to operational practice, an in-plant study of off-corner crack formation was conducted. The solidification studies conducted in a high-temperature laser-scanning microscope revealed that the velocity of the liquid/delta-ferrite interface decreases with the extent of segregation occurring in the early stages of solidification. An increase in alloy content of steels and/or an increase in cooling rate exacerbate segregation during solidification. It is understood that the migration of the interface requires the diffusion of large amounts of solute across the interface, implying that the delay in shell growth in the very early stage of solidification in mould might be attributed to this segregation. This is an important observation since it means that the initial rate of solidification in industrial practice is a strong function of steel composition, but that the influence of alloying elements on the rate of solidification can be quantified through experimental simulation studies. The rate of the solid-state delta-ferrite to austenite phase transformation in the presence of liquid phase is significantly higher in hypo-peritectic steels than in the other steels investigated, even at low cooling rates. The higher undercooling of these steels before nucleation of austenite initiates has been attributed to the pre-existence of a higher fraction of primary solidified deltaferrite in the steels of hypo-peritectic composition. However, it is not the fraction of pre-existing delta-ferrite as such that causes the deeper undercooling, but rather the higher solute concentration gradients that develop in the delta-ferrite phase in these steels that leads to an increased rate of the subsequent delta-ferrite to austenite phase transformation. In order to illustrate the ill-effects of uneven solidification in a thin-slab caster in industrial practice, the case of off-corner cracking of titanium bearing <b>steels</b> close to <b>peritectic</b> composition was selected for further study. This in-plant study revealed that off-corner cracks can occur as a result of excessive growth of austenite grains caused by the peritectic phase transition and/or by the precipitation of fine TiN precipitates at grain boundaries. Experiments conducted by the simple dip-test have shown that textured surfaces with 2 mm interval grooves provided the best mould surface to produce even solidification. These grooves also provided the most extensive shell growth through the improved contact between shell and textures mould surface. This observation is attributed to the effect of grooves on the dispersion of deformation sites in the thin shell. In mould simulator experiment, with the application of mild cooling mould flux the growth of shell in hypo-peritectic steel became much evener. Also with mild cooling much thicker shell grew through more intimate contact between shell and mould. The mould simulator experiments revealed that the use of a ‘mild cooling mould flux’ provided conditions conducive to high shell growth rates and even shell formation in casting hypo-peritectic steel. This observation is also attributed to the intimate contact between shell and mould as a result of the reduced heat extraction rate achieved with the ‘mild cooling mould flux’. In industrial practice it is difficult to predict the solidification behaviour of a specific steel design. The experiments conducted by DSC techniques provided convincing evidence that the susceptibility to the ill-effects of the peritectic phase transition of a given steel cannot be predicted by currently available thermodynamic software or by the calculation of the carbon equivalent alone. It is necessary to determine the absolute values of the phase boundaries as a function of temperature. It was shown that DSC technique is a tool for the identification of steels that will be subject to undergoing the peritectic transformation during continuous casting. It was found that in the case of at least one steel, DSC measurements proved it to be of hypo-peritectic composition whereas thermodynamic software predicted it to be of hyper-peritectic composition. It was possible to measure the stress developing in the course of solidification in each of the steels investigated by the use of the SSCC test. It was also found that the effect of a reduction in heat transfer by the use of a zirconium oxide coating in the SSCC test on decreasing the contraction forces is more pronounced in the case of hypo-peritectic steels. In summary: An attempt was made to explore practical measures (or the directions towards improvement) aimed at minimizing defects resulting from solidification events in high-speed continuous casting processes such as uneven shell formation, depressions, cracks and even breakouts. Specific attention was paid to the high stresses that result from the massive-type of phase transformation occurring in the meniscus region. The present study confirmed that it is necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors, fundamental and operational, that impact on solidification in order to predict the solidification behaviour of steels that fall within the <b>peritectic</b> composition range. <b>Steel</b> composition, casting speed and cooling rate play dominant roles. Two distinct occurrences close to the liquid/solid interface in a solidifying steel shell in a continuous casting mould were identified as of paramount importance: A massive type of deltaferrite to gamma-austenite transformation with planar liquid/solid interface morphology in the very initial stages of solidification in the meniscus region, which is caused by solute elements build-up in the liquid ahead of the growing solid/interface (partitioning) and a diffusionally driven deltaferrite to gamma-austenite transformation upon further solidification in the region of dendritic growth as a result of smoothed concentration gradients. Hot-spots need to be avoided at all cost and the development of a thin shell of even thickness in the region below the meniscus is a pre-requisite to preventing casting defects...|$|R
