5000|$|The lake {{consists}} of four basins. The first basin made up the original part of the lake. It is the largest basin of the four and stretches from [...] "the Narrows" [...] to the dam on Barton Road in Stow. It is {{the only part of}} the lake that is completely in Stow. In 1847 the water rights to Boon Pond were purchased by Amory Maynard and a dam was built to increase the size of the pond. The intent was to add to the water reserve needed to provide continuous water power to the Assabet Woolen Mill, in the town of Maynard. Thus, in the early years the pond would be large after the spring melt, then shrink as water was let out during the summer months. Once the woolen mill converted to coal-fired steam power the need for Lake Boon's water was ended, and a more <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> was established.|$|E

Firstly, an experimental analysis aimed at determining the hydraulic behaviour of the regulator under both free flow and submerged flow conditions was carried out. Then, a numerical investigation into the calibration of proportional (P) controllers for the weir control was performed. In particular, suitable values were evaluated for the controller proportional parameter {{in order to obtain}} quick regulations and avoid the occurrence of <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> oscillations behind the weir.

40|$|The {{preference}} of wetland angiosperms for waterlogged soils has been explained by several hypotheses: (1) wetland species are adapted to waterlogging and sensitive to drought; (2) wetland species are tolerant to drought, but inferior competitors at drier conditions; (3) wetland species have narrow moisture optima for recruitment. We tested these hypotheses by {{the application of}} <b>permanent</b> and fluctuating <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> to experimental wet dune plant communities with four species that frequently occur in wet dune slacks (Carex flacca, Molinia caerulea, Samolus valerandi and Schoenus nigricans) and one competitive species of drier conditions (Calamagrostis epigejos). After 3 years, fluctuating <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> had led to lower total biomass production than <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> indicating that switching from aerated to anoxic soil conditions involved physiological costs. The collective biomass of wetland species was highest at permanently waterlogged conditions with interspecific variation in the biomass optima. At the nutrient-poor growth conditions of this long-term experiment, biomass of Calamagrostis was independent of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> treatment, thus the hypothesized competitive superiority of this species at drier conditions could not explain the biomass responses of the wetland species in this study. Instead, this is evidence for an ecological {{preference of}} adult wet dune plants for waterlogged to moist conditions. Recruitment of most wet dune slack species occurred in a narrower range of <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> than adult growth, indicating that recruitment requirements also pose a limitation to the distribution of these wet dune species. Incorporation of recruitment into nature management support models may improve their predictions. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the lake began to suffer {{degradation}} {{as the more}} <b>permanent</b> and deeper <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> allowed a large population of the introduced common carp to build up. The feeding behaviour of the carp undermined the reedbeds and increased water turbidity, leading {{to the death of}} submerged plants, decreased oxygen levels and the decline of small aquatic wildlife. This was remedied in 1996-1997 by drying out the lake to kill the carp before allowing it to fill again. Since then <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> have been closely managed, with some seasonal drying in summer, to limit carp numbers and to maintain areas of open water as waterbird habitat.|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{there are}} a lot of {{observations}} on the significant impact of strong remote earthquakes on underground water and local seismicity. Teleseismic wave trains of strong earthquakes give rise to several hydraulic effects in boreholes, namely <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes and water level oscillations, which closely mimic the seismograms (hydroseismograms). Clear identical anomalies in the deep borehole water levels have been observed on a large part of the territory of Georgia during passing of the S and Love–Rayleigh teleseismic waves (including also multiple surface Rayleigh waves) of the 2011 Tohoku M 9 earthquake. The analysis carried out in order to find dynamically triggered events (non-volcanic tremors) of the Tohoku earthquake by the accepted methodology has not revealed a clear tremor signature in the test area: the Caucasus and North Turkey. The possible mechanisms of some seismic signals of unknown origin observed during passage of teleseismic waves of Tohoku earthquake are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tidal inlets which link a {{tidal basin}} {{to the sea}} via a {{constricted}} entrance are common on the south-east Australian coast. Closure, or even significant constriction, raises water levels but restricts tidal range within the basin, while open entrances provide regular and significant tidal exchange with the ocean. A rapid assessment procedure with minimal data requirements {{has been shown to}} be informative for monitoring and a useful component of any Decision Support System set up as part of a management structure. Such a system is presented in this paper. It is based on one <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> gauge inside the inlet plus the use of a simple, first-order hydrodynamic model to relate the tide range, mean water level and river flow to the inlet cross sectional area. The method is tested against data from the Snowy River Estuary in south-eastern Australia but would be suitable over a range of estuaries. In addition, the framework presented can also provide a mechanism to explore conditions over the range of expected data, thus allowing better selection of model schematization and runs in estuarine systems where the use of 2 or 3 D modeling can be justified...|$|E
5000|$|Beaver Pipes were {{installed}} in 2009 by Enzo Creek's management to help control the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in Hunt Marsh, {{which had been}} steadily growing since 2005. This method of water control proved to be ineffective as beavers were able to block water passage through the pipes. The beaver pipes were ultimately removed completely, and a much larger 20" [...] culvert pipe was installed through the dam and encased with hog wire fencing to prevent beavers from stuffing the pipe full of timber to block water passage. Over {{the course of a}} single year, beavers were able to dam the area around the hog wire fencing and again gain control of the <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Work is ongoing to try and reach a <b>permanent</b> solution to <b>water</b> <b>level</b> control on Hunt Lake.|$|R
40|$|The {{relocation}} of the East Fork of the White Lick involved {{the implementation of}} alluvial natural channel design to create a stable channel. However the 404 water quality permitting required that the relocated East Fork have equal or improved biological characteristics as before. The measures of success were fish and macro-invertebrate populations. Pre-project biological sampling fish kills associated with summer algae blooms. There was a paucity of piscivorous species attributed {{to the lack of}} habitat that could recruit and sustain bass species. This lack of habitat was a functional blockage to piscivorous fish migration from downriver, which was remedied with this project. A well defined meander channel was designed with rootwads installed well below <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> on the pool banks. This would supply the feeding and resting habitat for bass. Refugia and other habitat types were provided through a wide expansion of lateral habitat. Theoretically, lateral habitat would increase the number and age distribution of individuals in a species. Abandoned river a heavy load from road drainage and an oxbow pond with a heavy load from road drainage and an oxbow wetland for a light road runoff. The oxbow wetland was well connected to the East Fork. Tributaries were rebuilt with distinct riffle pool sequences to support intermittent flow, ephemeral runoff and backwater flooding, which provided for short term feeding migrations. When the road ditched and tributaries entered the floodpain, they wandered around like Yazoo channels for quite some distance before their confluence with the East Fork. These side channels provided refugia for temporary fish migration during floods. Post-construction biologic sampling indicated significantly improved piscivorous and macro-invertebrate populations. A wide size distribution for largemouth bass resulted, but with a narrow size distribution on smallmouth bass...|$|R

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} factors driving outcomes in markets for <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> – An Australian case study Prices paid {{in the market}} for <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> within the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District in Australia have increased by 15 % p. a. over the last ten years. This is less than half the increase that has taken place {{in the market for}} temporary water during the same period. Regression analyses show very few relationships between commodity prices and prices of <b>permanent</b> <b>water,</b> with only wine grape prices having a significant positive influence on price. Correlation analyses show strong negative correlations between commodity prices and the price of <b>permanent</b> <b>water,</b> especially with dairy products, which is the main high value industry within the district. The major factors influencing the price of <b>water</b> in the <b>permanent</b> market are: the price in the market for temporary <b>water,</b> the <b>level</b> of seasonal allocation, vine grape prices and interest rates.

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) backscattering coefficients {{have been used to}} distinguish vegetation types, to monitor flood conditions, and to assess soil moisture variations over the wetlands. Here, we attempted to estimate spatio-temporal <b>water</b> <b>level</b> variations over the central Congo mainstem covered with aquatic plants using the backscattering coefficients from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) Scanning SAR (ScanSAR) images and <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> from Envisat altimetry data. First, <b>permanent</b> open <b>water,</b> forest, macrophytes, and herbaceous plants have been classified over the central Congo Basin based on statistics of the backscattering coefficient values. Second, we generated multi-temporal <b>water</b> <b>level</b> maps over part of the Congo mainstem based on the relationship between Envisat altimetry-derived river-level changes and PALSAR ScanSAR backscattering coefficient variations.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of fish has decimated many amphibian populations through increased predation, primarily on their larvae. Some amphibian species now occupy marginal habitats {{as a response}} to the presence of introduced fish predators. Such habitats may include ephemeral water bodies where fish do not usually occur, although breeding in these suboptimal environments may incur some cost to a species if its larvae are not adapted to develop under these conditions. We investigated this scenario of amphibian decline using the endangered green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and the introduced mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) in a factorial experiment to determine the responses of tadpoles to declining <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> and the introduced predator. Tadpoles metamorphosed asynchronously but did not accelerate development in declining water or when housed with mosquitofish. Mass at metamorphosis was 30 % less in declining water. Mass increased with time to metamorphosis in constant water-level treatments, but decreased in declining water. Tadpoles did not respond to mosquitofish and were therefore assumed to be naive to this predator. These results suggest that ephemeral habitats may be suboptimal for breeding, and tadpoles appear better suited to develop in <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> bodies free of introduced fish. Intra-clutch variability in larval development (i. e. bet-hedging) may allow L. aurea to cope with unpredictable pond duration, whereby even <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> bodies may occasionally dry out. The responses observed in L. aurea suggest that introduced fish may have reduced the suitability of <b>permanent</b> <b>water</b> bodies as breeding sites for other pond-breeding amphibian species. The use of less favourable ephemeral habitats as breeding sites may be responsible for some of the declines reported in amphibians since the 1970 s...|$|R
