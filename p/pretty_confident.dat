500|$|Hughes won the grudge {{match against}} Serra at UFC 98: Evans vs. Machida via {{unanimous}} decision. In the first round, both fighters collided heads, and Hughes got {{the worst of}} it. Despite this, Serra could not finish the fight and Hughes recovered rapidly. In the second stanza, Hughes controlled his opponent {{on the ground with}} his wrestling skills. The final round saw the former champions taking each other down and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, I was <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> I was going to get my hand raised. Some people have asked why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He also told me that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry". After the fight Hughes said, [...] "I think I have a few more fights left in me." ...|$|E

[...] She faced {{criticism}} {{from her parents}} over her decision to marry and start a large family so young. [...] She also felt snubbed by her peers, {{at a time when}} the feminist movement was blooming and educated women were establishing careers. [...] She later said, [...] "My parents were questioning my choices, my peers were. But [...] I was pretty resolute, <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> in what I was doing." [...] She taught early morning seminary to them and other children while her husband worked, first in business, then in politics. [...] She wanted to go on for a master's degree, perhaps in art history, but first taking care of her children, and later her health issues, forestalled that. [...] She was active in the local PTA and with the League of Women Voters. [...] With a friend, she held local cooking classes for a brief period. [...] Naturally athletic, she began playing tennis and became one of the best players around the local country clubs.|$|E

His other friends are his dog, Loki, and Hilde, the <b>pretty</b> and <b>confident</b> daughter of Ralf Eiriksson, a nearby farmer.|$|R
5000|$|The Saxon {{court in}} Dresden favoured a {{marriage}} between Joseph and Maria Kunigunde, {{if only because}} he might help the Saxons solve their financial difficulties. A [...] "secret" [...] dinner meeting was arranged between the two at Teplice in Bohemia. However, Maria Kunigunde hardly said a word during this meal and Joseph decided she was too timid to be his bride. He married her first cousin, Maria Josepha of Bavaria, whom he considered not very <b>pretty,</b> but <b>confident.</b> Maria Josepha's marriage was an unhappy one; Maria Kunigunde was spared this fate. However, {{the story of her}} failed [...] "secret" [...] meeting in Bohemia spread around the European courts, making it almost impossible to arrange a suitable marriage for her.|$|R

500|$|Da Matta {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his third win of the season; the victory earned him $1 million. He was happy with the result: [...] "I was <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> {{in the car and}} could go flat down to the end. You need to be a little lucky, being {{in the right place at}} the right time. For everybody, it's a very exciting race. We were racing all together all the time." [...] Da Matta stated he did not want to lead the race with two laps remaining because of the draft and believed there would be a larger battle for the victory. Second-place finisher Papis said his team were planning a new strategy after the race's distance was reduced and had been looking forward to further racing and congratulated Da Matta on winning the race. Tagliani, who finished in third, revealed that he lifted from his accelerator pedal and ran in fifth gear on the backstraight and stated it was about conserving fuel and avoiding being caught in any incidents. He said the final ten laps felt like qualifying lap times and felt the race before then was [...] "kind of boring, just driving around and around." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the return}} of Micky Adams as Port Vale manager, Tomlinson held on to his first team place {{at the start of}} the 2011–12 season, though Martin was used in cup games. Neither Tomlinson or Martin could find the {{consistency}} to secure their first team place though; Tomlinson conceded twelve goals in his first seven games of the season, whilst Martin conceded ten times in his first five games. Assistant manager Mark Grew told the media that [...] "they've both been disappointing". On 29 October, Tomlinson was embarrassed to be caught off his line by Oxford United's Peter Leven, who found the net with a 'sensational 45-yard strike'. Adams said [...] "...in the division, he's the only player who would have scored that... you have to question the keeper's starting position." [...] He was still preferred to Martin though, and only a thigh injury kept him out of two league games in January. He returned to the first team, and was heading for a third consecutive clean sheet on 14 February when he committed an [...] "injury-time howler" [...] to allow Bradford City a share of the points at Valley Parade. On 10 March he spilled a cross to hand Barnet striker Ben May an easy winner at Vale Park. He vowed to improve his consistency, saying [...] "I'm a <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> person and it will take a lot to stop me bouncing back." [...] At the end of the season he rejected the club's offer of a new contract, and his departure was announced on 3 July. He said that he was [...] "not particularly worried" [...] about his free agent status, and that he would turn down similar offers from other clubs and wait until as late as the start of the following season until the [...] "right opportunity" [...] came about.|$|E
500|$|At a Senate {{hearing on}} September 9, 2014, Acting VA Inspector General Richard J. Griffin {{reported}} that investigations are continuing into the Phoenix VA, including {{a review of}} [...] "possible criminal misconduct by VA senior hospital leadership". Griffin also reported that [...] "Since July 2005, OIG published 20 oversight reports on VA patient wait times and access to care yet VHA did not effectively address its access to care issues or stop the use of inappropriate scheduling procedures. When VHA concurred with our recommendations and submitted an action plan, VA medical facility directors {{did not take the}} necessary actions to comply with VHA’s program directives and policy changes." [...] In his spoken testimony, Griffin said that in [...] "three-fourths (of the VA facilities investigated for falsification of wait time data), we're <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that it was knowingly and willingly happening, and we're pursuing those." [...] He also said he hopes to complete his office's investigations into possible criminal misconduct by the end of 2014. If his office finds criminal misconduct, it will then refer cases to U.S. attorneys for possible prosecution. Senator Richard Burr said that the [...] "culture that has developed at VA and the lack of management and accountability is simply reprehensible." [...] In his testimony, Secretary Bob McDonald apologized [...] "to all Veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care at the Phoenix facility, and across the country. We at VA are committed to fixing the problems and consistently providing the high quality care our Veterans have earned and deserve in order to improve their health and well-being." [...] He discussed actions taken at the Phoenix VA facility in response to Inspector General findings, and he discussed national initiatives to change VA's culture, measure patient satisfaction, improve access to care, and improve accountability (including a restructuring of the Office of Medical Inspector).|$|E
5000|$|Through {{the ghost}} of Kim Tae-yeon's eyes, we see a {{flashback}} of what really happened. Tae-yeon, who looks exactly like the student {{from the beginning of}} the movie; <b>pretty,</b> talented, and <b>confident</b> (indeed, the audience is led to believe there really wasn't a student to begin with, but rather Mi-ju hallucinating events), is the more talented cello player. It is Tae-yeon, not Mi-ju, who was the more talented, sweet, and [...] "better" [...] student. After the final humiliation of Tae-yeon being chosen over her, Mi-ju swerves while driving them home and crashes the car by a steep incline off the road. Tae-yeon is thrown from the car and is barely holding on from falling off the side of the cliff. Mi-ju grabs her friend's hand but eventually lets Tae-yeon fall to her death.|$|R
5000|$|Shi Xinhui {{became the}} fourth artiste to release an album after Project Superstar Overall Champion Tan Wei Lian, Kelly Poon and Hong Jun Yang. Her debut album 从台北到北京 consist of four {{original}} tracks, five covers and a cover duet with Kelvin Wei Lian. She even penned the lyrics for her album's no. 1 hit, 从台北到北京 / From Taipei To Beijing (which is {{a cover of}} popular Danish group, Infernal's [...] "From Paris to Berlin"). The song 从台北到北京 was an instant hit with the listeners and became popular as ringtone downloads and received frequent airplay on radio stations {{as well as in}} pubs or night hangouts because of its strong rhythmic techno nature. Her music video for the song From Taipei To Beijing became a hot topic in local newspapers and the online community after a 25-second video was leaked onto the popular video sharing website, YouTube. The video had more than 40,000 hits [...] and she made a stunning return from her reclusion from the industry after almost one year of hiatus while she has been preparing for her debut album. It was shocking for those who had always regarded her as the girl next door because of her demure looks and her plain dress sense and could not accept this major change. Following her debut release, she also became more <b>confident,</b> <b>pretty</b> and fashionable and has shown to critics that she has better fashion sense [...] now after vicious remarks and criticisms were directed at her during her competition days. She was also hailed as Singapore's version of popular and sexy Japanese singer, Kumi Koda by her record company. [...] Her popularity in Singapore landed her on the cover of a few magazines and many other magazine articles and spreads. Her immense popularity even as a debut singer made her {{the talk of the town}} for quite a while. Although there is a shift of focus onto her music video and her dressing, the album received good feedback from music professionals and media where most reviews gave her at least 3/5 stars with some as high as 4.5/5 stars because of her steely and emotive delivery which is rare for a newcomer. It also achieved good sales results especially for a newcomer and thus proving her popularity not just in Singapore but also the Malaysia regions. Shi Xin Hui was also ranked as top five Asian pop singer and top five personalities in 2006 by Singapore's premier and most prestigious English newspaper, The Straits Times together with the likes of Asian superstars David Tao and Andy Lau.|$|R

He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them." ...|$|E

Every one knows he has a good estate, so I have nothing to say against him, except that I see he is doing his best to upset my special plans.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is the}} law, as it stands; but we mean {{to alter}} it all. We have got so many votes now, as {{to be sure to}} have both parties with us at the gin'ral election; and give us the Governor on our side, with the sartainty of votes enough to turn an election, and we're <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> of success. Votes is all that is wanting, in a truly free country, for men to have things pretty much in their own way." ...|$|E

But I foresee that, should there be trouble, it is not of your own safety you will be thinking." ...|$|E
60|$|When within {{half a mile}} of the Danish camp Edmund and Egbert {{left the}} band and {{advanced}} alone. They were <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that they should find but few of the Danes near {{the bank of the}} river, for the arrows from the walls of Paris carried some distance beyond it, and the Northmen consequently encamped some hundred yards away. They had to pick their way carefully, for the ships were moored along the bank, their ropes being fastened to great stakes driven into the ground.|$|E
60|$|In {{an hour or}} so we came to {{the solitary}} farm of a Mr Green, who regaled us with a sumptuous breakfast, and lent me a spur. I had the liberal offer of two spurs, but as, in hunting with the rifle, it is {{sometimes}} advisable to sit on one's right heel, and memory during the excitement of the chase is apt to prove faithless, I contented myself with one spur,--feeling <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that if I persuaded the left side of my horse to go, the right side could not well remain behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not it," [...] Adolphe {{answered}} confidently. [...] "Why, {{from the}} shore it will look awash with the water. No one will ever dream {{that there could be}} a soul alive underneath it. I begin to think you will do it, monsieur. At first it seemed hopeless. Now I really do think there is a chance. I should feel <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> if it was you and two of us who had to do it; but the difficulty will be to get the young ladies under it, and then to get them to lie quiet there." ...|$|E

It was {{well for us}} we had both been {{tramping}} half our lives, and that our legs had saved our necks more times than once on the prairies. We were both <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> we could run sixteen miles in two hours. But we dared not run straight. We knew that if they found we were keeping a line, they would let the dog go their best pace and gallop alongside; {{so we had to}} zigzag, sometimes going almost back upon our own track. We did not do this so often as we should have done if we had had more time." ...|$|E
60|$|Then our porter said {{he thought}} that must be it on the {{high-level}} platform; {{said he thought}} he knew the train. So {{we went to the}} high-level platform, and saw the engine-driver, and asked him {{if he was going to}} Kingston. He said he couldn’t say for certain of course, but that he rather thought he was. Anyhow, if he wasn’t the 11.5 for Kingston, he said he was <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> he was the 9.32 for Virginia Water, or the 10 a.m. express for the Isle of Wight, or somewhere in that direction, and we should all know when we got there.

It is just the place a bear would choose, for he might reckon <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that there weren't no chance of his being disturbed. Well, we went on beyond that, and two miles lower the cañon opened again, and five minutes took us down on to the bank of the Colorado. There was no great room between the river and the cliff, but there were some good-sized trees there, and plenty of bush growing up some distance. We caught sight of another bear, but as we did not want him we left him alone." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy was {{sufficiently}} trained in woodcraft to feel <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> of finding his way, for {{he knew the}} north side of trees by their bark, and could find out the north star when the sky was clear, besides possessing a sort of natural aptitude for holding on in a straight line. He mounted the obstinate horse, therefore, took the rein of the obedient pony on his right arm, and, casting a last look of profound regret on Bevan's desolated homestead, rode swiftly away. So eager was he that he took no thought for the morrow. He knew that the wallet slung at his saddle-bow contained a small supply of food--as much, probably, as would last three days with care. That was enough to render Tolly Trevor the most independent and careless youth in Oregon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} {{remember}} that our army is a very raw one. A large proportion of it is newly raised, and though {{there may be a}} few men here who fought in Egypt, the great bulk have never seen a shot fired in earnest; while, on the other hand, the French have been fighting all over Europe. They are accustomed to victory, and are confident in their own valour and discipline. Our officers are as raw as our men, and we must expect that all sorts of blunders will be made at first. I can tell you that I am very well satisfied that our first battle is going to be fought with the odds greatly on our side. In six months I should feel <b>pretty</b> <b>confident,</b> even if the French had the same odds on their side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{would shoot}} us down at their leisure, Wilfrid. No, {{that is not}} to be thought of. We must run the risk of fire now; and I feel, as I said, <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that we are too good shots to let men with fire get up to the walls. I wish we could send down word to Mitford's that we are besieged here. Of course, if he is {{attacked}} himself he could not help us, but if he is not I know he would come out at once with a strong party to our relief. I wonder whether that native boy of yours would try to carry a message. None of us would have a chance of getting through, but these fellows can crawl like snakes; and by working up through the crops to {{the upper end of the}} glade he might gain the bush unobserved." ...|$|E

You will not suspect me of being wanting in love to you, if I say that the contemplation {{of what might have}} {{happened}} presented such a scene of desolation, such a void, that it would have required all the strength I possess to turn to God in resignation and submission to His will. I have often, very often, thought of that illness at Geneva, but this brought it home to me, perhaps closer still; and I hope I shall never cease to be mindful of, and thankful for, this special providence.

60|$|I {{was born}} in Quebec, between the years 1792 and 1794; {{probably}} in 1793. Of the rank of my father in the regiment, I am unable to speak, though I feel <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> he was a commissioned officer. He was much with the prince; and I remember that, on parade, where I have often seen him, {{he was in the}} habit of passing frequently from the prince to the ranks--a circumstance that induces my old shipmate to think he may have been the adjutant. My father, I have always understood, was a native of Hanover, and the son of a clergyman in that country. My mother, also, was said to be a German, though very little is now known of her by any of the family. She is described to me as living much alone, as being occupied in pursuits very different from those of my father, and as being greatly averse to the life of a soldier.|$|E
60|$|Emma {{could not}} feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper {{direction}} {{and raised the}} gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> of creating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, {{that she could not}} suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.|$|E

If so, I think that we may feel <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that we shall, at any rate, in the first place, carry off Miss Greendale and her maid. The danger won't be in the attack, but in the retreat. That Obi fellow may raise the whole country against us. There is one thing--the population is scanty up here, and it won't be until we get down towards the lower ground {{that they will be able}} to muster strongly enough to be really formidable; but we may have to fight hard to get down to the boats. You see, it is a twenty miles' march. We shan't be able to go very fast, for, although Miss Greendale and her maid might keep up well for some distance, they would be worn out long before we got to the shore, while the black fellows would be able to travel by other paths, and to arouse the villagers as they went, and make it very hot indeed for us." ...|$|E
60|$|Very {{slowly the}} boat drifted along her course, {{assisted}} occasionally {{by the men}} pushing with their poles against {{the foot of the}} wall that rose a few feet from them, while those with the fender stood in readiness to place them in position should the ship approach so close to the wall as to render contact probable. The captain was now at the tiller, the way given her by the poles being sufficient to enable him to keep her on her course close to the wall. Another quarter of an hour and they were {{at the end of the}} wall, for the forts at the entrance were detached. They were now approaching the most dangerous portion of the passage; they were no longer sheltered in the shadow, but must go along openly. It was, however, improbable that there would be sentries on the face of the fort looking towards the town, and Ned, accustomed as he was to keep watch on deck at night, could scarce make out the low shore a few yards away, and felt <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that the eyes of the sleepy sentries would not be able to pierce the gloom.|$|E
60|$|Until {{the people}} who try to help realise this, their well-intentioned efforts will be futile, and they will present a {{spectacle}} fit only to set Olympus laughing. I have gone through an exhibition of Japanese art, got up for the poor of Whitechapel with the idea of elevating them, of begetting in them yearnings for the Beautiful and True and Good. Granting (what is not so) that the poor folk are thus taught to know and yearn after the Beautiful and True and Good, the foul facts of their existence and the social law that dooms one in three to a public-charity death, demonstrate that this knowledge and yearning will be only so much of an added curse to them. They will have so much more to forget than if they had never known and yearned. Did Destiny to-day bind me down to the life of an East End slave {{for the rest of my}} years, and did Destiny grant me but one wish, I should ask that I might forget all about the Beautiful and True and Good; that I might forget all I had learned from the open books, and forget the people I had known, the things I had heard, and the lands I had seen. And if Destiny didn't grant it, I am <b>pretty</b> <b>confident</b> that I should get drunk and forget it as often as possible.|$|E
