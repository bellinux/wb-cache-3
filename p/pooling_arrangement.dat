2500|$|Throughout {{the spring}} of 1877, heads {{of the four major}} U.S. trunk lines — the B&O, the New York Central, the Erie and the Pennsylvania — held {{meetings}} to determine how, by working together, they could all [...] "earn more and … spend less". The initial fruits of these meetings was a freight <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangement</b> along lines similar to Gowen's anthracite combination, to increase revenues by reducing competition. They also determined that, after Gowen's defeating the BLE, a reduction in rail workers' wages was timely. The Pennsylvania {{was the first of the}} four to act, announcing an across-the-board wage cut of 10 per cent, effective June 1, 1877. Cuts on other roads — not just the four trunk lines — followed, affecting rail workers nationwide. The B&O's 10 per cent cut precipitated, in July 1877, a work stoppage in Martinsburg, West Virginia, which multiplied with telegraphic speed into the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. The Great Strike flashed from coast to coast; workers on railroad after railroad, in city after city, struck as well, forcing a halt to all rail activity in or through numerous locales, and in some places triggering general non-railroad work stoppages. Interstate commerce was paralyzed for weeks. As the Strike spread, destructive and deadly violence erupted in some major cities — Baltimore; Pittsburgh, Reading and Scranton, Pennsylvania; Buffalo, Chicago, and San Francisco. Almost immediately upon his return from Europe, on the very day the Great Strike broke out, Gowen instituted massive layoffs of brakemen across the railroad, in effect both sanctioning and reinforcing the other railroads' moves while he was gone. In Reading, back in April and May, striking BLE engineers had been quickly displaced by strikebreakers and then blacklisted—but the strikebreakers, as well as other workers, were not paid by the cash-strapped Reading Railroad from May through mid-July. While the Great Strike gathered momentum, Gowen found the money to pay back wages in Reading. Local outrage at Gowen and the Reading was intensified as newly laid-off brakemen swelled the ranks of unemployed railroad men and strikebreakers saw their wages as a transparent effort to buy loyalty.|$|E

40|$|Although comanagement {{is gaining}} {{increasing}} attention {{as a way}} to manage fisheries, few studies have attempted to understand quantitatively which factors of comanagement are critical for their success. This study investigates fishery comanagement regimes adopted by coastal fisheries in Japan. Utilizing a wide variety of examples of fishery comanagement nationwide, we search for key rules and measures that underlie traditional, cultural, and social aspects of comanagement. The study focuses on {{the rules of the game}} adopted by comanaging groups called fishery management organizations (FMOs). Upon examination of successful fishery comanagement cases, we found two distinctive measures: effort coordination and <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> are vital supporting measure for effective effort coordination, in which case having both of these two measures rather than only either one may be the key for successful fishery comanagement. We test this hypothesis with two sets of data. One is Japans fishery census, which was published by the government and offers a large sample size but lacks information on effort coordination. Another is data from a survey designed and conducted by the authors to supplement the information on effort coordination and other self-imposed regulations. Our results show that (1) merely establishing comanaging groups such as FMOs has limited effect; (2) FMOs that establish <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> earn greater revenue from their fishing efforts, particularly when such <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> are combined with effort-coordination; and (3) <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> and effort coordination coupled with marketing activities result in the greatest revenue.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} understanding intellectual sharing/pooling arrangements {{and the construction of}} cultural commons arrangements. We argue that an adaptation of the approach pioneered by Elinor Ostrom and collaborators to commons arrangements in the natural environment may provide a template for the examination of constructed commons in the cultural environment. We thus argue in favor of an approach to understanding the institutional features of commons and <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> through case studies {{from a wide range of}} disciplines. Such an approach promises to lead to a better understanding of how participants in commons and <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> structure their interactions in relation to the environment(s) within which they are embedded and with which they share interdependent relationships. We propose a framework for evaluating the contours of different <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangements</b> with an eye toward developing an understanding of the structural differences across arrangements and industries as well as the underlying contextual reasons for such differences. Among other things, we argue that a theoretical approach to cultural constructed commons should consider rules pertaining to membership criteria, contribution and use of pooled resources, internal licensing conditions, management of external relationships, and institutional form along with the degree of collaboration among members, sharing of human capital, degrees of integration among participants, and whether there is a specified purpose to the arrangement.

By that time, a critical shortage of alarm clocks had developed due to older clocks wearing out or breaking down. Workers were late for, or missed completely, their scheduled shifts in jobs critical to the war effort.

50|$|The Lord Chamberlain's Men {{departed}} the Curtain {{when the}} Globe Theatre, which they built {{to replace the}} Theatre, was ready for use in 1599. For seven years Henry Lanman (owner of the Curtain) had an agreement with James Burbage (owner of the Theatre) that all profit would be shared between them. This deal is how many believe Lanman was {{able to afford to}} open the Curtain, the rest is all very unclear. J. Leeds Barroll focuses in Shakespeare studies: An annual gathering of Research, Criticism and Reviews on the fact that Henry Lanman had offered the Curtain as an easer to James Burbage, proprietor of the Theatre. Thereby, he assumes that Lanman’s business, the Curtain, must have been doing as well as Burbage’s business, the Theatre, since both, Lanman and Burbage, had agreed on a <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangement</b> for seven years in 1585, to pool profits. As far as is known, Lanman ran the Curtain as a private concern for the first phase of its existence; He died in 1606 and it is assumed by Edmund Chambers that the theatre had been re-arranged into a shareholder’s enterprise before his death at some point. Thomas Pope, one of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, owned a share in the Curtain and left it to his heirs in his last will and testament in 1603. King's Men member John Underwood did the same in 1624. The fact that both of these shareholders belonged to Shakespeare's company may indicate that the re-organization of the Curtain occurred when the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting there. Otherwise, it would be very unwise of Burbage to pool profits if he did better in the first place. Thus, the suggestion is given that both proprietors were doing equal business. Burbage's father Richard had shares in the theatre {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

Conceptually it is seen as an alternative to centralized command-and-control regulations, as well as individually privatized system such as ITQs. Despite the increasing attention by various stakeholders, fishery co-management has not been adequately studied in economics. Previous studies have relied on case studies which precludes systematic comparison across heterogeneous institutions. To address this problem, the paper analyzes fishery co-management organizations (FMOs) in Japan. Japan is an ideal setting to study these questions because there are 1, 600 + FMOs with different management types. We focus on two types of management measures: effort coordination and pooling arrangements. We analyze the characteristics of these FMOs and their management performances and found that FMOs with both effort coordination and <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangement</b> outperformed FMOs with either only effort coordination or <b>pooling</b> <b>arrangement,</b> or none.
