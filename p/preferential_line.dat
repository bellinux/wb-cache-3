40|$|We used {{solution}} NMR {{experiments to}} analyze the conformation of an isolated peptide spanning the JM-A segment (residues 652 - 666). The secondary structure for the peptide was determined based on sequential connectivities inferred from the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) (Figure S 2 A and S 2 B), as well as Hα and Cα chemical shift values (Figure S 2 C and S 2 D). The presence of dNN(i, i+ 1) dαN(i, i+ 1) dαN(i, i+ 3) and dβN(i, i+ 1) NOE connectivities, and the up-field Hα chemical shift and down-field Cα chemical shift values with respect to random-coil values indicate that the JM-A segment has a significant population in the helical conformation throughout {{the length of the}} peptide (Wishart et al., 1992; Wüthrich, 1996). Isolated peptide fragments that form transient α−helices in solution are expected to be α−helical in the intact protein (Dyson et al., 1992). The shift in the apparent KD for JM-kinase dimerization from ~ 200 nM to> 8 μM upon deletion of the JM-A segment suggests that the KD for dimerization of the JM-A segment alone is ~ 2 mM or lower, assuming additivity. TOCSY spectra were acquired for the peptide at concentrations of 0. 2 mM, 0. 5 mM and 2 mM peptide under identical conditions. We observed concentration dependent line broadening for the methyl groups of leucine and valine (Figure S 2 E). The <b>preferential</b> <b>line</b> broadening of the Val and Leu methyl group resonances at higher concentration is consistent with concentration dependent oligomerization.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{feasibility}} of the detection of the 21 cm forest in the diffuse IGM with the radio telescope LOFAR. The optical depth to the 21 cm line has been derived using simulations of reionization which include detailed radiative transfer of ionizing photons. We find that the spectra from reionization models with similar total comoving hydrogen ionizing emissivity but different frequency distribution look remarkably similar. Thus, unless the reionization histories {{are very different from}} each other (e. g. a predominance of UV vs. x-ray heating) we do not expect to distinguish them by means of observations of the 21 cm forest. Because the presence of a strong x-ray background would make the detection of 21 cm line absorption impossible, the lack of absorption {{could be used as a}} probe of the presence/intensity of the x-ray background and the thermal history of the universe. Along a random line of sight LOFAR could detect a global suppression of the spectrum from z> 12, when the IGM is still mostly neutral and cold, in contrast with the more well-defined, albeit broad, absorption features visible at lower redshift. Sharp, strong absorption features associated with rare, high density pockets of gas could be detected also at z~ 7 along <b>preferential</b> <b>lines</b> of sight. Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures.

In Italy, the reform was undertaken through a governmental regulation and was implemented in the academic year 1999 - 2000. In Spain, the process has been completely different and, almost ten years after, university transformation has not been undertaken yet. In this work we present a comparison between both countries {{regarding the}} way in which such transformation has been or is to be undertaken —by the teaching staff— for measuring the work of students to pass subjects in ECTS (European Credit Transfer System). With that purpose, we have attempted to obtain information about the way in which professors implement these transformations in their everyday work. Professors in Technical Teachings (Engineering) have been consulted in both Italy and Spain. The research has been structured into two stages. The first was developed in a three-month stay, from September to December 2006. In this stage, it was studied the process followed in Italy. To do this, a questionnaire was designed and it was given out to professionals of teaching engineering in Italy; the results obtained allowed us establishing interesting conclusions.

Manual {{cross-pollination}} using male-sterile plants to produce large quantities of hybrid seed is difficult and time-consuming because of the low success rate in cross-pollination. Insect pollinators may be suitable vectors to transfer pollen, but the most suitable vector for pollen transfer from the male parent to the female parent has not been identified for soybean. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate seed-set on four male-sterile, female-fertile soybean lines by using alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata (F.)) and honey bees (Apis mellifera (L.)) as pollinators. Seed-set was evaluated in summers 2003 and 2005 near Ames, Iowa, USA and in summers 2003, 2004, and 2005 near Wooster, Ohio, USA. Neither the effect of pollinator species nor the interaction effect of pollinator species×location was significant for any year. Honey bees performed similarly to alfalfa leafcutting bees at both locations.

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{have defined}} over 150 genomic regions unequivocally containing variation predisposing to immune-mediated disease. Inferring disease biology from these observations, however, hinges on {{our ability to}} discover the molecular processes being perturbed by these risk variants. It has previously been observed that different genes harboring causal mutations for the same Mendelian disease often physically interact. We sought to evaluate {{the degree to which}} this is true of genes within strongly associated loci in complex disease. Using sets of loci defined in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease (CD) GWAS, we build protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for genes within associated loci and find abundant physical interactions between protein products of associated genes. We apply multiple permutation approaches to show that these networks are more densely connected than chance expectation. To confirm biological relevance, we show that the components of the networks tend to be expressed in similar tissues relevant to the phenotypes in question, suggesting the network indicates common underlying processes perturbed by risk loci. Furthermore, we show that the RA and CD networks have predictive power by demonstrating that proteins in these networks, not encoded in the confirmed list of disease associated loci, are significantly enriched for association to the phenotypes in question in extended GWAS analysis. Finally, we test our method in 3 non-immune traits to assess its applicability to complex traits in general. We find that genes in loci associated to height and lipid levels assemble into significantly connected networks but did not detect excess connectivity among Type 2 Diabetes (T 2 D) loci beyond chance. Taken together, our results constitute evidence that, for many of the complex diseases studied here, common genetic associations implicate regions encoding proteins that physically interact in a <b>preferential</b> manner, in <b>line</b> with observations in Mendelian disease...|$|R

In particular, the study focuses on the inactive cliff of Torre dell'Orso inlet which hosts a 150  m - wide beach and a high dune belt. The survey detected the cliff/wave-cut platform junction at about 3. 8  m below m. s. l. The platform is covered by a dune/beach sedimentary cover about 7  m thick. The collated data along with the available local sea level curves allow to reconstruct Otranto's cliff evolution as the result of late Holocene relative sea-level change due to eustasy and land motions. Cliff development was promoted by a sea still-stand level at about 3. 5  m below present mean sea level occurred between 3400 and 2400 years BP. A rapid sea level rise followed so that several tracts of cliffs were partly drowned becoming plunging cliffs. Cliff recession followed fast sea level rise only along <b>preferential</b> groundwater flow <b>lines</b> where hyperkarst process, due to fresh/salt water mixing, produced deep notches in the calcarenite bedrock inducing rock falls and cliff recession. This process is responsible for the indentation of present shoreline. Finally, during the last four centuries a wide beach and a high dune belt formed at Torre dell'Orso inlet {{as a result of the}} increased carry load of Ofanto River, so that the plunging cliff has been separated by shoreline becoming an inactive cliff. Finally, comparing the reconstructed local sea level history during the late Holocene with the available sea level curves produced by glacio-hydro-isostastic models, a yo-yoing land motion with a period of about 4500 years and amplitude of about 2 m can be inferred for the eastern coast of Salento peninsula...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{commodity}} {{tax system}} is fiscally decentralized: state, county, and municipal governments have taxing authority. Geographic borders create “lines,”' which are demarcations of goods into different tax rate categories; tax rates change discontinuously at lines. A discontinuous change in tax liabilities is a “notch”' {{and results in}} deadweight loss from cross-border shopping and tax driven product innovation. This dissertation studies the consequences of lines and notches on tax competition and utilizes variation in local taxes to understand tax policy. The dissertation focuses on sales taxation, but the theories and empirical methodologies are informative for tax policy more generally and are applicable to issues of <b>preferential</b> taxation, optimal <b>line</b> drawing, and time and characteristic notches. Chapter II extends the standard model of sales tax competition to allow for tax rates to vary not only across states, but within states. I demonstrate that municipal sales taxes are lower in level terms on the high-tax side of a state border relative to municipal sales taxes on the low-tax side of a border. Using a new methodology for studying municipal responses to discontinuities, I show that municipal taxes are a function of distance to the nearest state border. After accounting for differences in tax rates within a state, discontinuous tax changes at borders become smaller. Chapter III answers whether geographic differentiation of tax rates is optimal from a state government's perspective. I demonstrate that under relatively weak assumptions, differentiation of tax rates is almost always optimal. Replacing a large distortion with many smaller distortions everywhere is optimal from a social welfare perspective. Chapter IV studies how municipal governments react to county tax rates. Using an identification strategy grounded in a theoretical model, I identify strategic reaction functions. Jurisdictions mimic the tax rates of their neighbors. I also demonstrate [...] unlike state-federal reaction functions estimated in the literature [...] that a higher county tax rate implies strategically lower municipal tax rates. The results in this dissertation imply that fiscal federalism and both spatial location and spatial interaction {{must be considered in}} order to understand tax competition and optimal commodity taxation...|$|R

However, after successfully inserting the plasmid, the cell line failed to proliferate. Ultimately, a 73 % CD 133 phenotypic knockdown was achieved using RNAi technology from Santa Cruz, with 50 % CD 133 re-expression within 5 days, confirmation by both PCR and flow cytometry. Knockdown of CD 133 in Caco- 2 cells. resulted in no change in proliferation or adhesive properties to plastic, however a slight increase in cell cycle activity was observed. Gene profiling of CD 133 knocked down Caco- 2 and control cells was carried out using microarray technology. This was also applied to cells incubated with monoclonal antibodies against epitopes of CD 133, as these are often used as a means of cell isolation for CD 133 functional studies. A variety of genes were up and down regulated in both groups when compared to the control cells. CD 133 knockdown caused an up-regulation of genes associated with cell migration, motility, cell cycle, Wnt and tyrosine kinase pathway inhibitors and lipid transport across the membrane and down-regulated cell adhesion genes and apoptotic related genes. Caco- 2 cells incubated with monoclonal antibodies against CD 133 showed up regulation in genes associated with cell cycle, migration and DNA replication and down regulation of genes associated with regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. This result is significant due to the extensive use ofCD 133 antibodies in functional CD 133 and CD 133 + cell population studies. Confocal studies showed partial co-localisation between the lipid rafts and CD 133, removal of the lipid rafts using the drug Beta Methyl Cyclodextrine caused loss of CD 133. However, lipid raft expression remained relatively constant on CD 133 knockdown cells. Examining the distribution of CD 133 on Caco- 2 cells adhered to fibronectin compared to glass via confocal analysis, showed there is no direct involvement of CD 133 with anchorage type cell adhesion. However, considering the confocal analysis showing the association of CD 133 within lipid rafts and the results of microarray, this would imply a more indirect role of CD 133 within the processes of cell adhesion. This study has revealed that that CD 133 plays a suppressive role in stem cell biology and play a regulatory role in maintaining quiescence, keeping the early stem and progenitor cells in a non proliferating, non motile state. A number of studies in recent years have attempted to determine the function of CD 133 which still remains relatively elusive. However, this study has contributed to a greater understanding of CD 133 function and identified key areas for further investigation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new medicines for inhalation requires a series of procedures including in-vitro tests using special testing devices, which simulate the human airways to assess the local deposition of drugs. Such tests require samples of the new drugs and the series of tests are costly and time-consuming. A numerical model for the two-phase flow inside the first chamber {{of one of these}} special devices, the Twin Impinger (TI), has been developed. Due to the effects of drag, gravity and virtual mass forces, computer-generated particles travel through the virtual TI, which was discretised using a structured mesh. An Eulerian model has been used to simulate the continuous phase and a Lagrangian stochastic eddy-interaction model (EIM) has been chosen to simulate the behaviour of the discrete phase. Aiming to reduce the uncertainty associated to turbulence modelling of the continuous phase in a complex flow, detailed experimental data has been taken for the mean and turbulent air velocity fields. These data have been obtained by the use of a 2 D Laser Doppler Anemometer, employing the continuity concept to generate the third velocity component. The interaction between particles was not considered because it was supposed that the particles were already dispersed enough inside the TI. Finding the Eulerian control volume where the particle was after each Lagrangian time-step was attained in a circular search around the previous particle position, in preferential directions, for the closest mesh node. The Eulerian cell values for the mean and turbulent velocity fields were assumed everywhere except near the wall, where the gradients are larger, and corrections in both the flow model and the EIM were required. The interaction between the particles and the walls of the TI considered a coefficient of restitution depending on the angle of impact of the particles, which were considered adhered if their kinetic energy after impact was not sufficient to compensate the van der Waals forces between the wall and the particle. A simple procedure to compute the distance between the particle and the near-wall velocity led to <b>preferential</b> deposition in <b>lines</b> orientated along the mesh, and the formation of unphysical particle clusters. Major improvements to the global model performance were obtained by the use of near-wall corrections in the EIM and employing a more elaborate algorithm for the wall distance.

40|$|Fundamental issues {{associated}} with addressing the UK housing shortage problem are climate change {{and the lack of}} usable building space. Conservation of old buildings, maintaining green land and a country filled with single walled older properties mean that the UK government has to retrofit existing older building stock. This would make a significant impact on reducing the carbon footprint of each household as well as to alleviate energy supply problems. The investigation of novel zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticulates in aqueous silane/siloxane oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions for practical exterior facade applications is presented. An initial emulsion was developed and optimised before further improvement through nanoparticulate incorporation was achieved. Nanoparticulates of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide were dispersed respectively using ultrasonication in n-isooctyltriethoxysilane before being incorporated into a base emulsion. Once formulations were optimised, applied studies and fundamental assessment of these emulsions were conducted. The aim of the work presented was to produce a practical facade emulsion {{that could be used in}} the retrofitting of existing building stock or for heritage remedial treatments. Initial research indicated that water was the governing factor in a diverse range of facade degradation mechanisms; improving water repellence, thermal envelope efficiency while reducing biofouling was recognised as being of key interest in this field. The study gives insight into aqueous water repellent emulsions, nanoparticulate integration by commercially practical means, and assessment of the attributes exhibited by such treatments. Rheological and morphological characterisation concluded that a gelled network structure is produced by the incorporation of the fabricated nanoparticulate colloids. The emulsions retained shear-thinning characteristics, ideal for deep treatment penetration to be achieved for porous silicate substrates. Accelerated ageing tests showed that the nanoparticulate emulsions were substantially more thermodynamically stable than the emulsion control while also being physically more stable due to surfactant-particulate stabilisation mechanisms of the polar phases. From further investigation it was also found that hydroxyl terminated siloxane could be integrated into these emulsions, helping to improve the ‘green credentials’ of such systems through the replacement of conventionally used trimethoxy terminated siloxanes, that release harmful methanol upon curing, thus substitution is <b>preferential</b> and in <b>line</b> with current European policy. Treatments improved thermal envelope efficiency of structures through the reduction of retained water in various forms including rising damp. Assessment was carried out using model houses exposed to various temperature and humidity scenarios under controlled heating. The findings showed that water was the root cause of heat loss and thus a key parameter when considering the improvement of a structures’ carbon footprint. These treatments allow water vapour to permeate out of a structure passively, reducing internal humidity issues including microbiological degradation and health related problems experienced by occupants. Investigation of bioreceptivity conducted though an 8 week algal culture streaming study concluded that treatments with < 0. 1 wt% of the aforementioned nanoparticulates could reduce biofouling through photo-induced sanitisation. Furthermore, it was also found that while water repellence may vary at the facade interface due to the respective metal oxides photocatalytic nature, substrate interior water contact angles should remain high due to the absence of UV light. This is of key importance as it implies that simultaneous antifouling and rising damp remediation may be achieved by such treatments. One of the major advantages of the treatments presented is that they do not effectively alter the aesthetics of the substrate, unlike photo-induced ‘self-cleaning’ coatings that turn the facade white. In addition, these treatments are not susceptible to problems related to the cracking or chipping of coated surfaces, allowing them to provide better protection. From the above points it is clear that these treatments are the next paradigm in facade protection, complying with current social, ecological, political and industrial needs. This study presents the inception, development and investigation of key attributes and mechanisms of these novel treatments while showing critically that such emulsion treatments are practical with great potential to enhance the lives of UK residents.

40|$|Man creates maps of land, of earth, of sky, of real or {{imaginary}} worlds, of micro- and macro-cosmos, of everything, {{including his}} own body. Maps are useful for knowledge and for practice, linking one another these two kind of relation with the mapped space. When we say “body maps” we can mean both “maps of body” (representing body) and “maps on body” (representing something else that is projected on body, even forced to be adapted for coinciding with body). Maps are not simply a double of a country or of a body. Mapping gives a different and further ontology to the represented objects by a cause-effect circle, by a dialectic relation between two extended territories (the concrete one and the mapped one). Human body has been mapped as a land to orient our own or other’s navigation. To do this we need marks, references, directional systems: polarities, oriented <b>lines,</b> <b>preferential</b> protocols. Marks may be based on existing anatomical features or on projection of conceptual/symbolic elements, transcending somatic concreteness, relatively heterogeneous to flesh. The anatomical features can regard soft or hard tissues, similarly to “ complexio ” and “ constitutio ” of ancient physiognomy. This navigation is aimed to find signs, to read text(s) that is/are written on its surfaces and in its deepness, to act on it. The body maps taxonomy can be based on supports: skin, paper or bit or to contexts/purposes: official medicine (that presents iconographic maps as 4 D body imaging and not iconographic maps as DNA), alternative medicine, figurative arts, physiognomics, mantics, motion capture in cinema, erotic contexts (the ancient ars erotica and the modern scientia sexualis) mystic cosmology and so on. A particular case of neuronal mapping is related to movements. This perspective leads us toward a precise direction, grounding {{the study of the}} human movement in a very interesting way. This study is still looking for its own center that can define its specificity, its epistemic identity. The term “anthropokinetcs” (from the Greek words anthropos and kinesis) seems to be fully capable of indicating this recently established (in Anglophonic world, but still not existing in Italy) disciplinary area. This term is obviously related to “anthroposomatics”, that indicates the field of the studies related to human body. We aim neither to erase the legitimacy of existing studies of many different sciences that are referred to moving human body nor to create a double of these studies. Instead, we would like to offer them an organic frame to organize their contents and their methods, in order to apply and to communicate them in the best way. This line of study has the purpose of understanding human action thanks to researches that are capable of integrating biomechanical approach with neuronal one (definable “neuro-mechanics”). First of all this approach originates a dialectic play be- tween these two areas (but many others must be involved, as robotics, semiotics, EEC, IIB) and shows that the Nervous System is a “black box” that, after motor learning, manages sensory-motor information as space-time derivatives and integrals. So the CNS is competent (it owns the necessary acquaintance) as an engineer, even if according to a different formalization, it is based on neuronal sources. Anyway it solves real time and with efficacy the interaction problems, managed as input-output patterns. Here we propose to follow and to empower the recent establishment of the anthropokinetics, a knowledge of human action that can be applied in many fields: ergonomics, therapy, motor techniques (in work, in sport, etc.), didactics and so on. Engineering can offer adequate and effective models {{for the study of the}} execution of human action. The connecting rod-crank mechanism and, generally, the mathematical-physical approach to moving bodies are meaningful examples. Writing the “ trait-d’union ” to link one another the biomechanical and the neuronal data means reaching the heart of the matter. When we speak about neural functionality we have to interpret this as the biological datum correlated with the abstract thinking and cultural elements. The natural location of this researches could be seen in the motor sciences academic departments...|$|R
