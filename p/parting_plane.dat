At the point where the narrow tube opens into the larger one, combustion occurs, with a flame of at least [...] at its core. As the powder passes through the flame, it melts into small droplets, which fall onto an earthen support rod placed below. The droplets gradually form a sinter cone on the rod, the tip of which is close enough to the core to remain liquid. It is at that tip that the seed crystal eventually forms. As more droplets fall onto the tip, a single crystal, called a boule, starts to form, and the support is slowly moved downward, allowing the base of the boule to crystallise, while its cap always remains liquid.

40|$|Almost all {{subsurface}} rocks used as {{foundations for}} {{various types of}} structures are stratified. Such heterogeneity may cause specific behaviour of the materials under strain. Differential equations describing the behaviour of such materials contain rapidly fluctuating coefficients, in view of this, solution of such equations is more time-consuming when using today’s computers. The method of asymptotic averaging leads to getting homogeneous medium under study to averaged equations with fixed factors. The present article is concerned with stratified soil mass consisting of pair-wise alternative isotropic elastic layers. In the results of elastic modules averaging, the present soil mass with horizontal rock stratification is simulated by homogeneous transversal-isotropic half-space with isotropy plane perpendicular to the standing axis. Half-space is loosened by a vertical alveole of circular cross-section, and virgin ground is under its own weight. For horizontal <b>parting</b> <b>planes</b> of layers, the following two types of surface conditions are set: ideal contact and backlash without cleavage.

50|$|Complex forms {{made on a}} {{wood lathe}} develop from {{surprisingly}} few types of cuts: <b>parting,</b> <b>planing,</b> bead, cove, and hollowing. Parting separates the wood from the holding device, or establishes depth cuts. Planing is done with a tool in which the bevel below the cutting edge supports wood fibers, just as in a typical wood planer. Beads are a convex shape relative to the cylinder, and coves are a concave shape. Hollowing techniques are a combination of drilling and scooping out materials. The woodturner is at liberty to choose {{from a variety of}} tools for all of these techniques, {{and the quality of the}} cuts improves with practice wielding the tool selected. Turners rely upon three points of contact making any type of cut: the tool presses down on the tool rest, and against the woodturner's body before contacting the surface of the wood, most often with a bevel edge riding the surface of the wood. The objective is to position the tool correctly so that the wood comes around to the cutting edge, generating a thin shaving without chipping or tearing out sections of the wood. Woodturners prefer to use very clean cuts to minimize the time spent with abrasives. When it is necessary to sand the piece, they do so on the lathe, using abrasives held by hand, in an inertial sander which revolves with the wood's own rotation, or with power tools—drills or right-angle drills. The lathe also becomes a useful holding device for carving, burning, texturing, coloring, and finishing the form.|$|R

40|$|The acid {{rocks of}} the west of Rhum, {{previously}} considered to be one petrological unit designated 'granophyre', have been divided into two petrographically and geographically distinct units; a core of microgranite is surrounded by an outer zone of graphophyre. Along rost of its northern boundary the graphophyre has been thrust over Torridonian Sandstone. Along a short length of the contact, however, no faulting has occurred and the graphophyre grades into the Torridonian Sandstone through a belt of transitional rocks. These transitional rocks are divisible into five zones which are interpreted as marking successive stages in {{the conversion of the}} Torridonian into graphophyre. The graphophyre grades inwards into the microgranite which is believed to represent a still more advanced stage of metasomatism. The production of the microgranite from the Torridonian has been achieved by the enrichment of the latter In Al, Na, Fe, Ca, K, Ti, 1 and P, at the expense of Si. The excess Si has been driven outwards and fixed as an acid front in the bleached and indurated Torridonian Sandstone to the north. Seven small dolerite sills and several basalt dykes had been intruded into this part of the Torridonian before Its conversion to microgranite and graphophyre. These basic intrusions have suffered considerable metamorphism involving the addition of various constituents, principally Na. The petrography and internal structures of the basic plutonic rocks {{of the west}} of Rhum are described; the harrisite mass is divided into six zones and the gabbro into two. The lower zone of the gabbro conistc of an earlier coarse gabbro and a later fine gabbro. The fine gabbro was injected from below into almost horizontal <b>parting</b> <b>planes</b> in the coarse gabbro and forms a series of sheets the members of which are a few inches thick and a few inches apart. This alteration of fine and coarse layers gives the lower zone of the gabbro a highly banded appearance. The contact between the grahophrre and the basic plutonic rocks to the east is everywhere marked by a narrow zone of hybrid rocks against which both the basic lutonic rocks and the graphophyre have been metamorphosed. These hybrids are interpreted as highly metamorphosed fragmental rocks occurring along a faulted juntion up which streams of hot gases were passing. The hybrid rocks are believed to have been of both cataclastic and pyroclastic derivation; although many fragments were derived prom the wall rocks locally, some were transported for considerable distances. The southern and central parts of the narrow zone of hybrid rocks are believed to mark the continuation of the ring fault which is well known in eastern Rhum. The northern hybrid rocks were probably developed along a fault which intersected the western continuation of the ring-fault tangentially. A small Tertiary vent, which cuts the ring-fault in the east of Rhurm, is described. The hyrbrid rocks which occupy this vent are very similar to those found between the graphothyre and the basic plutonic rocks in the west of the island but they are somewhat finer in grain. The hybrids in the vent are fragmental rocks highly metamorphosed by rising gases at temperatures in excess of 1, 0000 C. These gases have enriched the vent rocks in K, Na, C, Al, Si, and P. and the contiguous Torridonian Sandstone in the same elements togeher with Fe, Mg and water. The rocks of the four Tertiary volcanic outliers in the west of Rhum have been correlated and a succession, nearly 1, 700 feet in thickness, has been synthesised from the combined data. The volcanic rocks have been shown to lie unconformably upon the grathophyre. The post-granitic minor intrusions of the west of Rhum have been divided into Six distinct rock types.

40|$|In closed-die forging {{the flash}} {{geometry}} should be such as {{to ensure that}} the cavity is completely filled just as the two dies come into contact at the <b>parting</b> <b>plane.</b> If metal is caused to extrude through the flash gap as the dies approach the point of contact — a practice generally resorted to as a means of ensuring complete filling — dies are unnecessarily stressed in a high-stress regime (as the flash is quite thin and possibly cooled by then), which reduces the die life and unnecessarily increases the energy requirement of the operation. It is therefore necessary to carefully determine the dimensions of the flash land and flash thickness — the two parameters, apart from friction at the land, which control the lateral flow. The dimensions should be such that the flow into the longitudinal cavity is controlled throughout the operation, ensuring complete filling just as the dies touch at the <b>parting</b> <b>plane.</b> The design of the flash must be related to the shape and size of the forging cavity as the control of flow has to be exercised throughout the operation: it is possible to do this if the mechanics of how the lateral extrusion into the flash takes place is understood for specific cavity shapes and sizes. The work reported here is part of an ongoing programme investigating flow in closed-die forging. A simple closed shape (no longitudinal flow) which may correspond to the last stages of a real forging operation is analysed using the stress equilibrium approach. Metal from the cavity (flange) flows into the flash by shearing in the cavity in one of the three modes considered here: for a given cavity the mode with the least energy requirement is assumed to be the most realistic. On this basis a map has been developed which, given the depth and width of the cavity as well as the flash thickness, will tell the designer of the most likely mode (of the three modes considered) in which metal in the cavity will shear and then flow into the flash gap. The results of limited set of experiments, reported herein, validate this method of selecting the optimum model of flow into the flash gap...|$|E
40|$|The {{die casting}} process {{is one of}} the net shape {{manufacturing}} techniques and is widely used to produce high production castings with tight tolerances for many industries. An understanding of the stress distribution and the deformation pattern of parts produced by die casting will result in less deviation from the part design specification, a better die design and eventually more productivity and cost savings.

40|$|The {{prominent}} Giggleswick Scar at the South Craven Fault extremity of the Carboniferous limestone of the Askrigg Block in North Yorkshire, UK, contains relict phreatic caves whose speleogenesis is enigmatic. This paper {{examines the}} local geomorphological evidence and proposes that some, {{but not necessarily}} all, karst features along and above the Scar formed after the Last Glacial Maximum. Building on a previous deglacial model for the Yorkshire Dales, it is hypothesized that inception fractures and bedding <b>plane</b> <b>partings</b> were created during isostatic uplift. These were then likely enlarged by dissolution in cold unsaturated meltwater beneath a local flowing deglacial ice-dammed lake that formed initially {{at an altitude of}} c. 300 m, with a catchment area of c. 2 km 2. Rising cupolas outside Gully Cave were probably formed at c. 18 ka BP by meltwater flowing up into a moulin within the ice, which continued to be cold-based farther south. As the ice-sheet slowly downwasted, the surface of the lake would have widened and lowered past the newly-formed cave entrances. Some of these were probably enlarged by freeze-thaw and lake-ice push and pull processes. Indeed, the heights of some enlarged entrances correspond to proposed stabilizing lake overflow levels. It is also assumed that the local ice-dammed lake coalesced with the main Settle glacial lake, until a jokulhlaup created a ravine above pre-existing glacial scoops in the limestone cliff. Thereafter, the lake split into two parts on each side of Buckhaw Brow, whilst still inundating the lower caves. If this hypothesis applies, it has wider implications for cave speleogenesis and sedimentation in the Yorkshire Dales...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{building}} construction along the Mississippi River bluffs in the 1970 s created a unique enclosed outcrop of the Late Ordovician Platteville Formation at Lilydale, Minnesota. This outcrop was examined in early 2013 after a newly-formed spring flooded an elevator shaft the previous year, {{drawing attention to}} the foundation conditions. The Lexington Riverside property is a six story condominium complex constructed within {{the top of the}} bluff. A two-level underground parking garage was built into the bluff. Bedrock was mechanically excavated to accommodate the construction of the building, creating an unweathered rock surface. The space between the structure and the excavated rock face, running for 150 meters, was roofed over, and is used as a utility space. At least three dominantly carbonate members of the Platteville Formation are visible: Mifflin, Hidden Falls, and Magnolia, in ascending order. The foundation of the structure was constructed on the lowermost Platteville limestone and Glenwood shale and is tile-drained to the nearby river gorge. Most of the seeps and springs on the property, both inside and on the grounds, belong to the three Platteville spring-lines identified for the Twin Cities Metropolitan (TCM) area by Brick (1997). Groundwater emanates from both vertical joints and horizontal bedding <b>plane</b> <b>partings</b> within the Platteville limestone and at the Platteville–Glenwood shale contact. Overall, the hydrostratigraphic attributes of this site are consistent with how the Platteville has been recently characterized in the TCM area in a fractured bluff edge setting (Anderson et al., 2011). The enclosed outcrop features many seep- and spring-related mineral deposits. Most notable were the iron-stained flowstone and microgours near the seeps and springs along fractures in the limestone, and calcite rafts on the surfaces of the pools. At some damp locations a fungal ecosystem has developed. Gypsum beards have grown in dry portions of the cavern. This man-made cavern, and others nearby, present unique opportunities to research groundwater flow in fractured bedrock settings. Studying the spring locations relative to joints and bedding, changes in spring flow rate over time, and mineral deposition rates, are possible in this accessible location without the complication of surface water inputs or instrumental interference from the general public...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to present a part complexity, based on basic {{information}} of the STL data. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a few methods of evaluating the complexity of the shape, based on the parts STL data. Methods vary from very simple based on the number of triangles in STL file and the parts volume, to the more complex mathematical determination based on the relations of the basic STL data. Findings: We discovered that evaluation of shape complexity based only on basic data of STL data gives us some basic view on part complexity. Research limitations/implications: For parts with large block volume/part volume ratio and thinner parts with free form surfaces only the first method is suitable and gives suitable results. Practical implications: The complexity of the shape of a part is an important factor for all manufacturing procedures. When using conventional machining, the parts complexity presents a key factor in determining the optimal way of manufacturing. Also, when using rapid tooling (for example silicon rubber moulding) the complexity of the part determines the <b>parting</b> <b>plane</b> layout and eventual tool construction (inserts, cores, etc.). Even when using certain rapid prototyping procedures, the support material consumption depends highly on the complexity of the part and together with the problem of optimal orientation and position of the part, significantly influences the manufacturing costs. At the end of the article a few test method are presented that try to determine the complexity regarding to the procedure by which the part will be manufactured. Originality/value: Choosing maximum efficient manufacturing processes on base of part complexity is a new perspective in manufacturing, which, properly evolved and complied can cause revolution in manufacturing optimization, especially in hybrid manufacturing processes...|$|E
40|$|As a {{net shape}} process, die casting is {{intrinsically}} efficient {{and improvements in}} energy efficiency are strongly dependent on design and process improvements that reduce scrap rates so that more of the total consumed energy goes into acceptable, usable castings. A casting that is distorted and fails to meet specified dimensional requirements is typically remelted but this still results in a decrease in process yield, lost productivity, and increased energy consumption. This work focuses on developing, and expanding the use of, computer modeling methods {{that can be used}} to improve the dimensional accuracy of die castings and produce die designs and machine/die setups that reduce rejection rates due to dimensional issues. A major factor contributing to the dimensional inaccuracy of the casting is the elastic deformations of the die cavity caused by the thermo mechanical loads the dies are subjected to during normal operation. Although thermal and die cavity filling simulation are widely used in the industry, structural modeling of the die, particularly for managing part distortion, is not yet widely practiced. This may be due in part to the need to have a thorough understanding of the physical phenomenon involved in die distortion and the mathematical theory employed in the numerical models to efficiently model the die distortion phenomenon. Therefore, two of the goals of this work are to assist in efforts to expand the use of structural modeling and related technologies in the die casting industry by 1) providing a detailed modeling guideline and tutorial for those interested in developing the necessary skills and capability and 2) by developing simple metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels that capture the results and experience gained from several years of die distortion research and can be used to predict key distortion phenomena of relevance to a die caster with a minimum of background and without the need for simulations. These objectives were met. A detailed modeling tutorial was provided to NADCA for distribution to the industry. Power law based metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels for predicting machine tie bar loading and for predicting maximum parting surface separation were successfully developed and tested against simulation results for a wide range of machines and experimental data. The models proved to be remarkably accurate, certainly well within the requirements for practical application. In addition to making die structural modeling more accessible, the work advanced the state-of-the-art by developing improved modeling of cavity pressure effects, which is typically modeled as a hydrostatic boundary condition, and performing a systematic analysis of the influence of ejector die design variables on die deflection and <b>parting</b> <b>plane</b> separation. This cavity pressure modeling objective met with less than complete success due to the limits of current finite element based fluidÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstructureÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinteraction analysis methods, but an improved representation of the casting/die interface was accomplished using a combination of solid and shell elements in the finite element model. This approximation enabled good prediction of final part distortion verified with a comprehensive evaluation of the dimensions of test castings produced with a design experiment. An extra deliverable of the experimental work was development of high temperature mechanical properties for the A 380 die casting alloy. The ejector side design objective was met and the results were incorporated into the metamodels described above. This new technology was predicted to result in an average energy savings of 2. 03 trillion BTUÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs/year over a 10 year period. Current (2011) annual energy saving estimates over a ten year period, based on commercial introduction in 2009, a market penetration of 70 % by 2014 is 4. 26 trillion BTUÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs/year by 2019. Along with these energy savings, reduction of scrap and improvement in casting yield will result in a reduction of the environmental emissions associated with the melting and pouring of the metal which will be saved as a result of this technology. The average annual estimate of CO 2 reduction per year through 2020 is 0. 085 Million Metric Tons of Carbon Equivalent (MM TCE) ...|$|E
40|$|The Main Magnetite Layer (MML) {{from the}} Northern, Eastern and Western lobes of the Bushveld Complex shows {{significant}} differences in textures and in mineral chemistry. The MML in the Eastern and Western lobes is massive, with rare, small and altered pyroxene inclusions. By contrast, the MML in the Northern Lobe is more heterogeneous, and it is made of anastomosed and sometimes imbricated, thin layers of magnetitite, magnetite-rich and silicate-rich rocks, where the inclusions in Ti-magnetite are more numerous and consist of mainly altered subhedral and anhedral plagioclase. The comparison of the maximum values of the oxides shows that the MML in the Northern Lobe has the highest content of V 2 O 3 (1. 97 wt%), TiO 2 (22. 49 wt%) and MgO (2. 92 wt%), while the MML in the Eastern Lobe has the highest content of Cr 2 O 3 (2. 92 wt%) and Al 2 O 3 (9. 80 wt%), but lowest V 2 O 3 (0. 52 wt%). The lower TiO 2 content and higher V 2 O 3 content in the MML of the Northern and Western Lobes suggest lower oxidising conditions during the crystallization of oxides. The MML in all three studied lobes consists of two layers of magnetitite, suggesting that MML was formed by two separate magma influxes, probably on a diverse and complex type of magma chamber floor. The high TiO 2 content in magnetite, together with the negative correlation between TiO 2 and V 2 O 3 suggest that the maximum V content should represent a “less evolved” and less oxidized melt. In this respect, higher concentrations V 2 O 3 in magnetite can be expected in magnetitite layers with lower TiO 2. It can be inferred that the Ti-magetite in the MML from the Eastern Lobe was formed from a more evolved (TiO 2 and FeO enriched) and more oxidized (lower V 2 O 3) melt, compared with the MML from the Northern and Western lobes. These findings {{can be used to}} illustrate: a) that high fO 2 can be responsible for the relatively low V content in magnetite from Fe-Ti oxide ores and b) the vanadium in magnetite decreases significantly in more evolved cumulates, due to a decreasing fO 2 with differentiation. Compositional profiles of Ti- magnetite along the stratigraphic height of the MML in the Eastern Lobe (composed of two layers, separated in the outcrop by a <b>parting</b> <b>plane)</b> depicts a cryptic variation with depth in each of the two layers, where each layer can be divided into four sublayers, labelled upwards as A, B, C (with C 1, C 2, C 3 and C 4) and D based on Cr, Mg, Ti, Al and V variation. Small scale reversals of the mentioned elements and the repetition of A, B, C and D sub-layers in each layer suggest that MML formed from two successive influxes of magma (indicated by relatively elevated values of MgO), which evolved by crystallization and cooling in a similar manner, to produce the A to D variation. Based on these observations and theoretical considerations, this study dismisses several models for the genesis of the MML: the immiscibility, the increased oxygen fugacity, the relative increase of H 2 O content of the melt, pressure variation within the magma chamber, magma mixing, and crustal rock contamination. The model proposed here for MML genesis involves the crystallization of both Ti-magnetite and ilmenite from a Fe-Ti-Ca-Al-rich melt (ferro-diorite) along its line of descent, and gravitational settling of oxides in a dynamic regime. The factor which triggered the crystallization of magnetite is a critical saturation of melt in magnetite (attaining saturation of magnetite and ilmenite in the melt after some silicates crystallized). The difference between the nature of silicate inclusions in magnetite {{and the nature of the}} magnetite floor, suggest that the Fe-rich magma was not in equilibrium with the cumulates from the present floor, but rather it was emplaced laterally on long distances, the melt being disrupted from its own cumulates. The absence of correlation between the Cr 2 O 3 in magnetite and co-existing ilmenite can indicate than no in-situ fractional crystallization took place at the moment of magnetite accumulation, but rather that magnetite and ilmenite gravitationally accumulated and the grains mechanically mixed from a flowing magma. The model presented herein proposes a five stage model of MML formation: Stage 1 is represented by the intrusion of a Fe-T-Ca-Al-rich magma which expands laterally within a flat and thin magma chamber. Oxides start to crystallize within a dynamic regime of the magma. Stage 2 is given by the accumulation of oxides at the bottom of the new floor. Some plagioclase starts to crystallize (e. g. subhedral plagioclase in the MML of the Northern Lobe). Stage 3 is a short living static regime, where both plagioclase and magnetite crystallized, without fractionation, forming the thin magnetite-anorthosite layer separating the MML into two layers. Stage 4 is represented by a new influx of Fe-Ti-Ca-Al-rich magma which is emplaced above the magnetite-bearing anorthosite, flushing out the liquid which was in equilibrium with the anorthosite. The oxides started crystallizing in a dynamic regime, as in Stage 1. In stage 5, the accumulation of oxides produced the upper layer of the MML. Our interpretation is that the flow of the magma was more dynamic (probably more turbulent on long distances) in the MML of the Northern Lobe, compared to the MML in the Western and Eastern lobes, producing highly heterogeneous and imbricated thin layers of magnetitite and silicates. The presence of olivine corona around orthopyroxene suggests the incongruent melting of orthopyroxene, which points out towards a local re-heating of existing silicate layers, this being a strong argument for multiple injections in generation of MML. Massive crystallization of oxides produced the sulphur saturation of the magma and caused the precipitation of the igneous sulphides, which nucleated on the existing oxides. Later hydrothermal fluids (and/or late magmatic volatiles?) percolated the MML, producing chloritization of the included silicates, remobilization of igneous sulphides and precipitation of hydrothermal sulphides...|$|E
