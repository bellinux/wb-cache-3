40|$|Abstract. Computer-aided tooth shade {{determination}} of the natural tooth is an emerging application area which is still in development. Selecting the correct porcelain type {{is the key to}} repair teeth successfully. But the color and shade determined by human observers could not achieve a satisfied result because of the effect of the surrounding light and the limit of human eyes. And the computer-aided tooth color selection methods can resolve this problem. In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) and two-dimensional principal component analysis (2 DPCA) are used to extract the features. And K nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and probabilistic neural net-work (PNN) are used as classifiers for matching the porcelain type. Finally, the experimental results of these methods are compared.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} multicenter study was to evaluate and compare the clinical performance of laser-welded titanium fixed partial implant-supported prostheses with conventional cast frameworks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two partially edentulous patients were provided with Brånemark system implants and arranged into 2 groups. Group A was provided with a conventional cast framework with porcelain veneers in {{one side of the}} jaw and a laser-welded titanium framework with low-fusing porcelain on the other side. The patients in group B had an old implant prosthesis replaced by a titanium framework prosthesis. The patients were followed for 3 years after prosthesis placement. Clinical and radiographic data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Only one implant was lost, and all prostheses were still in function after 3 years. The 2 framework designs showed similar clinical performance with few clinical complications. Only one abutment screw (1 %) and 9 <b>porcelain</b> <b>tooth</b> units (5 %) fractured. Four prostheses experienced loose gold screws (6 %). In group A, marginal bone loss was similar for both designs of prostheses, with a mean of 1. 0 mm and 0. 3 mm in the maxilla and mandible, respectively. No bone loss was observed on average in group B. No significant relationship (P > 0. 05) was observed between marginal bone loss and placement of prosthesis margin or prosthesis design.

Methods Five kinds of veneering porcelains were selected in {{this research}}. The surface microhard-ness of all the samples was measured with a microhardness tester. Wear tests were per-formed on a ball-on-flat PLINT fretting wear machine, with lubrication of artificial saliva at 37 °C. The friction coefficients were recorded by the testing system. The microstructure fea-tures, wear volume, and damage morphologies were recorded and analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The wear mechanism was then elucidated. Results The friction coefficients of the five veneering porcelains differ significantly. No significant corre-lation between hardness and wear volumewas found for these veneering porcelains. Under lubrication of artificial saliva, the porcelain with higher leucite crystal content exhibited greater wear resistance. Additionally, leucite crystal size and distribution in glass matrix influenced wear behavior. The wear mechanisms for these porcelains were similar: abrasive wear domi-nates the early stage, whereas delamination was the main damagemode at the later stage. Furthermore, delamination was more prominent for porcelains with larger crystal sizes. Significance Wear compatibility between <b>porcelain</b> and natural <b>teeth</b> is important for dental restorative materials.

The management of avulsed central incisors,complicated crown-root and uncomplicated fractures of lateralincisors in a 13 year old boy is presented in this poster. Clinical management: The patient presented with avulsed maxillarycentral incisors, a complicated crown-root fracture of tooth 22 andan uncomplicated crown fracture of tooth 12. In order to maintainpulp vitality, restore normal aesthetics and function, and the losttooth structure for the uncomplicated crown fracture of the rightmaxillary lateral incisor it was restored using composite resin. Thecomplicated crown-root fracture of the left lateral incisor (tooth 22) was treated with a Cvek pulpotomy. Root planning andmaintenance of proper oral hygiene brought about the resolutionof the pseudo-pocket caused by the crown-root fracture. Themissing tooth structure was restored using composite resin. Theavulsed maxillary central incisors were not recovered at the time ofthe accident. A modiﬁed Nance palatal appliance with acrylic teethwas used to replace the missing teeth. This however, is only theshort term treatment, the deﬁnitive treatment plan will probably involve orthodontic treatment to align his <b>teeth,</b> <b>porcelain</b> crownsand dental implants, {{which can only be}} considered once growth hasceased. Conclusion: Management of dental trauma should be minimallyinvasive and based on sound diagnosis including both short termand long-term treatment options. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Because of {{existing}} controversy, {{the present study}} investigated the individual and combined effects of endodontic treatment and porcelain veneer restoration on the fracture behavior of human mandibular incisors. Materials and Methods: Forty extracted intact human mandibular incisors were assigned to four groups often with a similar range of labiolingual widths at the cementoenamel junctions. Group A consisted of intact teeth; group B consisted of endodontically treated teeth; group C teeth were restored with labial porcelain veneers; and those of group D were endodontically treated and had labial <b>porcelain</b> veneers. All <b>teeth</b> were subjected to a slow continuous loading test at 30 degrees to the long axis of the teeth and 1 mm below the incisal edge on the labial side. Results: Fracture forces were 415 ± 220 N, 370 ± 89 N, 420 ± 128 N, and 448 ± 156 N for groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Root fracture was the most common mode of failure. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of fracture forces and modes of failure. Conclusion: Human mandibular incisors with endodontic treatment and/or porcelain veneer restorations were able to withstand the same magnitude of oblique loading as intact teeth. Endodontic treatment and/or porcelain veneer restoration did not affect the mode of failure of mandibular incisors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the wear behavior and wear mechanism of five different veneering porcelains. Five kinds of veneering porcelains were selected in {{this research}}. The surface microhardness of all the samples was measured with a microhardness tester. Wear tests were performed on a ball-on-flat PLINT fretting wear machine, with lubrication of artificial saliva at 37 °C. The friction coefficients were recorded by the testing system. The microstructure features, wear volume, and damage morphologies were recorded and analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The wear mechanism was then elucidated. The friction coefficients of the five veneering porcelains differ significantly. No significant correlation between hardness and wear volume was found for these veneering porcelains. Under lubrication of artificial saliva, the porcelain with higher leucite crystal content exhibited greater wear resistance. Additionally, leucite crystal size and distribution in glass matrix influenced wear behavior. The wear mechanisms for these porcelains were similar: abrasive wear dominates the early stage, whereas delamination was the main damage mode at the later stage. Furthermore, delamination was more prominent for porcelains with larger crystal sizes. Wear compatibility between <b>porcelain</b> and natural <b>teeth</b> is important for dental restorative materials. Investigation on crystal content, size, and distribution in glass matrix can provide insight for the selection of dental porcelains in clinical settings...|$|R
