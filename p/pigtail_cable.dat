5000|$|So far the PHY-Chips for the WNICs are {{generally}} distinct chips on the PCB. Dependent on the mode the WNIC supports, i.e. 1T1R, 2T2R or 3T3R, one WNIC {{have up to}} 3 PHY-Chips connected to it. Each PHY-Chip is connected to a Hirose U.FL-connector on the PCB. A so-called <b>pigtail</b> <b>cable</b> connects the Hirose U.FL either to a RF connector, {{in which case the}} antenna can be changed or directly to the antenna, in which case it is integrated into the casing. Common are single-band (i.e. only for 2.4 GHz or only for 5 GHz) and dual-band (i.e. for 2.4 and 5 GHz) antennas.|$|E
40|$|Flat panel antenna 18 dBi is the {{implementation}} of microstrip antenna with external type. This antenna is designed as the improvisation to decrease the development cost of wireless infrastructure. In this final project, it is designed a flat panel antenna 18 dBi vertical radiation pattern, gain in the frequency 2, 4 GHz. This antenna is made from PCB flat sized 35 x 35 cm and aluminum flat as the reflector. Signal will be accepted and strengthened by PCB flat, {{then it will be}} continued through <b>pigtail</b> <b>cable</b> to the received radio Renagade BWAP 608 H. In this research, the writer used experiment method. In this experiment, antenna is put onto the tower and test the difference of the received signal when it uses flat panel antenna and it does not uses flat panel antenna. This final project of flat panel antenna 18 dBi produces strengthen signal received the radio, so that in can be caught signal from access point in range 5 - 6 Km with gain + 18 dBi. Key word : flat panel antenna, flat panel 18 dBi, FP 180...|$|E

50|$|An {{electrical}} connection is {{made between the}} tractor and the trailer through a cable {{often referred to as}} a <b>pigtail.</b> This <b>cable</b> is a bundle of wires in a single casing. Each wire controls one of the electrical circuits on the trailer, such as running lights, brake lights, turn signals, etc. A straight cable would break when the rig went around corners, so a coiled cable is used which retracts these coils when not under tension. It is these coils that cause the cable to look like a pigtail.|$|R
50|$|A fanout kit {{is a set}} {{of empty}} jackets {{designed}} to protect fragile tight-buffered strands of fiber from a cable. This allows the individual fibers to be terminated without splicing, and without needing a protective enclosure such as a splicebox. This is normally an option with fiber distribution cable, or sometimes loose-buffer or ribbon cable, because these types of cable contain multiple strands that are designed for a permanent termination.The ribbon fanout <b>pigtails</b> include: Ribbon <b>cable,</b> Fanout kit, Fanout tubing and Connectors.|$|R
