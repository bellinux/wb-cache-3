40|$|Fluxes of D-xylose- 1 -C 14 (xylose) {{across the}} wall of the {{isolated}} intestine of the bullfrog were studied. When sodium was the <b>principal</b> <b>cation</b> in the mucosal bathing fluid, the transport rate of xylose from the mucosa to the serosa was about 5 times greater than the transport rate from the serosa to the mucosa, indicating an active intestinal transport for this sugar. With potassium as the <b>principal</b> <b>cation</b> on the mucosal side, the transport rate of xylose from the mucosal to the serosal compartment is reduced about 5 to 6 times without appreciable change in the serosal to mucosal transport. The asymmetry was also considerably reduced when ouabain was added to the mucosal and serosal compartments. The data confirm the in vitro and in vivo observations indicating active transport of xylose and are also in accord with the earlier findings that active transport of sugars in the intestine is dependent upon the presence of sodium ions in the mucosal compartment and is inhibited by cardioactive steroids. Since the chemical constitution of xylose does not meet the requirements which were hitherto considered necessary for active transport of sugars in the intestine, this structural requirement has to be revised...|$|E
30|$|Sodium, an {{essential}} nutrient, is the <b>principal</b> <b>cation</b> of extracellular fluid {{and a major}} determinant of intravascular fluid volume. There are considerable human and animal experimental studies implicating excessive dietary salt intake in cardiovascular diseases especially hypertension [1, 2]. Increase in blood pressure leads to damages to the kidney, heart, blood vessels, brain and the eyes. Major risk factors are; age, elevated LDL-cholesterol level, low HDL-cholesterol, microalbuminuria. Analysis of blood samples also show abnormalities in plasma fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, etc. These deleterious effects of excess salt can be managed with the use of medications or medicinal herbs.|$|E

30|$|Ion balance {{studies are}} carried out usually to {{validate}} the experimentally obtained data (Domenico and Schwartz 1990). For this purpose, the concentrations of the <b>principal</b> <b>cations</b> and anions were calculated in milliequivalents per liter. The two should be equal {{to one another and}} the ratio should be equal to 1.0 since the water as a whole is electrically neutral (Hem 1985). The ionic balance (BI) of the water samples can be calculated as: BI[*]=[*] 100 [*]×[*](Σ+[*]−Σ−)/(Σ−[*]+[*]Σ+) where Σ+: total milliequivalents/L of <b>principal</b> <b>cations</b> and Σ−: total milliequivalents/L of principal anions. Statistical analysis was carried out using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS, Version 16). Water quality monitoring and analysis programs generate large complex dataset that needs multivariate statistical methods for interpretation of the underlying information. Multivariate statistical analysis successfully explains the correlation among a large number of variables in terms of a small number of underlying factors and helps to simplify/organize large datasets to provide meaningful insight (Kumar et al. 2017). This multivariate method was used here to obtain information about the most relevant characteristics of the physicochemical variables with a minimal loss of original data (Altun et al. 2008; Kazi et al. 2009) to create an entirely new set of factors much smaller in number when compared to the original dataset of variables focused on reducing the contribution of the less significant variables to simplify even more the data structure coming from the principal component analysis (Iscen et al. 2008). For principal component analysis, the entire dataset was first standardized and arranged in correlation coefficient matrix with normal distribution in all variables (Okiongbo and Douglas 2015). Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix were extracted, and then less important of these was discarded (Davis 1986). The eigenvalues having values more than unity demonstrate the significant contribution of a factor to the total variance. The factor loadings were calculated by a varimax rotation technique {{in such a way that}} they are closer to +[*] 1, 0, −[*] 1, representing positive contribution, no contribution and negative contribution. Hierarchical cluster analysis comprises a series of multivariate methods which are used to find true groups of data. In clustering, similar objects are grouped into the same class and similar variables are merged to construct a dendrogram (Cloutier et al. 2008; Güler et al. 2012; Moya et al. 2015, Kumar et al. 2017).|$|R

30|$|Some of the {{important}} functions of electrolytes include regulation {{of the amount of}} fluid (water) in the body and maintenance of blood pH within normal range. Individuals with hepatitis C or cirrhosis tend to retain more water in the body than needed resulting in abnormal bicarbonate, chloride, potassium or sodium concentrations. Sodium is the <b>principal</b> <b>cation</b> in extracellular fluid which regulates plasma volume and acid-base balance. Increased dietary salt intake may promote organ damage through non-pressure related effects [23, 24]. Administration of the plant (A. wilkesiana leaf) extracts, which resulted in lower serum sodium concentrations of the treated groups, may be protective against these harmful effects or damage due to excess sodium in the system. Our previous studies with normal rabbits showed that the leaf extracts of the plant has a potential to maintain homeostasis by reducing the serum sodium concentrations of the experimental rabbits [25]. Maintenance of homeostasis (a possible effect of the plant) or regulation of plasma fluid volume is a preventive measure against organ damage that could possibly result from increased dietary salt intake [25, 26]. This diuretic effect has been linked with the tannin content of the plant [27].|$|E

30|$|Hardness is the {{property}} of water which prevents lather formation with soap. <b>Principal</b> <b>cations</b> imparting hardness are calcium and magnesium. However, other cations such as strontium, iron and manganese also contribute to hardness. The anions responsible for hardness are mainly bicarbonate and carbonate. The hardness mean concentration in river water samples ranged from 342  ±  19.69 to 570  ±  86.16  mg/l in PRM and from 70  ±  23.18 to 206  ±  35.77  mg/l in POM season. The concentration during PRM season of all the river water samples exceeded the desirable limit of hardness i.e. 300  mg/l {{but none of the}} sample in POM exceeded the limit. Water hardness has no adverse effect on health as such but the higher concentration of hardness in water causes heart disease as well as kidney stone problem (Napacho and Manyele 2010). The mean concentration of alkalinity in water ranged from 218  ±  7.60 to 461  ±  12.57 and from 57  ±  10.13 to 186  ±  34.7  mg/l during PRM and POM seasons, respectively. The concentration during PRM seasons of all the river water samples exceeded the desirable limit of alkalinity i.e. 200  mg/l but in POM season concentration is found well within the limit. Alkalinity in water is due to the presence of carbonates, bicarbonates and hydroxide constituents, which may be derived from dissolved rocks, salts or sediments (Kumar et al. 2012).|$|R

The national loss due to primary water and electrolyte disturbances, and to those secondary to other diseases, is of considerable importance. Deficiencies in our knowledge of water and electrolyte metabolism in the ruminant have become apparent, even of the <b>principal</b> <b>cations</b> sodium and potassium. The specialized form of nutrition in the ruminant has entailed {{some changes in the}} water and electrolyte economy. In adapting to a diet of plant material rich in cellulose, they have developed a large forestomach, the reticulo-rumen, where a symbiotic population of bacteria and protozoa is maintained and exploited. Microbial fermentation breaks down plant cellulose and converts carbohydrate to volatile fatty acids, principally acetic, propionic and butyric acids, which are rapidly absorbed by the host for use as an energy source. Microbial protein and certain vitamins are also made available further down the gastro-intestinal tract. The development of the reticulo-rumen has resulted in an increase in the content and daily turnover of gut water and electrolytes. A major source of this content of the reticulo-rumen liquor, which provides a well-buffered medium for the microbes, is the copious salivary flow. The rumen of the sheep may contain 500 - 800 m-equiv of Na+, approximately half that in the extracellular fluid.

In media containing any {{of a variety of}} organic compounds as the <b>principal</b> <b>cation</b> (choline, N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), arginine, L-lysine and trimethyl-phenylammonium), the ouabain plus bumetanide-insensitive influxes and effluxes of Na and K displayed marked paradoxical temperature dependence such that the flux minimum, which normally occurs at about 8 - 10 degrees C in a NaCl medium, was shifted up to about 20 degrees C. Inhibitor and anion replacement studies excluded contributions by the major carrier-mediated systems evident at 37 degrees C. At 0 degrees C in NMDG, about 1 mM-external Na and 10 mM-external K were required half-maximally to inhibit the K and Na influxes respectively. When the K(86 Rb) efflux in NMDG media at 0 degrees C was measured in the presence of low concentrations of a series of external inorganic ions and guanidine, the order of potency for reduction of the efflux was Li greater than Mg = Ca greater than Ba greater than Sr greater than Na greater than Rb = Cs = guanidine greater than K. The influxes of the neutral amino acid L-leucine and the cationic species L-lysine both showed simple monotonic temperature dependence in Na and NMDG media. These effects show that the permeability of the human red cell membrane to inorganic univalent cations at low temperatures is markedly dependent on the external ionic conditions. Low permeability is favoured by the presence of cations with a high charge density...|$|E
40|$|Active solute uptake in bacteria, fungi, plants, {{and animals}} {{is known to}} be {{mediated}} by cotransporters that are driven by Na+ or H+ gradients. The present work extends the Na+ and H+ dogma by including the H+ and K+ paradigm. Lepidopteran insect larvae have a high K+ and a low Na+ content, and their midgut cells lack Na+/K+ ATPase. Instead, an H+ translocating, vacuolar-type ATPase generates a voltage of approximately − 240 mV across the apical plasma membrane of so-called goblet cells, which drives H+ back into the cells in exchange for K+, resulting in net K+ secretion into the lumen. The resulting inwardly directed K+ electrochemical gradient serves as a driving force for active amino acid uptake into adjacent columnar cells. By using expression cloning with Xenopus laevis oocytes, we have isolated a cDNA that encodes a K+-coupled amino acid transporter (KAAT 1). We have cloned this protein from a larval lepidopteran midgut (Manduca sexta) cDNA library. KAAT 1 is expressed in absorptive columnar cells of the midgut and in labial glands. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, KAAT 1 induced electrogenic transport of neutral amino acids but excludes α-(methylamino) isobutyric acid and charged amino acids resembling the mammalian system B. K+, Na+, {{and to a lesser extent}} Li+ were accepted as cotransported ions, but K+ is the <b>principal</b> <b>cation,</b> by far, in living caterpillars. Moreover, uptake was Cl−-dependent, and the K+/Na+ selectivity increased with hyperpolarization of oocytes, reflecting the increased K+/Na+ selectivity with hyperpolarization observed in midgut tissue.

Fibers were stimulated with a voltage-clamp pulse protocol that consisted of pulses to − 70, − 65, − 60, − 45, and − 20 mV, each separated by 400 -ms periods at − 90 mV. The change in total Ca that entered into the myoplasm (Δ[CaT]) and the Ca content of the SR ([CaSR]) were estimated with the EGTA/phenol red method (Pape, P. C., D. -S. Jong, and W. K. Chandler. 1995. J. Gen. Physiol. 106 : 259 – 336). Fibers were stimulated with the pulse protocol, usually every 5 min, so that the resting value of [CaSR] decreased from its initial value of 1, 700 – 2, 300 μM to values near or below 100 μM after 18 – 30 stimulations. Three main findings for the voltage pulses to − 70, − 65, and − 60 mV are: (a) the depletion-corrected rate of Ca release (release permeability) showed little change when [CaSR] decreased from its highest level (> 1, 700 μM) to ∼ 1, 000 μM; (b) as [CaSR] decreased below 1, 000 μM, the release permeability increased to a maximum level when [CaSR] was near 300 μM that was on average about sevenfold larger than the values observed for [CaSR] > 1, 000 μM; and (c) as [CaSR] decreased from ∼ 300 μM to < 100 μM, the release permeability decreased, reaching half its maximum value when [CaSR] was ∼ 110 μM on average.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that in the}} transtubular movement of matter in kidney tubules, {{a significant portion of}} the solute and water passes through the cytoplasm of the transporting cells. Since sodium and, to a lesser extent, potassium are the <b>principal</b> <b>cations</b> reabsorbed by nephrons, their extrusion from the cells may be importantly tied to transtubule solute absorption as well as maintenance of intracellular volume and solute concentrations of kidney tubule cells. Consequently, considerable effort has been invested in studies of the mechanism of solute and water transport across the peritubular surface of kidney tubules. In the renal cortex in vivo, the cells ordinarily are bathed in isotonic medium on both the lumen and blood side. Accordingly, it is important to examine those factors which may perturb cell volume regulation to cause an increase or decrease in size, or a change in cellular ionic composition in an isotonic environment. The most common of these stresses encountered in the clinic are hypoxia (anoxia), acid-base disturbances and hypothermia (renal preservation for transplantation). On the other hand, renal, as well as other body cells, are subjected to anisotonic stresses which have an important impact on cell volume and ionic content. These include the hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic states encountered in heart and liver disease and diabetes mellitus. The delicate control of renal cell volume is important for at least two reasons. First, changes in cell volume may alter the normal function of the tissue, potentially to an irreversible extent. Second, owing to the compact structure of the kidney, changes in size of renal cells may drastically alter the flow of blood through the organ, and thereby intensify the injurious effects of cell swelling or shrinkage. In this setting we will examine our knowledge of the factors which control the regulation of renal cell solute and water transfer primarily across the peritubular side of the cell...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{results of}} {{experiments}} conducted in 1957 and 1958 {{to isolate the}} cause of post-transportation mortalities among hatchery-reared rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri Richardson, in Oregon are reported. Although death rate varies greatly, the average loss occurring from one to seven days following liberation has been estimated to be {{ten percent of the}} fish transported. Studies conducted over the past 15 years on problems arising from the live shipment of fishes are reviewed. General experimental procedure was to place fish in aquaria and subject them to certain environmental conditions perhaps associated with delayed planting mortalities. After a specified interval, animals were removed from test containers and placed in observation troughs. Subsequent losses were recorded and compared to the measured experimental conditions in an effort to identify causal relationships. Simulated in-transit motion, density of fish transported, and pre-hauling starvation period ha. d no apparent influence on the magnitude of delayed trout deaths. Zinc from zinc chloride and from galvanized iron plating was toxic to trout, and, at low concentrations, produced delayed mortalities characteristic of those that occurred following tank truck transportation in Oregon. The toxic effect of zinc increased with increasing zinc concentration, and with increasing length of exposure to the metal. Of the trout exposed for six hours to an initial zinc concentration of 0. 10 mg/ 1, an average of 8. 2 percent suffered a delayed mortality. When the concentration was increased to 1. 00 mg/ 1 for the same time period, the delayed loss increased to an average of 63. 2 percent. When length of trout exposure to various zinc concentrations was increased from two to eight hours, the mean delayed mortality increased from 39 to 68 percent. The toxicity of zinc increased with decreasing total water hardness. At 0. 75 mg/ 1 zinc, mean trout mortalities increased from five to 28 percent when total water hardness was decreased from 40 to 20 p. p. m. When hardness was decreased from 20 to zero p. p. m., mean mortalities increased from 28 to 88 percent. On the basis of research previously conducted in Oregon, it was shown that delayed trout losses were inversely correlated with total alkalinity of the transporting water. Assuming that calcium was the <b>principal</b> <b>cation</b> involved, the relationship was attributed to the effects of increased water hardness. Samples of transportation water from 32 inter-hatchery transfers of fish were taken at the completion of the station to station trips and analyzed for zinc. In every instance where delayed mortalities greater than one percent occurred, appreciable quantities of zinc were detected. When delayed losses of trout were much less than one percent, no zinc was detected in the water used during the transfer. Based on the results of the field and laboratory tests reported, it was concluded that zinc from galvanized iron surfaces was responsible for the post-transportation mortalities of trout in Oregon. Fish exposed to low zinc concentrations in liberating tanks were subjected to threshold toxic conditions in which a varying portion of the animals died a delayed death. Relatively small changes in the natural water hardness or zinc concentration could either increase or eliminate subsequent mortalities...|$|E

Chromium, in significant amounts, replaces ferric iron in the lattice structure of some nontronites. Effect of migration of clay minerals under colloidal suspension and the transfer of true solutions complicate correlations of the chemical composition. Moreover, many nontronites are secondary and occur in fracture zones associated with kaolinitic and halloysitic lay. A tendency of certain nontronites toform lathlike crystals is well known. Chemical composition of 15 selected nontronites from the United States of America, Germany, and Russia indicate a range of 30 to 60 percent SiO~, {{and a range of}} from 25 to 40 percent Fe 20 ~. Minor constituents are the oxides of magnesium, titanium, ferrous iron, and calcium, and the alkalis, potassium and sodium. Magnesium percentages found in nontronites are proportional to the value of sigma for octahedral coordination. Ferrous iron is proportional to titanium in montmorillonite, and a similar relationship is observed in the nontronites. A deficiency in alkalis typifies the composition of montmorillonite and this condition is likewise true in most nontronites. Potassium is limited to a narrow statistical range of between 0. 5 to 0. 6 ions of A 1 in tetrahedral coordination against an extreme deficiency of ferric iron and magnesium (combined) of less than 0. 05 ion in octahedral coordination.

The maintenance of the serum potassium concentration is a complex bodily function and results from the balance between intake, excretion, and distribution between intracellular and extra cellular space. Ingested potassium is virtually completely absorbed from and minimally excreted through the intestine under nonpathologic circumstances. Renal excretion of potassium, which {{is the major}} chronic protective mechanism against abnormalities in potassium balance, depends on filtration, reabsorption, and a highly regulated distal nephron secretory process. Factors regulating potassium secretion include prior potassiu...|$|R
40|$|Boron {{concentrations}} in rainfall, throughfall and stemflow for Spruce stands, mist, streamwater and groundwater are compared with chloride to assess atmospheric sources and catchment input-output balances for the Plynlimon catchments. In rainfall, boron concentration averages about 4. 5 &# 956;g-B l - 1 and approximately {{two thirds of}} this comes from anthropogenic sources. In through-fall and stemflow, boron concentrations are approximately a factor of ten times higher than in rainfall. This increase is associated with enhanced scavenging of mist and dry deposition by the trees. As the sampling sites were close to a forest edge, this degree of scavenging is probably far {{higher than in the}} centre of the forest. The throughfall and stemflow concentrations of boron show some evidence of periodic variations with time with peak concentrations occurring during the summer months indicating some vegetational cycling. In mist, boron concentrations are almost twenty times higher than in rainfall and anthropogenic sources account for about 86 % of this. Within the Plynlimon streams, boron concentrations are about 1. 4 to 1. 7 times higher than in rainfall. However, after allowance for mist and dry deposition contributions to atmospheric deposition, it seems that, on average, about 30 % of the boron input is retained within the catchment. For the forested catchments, felling results in a disruption of the biological cycle and a small increase in boron leaching from the catchment results in the net retention by the catchment being slightly reduced. Despite the net uptake by the catchment, there is clear evidence of a boron component of weathering from the bedrock. This is shown by an increased boron concentration in a stream influenced by a nearby borehole which increased groundwater inputs. The weathering component for boron is also observed in Plynlimon groundwaters as boron concentrations and boron to chloride ratios are higher than for the streams. For these Goundwaters, increases in boron concentrations are matched linearly by increases in the concentration of the <b>principal</b> ase <b>cation</b> weathering component in the bedrock, calcium. However, the bedrock weathering term is not uniform as the ratio of boron to calcium concentration varies for the different boreholes sampled...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to provide a}} geochemical {{characterization}} of the Seehausen territory (a neighborhood) of Bremen, Germany. In this territory it is hosted a landfill of dredged sediments coming both from Bremerhaven (North See) and Bremen harbor (directly on the river Weser). For this reason this work has been focused also on possible impacts of the landfill on the groundwaters (shallow and deep aquifer). The Seehausen landfill uses the dewatering technique to manage the dredged sediments: incoming sediments are put into dewatering fields until they are completely dried (it takes almost a year). Then they are randomly sampled and analyzed: if the pollutants content is acceptable, sediments are treated with other materials and used instead of raw material for embankment, bricks, etc., otherwise they are disposed in the landfill. During this work it has been made a study of the natural geology and hydrogeology of the whole area of interest, especially because it is characterized by ancient natural salt deposits. Then, together with the Geological Survey of Bremen and the Harbor Authority of Bremen there have been identified all useful piezometers for a monitoring net around the landfill. During the sampling campaign there have been collected data of the <b>principal</b> anions and <b>cations,</b> physical parameters and stable water isotopes. Data analysis has been focused particularly on Cl, Na, SO 4 and EC because these parameters might be helpful to attribute geochemical trends to the landfill or to a natural background. Furthermore dataloggers have been installed for a month in some piezometers and EC, pressure, dissolved oxygen and temperature data have been collected. Finally there has been made a deep comparison between current and historical data (1996 – 2011) and between old interpolation maps and current ones in order to see time trends of the aquifer geochemistry...|$|R
40|$|This {{program was}} a status study of the {{interaction}} between Las Vegas Wash, an enriched stream, and Las Vegas Bay, a wedge shaped arm {{of one of the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s deeper reservoirs. The program centered primarily on identification and counting of planktonic algae from several points in Las Vegas Bay. Additional work on nutrient enrichment of water samples was conducted to aid in interpretation of algal distribution related to nutrient input. Examination of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological parameters, both at many surface points in the bay, as well as in vertical profile, was also accomplished and further aided interpretation of nutrient cycling, sources of nutrient input and other limnological events commonly associated with the process of eutrophication. One copy of data is provided as an appendix to this report. Other copies are available on request. An intensive sampling program has been the core of the project. Fifteen stations were located to provide an 2 ̆ 2 early warning 2 ̆ 2 network for detection of directed movement of water bodies or strata in the bay, reliability in evaluation of surface plankton distributions, and reference points for exploitation of unanticipated opportunities. These stations were visited approximately weekly during the contract period for plankton samples to evaluate biologically-induced or biologically - responsive changes as cumulative indices of the chemical status of the system. Evaluation of results was aided by determinations of depth profiles of the standard limnological parameters: temperature, a measure of the degree of stratification or mixing of a lake, oxygen, pH and oxidation-reduction potential. Conductivity, to identify isothermal yet saline discontinuities and especially the location of the flow from Las Vegas Wash, was also measured. Colonies or unicellular plankton were counted to determine distribution versus time over the bay surface. Distribution and density, rather than productivity, was of primary interest; although evidence for growth or accumulation at given points was also obtained. Chemical analyses for <b>principal</b> anions and <b>cations</b> (such as sulfate, chloride, sodium and potassium) and major nutrients (such as phosphate) were performed in cooperation with Desert Research Institute and Environmental Protection Agency. Counts of total and coliform bacteria were made on samples from vertical profiles at various times to establish the reason for the pattern of oxygen depletion found...|$|R
