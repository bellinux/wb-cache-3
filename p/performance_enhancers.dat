25|$|In February 2009, Selena Roberts and David Epstein of Sports Illustrated {{reported}} that Rodriguez had {{tested positive for}} two anabolic steroids, testosterone and Primobolan, during his 2003 season playing for the Texas Rangers, the same season in which he captured his first American League Most Valuable Player award, broke 300 career home runs (hitting 47 that year), and earned one of his ten Silver Slugger Awards. The information {{had been part of}} a government-sealed report detailing 104 major league players (out of 1200 players tested) who tested positive for <b>performance</b> <b>enhancers</b> during a 2003 drug survey. Approved by the players themselves with the promise of anonymity, the survey was conducted by Major League Baseball to see whether a mandatory drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, {{as the result of a}} collectively bargained union agreement, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive test. Because more than 5% of the samples taken from players in 2003 came back positive, mandatory testing of major league baseball players began in 2004, with penalties for violations.|$|E

2500|$|O'Neill's 2007 {{positive}} {{test for}} the prescription medication, Phentermine, {{for which he was}} legally prescribed, and which was legal OUT of competition, but not IN competition, there were then, and have been MANY high-profile positives since, revealed within the professional peloton, and these for actual <b>performance</b> <b>enhancers,</b> i.e., EPO, Growth Hormone, Steroids. These are medications that have NEVER been legal in the professional peloton, (Ivan Basso, Floyd Landis, Alejandro Valverde [...] Michael Rasmussen, Christian Vandevelde, George Hincapie, Tom Danielson, Levi Leipheimer, David Zabriski, Matt White, Lance Armstrong, etc. just to name a few.) In fact, one might assert that calling Phentermine a performance enhancer is specious. Quite possibly, O'Neill was made an example of, because of the other problems surfacing in the peloton, ASADA was determined to take a hard line on any doping, even for a substance that was legal out of competition. Perhaps, more nefarious intent, they simply wanted to divert attention from a much more insidious problem that they could not get a handle on, and would shake the foundations of the sport. Regardless, O'Neill wears the badge of [...] "Doper" [...] like every other positive test. The substance itself long forgotten.|$|E
2500|$|With Benoit and {{his death}} {{allegedly}} linked to steroid abuse, WWE went {{under investigation by}} the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding their talent wellness policy. Congress did not take action against either the WWE or any other professional wrestling company {{in the wake of the}} event. In January 2009, Henry Waxman, outgoing chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requested that the Office of National Drug Control Policy chief, John P. Walters, [...] "examine steroid use in professional wrestling and take appropriate steps to address this problem." [...] In the letter, Waxman stated [...] "In the first year of WWE's testing program, which began in March 2006, 40% of wrestlers tested positive for steroids and other drugs, even after being warned in advance that they were going to be tested." [...] He also wrote about how wrestlers who test positive for <b>performance</b> <b>enhancers</b> receive light punishment and afterwards can often participate in wrestling events. The committee investigation also uncovered how easily wrestlers can secure [...] "therapeutic use exemptions" [...] (TUEs, permission to take banned substances for medical reasons) so they can continue performing while using steroids. When Waxman's staff interviewed Dr. Tracy Ray, a physician contracted by WWE, Ray claimed there was [...] "shadiness in almost every [...] case that I've reviewed." ...|$|E

50|$|The classifications of {{substances}} as performance-enhancing substances {{are not entirely}} clear-cut and objective.

As is usual with categorization, there are borderline cases; caffeine, for example, is considered a performance enhancer by some but not others.|$|E

50|$|Ripping is {{considered}} a slow and sometimes painful process due to diet and exercise.

There are many types of <b>performance</b> <b>enhancers</b> that can help with the loss of fat and the maintenance of muscle tissue. Of course, it is extremely unlikely that any <b>performance</b> <b>enhancers</b> or steroids will have an effect unless the person taking them is taking part in exercise or a specific diet plan.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{experiment}} {{evaluated the}} influence of isolated or associated phytogenic additives (PA) and organic acids (OA) on nutrient digestibility, performance and carcass characteristics of broiler chickens. Two experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with a 2 √ó 2 + 1 factorial arrangement of treatments (with or without PA √ó with or without OA + antibiotic <b>performance</b> <b>enhancer</b> and anticoccidial). In the first experiment, two metabolic tests were conducted to determine the metabolizability coefficients of the nutrients of starter and growth diets. In the second experiment, 2520 one-day-old chicks were housed in 40 experimental units to evaluate the performance and carcass characteristics. The phytogenic additives and organic acids, isolated or associated, improve the nutrient digestibility of the diet and replace the growth- promoting antibiotics. The use of organic acids isolated or associated with phytogenic additives in broiler diets improves broiler performance in comparison with free antibiotic <b>performance</b> <b>enhancer</b> at 42 days of age. Isolated or associated phytogenic additives and organic acids provided better carcass characteristics...|$|R

In ripping, it is considered that dieting that has the largest involvement, second to the workout. It is not just what food to eat that becomes a concern {{but it is the}} time in which one should consume that food that is equally important.|$|E
