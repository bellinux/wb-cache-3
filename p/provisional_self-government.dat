UNMIK was given exclusive rights to manage Kosovo's economic affairs and stated its intent in the Constitutional Framework to establish a market economy. Prior to 1999, much of Kosovo's economy had been controlled by the state. All publicly owned enterprises were owned by the Yugoslav government or the Serbian state, both governed from Belgrade. When UNMIK began implementing privatization of assets that it did not own, Serbs with interests in the companies subject to privatization sued first UNMIK and then the UN in New York.|$|E

40|$|Introduction]. To try to {{elaborate}} {{a proposal for}} a liberal concept aimed at a sustained economic revival in a postcommunist society already making its first steps in the transformation and transition towards democracy and market economy is not an easy task. However, in 2002 some good examples and some lessons learned in other countries in transition may help a lot in the attempt to suggest the most appropriate model. Unfortunately there are also cases where the application of the learned lessons is almost impossible, due to the unique character of the situation. One such case is Kosovo. The well-known German expert on South Eastern Europe Viktor Meier wrote in March 2001 : " [...] . Kosovo is a place without a legal system, neither for civil nor for economic needs, without a regulated property status for its big enterprises, which are not functioning, without a regulated foreign trade, without a functioning monetary and credit system, without a political representation and even a normal identity documents for its citizens and with a security system inadequate to address any task beyond the very basic police duties, not to speak about fighting the mafia [...] " One year later a lot of these statements do not correspond with reality. The progress made was so immense that the experts have enough arguments for optimistic forecasts. The Kosovo Assembly and a <b>provisional</b> <b>Self-Government</b> are in place. The economic situation looks considerably better. Improvements in the everyday life are visible. Nevertheless a lot of obstacles making the transition towards a functioning market economy an extremely hard endeavor remain in place, thus adding some uncertainties to any attempt to address the economic challenges of the future. Taking into consideration the complexity of the situation the experts from the Center for European Integration Studies (ZEI) at the Bonn University, Germany and the liberal Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, Germany decided to follow the old Chinese proverb " [...] . instead of cursing the darkness, try to light a candle" by offering some suggestions about a liberal concept for a sustained economic revival in Kosovo. These suggestions are results of a short fact finding mission in Kosovo (11. - 14. 12. 2001) including 13 interview sessions with almost 30 representatives from local administration and politics, from research institutes, think-tanks and NGOs, from the business community and from the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and other international organizations. The paper produced is far from pretending to be a recipe {{for the establishment of a}} functioning market economy in Kosovo. The limited number of interviews, the absence of a clear political, legal and status parameters, the lack of reliable statistical sources, the unique character of the situation, the short period of time surely have some negative impact on the paper. But the intention of the authors was not to pretend to be the last instance of truth. More challenging was to try to provoke a discussion among experts, politicians and businessmen and to look together for the best suitable approach for Kosovo. Because every success in the economic field is a joint effort and the benefits are for the whole society...|$|E

This study argues the UN has success potential in peacebuilding, statebuilding in particular, rather than conflict prevention and peacemaking. The empirical base {{of the study is}} the Kosovo statebuilding process from 1999 to 2008. An in-depth analysis of institution building of Kosovo political institutions indicates the UN has the ability to create a new path for sustainable institutions that lead to sustainable peace in postwar countries. The UN should cooperate with local actors in order to construct the new path and continuously support them until they become mature. Once cooperation of the UN and locals sets the path for new institutions, they will continue on their established path more with each down on that path. Kosovo institutions illustrate maturity and development in their success level based on Huntington’s criteria for successful institutions.

40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the significance}} of the rich cultural heritage in Kosovo and Metohija as well as the consequences of its destruction and ruining. Along with this, she takes into consideration the international standards of protection of the cultural heritage in the world. Development of these standards is manifested in increasingly broad implementation of the existing and adoption of new international conventions whose goal is to protect as comprehensively as possible the cultural heritage of the mankind. The author gives a survey of the most important conventions adopted by the UNESCO and the Council of Europe, pointing to {{the significance of}} implementation of the Hague Convention and its 1999 Second Protocol introducing the international criminal responsibility for the persons who violate or order violations of the protected cultural property. The paper presents historical, esthetical archaeological, ethnological, scientific and some other values of the cultural heritage in Kosovo. By its characteristics, these values speak of the presence of various religions and civilisations here, while the value of the cultural property in Kosovo and Metohija is far from being merely local and regional. This fully applies to {{the significance of the}} cultural monuments of the Serbs. Since Kosovo is under a special international protectorate, UNMIK is also in charge of the preservation of the cultural heritage, what is in accordance with the Resolution 1244 of the Security Council. Also the Joint Document of UNMIK and FRY (November 2001), the chapter on protection of the cultural property confirms the willingness to implement the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention (1954) on protection of the monuments of culture and cultural property. Apart from this, the author points out that the Constitutional Framework for <b>Provisional</b> <b>Self-Government</b> in Kosovo (May 2001) provides for the obligation of the Provisional Institutions of Kosovo to create conditions in order to enable the communities to preserve, protect and develop their identities also pointing to the their duty to work on promotion and preservation of the cultural heritage of all communities with no discrimination. However, in spite of the presence of the international forces in Kosovo and Metohija that should guarantee the implementation of the above mentioned documents and the international standards set by the UNESCO and the Council of Europe destruction of the Serb monuments of culture had not been prevented, and it was particularly prominent in the wave of violence in March 2004. In those events were also destroyed several dozens of Orthodox churches and monasteries, what was noted in the joint statement made by the Council of Europe and European Commission {{as well as in the}} report submitted by the UNESCO. The paper also analyses the international programmes of cultural heritage protection in Kosovo, pointing to the basic conclusions and proposals submitted by the missions of the UNESCO, Council of Europe and European Commission that visited Kosovo and Metohija several times. They point out that the violation of international standards in Kosovo is reflected in the deliberate destruction as well as the lack of any protection measures of the monuments from further ruining that results from not taking care of them. Destruction of the religious and cultural heritage is one of the ways for manifesting hostilities as well as the methods for "erasing" the evidence on the historical presence of the people in Kosovo. Apart from this, the author points out that the bad conditions of the cultural heritage in Kosovo also result from the involvement of the international organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, that in this field has often been partial and with no defined programmes and priorities. The author takes a critical consideration of the insufficient involvement of the Serbian authorities in this field, what is, among other things, reflected in the lack of elaborated programme of activities non-coordination and lack of continuity in their work. The author points to the impact of the violence committed in March 2004, as well as on the further work and composition of the international missions, this above referring to the common mission of the Council of Europe and European Commission. These events have in a brutal way drawn attention to the real picture of the bad conditions of the Serb cultural heritage in Kosovo and Metohija, after which the restoration of the destroyed and protection of the remaining monuments of the Serb culture has gained a more important role in involvement of the international community in this field. This role implies above all, involvement of the representatives of the Serb community in the work of the organs and bodies established by the Council of Europe and European Commission with the aim of restoring the monuments of culture of religious character. The article also gives a survey of the measures that SM and Serbia, itself, have already taken or are going to take for the purpose of protecting cultural property in the Province. According to the author's conclusion, in order to apply comprehensive and efficient measures of restoration of the destroyed and damaged monuments of culture and protection of the remaining ones in Kosovo and Metohija it is necessary to, with no delay, ensure the co-ordination of activities of the international and domestic bodies and organisations in order to prevent the irretrievable loss of the rich cultural heritage...|$|E
