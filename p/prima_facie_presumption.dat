25|$|Treasure trove had to {{be hidden}} with animus revocandi, that is, an {{intention}} to recover it later. If an object was simply lost or abandoned (for instance, scattered {{on the surface of}} the earth or in the sea), it belonged either to the first person who found it or to the landowner according to the law of finders, that is, legal principles concerning the finding of objects. For this reason, the objects found in 1939 at Sutton Hoo were determined not to be treasure trove; as the objects were part of a ship burial, there had been no intention to recover the buried objects later. The Crown had a prerogative right to treasure trove, and if the circumstances under which an object was found raised a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>presumption</b> that it had been hidden, it belonged to the Crown unless someone else could show a better title to it.

60|$|The social {{subordination}} of women thus stands out an isolated fact in modern social institutions; a solitary breach of what has become their fundamental law; a single relic of an old world of thought and practice exploded in everything else, but retained in the one thing of most universal interest; as if a gigantic dolmen, or a vast temple of Jupiter Olympius, occupied the site of St. Paul's and received daily worship, while the surrounding Christian churches were only resorted to on fasts and festivals. This entire discrepancy between one social fact and all those which accompany it, and the radical opposition between its nature and the progressive movement which is the boast of the modern world, and which has successively swept away everything else of an analogous character, surely affords, to a conscientious observer of human tendencies, serious matter for reflection. It raises a <b>primâ</b> <b>facie</b> <b>presumption</b> on the unfavourable side, far outweighing any which custom and usage could in such circumstances create on the favourable; and should at least suffice to make this, like the choice between republicanism and royalty, a balanced question.|$|E

40|$|The essay {{maintains}} that the WTO Appellate Body 2 ̆ 7 s concepts and terminology concerning a claimant 2 ̆ 7 s burden of proof-the concepts of <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case, <b>presumption,</b> and burden shifting-are disturbingly ambiguous and potentially misleading. This is so whether one thinks of these terms from either a common law or a civil law perspective. In {{the face of the}} current ambiguity, a future panel might understand the AB 2 ̆ 7 s <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case concept to require an overwhelming level of proof from the claimant. On the other hand, a different panel might allow a rather weak level of claimant 2 ̆ 7 s proof to meet the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> requirement, and then shift the full burden of proof to the respondent. Neither of these results would be justified. An important task of future AB decisions should be to clarify the existing ambiguity and to develop a more conceptually sound use of burden of proof terminology. The essay argues that the AB should abandon its current terminology (<b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case, <b>presumption,</b> and burden shifting) and should simply state that the complaining Member bears the burden of proof on its basic claim and that this burden-meaning essentially the burden of persuasion-does not shift {{during the course of the}} proceeding.

40|$|The {{statutory}} {{penalties for}} illegal insider trading have become almost {{as severe as}} first-degree murder, yet we see insiders make {{tens of thousands of}} lucrative transactions every year. Moreover, the increase in penalties over time has done little to slow down insider trading. We argue that the resolution of their paradox lies in understanding the concept of material, non-public information. As long as there is no clear definition of what is illegal under the statutes, insiders and tippees will continue to trade profitably, with little to fear from seemingly draconian sanctions. To prevent further abuse of insiders’ informational privileges, we offer a new evidentiary presumption. We propose that the a prima facie case for illegality be found upon proof that: 1) the information giving rise to the trade is of the type that requires an 8 -K filing by the corporation; 2) upon announcement, it must lead to statistically significant abnormal stock returns; and 3) the insider trading must have occurred within two months prior to the announcement of the information. Of course, our presumption does not cover all possible instances of insider trading and it is not intended to be comprehensive. For instance, insiders may trade on material, nonpublic information and yet, they may still end up losing money due to unexpected circumstances. Insiders may also exploit long-lived information beyond two months. Our objective is to provide a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>presumption</b> of what is always considered material, nonpublic information, similar to Rule 14 e- 3, which has declared takeover-related information to be always material and nonpublic. We expect that other types of trading will still fall in a grey area and will need to be resolved through a fact-finding process. Yet, we expect additional clarity will allow all insiders who {{want to be on the}} safe side of the law the ability to ensure that their transactions do not meet any of the conditions set forth abov...|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights, and some <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|R
50|$|Ross gives a list {{of seven}} <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties, which he does not claim is all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; non-maleficence; justice; beneficence; and self-improvement.

Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the absolute obligation or absolute duty, the action that the person ought to perform.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prima</b> <b>facie</b> ( [...] , , or from <b>prīmā</b> <b>faciē)</b> is a Latin {{expression}} meaning on {{its first}} encounter or at first sight. The literal translation would be [...] "at first face" [...] or [...] "at first appearance", from the feminine forms of primus ("first") and facies ("face"), both in the ablative case. In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be, [...] "on the face of it". The term <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> denotes evidence that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy. Most legal proceedings, in most jurisdictions, require a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.|$|R
40|$|Two years ago, in University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, the Supreme Court {{decided that}} a {{plaintiff}} in a Title VII retaliation case must prove but-for causation between his protected conduct and a defendant’s decision to take an adverse employment action against him. Although the Court was focusing only on the plaintiff’s ultimate burden of proof, several courts have interpreted Nassar’s pro-employer outcome as raising the burden plaintiffs must meet when attempting to establish a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. These courts are no longer accepting close temporal proximity between a plaintiff’s protected activity and the employer’s adverse employment action as being sufficient to establish the causal connection element of the plaintiff’s <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. As a result, plaintiffs in several jurisdictions are finding {{it more difficult to}} establish their <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> cases and are therefore losing at summary judgment. In this Article, I argue that although Nassar raised the ultimate burden for a plaintiff bringing Title VII retaliation claims, courts that are applying Nassar to the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage are applying Nassar incorrectly. There are four reasons these courts should not be raising the burden on a Title VII retaliation plaintiff as he is attempting to establish a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. First, the Supreme Court and all federal courts have consistently stated that establishing a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case should not be a difficult task, and applying Nassar to conclude that close temporal proximity is not sufficient to establish the causal connection element of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case contradicts that directive. Second, despite what several courts believe, Nassar did not address a plaintiff’s burden at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage; it simply addressed a plaintiff’s ultimate burden of proving but-for causation. Third, raising the burden on a plaintiff at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage will allow employers to avoid scrutiny of their alleged reasons for the adverse employment actions, and it is when employers are forced to provide those reasons that employers’ true motives are often discovered. And finally, any concern that not raising the burden at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage will result in frivolous EEOC charges and/or complaints in federal court is unwarranted. It is for these reasons that courts should not be using Nassar to raise a plaintiff’s burden at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage, but rather they should be using Nassar only for evaluating whether a plaintiff has met his ultimate burden of proving but-for causation...|$|R
40|$|A Rossian Just War Theory revises {{and extends}} the {{projects}} begun by Childress and O‘Connor, {{who argued that}} just war theory ought {{to be based on}} Rossian <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties. The project also leans heavily on the work of Michael Walzer and Jeff McMahan. This project will initiate a fourth segment, jus ante bellum, or justice before the war. ^ As an ethics of warfare based in <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties, the first question is what is necessary to justify overriding the duty of non-injury? The central idea is that the group of just war principles, together, must be satisfied in order to override the duty of non-injury. Articulating these principles in terms of <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties is covered in the first chapter. Two subsequent chapters address {{the question of how to}} ground jus ante bellum and jus post bellum in a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties framework? Jus ante bellum responsibilities are grounded in a duty to protect human rights and can be instances of overriding the duties of non-injury and fidelity. Chapter two introduces a picture of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties of the state in order to explicate jus ante bellum duties and fulfill <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties. Chapter three develops the idea of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties of the state in order to formulate a set of jus post bellum principles for an ethical set of restrictions on post-conflict reconstruction. ^ The final two chapters focus on challenges facing a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> just war theory. Chapter four concerns the question is how to handle individual judgments when the soldier has an obligation to fight and thus to override their <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duty of non-injury, but in their analysis the conditions of a just war have not obtained, and thus there is no moral justification for overriding non-injury. Chapter five covers the problem of supreme emergencies, tackling the question of whether it can be permissible to override non-combatant immunity in order to prevent horrific consequences. ...|$|R

Next, this article focuses on Reeve 2 ̆ 7 s identification of 2 ̆ 2 strength of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 as a factor to be considered on summary judgment, and discusses why it would be unwise and unworkable to interpret the words 2 ̆ 2 <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 in that factor as having the same meaning as the 2 ̆ 2 <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 proved in the first stage of the McDonnell Douglas framework. Finally, this article explains how and why courts should prevent the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case from 2 ̆ 2 popping up 2 ̆ 2 again in the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, where it would distort and disrupt the court from conducting a fair and reasoned evaluation of whether a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s discrimination claim should go to a jury. This article contends that {{it is a mistake to}} allow the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case to play a significant role in the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas analysis. Additionally, this article explains how the Aikens decision offered crucial insight into the proper role of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case in adjudging discrimination claims, and correctly concluded that the prime facie case should not be considered after the employer has presented a reason for its challenged action. Finally, this article argues that the Reeves decision, by making 2 ̆ 2 strength of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 a factor to be eonsidered at the final stage of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, threatens to give the traditional <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case far greater weight than is sensible or just...|$|R
