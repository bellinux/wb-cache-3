Wenger commented after the game that his team [...] "got the trophy we wanted" [...] while Strachan was in admiration of Southampton's performance: [...] "I'm very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they competed. I couldn't have asked for any more." [...] Keown said the FA Cup win was [...] "the best ever" [...] and Seaman felt the disappointment of losing out to Manchester United in the league spurred the team on. Football pundits Alan Hansen, Peter Schmeichel and Mark Hughes unanimously agreed that Arsenal deserved to win the match.|$|E

The show was reasonably well received. Wessex Scenes Darren Richman said [...] "what the series lacked in budget, it made up for in magnificent material" [...] and went on to call it [...] "far superior to the vastly overrated Little Britain" [...] and [...] "perhaps the greatest forgotten sketch show of modern times." [...] Eureka! TV, which released The Mitchell and Webb Situation on DVD in 2005, said that the show [...] "gushes forth an hilarious stream of surreal and quirkily inventive sketches", as well as calling it a [...] "cult success". In the interview with Wessex Scene, Mitchell stated that he was [...] "more <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it turned out than annoyed that it was only aired on a small channel." ...|$|E

[...] "I'm not <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I {{think it was a}} great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

500|$|Returning {{later in}} 2007, Ste and Amy {{eventually}} got back together. The pair moved {{into their own}} flat, {{to the dismay of}} Amy's father Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst). Despite this, Ste became increasingly violent and started to hit Amy, on one occasion even cutting off her ponytail. Slanina-Davis raised money from hair cut during the scene in aid the cancer charity CLIC Sargant. At this time, Amy became pregnant, but was unsure whether to keep the baby. Speaking about 2008 as a whole for Ste and Amy, producer Bryan Kirkwood said he was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Richardson had portrayed Ste in a sympathetic manner so viewers could understand - but not condone his behaviour. He thought he and Slanina-Davies delivered brilliant performances portraying the [...] "reality of so many 16-17-year-olds", struggling to make a life for themselves. He felt some of their scenes were [...] "downright shocking". Eventually, Amy decides to accept the help of her friends and family and leaves Ste for abusing her.|$|E
500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat {{as hard to}} take: [...] "It felt like a defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E
500|$|Bird {{stuck to}} {{elaborate}} scene planning, such as detailed animatics, {{to make sure}} there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed [...] "Macro" [...] early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the film was developed, noting that [...] "We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources." [...] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. [...] "People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something," [...] he recalled.|$|E

Viewers were so angry over Mary's death that they started a letter-writing campaign demanding for her reappearance. The show received such huge amounts of letters that eventually they admitted their mistake and asked Kozak to come back. She declined the offer since she was already working with other projects and she was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unusual <b>way</b> {{her character}} had made her exit. In February 1989, though, she made a brief return as an angel in Heaven. In 1987 Harley received a Soap Opera Digest Award from her role as Mary.|$|R

40|$|My {{doctoral}} {{research has}} explored how young children’s participation {{was put into}} practice—how it was ‘lived’ and negotiated—in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> one early learning and childcare setting. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> children’s participation is rooted in large part in the UN Convention on <b>the</b> Rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child (1989), which enshrines children’s right to express their views and have those views taken into account. However, young children’s participation rights are often overlooked. The more prominent discourse about young children has been one that focuses on early childhood as a preparatory period of life, in which adults must intervene and shape children’s development. My research has therefore focused on child-adult relationships within the early childhood setting, looking at how young children and early childhood practitioners ‘lived’ children’s participation and negotiated the tensions and challenges that arose for them. To carry out the research, I used an ethnographic methodology to study one fieldwork site in depth. ‘Castle Nursery’ was an early learning and childcare setting in Scotland, where practitioners professed to work in participatory ways with young children. <b>The</b> long-term nature <b>of</b> ethnography allowed me to observe how children’s participation was lived and negotiated at Castle Nursery over an eight-month period <b>of</b> fieldwork. <b>The</b> research found that practitioners challenged adult-led, ‘schoolified’ practices by foregrounding young children’s knowledge and contributions to the setting. Children’s participation was embedded into play-based pedagogy at Castle Nursery, with practitioners organising time and space to allow young children {{a great deal of}} influence over their daily experiences. Rather than planning adult-led learning activities, practitioners instead cultivated a rich learning environment for children to explore, through free-flow play. The thesis has also highlighted a variety of tensions and challenges that arose. Even at Castle Nursery, where practitioners were <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> their work challenged conventional norms about young children, there were limits to how far practitioners would take a participatory approach. The thesis has particularly highlighted <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> reflective practices about <b>the</b> ethical dimensions <b>of</b> early childhood practice. Uncertainty seemed to be an inevitable and enduring feature of living young children’s participation...|$|R
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Anasazi" [...] was rated an A, being described as [...] "mind-blowing if frustrating", with it being noted that the episode [...] "made fans want to fast-forward through summer." [...] Writing The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A-, noting that the episode [...] "has {{a lot of really}} strong moments" [...] and praising Duchovny's acting. However, he felt that the episode marked {{the point at which the}} series' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus, explaining that [...] "it's troubling that instead of answering any big issues here ... the show only gives us new directions". Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I'm <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it came together, what it did for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten. I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered." [...] He later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder. The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E

2500|$|On February 23, 2012 {{during a}} post-game press conference {{following}} a 62-52 loss to Stephen F.

Though Knight never apologized for his comments, he said he was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> his seniors responded after the criticism. [...] "They're the ones that deserve the credit," [...] he said. Knight led Lamar to its first 20-win season since 1988 and a third-place finish in the conference. Lamar would go on to win the Southland Conference Tournament and earn their first NCAA appearance since 2000.

[...] Penn State's defense received accolade for its play. Aside from captain and leader Mike Hull's continued strong play (he made 19 tackles, a career-high), [...] "a charged and freed-up Deion Barnes" [...] compiled seven tackles and 1.5 tackles for a loss, a [...] "savagely effective Austin Johnson" [...] totaled four tackles, and up and coming linebacker Brandon Bell posted 13 tackles. The week after the game, Penn State learned it would be without Zach Zwinak, whom it lost early in the game and was carted off the field, and Keiser, hurt earlier in practice, would miss <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, thus ending their Penn State careers, as they were both seniors.|$|R

2500|$|Criticism was {{not long}} in coming, largely from {{conservative}} elements of local churches of Christ in the nearby communities of Almo and Princeton, but also {{from as far away}} as El Paso, Texas. Dale drew fire for the his participation in the ecumenical effort of the St. Leo Catholic Church because he offered no criticism of the doctrines or practices of the Catholic Church while assisting them in their effort. Dale said that he was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which different religious groups co-existed peacefully within the local community and even went on to minimize any differences between them declaring that even he and his wife [...] "didn't agree on everything." [...] Critics pointed out that Dale's participation in the event coupled with the conciliatory message he delivered only served to assist the Catholic Church in their ecumenical effort to improve their image. They identified this as a violation of Eph. 5:11 and 2 John 9. Criticism came from conservative commentators such as Michael Heath, [...] Walter W. Pigg, and non-institutionalist Brian Yeager.|$|E
2500|$|His {{ability to}} {{correctly}} identify the biggest goats {{of a game}} is also widely admired, particularly when contrasted to archrival Russell Hantz's inability to not only keep the respect of a jury as Rob can, but to accurately judge the weakest opponents {{to bring to the}} end as Rob does. [...] However, many fans criticize Rob for his huge advantage in being a four-time player and having no real competition the entire season, giving him perhaps the easiest win in Survivor history. His tribemates were criticized for being too starstruck to act against Rob. Some fans also criticize him for probably having been unable to beat anyone other than his 2 ultimate goats (based upon cast interviews, amongst other indicators). [...] The jury has even indicated Phillip Sheppard could have beaten him had he followed through with his plan to [...] "own his game" [...] and reveal that he had purposely played the villain role to get taken to the end by Rob, and in doing so had duped Rob and his entire alliance. Instead Sheppard was rude, lashed out at Julie Wolfe after she had asked him if his son would be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he played the game, and gave all the credit to Rob, thus receiving only 1 vote (from Ralph Kiser, the one jury member Phillip showed respect towards at Final Tribal and throughout the game) and giving Rob the easy finish glove side.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career.
