40|$|Abstract Background The {{regulation}} of genes in multicellular organisms is generally achieved through the combinatorial activity of different transcription factors. However, the quantitative mechanisms {{of how a}} combination of transcription factors controls the expression of their target genes remain unknown. Results By using {{the information on the}} yeast transcription network and high-resolution time-series data, the combinatorial expression <b>profiles</b> of <b>regulators</b> that best correlate with the expression of their target genes are identified. We demonstrate that a number of factors, particularly time-shifts among the different regulators as well as conversion efficiencies of transcription factor mRNAs into functional binding regulators, {{play a key role in}} the quantification of target gene expression. By quantifying and integrating these factors, we have found a highly significant correlation between the combinatorial time-series expression <b>profile</b> of <b>regulators</b> and their target gene expression in 67. 1 % of the 161 known yeast three-regulator motifs and in 32. 9 % of 544 two-regulator motifs. For network motifs involved in the cell cycle, these percentages are much higher. Furthermore, the results have been verified with a high consistency in a second independent set of time-series data. Additional support comes from the finding that a high percentage of motifs again show a significant correlation in time-series data from stress-response studies. Conclusion Our data strongly support the concept that dynamic cumulative regulation is a major principle of quantitative transcriptional control. The proposed concept might also apply to other organisms and could be relevant for a wide range of biotechnological applications in which quantitative gene regulation plays a role...|$|R

[1] proposed a shifted cumulative model to dissect combinatorial gene regulation. They discovered significant correlations between the combined expression <b>profiles</b> of <b>regulators</b> and the time series of expression of their target gene. The work highlighted the importance of identifying integrative effects of multiple transcription factors and showed that this identification was possible. We did a series of experiments to study possible combinatorial regulatory mechanisms following their strategy, but we found that the correlation among three genes can increase significantly after time-shifted combination no matter whether there are regulatory relationships. Our observations led to the conclusion that such increases are not sufficient to infer cumulative regulation relations. We followed the strategy in He et al.

Specifically, let τ i (0 ≤ τ i ≤ τ max < n, where τ max is the maximum shift and n is the number of time points of the time series) be the time shift between regulator i and the target gene, and let R i (t) be the expression level of regulator i at time point t.

In plants, sRNAs are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs), repeat-associated siRNAs (ra-siRNAs), phased siRNAs (pha-siRNAs), cis and trans natural antisense transcript siRNAs (cis- and trans-nat siRNAs). Pima (Gossypium barbadense L.) {{is one of}} the most economically important fiber crops, producing the best and longest spin-nable fiber.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the auxin signalling network is made of 52 potentially interacting transcriptional regulators, activating or repressing gene expression. All the possible interactions were tested in two-way yeast- 2 -hybrid experiments. Our objective was to characterise this auxin signalling network and to quantify {{the influence of the}} dimerisation sequence dissimilarities on the interaction between transcriptional regulators. Results: We applied model-based graph clustering methods relying on connectivity <b>profiles</b> between transcriptional <b>regulators.</b> Incorporating dimerisation sequence dissimilarities as explanatory variables, we modelled their influence on the auxin network topology using mixture of linear models for random graphs. Our results provide evidence that the network can be simplified into four groups, three of them being closely related to biological groups.

The {{dramatic change in}} phenotype associated with transdifferen-tiation is underpinned by a global change in gene expression.

We applied ChIP-seq to map the chromosomal binding sites for two ISWI-containing nucleosome remodeling factors, ACF and RSF, in Drosophila em-bryos. Employing several polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against their signature subunits, ACF 1 and RSF- 1, robust profiles were obtained indi-cating that both remodelers co-occupied a large set of active promoters.

A total of 420 adolescents participated, including 342 typical and 78 clinically depressed adolescents. Data was collected in The Netherlands. A person-centered approach with Latent Profile Analysis was used, to identify underlying profiles of cognitive emotion regulation, based on the adolescents’ reports of their use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies when they were confronted with stressful life events. Nine different strategies, five purportedly adaptive and four maladaptive, were used as indicators. Four distinct profiles of cognitive emotion regulation strategies with distinct features were found: Low Regulators (n = 36), High Regulators (n = 174), Adaptive Regulators (n = 126) and Maladaptive Regulators (n = 84).

Here we describe the design of a transcriptional regulatory cascade to amplify the cell response to a given signal. We used the salicylate-responsive activators of Pseudomonas putida NahR of the naphthalene degradation plasmid NAH 7 and XyIS 2, a mutant regulator of the TOL plasmid for catabolism of m-xylene and their respective cognate promoters Psal and Pm. Control of the expression of xylS 2 with the nahR/Psal system permitted either their selective activation with specific effectors for each protein or the simultaneous activation of both of them with salicylate. When cells face the common effector of the two regulators, both the increase in XylS 2 concentration and the stimulation of its activity act synergistically on the Pm promoter, amplifying the gene expression capacity by at least one order of magnitude with respect to the individual systems. By changing the hierarchy of regulators, we showed that the specific features of the downstream regulator were crucial for the amplification effect.

Here, we investigated simultaneously the transcriptional changes of miRNA and mRNA expression levels over time after activation of the Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway by interferon-c stimulation of melanoma cells. To examine global miRNA and mRNA expression patterns, time-series microarray data were analysed. We observed delayed responses of miRNAs (after 24 - 48 h) with respect to mRNAs (12 - 24 h) and identified biological functions involved at {{each step of the}} cellular response.

First, multiple pathways to academic success were examined by comparing how motivation leads to academic outcomes (learning processes, academic behaviors, and grades) via self-regulation {{in high school and}} college by using structural equation modeling. As expected, the findings support the stance that there are different ways to achieve academic success. Surprisingly, emotion regulation mediated the relations between motivation and learning processes in favorite classes. Additionally, combinations of self-regulation were examined separately for type of class (favorite/least favorite) and age group (high school/college) using latent class analyses. As expected, these regulatory profiles mediated the relations between motivation and academic outcomes, found with structural equation modeling.

These sensitive mDA neurons express Pitx 3, a transcription factor that is critical for their survival during development. We used this dependence to identify, by flow cytometry and expression <b>profiling,</b> the negative <b>regulator</b> of G-protein signaling Rgs 6 for its restricted expression in these neurons. In contrast to Pitx 3 -/- mDA neurons that die during fetal (vSNc) or post-natal (VTA) period, the vSNc mDA neurons of Rgs 6 -/- mutant mice begin to exhibit unilateral signs of degeneration at around 6 months of age, and by one year cell loss is observed in a fraction of mice. Unilateral cell loss is accompanied by contralateral degenerating neurons that exhibit smaller cell size, altered morphology and reduced dendritic network. The degenerating neurons have low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and decreased nuclear Pitx 3; accordingly, expression of many Pitx 3 target gene products is altered, including Vmat 2, Bdnf, Aldh 1 a 1 (Adh 2) and Fgf 10. These low TH neurons also express markers of increased dopamine signaling, namely increased DAT and phospho-Erk 1 / 2 expression. The late onset degeneration may reflect the protective action of Rgs 6 against excessive DA signaling throughout life. Rgs 6 -dependent protection is thus critical for adult survival and maintenance of the vSNc mDA neurons that are most affected in PD...|$|R

Although several studies have explored gene expression during flower development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana on a genome-wide scale, a continuous series of expression data from the earliest floral stages until maturation has been lacking. Here, we used a floral induction system to close this information gap and to generate a reference dataset for stage-specific gene expression during flower formation. Results: Using a floral induction system, we collected floral buds at 14 different stages from the time of initiation until maturation. Using whole-genome microarray analysis, we identified 7, 405 genes that exhibit rapid expression changes during flower development. These genes comprise many known floral regulators and we found that the expression <b>profiles</b> for these <b>regulators</b> match their known expression patterns, thus validating the dataset. We analyzed groups of co-expressed genes for over-represented cellular and developmental functions through Gene Ontology analysis and found that they could be assigned specific patterns of activities, which are in agreement with the progression of flower development.

This approach allows a small {{subset of the}} population to survive without the prohibitive cost of constantly expressing resistance machinery at the population level. However, expression of multiple genes in concert is often needed to ensure survival, requiring coordination of infrequent events across many downstream targets. This {{raises the question of}} how cells orchestrate the timing of multiple rare events without adding cost. To investigate this, we used a stochastic model to study regulation of downstream target genes by a transcription factor. We compared several upstream <b>regulator</b> <b>profiles,</b> including constant expression, pulsatile dynamics, and noisy expression. We found that pulsatile dynamics and noise are sufficient to coordinate expression of multiple downstream genes. Notably, this is true even when fluctuations in the upstream regulator are far below the dissociation constants of the regulated genes, as with infrequently activated genes. As an example, we simulated the dynamics of the multiple antibiotic resistance activator (MarA) and 40 diverse downstream genes it regulates, determining that low-level dynamics in MarA are sufficient to coordinate expression of resistance mechanisms. We also demonstrated that noise can play a similar coordinating role. Importantly, we found that these benefits are present without a corresponding increase in the population-level cost. Therefore, our model suggests that low-level dynamics or noise in a transcription factor can coordinate expression of multiple stress response mechanisms by engaging them simultaneously without adding to the overall cost...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{building}} block of a gene regulatory network consists of a gene encoding a transcription factor (TF) and the gene(s) it regulates. Considerable efforts have been directed recently at devising experiments and algorithms to determine TFs and their corresponding target genes using gene expression {{and other types of}} data. The underlying problem is that the expression of a gene coding for the TF provides only limited information about the activity of the TF, which can also be controlled posttranscriptionally. In the absence of a reliable technology to routinely measure the activity of regulators, it is of great importance to understand whether this activity can be inferred from gene expression data. We here develop a statistical framework to reconstruct the activity of a TF from gene expression data of the target genes in its regulatory module. The novelty of our approach is that we embed the deterministic Michaelis–Menten model of gene regulation in this statistical framework. The kinetic parameters of the gene regulation model are inferred together with the profile of the TF regulator. We also obtain a goodness-of-fit test to verify the fit of the model. The model is applied to a time series involving the Streptomyces coelicolor bacterium. We focus on the transcriptional activator cdaR, which is partly responsible for the production of a particular type of antibiotic. The aim is to reconstruct the activity <b>profile</b> of this <b>regulator.</b> Our approach can be extended to include more complex regulatory relationships, such as multiple regulatory factors, competition, and cooperativity. ...|$|R

In this study we investigated the role of PARP- 1 on apoptosis in early myocardial reperfusion injury. Mice genetically deficient of PARP- 1 (PARP- 1 –/ –) and wild-type littermates were subjected to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Myocardial injury was assessed by measuring the serum levels of creatine phosphokinase and oligonucleosomal DNA fragments in the infarcted area. Expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl- 2, and the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, was analyzed by Western blot. Activation of caspases, important executioners of apoptosis, and activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway were evaluated. Gene expression <b>profiles</b> for apoptotic <b>regulators</b> between PARP- 1 –/ – and wild-type mice also were compared. Myocardial damage in PARP- 1 –/ – mice was reduced significantly, as indicated by lower serum creatine phosphokinase levels and reduction of apoptosis, as compared with wild-type mice. Western blot analyses showed increased expression of Bcl- 2, which was associated with reduction of caspase- 1 and caspase- 3 activation. This cardioprotection was associated with significant reduction of the activation of IκB kinase complex and NF-κB DNA binding. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of 29 known genes of apoptotic regulators was significantly altered in PARP- 1 –/ – mice compared with wild-type mice, whereas 6 known genes were similarly expressed in both genotypes.

We sought to study the activation of the LT and Wnt pathways during early- or late-onset allergic airway inflammation and to address regulatory mechanisms and clinical relevance in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) and nasal polyp tissues. Mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) allergens from days 3, 15, or 60 after birth. Remodeling factors in murine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue, or human nasal polyp tissue were analyzed by means of Western blotting, immunoassays, or histology. Regulatory mechanisms were studied in cytokine/HDM-stimulated NHBEs and macrophages. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid LT levels were increased in neonatal and adult but reduced in juvenile HDM-sensitized mice. Lungs of neonatally sensitized mice showed increased 5 -lipoxygenase levels, whereas adult mice expressed more group 10 secretory phospholipase A 2, Wnt 5 a, and transglutaminase 2 (Tgm 2). Older mice showed colocalization of Wnt 5 a and LT enzymes in the epithelium, a pattern also observed in human nasal polyps. IL- 4 promoted epithelial Wnt 5 a secretion, which upregulated macrophage Tgm 2 expression, and Tgm 2 inhibition in turn reduced LT release. Tgm 2, group 10 secretory phospholipase A 2, and LT enzymes in NHBEs and nasal polyps were refractory to corticosteroids.

To address this question, we used a comparative genomics approach that {{takes advantage of the}} large number of sequenced bacterial genomes to predict conserved and variable members of transcriptional regulatory networks across phylogenetically related organisms. Specifically, we developed a computational method to predict the conserved regulons of transcription factors across alpha-proteobacteria. We focused on the CRP/FNR super-family of transcription factors because it contains several well-characterized members, such as FNR, FixK, and DNR. While FNR, FixK, and DNR are each proposed to regulate different aspects of anaerobic metabolism, they are predicted to recognize very similar DNA target sequences, and they occur in various combinations among individual alpha-proteobacterial species. In this study, the composition of the respective FNR, FixK, or DNR conserved regulons across 87 alpha-proteobacterial species was predicted by comparing the phylogenetic <b>profiles</b> of the <b>regulators</b> with the <b>profiles</b> of putative target genes. The utility of our predictions was evaluated by experimentally characterizing the FnrL regulon (a FNR-type regulator) in the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Our results show that this approach correctly predicted many regulon members, provided new insights into the biological functions of the respective regulons for these regulators, and suggested models for {{the evolution of}} the corresponding transcriptional networks. Our findings also predict that, at least for the FNR-type regulators, there is a core set of target genes conserved across many species. In addition, the members of the so-called extended regulons for the FNR-type regulators vary even among closely related species, possibly reflecting species-specific adaptation to environmental and other factors.

Modelling methodologies {{on the other hand}} assume a given network structure and vary significantly in their algorithmic approach, ranging from over-simplified representations (e. g. Boolean networks) to detailed -but computationally expensive-network simulations (e. g. with differential equations). In this work we use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to model transcriptional regulatory cascades that emerge during the stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and extend in two layers. We confine the structure of the ANNs to match the structure of the biological networks as determined by gene expression, DNA-protein interaction and experimental evidence provided in publicly available databases. Trained ANNs are able to predict the expression profile of 11 target genes across multiple experimental conditions with a Correlation Coefficient > 0. 7. When time-dependent interactions between upstream transcription factors and their indirect targets are also included in the ANNs, accurate predictions are achieved for 30 / 34 target genes. Moreover, heterodimer formation is taken into account. We show that ANNs can be used to (a) accurately predict the expression of downstream genes in a 3 -layer transcriptional cascade based on the expression of their indirect regulators and (b) infer the condition- and time-dependent activity of various TFs as well as during heterodimer formation. We show that a three-layer regulatory cascade can successfully be modelled using ANNs with a similar configuratio...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{formation}} of flowers {{is one of}} the main model systems to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control developmental processes in plants. Although several studies have explored gene expression during flower development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana on a genome-wide scale, a continuous series of expression data from the earliest floral stages until maturation has been lacking. Here, we used a floral induction system to close this information gap and to generate a reference dataset for stage-specific gene expression during flower formation. Results Using a floral induction system, we collected floral buds at 14 different stages from the time of initiation until maturation. Using whole-genome microarray analysis, we identified 7, 405 genes that exhibit rapid expression changes during flower development. These genes comprise many known floral regulators and we found that the expression <b>profiles</b> for these <b>regulators</b> match their known expression patterns, thus validating the dataset. We analyzed groups of co-expressed genes for over-represented cellular and developmental functions through Gene Ontology analysis and found that they could be assigned specific patterns of activities, which are in agreement with the progression of flower development. Furthermore, by mapping binding sites of floral organ identity factors onto our dataset, we were able to identify gene groups that are likely predominantly under control of these transcriptional regulators. We further found that the distribution of paralogs among groups of co-expressed genes varies considerably, with genes expressed predominantly at early and intermediate stages of flower development showing the highest proportion of such genes. Conclusions Our results highlight and describe the dynamic expression changes undergone by a large number of genes during flower development. They further provide a comprehensive reference dataset for temporal gene expression during flower formation and we demonstrate that it can be used to integrate data from other genomics approaches such as genome-wide localization studies of transcription factor binding sites...|$|R
40|$|Context: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) {{represents the}} most common endocrine abnormality in women of reproductive age. The cause of PCOS remains largely unknown, but studies suggest an intrinsic ovarian abnormality. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to test our hypothesis that differences in granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis may underlie abnormalities that affect follicular development. Design: Granulosa cells were prepared from follicular fluid aspirated from 4 - to 8 -mm follicles of unstimulated ovaries during routine laparoscopy or laparotomy from women with anovulatory PCOS and those with regular ovulatory cycles. Setting: The study was conducted at a university hospital. Patients: Fourteen women with anovulatory PCOS and nine women with regular ovulatory cycles participated in the study. Main Outcome Measures: Immunocytochemistry on granulosa cells to investigate apoptotic and proliferation rates, together with real-time RT-PCR to analyze gene expression <b>profiles</b> of apoptotic <b>regulators,</b> was measured. Results: Significantly lower apoptotic rates were found in granulosa cells from patients with PCOS, compared with women with regular ovulatory cycles (P = 0. 004). Lower apoptotic rates were associated with decreased levels of the apoptotic effector caspase- 3 (P = 0. 001) and increased levels of the anti-apoptotic survival factor cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins- 2 in the PCOS group that were coupled to higher proliferation rates (P = 0. 032). Gene expression profiling confirmed the immunocytochemical findings. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there are significant differences in the rate of cell death and proliferation in granulosa cell populations in PCOS patients. These are associated with decreased expression of apoptotic effectors and increased expression of a cell survival factor. These results provide new insights that may be useful in developing specific therapeutic intervention strategies in PCOS...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Interstitial {{lung disease}} is {{a major cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc), with insufficiently effective treatment options. Progression of pulmonary fibrosis involves expanding populations of fibroblasts, and the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Characterisation of SSc lung fibroblast gene expression profiles underlying the fibrotic cell phenotype could enable {{a better understanding of the}} processes leading to the progressive build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. In this study we evaluate the transcriptomes of fibroblasts isolated from SSc lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis, compared with those from control lungs. METHODS: We used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the gene expression profile of pulmonary fibroblasts cultured from 8 patients with pulmonary fibrosis associated with SSc (SSc-ILD), with those from control lung tissue peripheral to resected cancer (n= 10). Fibroblast cultures from 3 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) were included as a further comparison. Genes differentially expressed were identified using two separate analysis programs following a set of pre-determined criteria: only genes significant in both analyses were considered. Microarray expression data was verified by qRT-PCR and/or western blot analysis. RESULTS: A total of 843 genes were identified as differentially expressed in pulmonary fibroblasts from SSc-ILD and/or IPF compared to control lung, with a large overlap in the expression profiles of both diseases. We observed increased expression of a TGF-beta response signature including fibrosis associated genes and myofibroblast markers, with marked heterogeneity across samples. Strongly suppressed expression of interferon stimulated genes, including antiviral, chemokine, and MHC class 1 genes, was uniformly observed in fibrotic fibroblasts. This expression <b>profile</b> includes key <b>regulators</b> and mediators of the interferon response, such as STAT 1, and CXCL 10, and was also independent of disease group. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a strongly suppressed interferon-stimulated gene program in fibroblasts from fibrotic lung. The data suggests that the repressed expression of interferon-stimulated genes may underpin critical aspects of the profibrotic fibroblast phenotype, identifying an area in pulmonary fibrosis that requires further investigation...|$|R

The QSi 5 inbred strain of mice was selected for high fecundity and low inter-litter interval, and is very successful at weaning large numbers of offspring {{when compared to other}} inbred strains. Results Post-natal pup weight gain was used to estimate mammary gland output and to compare the performance of QSi 5 mice to CBA mice. Cumulative litter weights and individual pup weight gain was significantly higher throughout the first eight days of lactation in QSi 5 mice compared to CBA mice. Morphometric analysis of mammary glands during pregnancy in QSi 5 mice revealed a 150 percent greater ductal side branching compared to CBA mice (P Wnt signalling. Eleven of these genes, including six genes from the MAPK signalling pathway, were identified as associated with postnatal growth. Further, positive mediators of Wnt signalling, including Wnt 4, Csnk 2 a 1 and Smad 4, were over-represented in the QSi 5 strain <b>profile,</b> while negative <b>regulators,</b> including Dkkl 1, Ppp 2 r 1 a and Nlk, were under-represented. These findings are consistent with the role of Wnt and MAPK signalling pathway in ductal morphogenesis and lobuloalveolar development suggesting enhanced activity in QSi 5 mice. A similar pattern of phenotype concordance was seen amongst 12 genes from the tight junction pathway, but a pattern did not emerge from the insulin signalling genes. Amongst a group of differentially expressed imprinted genes, two maternal imprinted genes that suppress growth induced via the IGF signalling pathway, Grb 10 and Igf 2 r, were under-represented in QSi 5 mice. Whereas Peg 3 and Plagl 1, both paternally imprinted genes that enhance neonatal growth, were over-represented in QSi 5 mice. Conclusion We propose that the combined action of at least three major signalling pathways involved in mammary gland development and milk secretion, namely Wnt, MAPK and tight junction pathways, contribute to the superior maternal performance phenotype in QSi 5 mice. Additionally, favourable expression patterns of the imprinted genes Peg 3, Plagl 1, Grb 10 and Igf 2 r may also contribute. </p...|$|R

40|$|Academic {{achievement}} gaps across racial, ethnic, {{and socioeconomic}} groups are apparent {{as soon as}} children enter kindergarten: racial minorities, Hispanics, and poor children begin school at a distinct disadvantage compared to their White peers from middle- and high-income families (Chatterji, 2005; Fryer, Jr. 2 ̆ 6 Levitt, 2004; Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, 2 ̆ 6 Waldfogel, 2004; Magnuson 2 ̆ 6 Waldfogel, 2005; Reardon, 2011). To understand these gaps at kindergarten entry, {{it is essential that}} researchers understand the skills with which children enter kindergarten. Previous research on school readiness has been limited by variable-centered methods that separate components of school readiness (e. g., early academic skills, social skills, engagement). As each entering kindergartner possesses their own set of school readiness skills, it is not likely that school readiness skills are independent of one another. School readiness may be better conceptualized and measured as patterns of skills that children possess at the beginning of kindergarten. These detectable patterns of school readiness skills present at kindergarten entry may deferentially support development of academic and non-academic achievement outcomes, such that strengths can promote the development of weaker skills across the kindergarten year. Within the framework of Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1994), this study investigated the nature of the relations among children 2 ̆ 7 s school readiness skills and their associations with development of academic, social, and engagement skills across the kindergarten year. This study used a person-centered analytic technique to identify profiles of school readiness present in entering kindergartners and explored the different developmental trajectories of academic, social, and engagement skills of children across these profiles. Five school readiness profiles were detected: 1) Scholastic, 2) On Par, 3) Room to Grow, 4) Super Regulator, and 5) Wiggler. Membership in these profiles was predicted by key demographic variables, and membership in profiles in turn uniquely predicted change in achievement outcomes across the kindergarten year. More specifically, children in the Super <b>Regulator</b> <b>profile</b> improved notably in academic skills, which were their weaker skills at school entry, but did not show improvement in social and engagement skills as a group across the year; children in the Wiggler profile showed moderate improvements in engagement skills, social skills, and self control across the year; children in the On Par profile showed no change in social and engagement skills, while showing the most improvement in math scores across all the profiles; the social and engagement skills of children in the Scholastic profile improved moderately, while their academic skills improved the least of all the groups; and children within the Room to Grow profile showed the most growth in social and engagement skills and improved moderately in math skills, but did not show the same improvement in reading skills. Furthermore, this study contrasted the person-centered approach described above to a more traditional, variable-centered approach. The author believes that the person-centered approach succeeded in providing findings about school readiness that can be more easily and succinctly communicated to early childhood education stakeholders than did the variable-centered approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{basis of}} {{regulatory}} decisions is the benefit-risk assessment, {{a complex process}} that requires the evaluation of quality, non-clinical and clinical data submitted by the pharmaceutical company. Unfortunately the scientific evidence supporting {{the use of a}} new product is always incomplete and therefore decisions have to be made under conditions of uncertainty. This thesis provides an insight into the regulatory decision-making process when it comes to dealing with situations of uncertainty and to evaluating the robustness and credibility of the evidence of medicines. We tried to describe the dynamics involved over the course of an application review and the factors guiding regulators in their decision-making process before the final outcome is presented to the world. Regulatory decision-making follows a process that requires flexibility. Based on the case of proton pump inhibitors in children we demonstrated that under certain circumstances the evidence already available may be enough and conducting additional clinical trials may be unnecessary. In other cases, when data are based on trials prematurely stopped for apparent benefit, evidence should be viewed with caution. We discussed the issues related to the interpretation of results based on interim analyses, and assessed how often trials early stopped for benefit are used for registration purposes. When evidence is considered insufficient this obviously leads to a non-approval, and it is especially due to lack of clinical relevance of the data submitted by the companies, as we highlighted in our research on applications withdrawn by companies prior to the conclusion of the evaluation process or refused at the end of it. However, even when a drug makes it to the market, an uncertain benefit/risk <b>profile</b> often leads <b>regulators</b> to what we call “precautionary approvals”, which tend to be tailored to restricted patient populations and are potentially distant from the actual clinical needs. We showed that the highest rate of regulatory restrictions is usually matched to shorter clinical developments in oncology. Uncertainty may also be interpreted differently across regulatory authorities and this may significantly affect patients’ access to relevant therapeutic options. We identified cases where EMA and FDA made different decisions based on the same data package, and cases where differences in the outcome of the EMA and FDA approval process were clinically relevant. These divergences, which were explored in an interview study involving EMA and FDA regulators, are due to “formal factors”, such as a different interpretation of clinical endpoints, as well as to “informal factors”, such as a different perception of risk and differences in the core organisational structures of regulatory agencies. The task of regulatory science is to evaluate and study regulatory systems in terms of their ability to ensure patient safety, enhance public health, and stimulate innovation. New and emerging sciences bring along new challenges for regulators and new potential avenues for regulatory science. Research in regulatory science in the next years will be facilitated by the increasing level of transparency and openness in the field of medicines regulation, fuelling better access to information on the decision-making process for the evaluation of medicinal product...|$|R
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P EE 2014 Linxxiv, 191 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmActive {{suspension}} system (ASS) {{has been growing}} its popularity in industrial development and academic research since 1980 s. The main advantage of electromagnetic ASS is its high performance in automotive applications. The ASS shows a high flexibility in control and provides enhanced comfort and safety to drivers and passengers when it is compared with the passive suspension. While compared to the pneumatic and hydraulic types, the ASS with electrical actuators can eliminate many mechanical components and perform faster response which in turn reduces the maintenance cost. Investigations into the electromagnetic ASS have been actively performed by worldwide researchers. Switched reluctance actuator (SRA) {{is a type of}} synchronous motors that has simple structure, low cost, robustness, and reliability characteristics. The linear motion type of SRA, linear switched reluctance actuator (LSRA), has inherent distinct advantages of high force and fault tolerance features, which align with the ASS operations to maintain equilibrium. The ASS with LSRA involves complex control. Variable reluctance and inherent nonlinear force characteristics are two major uncertainties that lead to implementation difficulty of LSRA control. Hence, an accurate position sensor is installed to the system for phase commutation and force control. A noise-free tracking mechanism is developed to acquire high precision position control. The ultimate objective of this project is to investigate and propose an effective nonlinear controller and position-tracking scheme for the quarter-car and full-car ASS equipped with LSRA. To achieve this target, the whole research work frame is divided into three phases. The first phase of research work is to investigate the linear actuator and develop the prototype of LSRA for the ASS. The magnetic path of the LSRA and its operation principle are reviewed. Based on the dimension and force requirement of the ASS, the specified magnetic circuit is modelled and analysed through finite element analysis (FEA). Moreover, the prototype model is developed and verified by experimental implementation through direct drive converter. Following the fabrication of the proposed LSRA, the experimental platform of the quarter-car ASS is built. The models of the quarter-car ASS and full-car ASS are developed for both force control of LSRA and nonlinear advanced control of ASS. The open-loop instability exists due to the external road disturbances which compensation algorithms are used to meet the standstill requirement; moreover, the coupling behaviour of the full-car ASS deteriorates the performance of the controller. To simplify the control scheme of the overall system, the ASS is divided into two subsystems, sprung part and unsprung part. The control issue focuses on the sprung part to improve the performance of the ASS. High accuracy position feedback is critical in this application. A novel tracking mechanism without the requirement of the system state equation, the so-called tracking differentiator (TD), is introduced to track the feedback displacement signal and to calculate its velocity directly through numerical method based on optimal control theory. The effectiveness of the TD is verified through position tracking of the sinusoidal road profile. A nonlinear proportional-derivative (PD) controller is developed for the quarter-car ASS. Both the simulation and experimental results illustrate that the electromagnetic active suspension control system can achieve a high motion performance and keep the system stable consistently with the proposed nonlinear PD controller. The developed nonlinear control method is more robust than that of linear PD controller under the variations of system parameters and road disturbances. The second phase of the research work is to improve the robustness of the whole {{suspension system}} by implementing the nonlinear controllers into the ASS. An integral sliding mode controller is examined. The integral item of integral sliding surface guarantees the stability of the nominal system at the initial time instant. In addition, adaptive mechanism is applied to the quarter-car ASS. An adaptive model following control method is used to determine the dynamic behaviour of the suspension system by predefining a reference model. The control input is generated through adaptive regulator based on partially known parameters and disturbances. Furthermore, combination of sliding mode technique and adaptation mechanism is attempted in this research to obtain the advantages of simplicity and robustness. The final phase of the research work is to propose both linear and nonlinear control algorithms for the full-car ASS. The full-car sprung mass subsystem is decoupled into three individual single-input single-output subsystems using decoupling transformation matrix. This results that the control complexity of the full-car active suspension is significantly simplified. The proposed control algorithms are categorised by two types of suspension models such that one is linear and the other is nonlinear. For the linear model, a Linear Model Following Control method is used to suppress the vertical vibration due to road <b>profile.</b> A proportional-derivative <b>regulator</b> is added to compensate the parameters variation and external disturbance. For the other one, a nonlinear sliding mode controller is applied. The discontinuous control laws of the sliding mode controller compensate the system uncertainties and unmodelled dynamics. The thesis presents a number of advanced control methods to successfully suppress the vertical oscillation of the ASS and it thus enhance the safety and comfort. It is confident that the new development will be applied to a vehicle {{for the next generation of}} mobility. Department of Electrical EngineeringPh.
