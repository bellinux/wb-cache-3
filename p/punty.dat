25|$|The {{earliest}} floats, {{including most}} Japanese glass fishing floats, were handmade by a glassblower. Recycled glass, especially old sake bottles, was typically used and air bubbles {{in the glass}} {{are a result of}} the rapid recycling process. After being blown, floats were removed from the blowpipe and sealed with a 'button' of melted glass before being placed in a cooling oven. (This sealing button is sometimes mistakenly identified as a pontil mark. However, no pontil (or <b>punty)</b> was used in the process of blowing glass floats.) While floats were still hot and soft, marks were often embossed on or near the sealing button to identify the float for trademark. These marks sometimes included kanji symbols.|$|E

This glass is then rolled on the marver, which was traditionally a flat slab of marble, but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called marvering, forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a stainless steel or iron rod called a <b>punty</b> [...] for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and/or to finalize the top.|$|E
2500|$|The bench is a {{glassblower}}'s workstation, {{and has a}} {{place for}} the glassblower to sit, {{a place for the}} handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or <b>punty</b> rides on while the blower works with the piece.

[...] In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly 6 inches square, one-half to one inch thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece. [...] Jacks are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later {{in the creation of a}} piece. Paddles are flat pieces of wood or graphite used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} cane, called vetro a fili [...] (glass with threads) {{is clear}} glass {{with one or}} more threads of colored (often white) glass running its length. It is commonly made by heating and shaping a chunk of clear, white, or colored glass {{on the end of a}} <b>punty,</b> and then ‘’gathering’’ molten clear glass over the color by dipping the <b>punty</b> in a furnace containing the clear glass. After the desired amount of clear glass is surrounding the color, this cylinder of hot glass is then shaped, cooled and heated until uniform in shape and temperature. Simultaneously an assistant prepares a 'post' which is another <b>punty</b> with a small platform of clear glass on the end. The post is pressed against the end of the hot cylinder of glass to connect them, and the glassblower (or ‘gaffer’) and assistant walk away from each other with the punties, until the cane is stretched to the desired length and diameter. The cane cools within minutes and is cut into small sections.|$|E
50|$|Streamers are {{prepared}} from very hot molten glass, {{gathered at the}} end of a <b>punty</b> (pontil) that is rapidly swung back and forth and stretched into long, thin strings that rapidly cool and harden. These hand-stretched streamers are pressed on the molten surface of sheet glass during the rolling process, and become permanently fused.|$|E
50|$|A pontil mark or punt mark is {{the scar}} where the pontil, <b>punty</b> or punt was broken from {{a work of}} blown glass. The {{presence}} of such a scar indicates that a glass bottle or bowl was blown freehand, while {{the absence of a}} punt mark suggests either that the mark has been obliterated or that the work was mold-blown.|$|E

5000|$|Crown {{glass was}} an early type of window glass. In this process, glass was blown into a [...] "crown" [...] or hollow globe. This was then {{transferred}} from the blowpipe to a <b>punty</b> and then flattened by reheating and spinning out the bowl-shaped piece of glass (bullion) into a flat disk by centrifugal force, up to 5 or 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 metres) in diameter. The glass was then cut to the size required.|$|E
5000|$|The {{thinnest}} {{glass was}} in a band {{at the edge of}} the disk, with the glass becoming thicker and more opaque toward the center. Known as a bullseye, the thicker center area around the <b>punty</b> mark was used for less expensive windows. In order to fill large window spaces with the best glass, many small diamond shapes would be cut from the edge of the disk and these would be mounted in a lead lattice work and fitted into the window frame.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods of making cane. In each, the fundamental technique is the same: {{a lump of}} glass, often containing some pattern of colored and clear glass, is heated in a furnace (glory hole) and then pulled, {{by means of a}} long metal rod (<b>punty)</b> attached at each end. As the glass is stretched out, it retains whatever cross-sectional pattern was in the original lump, but narrows quite uniformly along its length (due to the skill of the glassblowers doing the pulling, aided by the fact that if the glass becomes narrower at some point along the length, it cools more there and thus becomes stiffer). Cane is usually pulled until it reaches roughly the diameter of a pencil, [...] when, {{depending on the size of}} the original lump, it may be anywhere from one to fifty feet in length. After cooling, it is broken into sections usually from four to six inches long, which can then be used in making more complex canes or in other glassblowing techniques.|$|E

50|$|Most globes were plain glass, but {{sometimes}} they were <b>punty</b> cut or etched glass. Some had multiple stoppers, each stopper smaller than the one below, tapering to a small finial at the top. They could be freestanding or wall-mounted. If they were freestanding, they hung from a brass chain; the most elaborate had multiple tiers, each chamber containing a different color of water. It {{was not so much}} the pharmacists who were responsible for the evolution of show globes to works of arts, but American glass manufacturers. Pharmaceutical catalogs during the 1870s advertised numerous styles of show globes with each glass manufacturer developing his own design. A US patent was granted in 1869 to Henry Whitney of Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a show globe with a colored glass body with a neck and base of transparent uncolored glass. The purpose of this design was to eliminate the need to use colored liquids, which could leave a residue inside the bottle.Though oil could be used to illuminate the colored glass panes in windows, gas lighting in the early 19th century led to the general use of show globes. They could be lit from the interior or placed in front of a gas jet. In the US, globes were usually illuminated by a light placed behind them.|$|E
40|$|After shaping, the {{glassblower}} takes a jackline, {{which is}} {{like a pair of}} huge tweezers meant to manipulate the glass, puts the line in the neck of the piece, and cools it by putting water on it. Then they take a metal rod called a <b>punty,</b> which is tipped with hot glass, and use it to transfer the glass work. The glassblower attaches the <b>punty</b> to that end of it and breaks it off at the neck of the piece, which is called a transfer...|$|E
40|$|On foot of {{the success}} of the {{ruthenium}} tris-bipyridine complex as a complex capable of catalysing reactions which can convert solar energy into electrical energy, much work has been done to synthesize alternative ligands for use with ruthenium in an effort to increase stability. 1, 2, 4 -triazoles have, for a number of years, been synthesised with a view to acting as ligands in these ruthenium complexes. These complexes are vital pieces in the puzzle that will ultimately result in the development of successful artificial photosynthetic systems. While previous work has concentrated on investigation of electrochemical and photophysical properties of ruthenium complexes, this work concerns the synthesis of new 1, 2, 4 -triazole ligands and their complexes. These triazoles have been carefully pre-designed with the aim of being successful ligands in the search for the more efficient electrochemical devices. The thesis follows the logical thought process of the organic experimentalist. The initial challenge was not only to synthesise a heretofore-unknown ligand, but to also develop a synthetic procedure, which can be routinely followed, enabling the facile production of high yields of analogous ligands. The first chapter introduces the problem, which must be investigated. The reader is then introduced to the people and the research behind 1, 2, 4 -triazole synthesis aswell as the synthetic methods used. The next logical step in the process was to produce model compounds. This has the practical advantage of giving the researcher experience in the reactions required in the synthesis. It allows reaction methods to be compared and the possible pitfalls established at an early stage. During model synthesis, one of the stages of triazole synthesis, namely amidrazone formation, produced a bipyridyl dihydrazide molecule from which we obtained a never before reported crystal structure. Along with successful model compound synthesis, a thorough spectroscopic investigation of the 1, 2, 4 -triazoles by 1 H-NMR is described. Chapter two describes the synthesis of larger 1, 2, 4 -triazole containing molecules most of which comprise two 1, 2, 4 -traizole moieties encased in a heteroaromatic system. Research carried out into these ligands is discussed and the synthetic methods used evaluated. The experimental section of chapter two describes the synthesis of a number of new 1, 2, 4 -triazole ligands, termed the “target ligands” of the research. Extensive 1 H-NMR and microanalytical data is provided to confirm the <b>punty</b> of the ligands X-ray crystal structures of all but one of the ligands have been obtained, all of which are new and the publication of which is keenly awaited. Chapter three takes the research a stage further by incorporating the “target ligands” into ruthenium complexes. The issue of the removal of methyl ether protecting groups is discussed and solved. All of the target ligands were successfully complexed Detailed 1 H-NMR analysis is provided for all the complexes and a deuterated bis-bipyridyl version of each of the complexes prepared and spectroscopically compared. The X-ray crystal structure of one complex gives a superb illustration of the spatial make-up of these rarely reported molecules. Chapter three also contains an organic experimentalist’s introduction to the electrochemistry involved and a cursory investigation of each complex is provided. Ground and excited state absorption and emission results are presented, among others. Chapter four aims to put the thesis into perspective from a practical point of view. For all the experimental work, descriptions of solvent and chemical preparation, equipment and instrumentation used is provided. The aim of the thesis is to have, in this work, a bench-top manual of triazole production to serve as a clear and simple guide to aid researchers in furthering 1, 2, 4 - triazole synthesis toward the goal of the ultimate “target molecule”...|$|E
