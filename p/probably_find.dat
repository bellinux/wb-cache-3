[...] He stated that while the band was {{doing a lot of}} experimenting, something was still missing, but continued that newcomers would <b>probably</b> <b>find</b> the album quite interesting and original. [...] Trey Spencer of Sputnik Music described the album as a blend of elements from many of their previous albums, and also said {{it would be a good}} first album for new listeners to buy.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Douglas Pratt {{argued that}} Inseminoid {{consists}} of [...] "some gooey gore shots but few other thrills" [...] and denounced {{the quality of}} the acting and props used. He still conceded that Inseminoid [...] "goes through the motions properly, however, so fans will <b>probably</b> <b>find</b> it worth passing the time." [...] The film is award one star out of five on the AllRovi website, where reviewer Cavett Binion rules that it is a [...] "fairly standard rip-off" [...] of Alien in spite of the originality of its core premise, with a [...] "rabid, eye-popping performance" [...] from Geeson that is [...] "more than a bit uncomfortable to watch." [...] The rape sequence is seen as a [...] "surreal and truly disgusting flashback" [...] and the title of the film itself deemed [...] "sleazy".|$|E

[...] According to the review by Rob Steele of The Games Machine, the Atari ST version was entertaining and very enjoyable, even if [...] "wholeheartedly sexist". Jason Simmons from Amiga Action opined that the 1991 remake's [...] "advanced graphics and new control system have improved the game by a huge degree", but [...] "without a hard drive it is slow and almost a chore to play" [...] and those who played the original [...] "will <b>probably</b> <b>find</b> the new edition a waste of time and little more than an exercise in pretty pictures." [...] In 2004, Adventure Gamers' Rob Michaud wrote: [...] "Despite its weaknesses, it's a bona fide gaming classic, a must-play for adventure history buffs as well as those who just like risqué humor." ...|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{views of}} Pornography {{have been more}} favourable. In his {{biography}} of the Cure, Never Enough: The Story of the Cure, Jeff Apter wrote that it [...] "turned {{out to be the}} kind of album—just like Lou Reed's Berlin or Bowie's coke-fueled Low—that required some distance and a good few years of music history to be really appreciated". In 1995, Mark Coleman of Rolling Stone noted that Pornography had come to be [...] "revered by Cureheads as a masterstroke", while noting that [...] "normal listeners will <b>probably</b> <b>find</b> it impenetrable". Stewart Mason of AllMusic found it to be [...] "much better than most mainstream critics of the time thought", but at the same time [...] "not the masterpiece some fans have claimed it to be" [...] and [...] "just a bit too uneven to be considered a classic". In 2004, Jaime Gill of BBC Music singled out the album's [...] "sonic depth and sheer relentless conviction" [...] for praise, adding that without these qualities, its [...] "extraordinary misanthropy would be laughable". Uncut called Pornography [...] "a masterpiece of claustrophobic self-loathing".|$|E
500|$|My Gym Partner's a Monkey {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. William Barker of Web Wombat gave the King of the Jungle DVD a positive review, awarding {{it with a}} score of 70%, saying: [...] "With an original – dare I say unique? – premise, My Gym Partner's a Monkey makes for a somewhat refreshing change from super heroes and mutants, and the cut-out animation style is captivating, though far from novel. It's not the most impressive cartoon show I've ever seen, but it's quite cute and fairly amusing – even for the older primates among us." [...] Larisa Wiseman of Common Sense Media awarded the series three out of five stars, saying: [...] "It's difficult to tell what age group the show's producers were aiming at – the animation style and slapstick by themselves would seem to appeal mainly to grade-schoolers, while the jokes and life lessons are definitely aimed at the tween set. The sly humor may even give some adults the occasional laugh-out-loud moment. Overall, My Gym Partner's a Monkey is commendable for its effort to include a subtle message in each episode. Younger viewers will <b>probably</b> <b>find</b> Jake's sometimes-annoying goofiness amusing, and will definitely find the story lines entertaining." ...|$|E

5000|$|The modern word is French, {{deriving}} from Middle French where it {{referred to a}} court official charged with transportation of supplies. [...] This {{use of the term}} dates to a period when pack animals would be used to transport supplies.

In Late Latin, sagma referred to a packsaddle.|$|R

500|$|This {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1911 based on three collections made by his colleague Franklin Sumner Earle in Santiago de las vegas (Cuba) {{a few years}} earlier. It was originally described by Murrill in the genus Volvariopsis, created in the same publication, because at that time there was considerable confusion about which generic name was more appropriate for the mushrooms traditionally classified in the genus Volvariella. At the time of Murrill's proposal most species in this group were classified in the genus Volvaria erected by Paul Kummer in 1871, but mycologists realized that the name Volvaria was already taken {{as it had been}} coined by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle for a genus of lichens in 1805. A year later Murrill transferred his species of Volvariopsis to the genus Volvaria, citing practical concerns about usage of names for non-taxonomists: [...] "A number of species of gill-fungi described by me from tropical America in Mycologia, 1911–1912, under genera not found in Saccardo's Sylloge, are here recombined for the benefit of those having or using herbaria arranged according to this work. Collectors, pathologists, and others who may not be intimately acquainted with taxonomic methods will <b>probably</b> <b>find</b> it more convenient to follow the one system until a comprehensive revision is completed, at least for some important groups".|$|E

50|$|Giorgio Vasari, {{an artist}} and biographer of the Italian Renaissance, states that Pisanello also worked in the {{workshop}} of Andrea del Castagno, author of the painted equestrian monument of Niccolò da Tolentino (1456) in the Cathedral in Florence. He must also have known Paolo Uccello, the painter of the Battle of San Romano with its many horses.

2500|$|So serial {{thinking}} is something that's {{come into our}} consciousness and will be there forever: it's relativity and nothing else. It just says: Use all the components of any given number of elements, don't leave out individual elements, use them all with equal importance {{and try to find}} an equidistant scale so that certain steps are no larger than others. It's a spiritual and democratic attitude toward the world. The stars are organized in a serial way.

40|$|This {{essay is}} part of an attempt to {{reconcile}} two extreme views in economics: the (neglected) subjective, apriorist approach and the (standard) objective, scientific (i. e., falsifiable) approach. The Austrian subjective view of value, building on Carl Menger’s theory of value, was developed into a theory of economics as being entirely an a priori theory of action. This <b>probably</b> <b>finds</b> its most extreme statement in Ludwig von Mises’ Human Action (1949). In contrast, the standard economic view has developed into making falsifiable predictions about economic phenomena whereby the truth of the assumptions, especially about economic agents, is relatively unimportant: predictive fecundity is all. This finds an extreme statement in Milton Friedman’s introductory essay in his Essays in Positive Economics (1953). However, many economists fall somewhere between the two extremes, such as McKenzie and Tullock (1978) ...|$|R
2500|$|Cheryl Anderson, in {{her book}} Ancient Laws and Contemporary Controversies: The Need for Inclusive Bible Interpretation, {{discusses}} an anecdote about a student, who, when exposed to the passages in Deuteronomy, said that [...] "This is the word of God.

2500|$|Native Hawaiians {{may have}} known about Kauō before Americans and Europeans sailed their ships into {{the region in the}} early 19th century. The first {{reported}} sightings of the island were by Massachusetts whalers in the 1820s. The Nantucket Enquirer reported a sighting in 1825. Here we <b>probably</b> <b>find</b> the first reference to the name Laysan in print. [...] They were among many who took advantage of the newly discovered whaling grounds off the coast of Japan, making the waters around the Northwest Hawaian archipelago an increasingly popular commercial route. A United States government survey of Pacific Ocean geography in 1828 included the earlier whalers' reports and an additional sighting of an island fitting Laysan's description by Capt. [...] "Brigs." [...] This may refer to Capt. John Briggs of New Bedford, who may have come across the island as early as 1822. Various publications name Capt. Stanyukovich of the Russian ship Moller as the discoverer of Laysan. Although he mapped the island in 1828 and attempted to name it for his ship, he clearly was there after the New Englanders, at least.|$|E
2500|$|In {{looking at}} the {{creation}} of Native Authorities at Oke-Imo, Ilesa in 1900 by Major Reeve Tucker [...] and the re-organization of North East District in December, 1912; [...] the separation of Ijesa, Ekiti and other areas on 1 January 1913 {{and the creation of}} Ekiti Native Authority [...] with its headquarters at Ado-Ekiti; it is obvious that conflicts and agitations for local autonomy had pervaded politics of traditional institutions in Ekitiland. When the British moved its administrative centre for Ekiti District to Ado-Ekiti in 1913 where the Ewi holds sway, [...] the change in political status of Ado-Ekiti spurred a desire in other traditional authorities across Ekitiland to further demand for local autonomies. The heightened struggle did not give credibility to the fact that Ado-Ekiti which was eventually picked was already the official and major administrative capital of Ekitiland since 1 January 1913, [...] nor did it occur to the agitators that it had over time become a second home for all Ekiti people irrespective of their hometown of place of origin.
