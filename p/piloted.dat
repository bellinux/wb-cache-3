In general, <b>pilot</b> scheduling schemes include time-shifted <b>pilots,</b> power control, fractional <b>pilot</b> reuse, and <b>pilot</b> coordination scheduling.|$|R

5|$|The Little Boy pre-assemblies were {{designated}} L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first drop test {{was conducted with}} L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped over the sea near Tinian {{in order to test}} the radar altimeter by the B-29 later known as Big Stink, <b>piloted</b> by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, the commander of the 509th Composite Group. Two more drop tests over the sea were made on 24 and 25 July, using the L-2 and L-5 units in order to test all components. Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 Next Objective, <b>piloted</b> by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, Enola Gay, <b>piloted</b> by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.|$|E

Concorde 002 followed suit on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East. Concorde 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973, landing at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airport's opening.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a hybrid pilot-aided channel estimation technique for mitigating {{the effect of}} <b>pilot</b> contamination for the uplink of multi-cell multiuser massive MIMO systems. The proposed hybrid <b>pilot</b> is designed such that it enjoys the complementary advantages between time-multiplexed (TM) <b>pilot</b> and time-superimposed (TS) <b>pilot,</b> and thereby, allows superior solution to the conventional <b>pilot</b> schemes. We mathematically characterize the impact of hybrid <b>pilot</b> on the massive MIMO uplink by deriving a closed-form approximation for the uplink achievable rate. In large-number-of-antennas regime, we obtain the asymptotically optimal solution for hybrid <b>pilot</b> by jointly designing the TM <b>pilot</b> and the TS <b>pilot.</b> It is shown that either TM <b>pilot</b> or TS <b>pilot</b> has the advantages for large frame-size and limited frame-size transmission, respectively, while the hybrid <b>pilot</b> scheme can offer a superior performance to that employing either TM <b>pilot</b> or TS <b>pilot.</b> Numerical results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed design.
