Tracy and People ex rel. Waldron v. Soper, and his successor, Seth Wakeman (18501855) filed the complaint in New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble. Although Martindale was district attorney when the complaint in Tracy was filed, he lost the election and attempted to litigate the mandamus issue as a <b>private</b> <b>attorney.</b>|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a <b>private</b> <b>attorney</b> after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1960, prisoners had {{virtually}} no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights. That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to police brutality, or deprived of religious reading material. In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; and in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. <b>Private</b> <b>attorney</b> Phil Hirschkop discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the Virginia State Penitentiary strike, and won an important victory in 1971's Landman v. Royster which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways. In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the National Prison Project. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as Ruiz v. Estelle (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 U.S. Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a fair trial so {{there could be no}} grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and <b>private</b> <b>attorney</b> Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E
5|$|Yasui had {{consulted}} {{a friend in}} the FBI prior to arrest, and consulted with other legal minds to try to test the legality of the orders. At trial he was defended by <b>private</b> <b>attorney</b> Earl Bernard. Gus J. Solomon, later a judge for the same court, had asked the national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui. One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non-jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee {{came to the conclusion that}} laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen. Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a $5000 fine.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there are}} states in Mexico where judges {{have a better}} {{understanding}} of the Convention and have ordered returns under the Convention, the USCA continues to note an overall pattern of noncompliance in Mexicoâ€™s judicial system. In the few cases that led to the return of the child to the United States, the LBP retained a <b>private</b> <b>attorney</b> with a greater understanding of the Conventionâ€™s principles than Mexican public prosecutors have tended to exhibit. Mexican courts delay Convention cases and often improperly treat them as custody decisions. See Convention, art. 16. In these instances, Mexican judges determine children to be well settled in the new environment and deny the application for return to the childâ€™s country of habitual residence. This determination could be avoided by handling Convention cases more expeditiously and adhering more closely to the Conventionâ€™s requirements. Mexican judges have also abused the [...] "amparo", a special type of constitutional challenge, which results in additional delays to Convention cases and increases the LBPâ€™s legal costs.|$|E
