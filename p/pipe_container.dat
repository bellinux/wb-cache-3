40|$|The use of {{concrete}} <b>pipe</b> <b>containers</b> for planting is becoming widely popular in Thailand because the essential soil physical environments for plant growth {{can easily be}} controlled. In this paper, we aimed to investigate the soil temperature and moisture content variations under Eastern Thailand climate throughout the soil within a concrete pipe, which applies to lime trees culture. Concrete pipes of 80  cm diameter and 40  cm height, and 1 -year-old and 2 -year-old lime trees were conducted. Soil temperature and moisture content at the depths of soil surface, 10  cm, 20  cm, 30  cm, and 40  cm were measured hourly during the day. The results show that average soil temperature and moisture content are different in all depths. Soil temperature at the surface {{was found to be}} higher during day time while lower during night time. The study also reveals that soil temperature decreases with depth at day time and vice-versa at night. Soil moisture content variations was found {{to be related to the}} canopy size of the trees. The preliminary data could be used for imposing fertigation regimes, soil moisture regime or different nutrient regime within concrete <b>pipe</b> <b>containers</b> for planting lime trees...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposition}} of the large back-log of plutonium residues at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (Rocky Flats) will require interim storage and subsequent shipment to a waste repository. Current plans call for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) and the transportation to WIPP in the TRUPACT-II. The transportation phase will require the residues to be packaged in a container that is more robust than a standard 55 -gallon waste drum. Rocky Flats has designed the <b>Pipe</b> Overpack <b>Container</b> to meet this need. It is desirable to use this same waste packaging for interim on-site storage in non-hardened buildings. To meet the safety concerns for this storage the <b>Pipe</b> Overpack <b>Container</b> {{has been subjected to}} a series of tests at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In addition to the tests required to qualify the <b>Pipe</b> Overpack <b>Container</b> as a waste container for shipment in the TRUPACT-II several tests were performed solely for the purpose of qualifying the container for interim storage.

50|$|The {{running of}} steam {{locomotives}} required water {{as well as}} coal. As a result, the water supply of a Betriebswerk played an important role. In order to guarantee the supply, almost all Bahnbetriebswerk had their own railway waterworks. These waterworks were equipped with various systems for delivering water (pumps, <b>pipes,</b> water <b>containers</b> and take-off points). Many Bahnbetriebswerke had two different waterworks: one railway waterworks that provided water for the engines and a drinking waterworks that supplied water for the employees of the depot. When Betriebswerke were eventually connected to the regional water network, their drinking waterworks was usually closed down. The water was extracted from springs, wells and ponds and then cleaned. Industrial water for the running the steam locomotives {{had to have a}} high level of quality. As a result, the railway waterworks developed their own filtering systems, where the water for operations was made usable. Especially important were the salt content and the hardness of the water.|$|R
40|$|The {{regulatory}} compliance determination for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant includes {{the consideration of}} room closure. Elements of the geomechanical processes include salt creep, gas generation and mechanical deformation of the waste residing in the rooms. The WIPP was certified as complying with regulatory requirements {{based in part on}} the implementation of room closure and material models for the waste. Since the WIPP began receiving waste in 1999, waste packages have been identified that are appreciably more robust than the 55 -gallon drums characterized for the initial calculations. The pipe overpack comprises one such waste package. This report develops material model parameters for the <b>pipe</b> overpack <b>containers</b> by using axisymmetrical finite element models. Known material properties and structural dimensions allow well constrained models to be completed for uniaxial, triaxial, and hydrostatic compression of the pipe overpack waste package.

The model parameters developed in this report are used subsequently to evaluate the implications to performance assessment calculations...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Pipe</b> Overpack <b>Container</b> was {{designed}} to optimize shipments of high plutonium content transuranic waste from Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) to Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The container was approved {{for use in the}} TRUPACT-II shipping container by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 1997. The container optimizes shipments to WIPP by increasing the TRUPACT-II criticality limit from 325 fissile grams equivalent (FGE) to 2, 800 FGE and provides additional shielding for handling wastes with high americium- 241 (Am- 241) content. The container was subsequently evaluated and approved for storage of highly dispersible TRU wastes and residues at RFETS. Thermal evaluation of the container shows that the container will mitigate the impact of a worst case thermal event from reactive or potentially pyrophoric materials. These materials contain hazards postulated by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board for interim storage. Packaging these reactive or potentially pyrophoric residues in the container without stabilizing the materials is under consideration at RFETS. The design, testing, and evaluations used in the approvals, and the current status of the container usage, will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{has been}} one of the most serious safety {{problems}} in aviation, and the most costly maintenance problem. Contributing to the problematic nature of corrosion is the complexity of its mechanisms and the randomness with which it occurs. The reliability of a structure affected by corrosion is normally based on the forms of the erosion and its severity. Existing research in this area has a primary focus on corrosion induced structure failure due to inadequate residual structural strength. However, it is valuable to recognise that some product failures induced by corrosion are not critically dependent on stress or fatigue-examples include such cases as leakage from oil <b>pipe</b> or <b>containers,</b> leakage into air cabin and landing floats and, or degradation of a high smooth surface required structure. In such cases non-structural failure should be judged on some specific failure criterion involving the number of corrosion spots, as well as their surface area, depth and distribution. Based on data collected from inspection and maintenance records of the Chinese Yunshu- 7 passenger aircraft, this paper will propose some new concepts formulation of relevant failure criteria and will propose corrosion probabilistic models for reliability assessment...|$|R
40|$|Blast {{resistant}} structural {{designs are}} becoming essential {{because of the}} upsurge in terrorist attacks throughout the world in recent years. A lot of {{research has been done}} since 1940 s to develop design philosophies against blast forces. As a result, a number of methods have been introduced to estimate design parameters and procedures have been developed to carry out blast resistant designs. Conventional designs codes consider risks such as excessive wind, floods, water waves, earthquakes, crashing of vehicles or aircraft on to buildings, collapse of masses, explosions (gas <b>pipes,</b> gas <b>containers,</b> pressured water lines etc) and consequences of human error. However, designs for explosions using explosives (bombs) are not included in commonly used conventional design codes. Therefore, developing design guidelines which can be easily used for designing blast resistant structures is important. Using results of previous research works and numerical methods, design envelopes can be developed by means of which, the position of conventional structural elements in a blast loading environment can be identified. Design envelopes for cantilever slabs were developed using Kingery and Bulmash’s (1984) empirical method (for estimations of blast parameters) and the procedures described by Cormie D et al.

As part of the cleanup and closure of the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) located on the Hanford site, the nuclear material inventory was reviewed to determine the appropriate disposition path. Based on the nuclear material characteristics, the material was designated for stabilization and packaging for long term storage and transfer to the Savannah River Site or, a decision for discard was made. The discarded material was designated as waste material and slated for disposal to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Prior to preparing any residue wastes for disposal at the WIPP, several major activities need to be completed. As detailed a processing history as possible of the material including origin of the waste must be researched and documented. A technical basis for termination of safeguards on the material must be prepared and approved. Utilizing process knowledge and processing history, the material must be characterized, sampling requirements determined, acceptable knowledge package and waste designation completed prior to disposal. All of these activities involve several organizations including the contractor, DOE, state representatives and other regulators such as EPA.
