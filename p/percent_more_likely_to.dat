Most studies conducted thus far have been on convenience samples from hospital patients, high school or university students. These have yielded a wide range of results: between 0.1% and 1.4% of males, and between 0.3% and 9.4% of females.

According to Gelder, Mayou and Geddes (2005) bulimia nervosa is prevalent between 1 and 2 percent of women aged 15–40 years. Bulimia nervosa occurs more frequently in developed countries and in cities, with one study finding that bulimia is five times more prevalent in cities than in rural areas.

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{expectations}} placed on women {{by their own}} religions, society also holds certain biases against women of certain religions that causes them to have less success in the job market. [...] This is seen most often among Muslim women who express their religion by [...] wearing modest clothing and traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs. This was proven by {{a study by the}} Bristol school of Sociology that showed that Muslim women were 70 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be unsuccessful in looking for work than Christian and nonreligious women. [...] These numbers stem from discriminatory actions on various levels of society that often lead Muslim women to lose their jobs or have trouble finding jobs. For example, on the local level, a woman was fired from a Jiffy Lube for wearing her hijab to work because it apparently violated the company's [...] "no hat" [...] rule. The company suffered no repercussions for this action. [...] On the federal level, the court case Webb v Philadelphia ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, which is a requirement for women in her religion, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality and therefore could be terminated for her choice to wear it. This ruling makes this type of discrimination precedent for similar situations and makes it harder to traditional Muslim women to find and hold professional careers. There are laws against this type of discrimination, such as America's Title XII of their Civil Right's Act of 1964 which makes it illegal for businesses to discriminate against their employees [...] based on their sex, race, color, national origin, and religion, but even so this sort of religious and gender discrimination often intersect and lead to the feminization of poverty within certain communities.|$|E

METHODS: The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) is a nationally representative survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U. S. population, 2 months of age or over. Participants were asked about their use of vitamin and/or mineral supplements in the past month. Many also reported use of other dietary supplements. RESULTS: Approximately 40 {{percent of the population}} took dietary supplements during the month prior to the interview. Females (44 <b>percent)</b> were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take a supplement than males (35 percent). Non-Hispanic white persons (43 <b>percent)</b> were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take supplements than non-Hispanic black persons (30 percent) and Mexican American persons (29 percent). Children 1 - 5 years of age were major users of supplements. Among adults 20 years of age and older, there was a trend toward increasing use of dietary supplements with age. Higher levels of education, income, and self-reported health status were all positively related to supplement use. Sixty-seven percent of supplement users took only one supplement, with the majority of them taking a combination vitamin/mineral product (46 percent). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of the U. S. population takes vitamins, minerals, and/or other dietary supplements. "June 1999. "By R. Bethene Ervin, Jacqueline D. Wright, and Jocelyn Kennedy-Stephenson.

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that there is a two to {{threefold}} greater risk of having social phobia if a first-degree relative also has the disorder. This could be due to genetics and/or due to children acquiring social fears and avoidance through processes of observational learning or parental psychosocial education.

To some extent this 'heritability' may not be specific – for example, studies have found that if a parent has any kind of anxiety disorder or clinical depression, then a child is somewhat <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop an anxiety disorder or social phobia. Studies suggest that parents of those with social anxiety disorder tend to be more socially isolated themselves (Bruch and Heimberg, 1994; Caster et al., 1999), and shyness in adoptive parents is significantly correlated with shyness in adopted children (Daniels and Plomin, 1985).|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{develops}} a methodology for identifying complications following carotid endarterectomy, using physician claims data. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING. We selected a random 20 percent sample of Medicare patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in 1991 (n = 8, 345) and extracted {{all of their}} claims. STUDY DESIGN. Project neurologists identified the following services as indicative of complications following carotid endarterectomy if they were provided within 30 days of surgery: head CT, head MRI, and surgical exploration of the neck for hemorrhage, thrombosis, or infection. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. Total costs were calculated from all claims associated with the hospitalization and the 30 -day postoperative period. Outcomes included mortality (obtained from Medicare eligibility files), length of stay, discharge to an institution, and readmission to an acute care hospital (the latter obtained from claims data). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Surgical complications were identified in {{one out of every}} ten endarterectomy patients (10. 3 percent). Patients with complications were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> die within 30 days of surgery (8. 9 percent, compared with 1. 1 percent of those not experiencing complications). They also were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be discharged to an institutional setting (24. 9 percent versus 2. 9 <b>percent),</b> and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be readmitted to acute care hospitals (26. 8 percent versus 8. 2 percent). Patients with postoperative complications also were significantly more expensive: $ 22, 187 versus $ 10, 892. CONCLUSION. Our findings suggest that physician claims could be used by PROs or similar entities as a screening tool to identify potential problem hospitals or problem surgeons.

40|$|Abstract Employing a {{simultaneous}} model of part-time status, health insurance offers, and wages, {{we examine the}} impacts on employment and health insurance cov-erage of nondiscrimination rules {{in the tax code}} governing employer-sponsored health insurance. Using 1988 and 1993 Employee Benefits Supplements to the Current Pop-ulation Surveys and variations in health insurance premiums and minimum wages, we find that health insurance coverage among low-wage primary earners is increased by at most 31 percent by the policy, at a cost of an estimated 0. 8 – 5. 4 -percentage-point decrease in full-time employment for low-wage workers. Since the failure of the Clinton health care reform initiative, comprehen-sive health insurance coverage in the United States has fallen off the polit-ical map, to be replaced by piecemeal measures to extend or improve the generosity of coverage for various subgroups of the population. Despite these efforts and a booming economy in the 1990 s, a significant propor-tion of the population, 14 percent in 2000 (Mills 2001), remained with-out health insurance coverage for the entire year. Lack of insurance is a problem because the uninsured disproportionately go without needed medical care or delay care. In 2002, 28 percent of uninsured adults did not receive needed medical care, compared to only 6 percent of insured per-sons. The uninsured are also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than the insured to postpone care (41 percent compared <b>to</b> 20 <b>percent)</b> and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> skip filling a pre-scription (26 percent compared to 11 percent) (Kaiser Family Foundatio...|$|R
25|$|The Islamic worship {{practiced by}} one Muslim {{may differ from}} another's in minor details, which can affect the precise actions and words involved.

Muslims believe that Muhammad practiced, taught, and disseminated the worship ritual in the whole community of Muslims and made it part of their life. The practice has, therefore, been concurrently and perpetually practiced by the community {{in each of the}} generations. The authority for the basic forms of the Salah is neither the hadiths nor the Qur'an, but rather the consensus of Muslims.
