No just cause or {{impediment}} exists why we should insist on being ignorant of the orbits of the planets because we cannot ourselves make the calculations for determining them; no reason why we should insist on being ignorant of the classification of plants and animals because we don't feel able ourselves to embark on anatomical researches which would justify us in coming to original conclusions about them. I know the mass of scientific opinion has always gone the other way; but then scientific opinion means only the opinion of men of science, who are themselves specialists, and who think most of the education needed to make men specialists, not of the education needed to fit them for the general exigencies and emergencies of life.

Reading Gaol provides an insight into how educational methods and techniques were modified to suit a particular environment – the prison – and a particular student body – convicted criminals. When viewed in its educational and penal context, Reading Gaol also shows that although schemes for educating prisoners have often (and rightly) been associated with spiritual reformism, wider bases of support ensured the survival of at least elementary instruction for illiterate adult prisoners even when central authorities pressed for the adoption of hard labour, hard board and hard fare in local gaols...|$|E

The study tested a hypothesis of no relationship between exposure to entrepreneurship educational experience and managerial skill development among the respondents. The Pearson correlation analyses used in the test showed that there is a positive correlation between the variables, i. e., entrepreneurship education and managerial skill development (r = 0. 349; p < 0. 05). It also found that students who received instruction in entrepreneurship education showed a greater desire to set-up small-scale businesses after graduation (r = 0. 379; p < 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects a course of instruction about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might have on symptoms, psychological well-being, and medical care requirements in these patients. Methods: Twenty-nine women with IBS participated in a <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> on medical care, physical activity, stress-management, diet and health insurance. The women completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the Psychological General Well-Being Index and provided information about their requirements of medical care before and after the course. Results: Twenty-three of the women included, completed the questionnaires at 12 months after the course. When comparing these values to those at baseline, there were improvements in abdominal pain (p < 0. 037) and vitality (p < 0. 045) as well as a reduction in the number of visits to physicians (p < 0. 037) and dieticians (p < 0. 042). Conclusion: Information related to the disease, might help women with IBS to perceive less pain and more vitality and thereby experience a higher quality of life. Practice implications: A course of instruction for patients with IBS maybe of benefit for the patients, and could be apart of a multicomponent approach in the treatment of this patient group.

40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop an {{approach}} to systematically guide researchers in Economics toward conceiving original research contributions in their discipline. To achieve this aim, I developed a theoretical framework that explains how researchers in the field can discover new theoretical and policy ideas. I tested the plausibility of this theoretical framework by applying it to research that is generally regarded by economists as original; and derived, from the theoretical framework, a <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> that may be incorporated into a formal (post) graduate programme in Economics or delivered as a short course aimed at developing novice researchers in Economics. The pilot version of this short course was presented in Colombia in June and July 2015 and was found, even by experienced researchers, to be effective at promoting research creativity. This study identified the following as conceptions of an original contribution: (1) an original idea that answers an unanswered question or solves an unsolved problem; (2) the useful reformulation of an existing problem or the identification of a new problem that is significant to the discipline; (3) a new question that opens up new possibilities for research or shows that an old question is problematic; and (4) the identification of a previously unknown, but significant and questionable assumption in the shared mental model of the discipline. I developed techniques to make arriving at each {{of these types of}} conceptions a systematic process that can be followed by economists, or researchers in any of the social sciences. The ability to conceive of original contributions is often underestimated because such conceptions are usually captured in only a sentence or two [...] . Ph. D. (Economics...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] literacy interventions (i. e. <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> for low-progress readers and writers that are supplementary to the literacy programmes used in mainstream classrooms) implemented in most Western Cape schools reflect the use of isolated item-based literacy teaching methods. The low literacy levels in the Western Cape primary grades, however, do not indicate successful literacy learning. This article describes an individualised literacy intervention for emergent literacy learners that explored alternative, research-based methods <b>of</b> <b>instruction.</b> The intervention took shape as a comparison between low-progress learners {{who participated in the}} literacy intervention and average-progress learners who did not participate in this intervention. The aim was to accelerate the low-progress learners’ literacy learning so that they could reach the average-band performance of their classmates after 12 weeks in the intervention. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered by means of observations of learners and assessment results obtained in a pre-test-post-test design, {{with the addition of a}} mid-test to observe learners’ literacy progress. Based on qualitative data, the intervention proved to be successful, because observations indicated positive change in the low-progress learners’ reading and writing behaviours. Given the small sample size, the overall trend in the quantitative data supported the value of the intervention and indicated a need for extending the research beyond a pilot study. Further research using larger sample sizes is thus recommended. Publisher's versio...|$|R

Objective The small scale study was undertaken to investigate the impact of subjective well being (SWB; using the Positive Affect (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) Scale; PANAS) on adherence to a <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> metacognitive training and on prediction accuracy. Procedure Participants were asked to predict the submission date and grade for their next assignment and baseline measures of metacognitive awareness (using the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory; MAI) and SWB were taken. Participants were assigned to a 6 -week metacognitive training programme which comprised completing a critical reflection, a reading and a questionnaire-type activity each week. Results Critical reflections were content analysed; baseline and post-study scores were compared, and predicted submission times and grades were compared with actuals. MAI scores increased significantly and were positively correlated with high PA and low NA. There was no significant relationship between prediction accuracy for submission time or grade with change in MAI scores. However, positive relationships were found between prediction accuracy for both submission time and grade with SWB. In addition, those with higher baseline SWB adhered to the training programme longer than those with lower baseline SWB. Conclusions SWB is a useful predictor of adherence to a <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> metacognitive training and on prediction accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|It is the author's {{contention}} {{that one of}} the functions of a state education system within a democracy is to educate its citizens so that they can fully participate in society. Fulfilling that function as a school physical educator requires one to be concerned with movement outcomes based on a good citizen model. A good citizen model of physical education translates to a physically well-educated populace that has benefits for citizens at individual, community and national levels. For the individual there are health benefits of a physical, emotional and spiritual kind. At a community level, there are the social capital benefits associated with the interaction and fellowship that transpire when people meet to play sports, recreate or take part in leisure. Such interaction encourages socialisation and can even give communities a focus and direction. Nationally, a fit and active populace promotes greater participation in society, involvement with issues and less demand on health services. This study evaluated, using instruction in tennis in a physical education context, whether a personalised mastery learning <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> that incorporated individualised goal setting, accelerated motor-skill learning towards achieving mastery or competency in movement at a rate faster and, therefore, more effectively than traditional motor-skill learning instruction. If it did, then a recommendation from this study would be that in order for teachers to fulfil their function within a 'good citizen' model of instruction in physical education that they adopt, where applicable, mastery learning strategies to ensure that as many students as possible achieve mastery of fundamental movements. It found that those learning conditions produced a positive learning environment and notable final student competency levels that appeared counter intuitive to the plateau effect frequently associated with motor-skill instruction and learning...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{foundation}} of a national system of primary education in 1831, curricular reforms – in the guise of the Revised <b>Programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>Instruction</b> (1900), Curaclam na Bunscoile (1971), and the Primary School Curriculum (1999) – have succeeded in both broadening the definition and increasing the status of the arts in schools. However while these curricula each presented the arts disciplines as an integral component of primary education, the dearth of sustained professional development to support teachers in their implementation meant that the commendable aspirations of these reforms were never fully realised. The importance of the arts within education has, however, been reaffirmed with the recent publication of the Arts-in-Education Charter (2013). This Charter – presented as a “formative step” towards situating the arts “at the core of our education system” – proposes to “incentivise and recognise” those schools which make the arts a key part of school life with the introduction of an Arts-Rich Schools scheme. In this publication the DES has promoted the concept of an arts-rich school without defining clearly what such a school would look like, or what teaching and learning would look like in such a school. It is a document that focuses predominantly on arts-in-education experiences, and is deficient in both actionable guidelines for teachers and commitments to their professional development. Teachers, however, {{play a central role in}} realising successful changes in education. Inspired by this proposed scheme the aim of this research was to explore, collaboratively with a community of teachers, the potential for arts-rich education in the primary classroom. How might teachers be empowered to develop an arts-rich classroom? What are the characteristics of such a learning environment? To address these questions a qualitative study, utilising collaborative action-research, was designed. A small Professional Learning Community (PLC), comprised of five primary teachers, was formed. Data collected between September 2015 and June 2016 included audio-recordings of PLC meetings, teachers’ reflective journals, photographs, classroom observations, individual interviews, and messages sent via WhatsApp. Analysis of the data indicates that: developing an arts-rich classroom is an ongoing process that must be sustained over time and supported by ongoing professional learning and support; arts-rich education comprises not alone high-quality teaching in the arts but meaningful teaching through the arts; and that teaching through the arts has the potential to democratise the learning process by diminishing barriers to academic content posed by language or text-heavy media. This study further indicates that there is considerable potential in the development of PLCs as a vehicle for teachers’ professional development in the arts...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the legal knowledge held by teachers of New South Wales Government schools and the need for continued professional development in this area. The study commenced in 1997 and primary research concluded in 2000. The Australian experience seems to be mirroring international experiences, particularly those of the United States of America, which have seen an increase in the legalisation of the field of education. From this increase there emerged a need for a systematic <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> {{to address the problem of}} a lack of legal knowledge held by teachers in order to adequately perform their professional duties as teachers and protect themselves and their employer from potential legal liabilities. The main purposes of this study were to determine the degree of legal knowledge that teachers in the State of New South Wales possessed, the need for the development of a course of instruction to address the perceived problem of a lack of legal knowledge and to investigate the methods available to address this problem. The study then proceeded to develop and trial a systematic curriculum designed to provide a background for teachers to education and the law. This was a multimethod ethnographic exploratory study that integrated aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. An initial focus group interview schedule was developed and then trialled with a group of teachers in order to gauge their experiences and knowledge of the law. This interview schedule was then refined and trialled with a larger sample of teachers drawn from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. From those focus groups there emerged clear evidence that the majority of teachers lacked knowledge of the law as it affected the performance of their professional teaching duties. What legal knowledge teachers did possess was often based on myth or misunderstanding. Therefore there emerged a need to canvas the views of the dominate stakeholders in the field of education to gain their interest/views on developing a course of legal instruction devised to address this problem. Additionally the question of which elements of the law would be necessary in such a course was also addressed. To this end the views of the teachers, their union and their government employer were all engaged. It became clear that there was general support, particularly high amongst the teachers, for the need for such a course of instruction. This study then moved on to develop a course of instruction which could be used at either the pre or post service levels of teacher professional development. The study examined a number of potential models of curriculum and the conclusion was reached that no single model of curriculum could be used to devise a successful and progressive course. Instead the curriculum devised was based upon a hybrid model using elements from the process and dynamic models of curriculum. This curriculum was then trialled with a sample of teachers. At the end of the trial, course participants were asked to complete a brief survey and their comments were reported to show that the majority believed they had engaged in a positively rewarding experience, which made them more aware of how the law was a pervasive influence on their teaching. Overall the findings indicate that there is a definite need for pre service and practising teachers to have a degree of legal knowledge which is provided in a professional manner. There is broad support for such a course of instruction amongst the teaching profession and its dominant union body. Unfortunately there was not the same degree of enthusiasm shown by the government employer. The study concludes with a statement that there needs to be a unilateral effort between the teachers, their union and their employer towards a common goal of instructing teachers about the law if such a course of instruction is to gain credibility and acceptance amongst the members of the teaching profession...|$|E

40|$|Second {{language}} (L 2) decoding – the sub-lexical {{process of}} mapping the graphemes of an alphabetic writing system onto the phonemes they represent – is argued to underpin {{various aspects of}} L 2 learning, particularly vocabulary acquisition. Recently, second language acquisition research has shown increased interest in decoding, consistently finding evidence for L 1 -to-L 2 transfer effects on learners’ processing mechanisms and outcomes. Correspondingly, studies conducted in Modern Foreign Language (MFL) classrooms in English secondary schools – an under-researched context – have found that beginner learners of French tend to (a) pronounce L 2 words according to English decoding conventions and (b) make poor progress in this aspect of L 2 learning. Recent official guidance for MFL teachers has addressed this problem by advocating an explicit focus on decoding, {{but there is a}} lack of convincing evidence (both in the MFL context and more widely) that explicit L 2 decoding instruction can be effective. The current study therefore trialled two <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> French decoding <b>instruction</b> for beginner MFL learners, delivered in ten- to fifteen-minute segments over around thirty lessons. Three intact secondary school classes followed a phonics-based approach; three classes from another school followed a programme in which learners were encouraged to derive the pronunciations of French graphemes from ‘source words’ in a memorized poem; and six classes in two other schools received no explicit decoding instruction. Participants (N= 186) completed pre- and post-tests of French decoding; a sub-sample (N= 15) also completed task-based self-report interviews. The two intervention groups made significantly more progress than the comparison group in terms of the number of graphemes pronounced ‘acceptably’, although the magnitude of the difference between the groups was small. Compared to the comparison group, the two intervention groups also appeared to show different and more extensive patterns of change in their realizations of individual graphemes, even where their pronunciations were still not ‘acceptable’. Finally, self-report data generally revealed little change in participants’ strategic reasoning, either in the intervention or comparison group. Together, these findings suggest that explicit instruction can improve beginner learners’ proficiency in decoding L 2 French, but that their progress may follow a longer and more complex trajectory than simply moving directly from ‘incorrect’ to ‘correct’ forms. Further research is required to assess the effects (if any) of a given improvement in decoding proficiency on other language-learning outcomes; and to design and evaluate alternative <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The English {{language}} holds {{a powerful}} role world-wide {{and is now}} used in some domains in Sweden. This has caused concern {{for the future of}} the Swedish language and whether or nor diglossia is underway. The aim of this dissertation is to investigate if there are differences in the attitudes towards the increasing use of English in Swedish society between two different populations of upper-secondary school students: a) students who attend the International Baccalaureate <b>Programme</b> (whose medium <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> is English), and b) students who attend the Social Science <b>Programme</b> (whose medium <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> is Swedish). The study investigates students’ pattern and language use and attitudes through the use of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and reflective journals. The results show that the IB pupils are somewhat less positively disposed towards the increased influence of the English language in Swedish society and argue that it might pose a threat to the status of the Swedish language. However, the investigation also discloses that most IB pupils, to a much larger extent than the SP pupils, consider English paramount in order to succeed in today’s society. Furthermore, the results indicate that the IB pupils’ attitudes towards the expansion of the English language in Swedish society largely correspond to the main objective of Mål i mun, i. e. to protect the Swedish language as well as promote the English language.

Various studies have confirmed the potential of SCLI as a means of familiarising language learners with academic genres and the language skills expected of them in the content classroom. To date, however, there has been little or no research into the use of CMC within SCLI. We found that students who followed a <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> SCLI using CMC ESP tasks made significant improvements in their oral communication skills, and also achieved higher scores than their peers in a computer science project undertaken in the semester following the treatment...|$|R

Literacy in the Early Years courses are often grounded in constructivist theory {{and designed to}} help pre-service teachers provide balanced literacy instruction for elementary grades. Even though many of these educational institutions are beginning to introduce new courses and programs that focus on problem-based learning, discovery learning, experiential learning, cooperative learning, service learning and inquiry-based learning (Justice, Rice, Roy, Hudspith, 2 ̆ 6 Jenkins, 2009), there is little attention paid to emergent practice (Stacey, 2009) in early literacy pre-service education programs. The goal for this workshop is to “practice what we preach” by introducing concepts of play-based, emergent curriculum that model flexible, inquiry-based approaches to curriculum content. In Early Literacy courses, one module can be left to explore ideas, questions, interests, and theoretical concepts that the students identified...|$|R
