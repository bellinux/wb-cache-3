5000|$|Overprints {{have been}} used as {{security}} measures to deter misuse and theft. In the nineteenth century, Mexico was plagued by thefts of stamps on their way to remote post offices. To address this, stamps were shipped from Mexico City to the local districts where they were overprinted with the district name - they were not valid for <b>postage</b> <b>without</b> the overprint. The United States used a similar strategy to deal with thefts in Kansas and Nebraska in 1929, overprinting the current definitive issue with [...] "Kans." [...] and [...] "Nebr." [...] before they were shipped from Washington, to {{make it more difficult to}} sell stolen stamps outside the indicated state.|$|E
25|$|One {{specialty}} use {{of carbon}} tetrachloride is in stamp collecting, to reveal watermarks on <b>postage</b> stamps <b>without</b> damaging them. A {{small amount of}} the liquid {{was placed on the}} back of a stamp, sitting in a black glass or obsidian tray. The letters or design of the watermark could then be clearly seen.|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, CTV London {{reported}} {{that some of}} Minister Duguid's Christmas cards were sent <b>without</b> <b>postage,</b> instead using franking stickers only available to the monarch, federal MPs, senators and certain parliamentary employees. A staffer later resigned over the controversy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{unofficial}} {{nature of}} poster stamps {{has led to}} debate about exactly {{what is and is}} not a poster stamp. One definition has been [...] "labels <b>without</b> <b>postage</b> stamp values, not good for postal service; advertising labels or charity labels." ...|$|R
5000|$|Soon thereafter, Fisk was {{appointed}} as Postmaster of San Francisco. It {{was in this}} position he suffered his first public controversy. In {{the wake of the}} 1906 earthquake, Fisk had allowed mail to be sent <b>without</b> <b>postage,</b> which was technically illegal, and was estimated to cost the federal government $60,000. Fisk said he [...] "forwarded hundreds of thousands of letters <b>without</b> <b>postage</b> throughout the United States. These letters were written on old cuffs, pieces of cardboard, anything. They went into the mail bags and I was liable to criminal prosecution...Thousands were homeless, without food and without means of communicating with relatives. I established kitchens {{in the basement of the}} post office and fed hundreds of starving people." [...] Five years later, an act of Congress exonerated Fisk. When Democrats gained the White House in 1912, President Wilson asked for Fisk's resignation as Postmaster.|$|R
500|$|The Act of March3, 1845 {{authorized}} the first United States postage stamps {{and set the}} rate for local prepaid letters at five cents. [...] In the years following, this rate was seen as too high and an impediment to commerce. [...] Accordingly, Congress on March3, 1851 authorized both a three-cent stamp and a three-cent silver coin. [...] Kentucky Representative Richard Henry Stanton believed that {{the need to make}} change from a silver half dime with large copper cents might defeat the new scheme, writing to Mint Director Robert M.Patterson that [...] "reduced postage [...] depended on a three-cent coin for use in those states where copper does not circulate." [...] According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, [...] "the main purpose of the new 3¢piece would be to buy <b>postage</b> stamps <b>without</b> using the unpopular, heavy, and often filthy copper cents.|$|R
50|$|The {{focus of}} Burt Todd on the {{international}} market left the P&T Department with too few lower-value stamps for the local mail. On advice of the Indian postal advisor to Bhutan, Dr. K. Ramamurti, P&T issued a series of surcharged stamps released in 1965, which were overprinted at the India Security Press in Nashik. The same printer was used by P&T next year 1966 for the first regular, low value, non-agency definitives with the local theme of Bhutanese dzongs. Another complaint by P&T was that often the Bhutan Stamp Agency designed and printed <b>postage</b> stamps <b>without</b> any or enough discussion or approval. After the death in 1972 of the 3rd Druk Gyalpo, His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, {{a good friend of}} Todd, one of the changes which took place was the cancellation of the contract of the Bhutan Stamp Agency end March 1974.|$|R

40|$|This report {{discusses}} controversy {{regarding the}} franking privilege, which allows Members of Congress to transmit mail matter under their signature <b>without</b> <b>postage.</b> During the 18 th and 19 th centuries, the franking privilege served a fundamental democratic role, allowing Members of Congress to convey information to their constituents about {{the operations of}} government and policy matters before Congress. Conversely, it also provided a mechanism for citizens to communicate their feelings and concerns to Members (prior to 1873, Members could both send and receive mail under the frank) ...|$|R
5000|$|In a May 1980 ruling, Conner {{decided that}} {{community}} organizations that placed fliers in personal mailboxes {{did not violate}} the law, holding that the organizations' First Amendment rights trumped a 1934 statute imposing a $300 fine for placing mailable material into a mailbox <b>without</b> <b>postage.</b> The organizations that challenged the ban claimed that the cost and delays of using the mail [...] "barred them from effective communication", while the United States Postal Service contended that mailbox security would be lost and that mail carriers would have to waste time checking what's in mailboxes.|$|R
50|$|Part of the Journal's {{attraction}} was its low price. Thank to its printing methods, {{it could}} be sold for only 5 centimes, as opposed to 15 centimes for the typical daily. It came in a convenient format of 43×30 cm (17×12 ins.), did not require a subscription and, {{in addition to the}} news, offered feature stories, serials (including the popular detective stories of Émile Gaboriau), horoscopes and opinion pieces. It was officially (if not actually) apolitical and could be sent <b>without</b> <b>postage.</b> Also, it was distributed in the evening, so {{it could be}} hawked to workers leaving their shops and factories.|$|R
5|$|The great {{influx of}} bullion from the California Gold Rush and other finds caused {{the price of}} silver {{relative}} to gold to increase starting in 1848, and silver coins were hoarded or exported for melting. In 1851, a bill for a three-cent piece in 75% silver and 25% copper was introduced in Congress by New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson, who wanted to lower postage rates from five to three cents. This percentage of silver was less than the normal 90% so that the coins would circulate {{at a time of}} hoarding. The copper large cent did not circulate in the Pacific Coast region or South due to prejudice against coins that did not contain precious metal, and some means of allowing the purchase of a <b>postage</b> stamp <b>without</b> the use of copper cents was necessary. Dickinson's bill passed on March 3, 1851, and in addition to authorizing the new three-cent silver, lowered rates for most domestic mails. By 1854, the imbalance had abated, and Congress increased the silver content of the three-cent piece to the standard 90% for silver coins, though its weight was reduced.|$|R
50|$|LIDAR {{and other}} Phased Array Imaging: Arrays of PICs can take {{advantage}} of phase delays in the light reflected from objects with three-dimensional shapes to reconstruct 3D images, and Light Imaging, Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) with laser light can offer a complement to radar by providing precision imaging (with 3D information) at close distances. This new form of machine vision is having an immediate application in driverless cars to reduce collisions, and in biomedical imaging. Phased arrays can also be used for free-space communications and novel display technologies. Current versions of LIDAR predominantly rely on moving parts, making them large, slow, low resolution, costly, and prone to mechanical vibration and premature failure. Integrated photonics can realize LIDAR within a footprint the size of a <b>postage</b> stamp, scan <b>without</b> moving parts, and be produced in high volume at low cost.|$|R
5000|$|Reply cards, with or <b>without</b> <b>postage,</b> may be {{included}} with an invitation {{according to some}} etiquette writers, though they need not be. However, Judith Martin calls response cards [...] "vulgar", as they imply the guest would not reply without being prompted to do so. She advocates discarding them and replying on one's own stationery, while Peggy Post suggests that guests use them if included, to avoid interfering with the host's card collection system. Some say maps, directions, websites, and other information may {{be included}}. Others note {{that these are not}} formal aspects of an invitation, and therefore should not be included in formal invitations, and those who accept should instead later be sent the information via informal communication, such as postal mail, phone, or the internet. At-home cards may be included with wedding invitations. Traditionally, they announced the bride and groom's new address; they are now more likely to be used to announce the couple's choice of surnames.|$|R
