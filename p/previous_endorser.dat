A second objective was to examine what causes guilt to occur in these questionable situations (study 2 a/b). Two distinct conceptualizations of the guilt emotion are investigated, i. e. the intrapsychic and interpersonal perspective. Results support both notions of the guilt emotion separately in the context of consumer ethics. When investigating the consequent ethical intentions, it was found to be sufficient for consumers’ behavioral decisions to alter if one of the two perspectives is made salient, that is, when guilt is aroused. Implications are discussed for both consumer ethics literature and consumer behavior research in general. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The role of apolipoprotein E (Apo E) gene polymor-phisms in the {{etiology}} of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is not clearly understood. We evaluated this polymorphism in unex-plained pregnancy losses {{in a group of}} Turkish women. In our prospective case-control study, 45 well-characterized RPL cases were examined for their Apo E genotypes, based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -amplified fragments. The observed genotypes were compared with those obtained from equal number matched controls. We observed similar Apo E genotypes and E 2, E 3 and E 4 allele frequency distribution among RPL patients and controls. The allele frequencies obtained in patients and controls, respec-tively, were as follows: E 2 = 8 (9 %) and 12 (13. 4 %) (P= 0. 342), E 3 = 66 (73. 3 %) and 60 (66. 6 %) (P= 0. 328) and E 4 = 16 (17. 7 %) and 18 (20 %) (P= 0. 703).

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the cognitive and}} emotional sequelae following mild head injury (MHI; e. g., concussion) in high-functioning individuals and whether persons with MHI pre~ent, both physiologically and via self-report, in a manner different from (i. e., underaroused) that of persons who have no history of head injury. We also investigated the effect arousal state ~as on the cognitive performance of this population. Using a quasiexperimental research design (N = 91), we examined changes in attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility (subtests ofthe WAIS-III, 1997,WMS-III, 1997, & DKEFS, 2002) {{as a function of}} manipulated arousal (i. e., induced psychosocial stress/activation; reduced activation/relaxation). In addition to self-reported arousal and state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Speilberger, 1983 a) measures, physiological indices of arousal state (i. e., electrodermal responsivity, heart rate, and respiration activity) were recorded (via Polygraph Professional Suite, 2008) across a 2. 5 hour interval while completing various cognitive tasks. Students also completed the Post-concussive Symptom Checklist (Gouvier et aI., 1992). The results demonstrate that university students who report a history ofMHI (i. e., "altered state of consciousness") experience significantly lower levels of anxiety, were physiologically underaroused, and were less responsive to stressors in their environment, compared to their non-~HI cohorts. As expected, cognitive flexibility (but not other neuropsychological measures of cognition) was advantaged with increased stress, and disadvantaged with reduced stress, in persons with reported MHI, but not for those without reported MHI which provided limited support for our hypothesis. Further, university students who had no complaints related to their <b>previous</b> MHI <b>endorsed</b> a greater number of traditional post-concussive symptoms in terms of intensity, duration and frequency as compared to students who did not report a MHI. The underarousal in traumatic brain injury has been associated with (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) VMPFC disruption and may be implicated in MHI generally. Students who report sustaining a previous MHI may be less able to physiologically respond and/or cognitively appraise, stressful experiences as compared to their no-MHI cohort and experience persistent, long-lasting consequences despite the subtle nature of a history of head injury...|$|R
40|$|As {{service user}} {{involvement}} {{in health and}} social care research has become more firmly embedded in health policies, both in the UK and internationally, there is increasing interest in evaluating its potential benefits and outcomes. Impact studies have highlighted a range {{of different types of}} service user involvement, using diverse research methods, within various research topics and involving different stakeholders. Potential benefits to research, researchers and the service users actively involved in research have been identified, along with the possibility of some negative consequences. Many impact studies have been criticized for being based on informal retrospective accounts of researchers and service users working together. Few have been underpinned by conceptual models, and there is a paucity of detailed accounts of the process of involvement that would enable replication. This paper reports an account of a prospective, qualitative exploration of service user involvement within a study, where the aims of the evaluation were agreed beforehand. Reflective discussions about the process and progress of service user involvement at different stages of the study were recorded, transcribed and analysed. The qualitative analysis identified perceived benefits to research, researchers and service user researchers that <b>endorsed</b> <b>previous</b> findings.

This study involved a sample of 56, 9 to 10 year old students with low socio-economic backgrounds. An 8 week improvisational drama programme (16 one-hour sessions) was administered to half the students, while the others served as a control. The design of this study was quasi experimental and followed a pre-test/training/post-test format. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of this programme by both quantitative and qualitative methods. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess whether improvisational dramatic strategies would affect three skill areas of oral comprehension (translation, interpretation, and extrapolation) and also, children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes both toward themselves and others. Analysis of the data showed significant improvements in the treatment group 2 ̆ 7 s skills of translation, interpretation and extrapolation. In addition, significant improvements were found in the treatment group 2 ̆ 7 s attitude towards others. The treatment group 2 ̆ 7 s classroom teacher also rated students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and school performance more highly {{at the conclusion of the}} programme. The findings of this study suggest that the integration of specific drama strategies into the educative process offers the following benefits: - enhancement of children 2 ̆ 7 s internal motivation, - active participation in learning, which has a positive effect on the development of cognition, - a specific targetting for the development of higher order cognitive skills, and, -the emphasis on interaction and creativity fosters positive self-concepts. It can, therefore, be concluded that a programme of improvisational dramatics has the potential to improve the oral comprehension skills and attitudes of children with low socio-economic backgrounds. Drama is one avenue that allows teachers to tap into potential that cannot be brought to fruition by the conventional methods of mainstream education...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MComm (Industrial Psychology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{present study}} evaluates the {{influence}} on the four factors of an innovative work group climate, namely participative safety, vision, support for innovation and task orientation, of a team development intervention based on improvisational theatre exercises. In the literature study, these four factors are compared {{with the principles of}} improvisational theatre, namely trust and support, agreement, listening and awareness, and narrative skills. A quasiexperimental study was conducted. Differences in pre-test and post-test scores of an experimental group (ne= 15), who took part in a half-day improvisation theatre team development intervention, are compared with the differences in pre- and post-test scores of a control group (nc= 13). The sample consisted of two teams from a health care management unit, which formed part of the health care department of a large insurance company in South Africa. The results show that, for innovative work group climate as a whole, the experimental group’s scores improved significantly (p<. 01) in comparison to the control group’s scores. The experimental group’s scores for the three factors, vision, participative safety and task orientation, also improved significantly in comparison to the control group’s scores (p<. 05 for all three factors). However, the experimental group’s score for support for innovation did not improve significantly. It is therefore concluded that the intervention had a positive influence on climate for work group innovation, based on its impact on the three factors, vision, participative safety and task orientation. In conclusion, this study builds on <b>previous</b> research that <b>endorses</b> the application of improvisational theatre techniques in organisational development settings...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Despite the sizable {{amount of}} {{previous}} research on this topic, {{little is known about}} the reasons why firms decide to start collaboration projects with innovation advanced service providers, such as universities and technological institutes. This paper aims to investigate which factors at an individual firm level are involved in these collaborative strategies on supporting product and management improvements offered by local institutions to innovative firms. Design/methodology/approach – The research is contextualized in the Valencian region and applies the resource based view and the regional innovation system approach as theoretical frameworks. Methodologically, the paper adopts a cross-sectional analysis and employs ordered regression models on a sample of innovative firms during 2009. Findings – Firstly, this paper <b>endorses</b> <b>previous</b> research suggesting the crucial role of cooperation and external knowledge on SME innovation. Secondly, it evidences how internal resources and capabilities determine a firm's use of public supported innovation. Thirdly, previous experience appears to be extremely relevant in explaining successful engagement in both technological and managerial innovation programs. Research limitations/implications – Because the case study approach and qualitative methodologies are used, the authors advise readers not to generalize their findings. The research on the subject matter is offered as a means to substantiate or refute the latest research premises, and provide empirical evidence on the selected region. Originality/value – Although this paper corroborates recent contributions, it does provide some novel findings. High-level managerial capabilities seem to discourage the use of public programs supporting innovation practices (either in technological or managerial aspects), while engagement in university programs relies heavily on the firm's technological capabilities or exposure to global competition, and less on other characteristics. Policy makers should pay particular attention to both pieces of evidence when designing programs. This paper has benefited from the excellent comments of two anonymous referees.

40|$|For decades, the {{immigration}} adjudication {{system has been}} under relentless attack from {{both the left and}} the right. The left has been concerned with the fairness of the proceedings, the accuracy and consistency of the outcomes, and the acceptability of both the procedures and the outcomes to the parties and to the public. The right has focused on the fiscal costs and elapsed times of these proceedings. This Article demonstrates that all of these criticisms have been well founded and that the roots of the problems are severe underfunding, reckless procedural shortcuts, the politicization of the process, and a handful of adjudicators personally ill suited to the task. Over the years, commentators and commissions have offered thoughtful solutions, but consensus has proven elusive. This Article calls for redesigning the entire system. For the trial phase, this Article <b>endorses</b> <b>previous</b> proposals for converting the current immigration judges into administrative law judges, who enjoy greater job security, and moving them from the Department of Justice into a new, independent executive branch tribunal. For the appellate phase, this Article proposes radical surgery, replacing both administrative appeals and regional court of appeals review with a single round of appellate review by a new, Article III immigration court. The new court would be staffed by experienced Article III district and circuit judges serving two-year assignments. This new system would significantly depoliticize the hiring, judging, supervision, and control of immigration adjudicators. It would consolidate the two current, largely duplicative rounds of appellate review into one, in the process restoring the Article III jurisdiction that Congress stripped away in 1996. It would save tax dollars and speed the removal process, thus reducing not only prolonged detention, but also what some believe is a meaningful incentive to file frivolous appeals to delay removal. It would preserve both specialized expertise and a generalist perspective. And it is politically realistic, permitting all sides to meet the specific objectives they hold most dear while requiring each side to make only modest concessions...|$|R

The main {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse and understand their experiences, to evaluate the extent to which their experiences <b>endorse</b> <b>previous</b> research in the area, and to identify aspects of their experiences that may be universal to immigrant teachers in general or specific to Japanese immigrant teachers in the New Zealand context. This study therefore adopts a qualitative research approach. Findings emerge mainly from the analysis of interviews with twenty-five Japanese native speaker teachers and are supplemented by fifty-two written survey responses. Major themes include ways that the teachers’ backgrounds influenced their career development decision-making process; differences that teachers expected and found in teaching in New Zealand; difficulties that teachers encountered in New Zealand schools; adjustments that teachers made to fit into teaching in New Zealand; adaptation strategies that they adopted to work effectively in the New Zealand cultural environment; and the teachers’ perceptions of working well as Japanese language teachers in New Zealand. The main findings reveal that the teachers confronted difficulties and challenges similar to those of all beginning teachers, but in their case, specific values they held enabled them to develop useful teaching strategies peculiar to them and make successful adaptations to the New Zealand teaching environment. This successful outcome was influenced by their additional learning experience of having gone through the complexity in teacher development as immigrants. Previous research demonstrated that teachers’ experiences and their values influenced curriculum making, the teaching process and classroom organisation. My research extended these findings by describing more specifically the values and strategies that my participant teachers adopted to teach New Zealand students. In addition to the suggestions made for other teachers, several recommendations are made for future research. This study concluded that immigrant teachers need to continue their learning, utilise skills previously acquired in their own countries, and participate in the new society to make successful adaptation...|$|R

Repeated immobilisation protocols (6 days, 1 h/day and 13 days, 2 h/day) were used to diminish the influence of acute immobilisation stress on c-Fos expression and analgesia (tail-flick test) induced by electroacupuncture on the 36 S point (EA 36 S). Animals submitted to immobilisation alone (IMMO) or to electroacupuncture (100 Hz, 2 - 4 V, faradic wave) on a non-point region (EANP) were compared with animals submitted to electroacupuncture on the 36 S point. in animals not previously submitted to repeated immobilisation, electroacupuncture on the 36 S point induced analgesia and c-Fos expression in the PAG was not different from that induced by electroacupuncture at a non-acupuncture point. in animals submitted to repeated immobilisation (repeated immobilisation for 6 days or repeated immobilisation for 13 days), however, electroacupuncture on point 36 S led to higher levels of analgesia and c-Fos expression, specifically in the ventrolateral PAG (v 1 PAG), as compared with animal groups subjected only to immobilisation or to electroacupuncture on a non-point.

Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.A bill of exchange is essentially an order made by {{one person to another}} to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.A bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The [...] "holder in due course" [...] may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the <b>previous</b> payee or <b>endorser</b> from doing so.

Carbohydrate Research, 83, 263 - 272. Sugars undergo caramelisation reactions at relatively high temperatures but when amino compounds are present, Maillard browning reactions are possible and these occur under less severe conditions. The reaction {{conditions and the}} basic character of the amino compounds determine the range of flavour compounds formed. The first step during Maillard browning is the condensation of a reducing sugar with an amine to form a glycosylamine and this compound may then undergo the Amadori rearrangement to form a 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketose. The pyrolysis of two 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses (1 -deoxy- 1 -glycino-D-fructose and 1 -β-alanino- 1 -deoxy-D-fructose) was studied in this investigation to examine their participation in a low energy route to aroma formation. Thermal analysis and parallel chemical investigations showed that the formation of these Amadori compounds facilitates the thermal degradation of their sugar and amino acid moieties. In addition increased quantities of various aroma compounds are produced, compared with the controls. In particular, the toxic compound protoanemonin is formed and a degradation pathway leading to its production is proposed. Most of the work involving the elucidation of degradation pathways during Maillard browning have involved studies in aqueous systems. Browning reactions between glucose and amino acids were also observed during heating in the dry-state in this study. These reactions are very vigorous once initiated and this precluded the study of a glucose plus amino acid control by the techniques used to study the pyrolysis of the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses. Such reactions occur at temperatures below those required for the thermal degradation of the corresponding Amadori rearrangement compound thus questioning the involvement of these compounds in the lowest energy thermolysis pathway in the absence of moisture. The results of experiments designed to investigate the role of Amadori compounds during the browning of sugar-amino acid systems in the dry-state demonstrated however that the reactions reported to occur in aqueous systems can also account for the dry-state processes at temperatures up until the spontaneous decomposition of the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketose can occur. That the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketose does not brown by itself or in the presence of glucose as readily as a glucose plus amino acid system is presumably a basicity effect. The stronger base (the amino acid) may promote a solid-state enolisation of the glucose and hence initiate browning at a somewhat lower temperature. The results of these experiments also demonstrate the stability of the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses and show that their formation is not a rate-limiting step during browning. In the third section of this thesis the effect of changing the amine moiety on the degradation pattern of 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses is assessed. Previous research has indicated that glucose by itself and Amadori compounds formed from weak primary bases degrade via an initial 1, 2 enolisation step to form mainly 2 -furaldehydes and pyrrole derivatives while 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses containing a strong basic moiety (usually formed from a secondary base) degrade via a 2, 3 enol intermediate and give rise to fragrant caramel aroma compounds. Several 1 -amino- 1 -deoxy-ketoses were prepared using primary and secondary bases covering a range of pkb values. These compounds were pyrolysed and their decomposition characteristics monitored by thermal analysis methods. Parallel analysis of the volatiles produced and a comparison of the results from <b>previous</b> investigations generally <b>endorsed</b> the reported hypotheses on the degradation of Amadori compounds. It was found that the structure of the base and functional groups present influenced the degradation phenomena as well as the basicity. The thermal decomposition of amino acid - derived Amadori compounds for instance, did not fit into the pattern of that observed for 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses derived from other bases. The amino acid influences the degradation traits by promoting 1, 2 enolisation and charring rather than aiding 2, 3 enolisation similar to bases of comparable pkb...|$|R
