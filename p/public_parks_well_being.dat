40|$|The {{definition}} of a public space promotes free access to all citizens. Unlike men, women had many concerns about feeling free to go out {{at any time in}} accessing and being in public spaces. This reduces, rather than enhances, women's access to public spaces. Thus, public spaces themselves become gendered. Women may find it difficult to participate in public spaces. Many factors limit women from accessing public spaces. The significance of this thesis is to investigate and try to answer these questions: how do women use <b>public</b> <b>parks?</b> Do women have full/fair access to <b>public</b> <b>parks?</b> What are consequences of multiculturalism on women’s access to <b>public</b> <b>parks?</b> Is there a need for segregated parks for women? Moreover, {{it is important to understand}} and identify the factors that limit women’s access to <b>public</b> <b>parks,</b> as <b>well</b> as defining the elements that give women comfort in <b>public</b> <b>parks.</b> Therefore, this will help to enhance and improve the <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> environment in Doha, which will promote free access to all citizens. The thesis will focus on studying <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in Doha. The thesis depends on the data collected from both secondary and primary resources. Thus, to reach a conclusion regarding this problem, a detailed literature review was done to help understand the background of the problem and to identify what the variables are that will help in understanding and formulating the thesis framework. The thesis employs the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods, given its investigative nature. After identifying the variables from the literature review, a questionnaire was formulated. Moreover, the literature review will give certain and clear techniques to be used in observation. Different parks in Doha city are observed to come up with maps that documented the behavior of users in parks. The outcomes of this thesis are behavioral maps, graphs, charts, photos, and recommendations...|$|R
