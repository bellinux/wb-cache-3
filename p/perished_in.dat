5|$|Before {{leading the}} final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinski ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine. After cutting {{down the last}} of the {{defenders}} the besiegers poured into the fortress.

5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E

The {{municipality}} of Sabana Grande claims that Ángel Gregorio Martínez, one of its native sons, was the first to <b>perish</b> <b>in</b> that conflict, and the town named one of its main thoroughfares after him. However, in Luis Fortuño Janeiro's [...] "Album Histórico de Ponce (1692–1963)", the author claims that Juan Sanz from Ponce {{was the first one to}} <b>perish</b> <b>in</b> France during the World War I conflict.

5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> the effort.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed.

According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E

In 2007, scientists using DNA analysis identified the body of a small fair-haired toddler, one of the first victims to be recovered by the CS Mackay Bennett, as Frederick's youngest child, 19-month-old Sidney.

5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines.

A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
