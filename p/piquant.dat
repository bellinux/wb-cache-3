5|$|During the Second Temple period (516 BCE to 70 CE), Hellenistic and Roman culture heavily {{influenced}} cuisine, particularly {{of the priests}} and aristocracy of Jerusalem. Elaborate meals were served that included <b>piquant</b> entrées and alcoholic drinks, fish, beef, meat, pickled and fresh vegetables, olives, and tart or sweet fruits.|$|E
5|$|A meze {{of fresh}} and cooked {{vegetable}} salads, pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, hummus, ful, tahini and amba dips, labneh cheese with olive oil, and ikra is served at festive meals and in restaurants. Salads include Turkish salad (a <b>piquant</b> salad of finely chopped onions, tomatoes, herbs and spices), tabbouleh, carrot salad, marinated roasted {{red and green}} peppers, deep fried cauliflower florets, matbucha, torshi (pickled vegetables) and various eggplant salads.|$|E
5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named <b>Piquant,</b> was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E

25|$|Although Pari had a liking for {{the dense}} {{counterpoint}} {{of the middle}} of the 16th century, he experimented with <b>piquant</b> dissonances, and also with the concertato style, features which were quite contemporary; he also varied the texture widely within individual pieces as a way to highlight the dramatic contents of the text.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} its {{popularity}} are clear enough; it is a score replete with beguiling orchestral colors, fresh and <b>piquant</b> melodies, {{with a mild}} oriental flavor, a rhythmic vitality largely absent from many major orchestral works of the later 19th century, and a directness of expression unhampered by quasi-symphonic complexities of texture and structure.|$|E
25|$|Threads are {{a popular}} {{condiment}} for rice in Spain and Iran, India and Pakistan, and other countries. Two {{examples of such}} saffron rice is the zarzuela fish-seafood stew and paella valenciana, a <b>piquant</b> rice-meat preparation. It is essential in making the French bouillabaisse, which is a spicy fish stew from Marseilles, and the Italian risotto alla milanese.|$|E

25|$|Spohr, {{with his}} {{eighteen}} violin concertos, won for himself a conspicuous {{place in the}} musical literature of the nineteenth century. He endeavored (without any good result) to make the concerto a substantial and superior composition free from the artificial bravura of the time. He achieved a new romantic mode of expression. The weaker sides of Spohr’s violin compositions are observed in his somewhat monotonous rhythmic structures; in his rejection of certain <b>piquant</b> bowing styles, and artificial harmonics; and in the deficiency of contrapuntal textures.|$|E
25|$|Apples, plums, and pears, which grow well in Lithuania, are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fruit. Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas, and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews (kompots). Gooseberries (agrastai) and currants (serbentai) are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a <b>piquant</b> touch to desserts.|$|E
25|$|Solyanka is a thick, <b>piquant</b> soup that {{combines}} components from shchi (cabbage, smetana) and rassolnik (pickle water and cucumbers), spices such as olives, capers, tomatoes, lemons, lemon juice, kvass, salted and pickled mushrooms {{make up a}} considerably strong sour-salty base of the soup. Solyanka is much thicker than other soups, about 1/3 less liquid ratio. Three types are distinguished: meat, fish, and simple solyanka. The first two are cooked on strong meat or fish broths, and the last on mushroom or vegetable broth. All the broths are mixed with cucumber pickle water.|$|E
50|$|The American Dental Association, or ADA, {{does not}} endorse {{painting}} bitterants, <b>piquants,</b> or otherwise unpleasant substances on children's nails to inhibit the habit.

Rather than use bitterants or <b>piquants,</b> which are not endorsed by the ADA due to their causing of discomfort or pain, TGuards break the habit simply by removing the suction responsible for generating the feelings of comfort and nurture. [...] Other appliances are available, such as fabric thumb guards from Thumbsie, each having their own benefits and features depending on the child's age, willpower and motivation.|$|R
25|$|The shanty genre was {{typified by}} {{flexible}} lyrical forms, which in practice provided for much improvisation {{and the ability}} to lengthen or shorten a song to match the circumstances. Its hallmark was call and response, performed between a soloist {{and the rest of the}} workers in chorus. The leader, called the shantyman, was appreciated for his <b>piquant</b> language, lyrical wit, and strong voice. Shanties were sung without instrumental accompaniment and, historically speaking, they were only sung in work-based rather than entertainment-oriented contexts. Although most prominent in English, shanties have been created in or translated into other European languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} new Liberalism {{did not seem}} much more <b>piquant</b> or fertile than the respectable old. As it happened, in the fulness of time our {{distinguished}} apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with {{a share in the}} finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover no better way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not without a trace of arbitrary proscription) from the opposing party that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.|$|E
25|$|Mojo, a word {{probably}} of Portuguese origin, {{describes a}} typical Canarian sauce, {{served as an}} accompaniment to food. The sauces {{come in a variety}} of colours, flavours and textures, and are usually served cold, often in separate dishes, for the diner to choose how much to apply. Green mojo usually includes coriander, parsley, and garlic; whilst red mojo is <b>piquant,</b> and made from a mix of hot and sweet peppers. A wide variety of other ingredients are also used, including; almonds, cheese, saffron and fried bread. Mojos are served with most meat, and some fish, dishes, and are often used on potatoes, or bread is dipped into them.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and <b>piquant</b> olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E
25|$|This {{album is}} filled with {{feelings}} of lethargy, languor and disengagement, yet most of the tracks sound warm and sweet, {{as opposed to those}} <b>piquant</b> self-centered ones before her motherhood. Reporters noticed that she began to smile more often in public and was not as icy or aloof as before. However, the album was released during the Asian financial crisis which swept East and Southeast Asia. Wong's old company Cinepoly, which retains the copyright on her previous records, released a Mandarin compilation {{at the same time in}} 1997 to counteract her new EMI album (and indeed outperformed it). Later, Cinepoly would release two compilations each year to compete with Faye's new releases, a tactic which has come under fire from her international fans. Faye Wong did not sell well in Hong Kong, but did quite well in Taiwan and mainland China. Although Wong had garnered some popularity with her 4 previous Mandarin albums, it was really this sweet yet slightly alternative album which had the Mainland Chinese audience listening. Her profile began to rise sharply in Asia.|$|E
500|$|A banquet {{was meant}} to {{overwhelm}} the guests with lavishness and flaunt the host's wealth and munificence. Abundant use of expensive spices was one way to accomplish this. Black pepper, ginger, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, mace and nutmeg were added to most dishes by kilograms. Czerniecki counted sugar among spices and used it as such; his book contains few recipes for desserts, but sugar is used profusely in recipes for meat, fish and egg dishes. Vinegar was also used in copious amounts. Such fusion of excessively <b>piquant,</b> sweet and sour tastes, which modern Poles would likely find inedible, was typical of Old Polish cuisine, described by Czerniecki as [...] "saffrony and peppery".|$|E
500|$|The {{blackcurrant}} (Ribes nigrum) is a woody shrub in {{the family}} Grossulariaceae grown for its <b>piquant</b> berries. It is native to temperate parts of central and northern Europe and northern Asia where it prefers damp fertile soils and is widely cultivated both commercially and domestically. It is winterhardy, but cold weather at flowering time during the spring reduces {{the size of the}} crop. Bunches of small, glossy black fruit develop along the stems in the summer and can be harvested by hand or by machine. The raw fruit is particularly rich in vitamin C and polyphenol [...] phytochemicals. Blackcurrants can be eaten raw but are usually cooked in a variety of sweet or savoury dishes. They are used to make jams, jellies and syrups and are grown commercially for the juice market. The fruit is also used in the preparation of alcoholic beverages and both fruit and foliage have uses in traditional medicine and the preparation of dyes.|$|E
500|$|Zombia antillarum {{is called}} the [...] "Zombie palm" [...] or [...] "Zombi palm" [...] by horticulturists. [...] Orator F. Cook coined the name [...] "Haitian cactus palm" [...] due to the spiny {{appearance}} of its trunk. [...] In Haiti it is usually known as latanye zombi (latanier zombi in French; the zombie fan palm), or latanye pikan, (latanier <b>piquant</b> in French, the spiny fan palm). [...] It is also called latanier savanne or latanier marron. [...] Latanye or latanier is a common term for fan palms in Haiti, so these names ("savanna fan palm" [...] and [...] "wild fan palm") are not specific to this species; they are also used for several species of Coccothrinax. [...] In the Dominican Republic the species is called guanito or guanillo. [...] These are diminutives of guano, which is used for several species of Coccothrinax and Thrinax. In his 1821 description of the species, Descourtilz used the name latanier épineux.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Bellman {{writes that}} modern concert {{performance}} style—set in the [...] "conservatory" [...] tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against {{what is known}} of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that [...] "concerts are never real music, {{you have to give}} up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art." [...] Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as [...] "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. [...] Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin [...] "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery... whose effect is so strange and <b>piquant</b> as to be impossible to describe... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn". Hiller wrote that [...] "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers." ...|$|E
500|$|On 17 February, Henry Sutherland Edwards {{wrote in}} the Musical World: [...] "In almost all conjunctions of music and words, there is a {{sacrifice}} of one to the other; but in Thespis... Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece." [...] Similar reports continued to appear through early March, when Thespis closed. The final performance during the authors' lifetimes was given {{less than two months}} later, on 27 April, at a matinée for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at [...] "inflated prices". The actress was a Gaiety favourite, [...] "not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure." [...] Others recalled [...] "the charm of Mlle. Clary, with her pretty face and <b>piquant</b> broken English". She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion, and her song in Act II, [...] "Little Maid of Arcadee", was the only one chosen for publication.|$|E
500|$|When David Webster was {{appointed}} {{chief executive of}} the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden {{at the end of the}} war, his assignment was to establish permanent opera and ballet companies for the house. He set about building the opera company from scratch but persuaded de Valois to make Covent Garden the main base for her ballet company. In 1946, while still a student, MacMillan appeared in the production of The Sleeping Beauty with which Webster and de Valois reopened the opera house. At first he was a non-dancing extra, and later he was promoted to a small dancing role. With the main company now resident at Covent Garden, de Valois established a smaller ensemble to perform at Sadler's Wells and act as a training ground for young dancers and choreographers. In April 1946 MacMillan was a founder member, and quickly made progress. He was cast by Frederick Ashton, de Valois' principal choreographer, in a leading role in a new ballet, Valses nobles et sentimentales, in October 1946. The success of the piece encouraged Ashton to revive his 1933 Les Rendezvous. Although initially only in the corps de ballet for this work, MacMillan was unexpectedly promoted to the male lead because of injuries to all the eligible company principals. His biographer Jann Parry comments that he was able to take over without notice because he had a rare ability to remember and reproduce the steps of every dancer in any piece in which he appeared. He was promoted to the senior Covent Garden company at the start of the 1948–49 season, touring in Europe and dancing Florestan in the third act pas de trois of [...] The Sleeping Beauty in the company's opening gala in New York in October 1949. The first new role he created was The Great Admirer of Mademoiselle <b>Piquant</b> in John Cranko's ballet Children's Corner (1948), followed by both Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty in Margaret Dale's The Great Detective (1953), and Moondog in Cranko's The Lady and the Fool (1954).|$|E

The cooking technique is mostly the same as of ukha, but to the broth were added pickled cucumbers, pickle water, lemons and lemon juice, either separately or all together. The main characteristic of kal'ya is that only fat, rich fish was used; sometimes caviar was added along with the fish. More spices are added, and the soup turns out more <b>piquant</b> and thicker than ukha. Formerly kal'ya was considered a festivity dish.|$|E
