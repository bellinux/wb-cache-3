On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, his Elo rating of 2785 was 125 points above (World No. 2) Spassky's rating of 2660.

5|$|Henry de Cornhill (c. 1135– c. 1193) was {{a medieval}} English royal {{official}} and sheriff who served King Henry II of England.

5|$|In {{the state}} {{legislative}} elections of 1830, the ascendent Whig Party {{gained control of}} both houses of the General Assembly. Rowan's strict adherence to Jeffersonian democracy and leadership of the New Court faction during the court controversy of the 1820s had <b>put</b> <b>him</b> at odds with Whig founder Henry Clay. By this time, however, not even Rowan's fellow Democrats endorsed his re-election. Henry Clay was elected instead.|$|E

His design for an airport in Kanon, Hiroshima was accepted and built, but a seaside park in Ujina was not.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E
5|$|After strong podiums in Monaco and Canada, Hill {{took his}} first career pole in France, {{finishing}} second to Prost after team orders prevented him from seriously challenging for the win.

5|$|After the Gdańsk Agreement, the Polish {{government}} was under increasing {{pressure from the}} Soviet Union to take action and strengthen its position.

Kania lost his post as First Secretary, {{and was replaced by}} Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.|$|E

His time was good enough to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sectional}} conflict {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 <b>put</b> <b>him</b> at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any.

I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
