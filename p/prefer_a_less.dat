Besides, she really believed Marian Arundel had no affection for any one,--no warmth of feeling; she would ten times <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> diligent and more troublesome pupil, in whom she could take some interest, and who showed some affection, to one so steady and correct in behaviour, without the frank openness of heart which was so delightful. To make up, however, for this general want of liking for poor Marian, on the other hand, every one was fond of Gerald. His behaviour in the schoolroom was so very nice and good, and out of doors his climbing, running, and riding were no less admired by his contemporaries. Now and then, indeed, a dispute arose between him and the other two boys, when Gerald criticised, and declared that [...] "Edmund and everybody" [...] thought as he did; or when he would try to outdo the sporting exploits reported of Elliot, by Edmund's shooting at Fern Torr. One day there was a very serious quarrel, Gerald having taken up the cause of an unfortunate frog, which Lionel and Johnny were proposing to hunt, by rolling their marbles at it.|$|E

50|$|MINDS runs: 4 Special Education SchoolsThe 4 MINDS schools offer four {{programs}}; Pre-School, Junior, Senior and Special {{programs for}} pupils who have Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and are severely disabled intellectually or have challenging behaviours. The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and {{the focus is on the}} functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the holistic development of pupils, the schools have within their curriculum time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a holistic approach to the development of pupils and support for their families.3 Employment and Development Centres (EDCs)The Employment Development Centres continuously seek to increase their diversity of contract work, in-house industries, social enterprises and job placements into open employment for persons with intellectual disability. These efforts go towards providing income for the trainees to pay for their own transport, food and leisure. But more importantly, with jobs to do, persons with intellectual disability can hold their heads high in society as ‘contributors’.6 Training and Development Centres (TDCs)The Training and Development Centres service clients with more challenging behaviours, or have a greater degree of special needs that require continuous professional help. Extensive training is provided through a multi-disciplinary team to modify behaviours and improve independent living skills so that some may eventually be transferred to sheltered workshops or even prepared for open employment.2 Residential Homes (one for adults, one for children) + 1 Hostel/Group Home (for adults)MINDSville@Napiri is a multi-service centre in Lorong Napiri run by MINDS. It replaces two former MINDS Homes for intellectually disabled adults and includes Singapore’s first home for intellectually disabled children, aged six to 18. With a total capacity of about 310, the centre can accommodate the Home and Hostel/Group Home, Napiri Training & Development Centre and Children’s Wing1 Caregivers Support CentreThe Caregivers Support Services Centre provides a range of services to empower and support caregivers in their care for their charges with special needs, enabling carers to maintain a balance between their caring responsibilities and a life outside caring.1 Social Integration Programme (Me Too!

Their role is to act as a bridge between the Investigation Officer and the police detainee/suspect/witness to enable him/her to communicate more effectively during the police interview. This means that the police detainee/suspect/witness does not misunderstand the questions asked or that he/she is not misunderstood by the Investigation Officer, ensuring that statements recorded are reliable.All applicants will have to attend a mandatory one-day training session and selection process. Training sessions will be held depending on demand, and the dates will be publicised.|$|E

I employ a simple two-period agency model, in which contract frictions arise from limited liability {{and the potential}} unverifiability of the principal’s information about the agent’s action.

We show that by dividing labour (assigning tasks to different agents and verifying that agents do not carry out tasks {{to which they are}} not assigned), it is possible for the principal to implement the efficient way of production. Colluding agents can undermine this implementation. However, if agents have different abilities, collusion can be prevented by a specific assignment of agents tasks. hidden action, moral hazard, specialisation, job design...|$|E

This paper shows that intermediaries reduce a biased sender’s reputation cost, but they also lessen his influence on the receiver. Biased agents ’ truth-telling incentives are strategic complements, and each additional intermediary reduces everyone’s reporting truthfulness. If the sender’s existing reputation is sufficiently high and his signal sufficiently informative, ex ante, he prefers using intermediaries.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{literature}} on {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) has analysed {{the entry mode choice}} by multinational enterprises (MNEs) from several theoretical viewpoints. Nevertheless, previous studies have mainly focused on the behaviour of large and established MNEs while little attention has been given to small- and medium-sized firms. The paper aims at providing further empirical evidence on the role of firm size and international experience in influencing the ownership structure of FDI. The main hypothesis is that smaller firms, characterised by financial and managerial con-straints, as well as firms lacking experience in managing foreign operations, suffer from a condition of adverse asym-metry in information costs, compared to their competitors. Therefore, they are forced to act prudently, minimising risk and thus <b>preferring</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> control arrangement of foreign sub-sidiaries.
