40|$|The Belgian Heart Disease Prevention Project is a {{controlled}} multifactorial <b>preventive</b> <b>trial.</b> It is basal on the well-documented epidemiologic notion of major coronary risk-factors: hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking and obesity. This Project has been executed in industries, in males aged 40 - 59 yrs at the base-line screening. It {{is part of}} the WHO European Collaborative Trial including the United-Kingdom, Italy, Poland and Spain. This trial should verify a double work-hypothesis: 1 degree it is possible to modify significantly the coronary risk profile in middle-aged males through a comprehensive intervention program, 2 degrees this modification should, in turn, significantly reduce total mortality as compared to a control group. The authors discuss {{the pros and cons of}} a <b>preventive</b> <b>trial</b> in industry and review the numerous problems raised by the difficulties in modifying well-established life-styles as well as those related to the follow-up morbidity and mortality.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Because no {{effective}} curative approaches are available, preventive approaches {{in the field}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed. We present the design of the ongoing Multidomain Alzheimer <b>Preventive</b> <b>Trial</b> (MAPT) Study. Several previous studies suggested that many factors may be involved in the occurrence of AD at late ages. Because of the probable multifactorial nature of AD, it seems logical to initiate multidomain interventions to examine their potential synergistic effects. The MAPT Study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a multidomain intervention (nutritional, physical, and cognitive training) and omega 3 treatment in the prevention of cognitive decline in frail elderly persons aged 70 years or over. The study also collects imaging and biological data {{that could be used in}} future AD prevention and treatment trials. METHODS: The MAPT Study is a 3 -year, randomized, controlled trial conducted by university hospital practitioners specializing in memory disorders in four French cities (Bordeaux, Limoges, Montpellier, and Toulouse). The study plans to enroll 1200 frail elderly subjects on the basis of at least one of the following criteria: subjective memory complaint spontaneously expressed to a general practitioner, limitation in one instrumental activity of daily living (IADL), and slow walking speed. To demonstrate the protective effect of interventions, subjects are randomized into one of the following four groups: omega 3 alone, multidomain intervention alone, omega 3 plus multidomain intervention, or placebo (n = 300 each). The principal outcome measure is a change in cognitive function at 3 years, as determined by the Grober and Buschke Test. CONCLUSIONS: The MAPT Study is the first <b>preventive</b> <b>trial</b> involving multidomain interventions. Final results should be available in 2013...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{interest}} {{of patients in}} participating in randomized clinical trials involving treatments has been widely studied, {{but there has been}} much less research on interest in <b>preventive</b> <b>trials.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} find out how many women would be interested in a trial involving postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT) and how the women's background characteristics and opinions correlated to their interest. Methods The data come from recruitment questionnaires (n = 2000) sent to women in Estonia in 1998. A random sample of women aged 45 to 64 was drawn from the Population Registry. The trial is a two-group randomized trial comparing estrogen-progestogen therapy with placebo or no drugs. A brief description of the study was attached to the questionnaires. Women were not told at this stage of the recruitment which group they would be assigned to, however, they were told of the chance to receive either hormone, placebo or no treatment. Results After two reminders, 1312 women (66 %) responded. Eleven percent of the women approached (17 % of the respondents) were interested in joining the trial, and 8 % wanted more information before deciding. When the 225 women who stated clearly that they were interested in joining and the 553 women who said they were not interested were compared, it was found that interested women were younger and, adjusting for age, that more had given birth; in other respects, the sociodemographic characteristics and health habits of the interested women were similar to those of the non-interested women. The interested women had made more use of more health services, calcium preparations and PHT, they were more often overweight, and more had chronic diseases and reported symptoms. Interested women's opinions on the menopause were more negative, and they favoured PHT more than the non-interested women. Conclusion Unlike the situation described in previous reports on <b>preventive</b> <b>trials,</b> in this case Estonian women interested in participating in a PHT trial were not healthier than other women. This suggests that trials involving PHT are more similar to treatment <b>trials</b> than to <b>preventive</b> <b>trials.</b> In a randomized controlled trial, more information should be obtained from those women who decline to participate. </p...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} a multifactorial {{cardiovascular}} <b>preventive</b> <b>trial</b> serum thiocyanate {{was measured}} in random samples of 1035 cases and 1087 controls. A cut-off point 0. 45 mg/dl (77. 6 /mumol/l) gave a sensitivity of 82. 1 % among the cigarette smokers in the control group and a specificity of 91. 0 % among the non-smokers. When the intervention and control groups are compared in terms of self-reported smoking behaviour non-significant differences in mean thiocyanate concentration are observed for those who never smoked, ex-cigarette smokers, actual cigarette smokers, and in four different cigarette smoking categories. Our results fail to confirm the reported pessimistic views concerning the validity of self-reported smoking behaviour in subjects taking part in intervention trials.

40|$|International audienceAlzheimer's disease (AD) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} form of dementia {{and according to the}} most recent estimation it affects nearly 27 million people in the world. The onset of the disease is generally insidious. It is becoming increasingly evident that the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are active long before the appearance of the clinical symptoms of the disease. In the current context, it is important to develop strategies to delay the onset of cognitive decline. Delaying the onset by 5 years would reduce the prevalence by half at term, and a delay of 10 years would reduce it by three-quarters. The effectiveness of currently suggested preventive approaches remains to be confirmed, but certain strategies could be applied straight away to at-risk subjects. We propose that a health-promoting memory consultation should be set up for elderly persons who have attended a specialized memory consultation and in whom the diagnosis of dementia and of AD in particular, has not been established by standardized tools. Through this consultation, they would be offered full multidimensional investigation of all aspects of their health status, follow-up could be organized, general practitioners in private practice could be made more conscious of this population and the elderly could be made more aware of the risk factors to which they are exposed. The development of an information policy for the elderly would meet a present need. In our reflection, we must take into account the question of how to give this preventive consultation its due place in the healthcare pathway of the elderly person in order to ensure coordinated follow-up with all the other health professionals involved. The principle of the health-promoting memory consultation is undergoing validation in a large French multicentre <b>preventive</b> <b>trial</b> in 1200 frail elderly persons aged 70 years followed for three years, the Multidomain Alzheimer <b>Preventive</b> <b>Trial</b> (MAPT) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{examined}} how family environmental characteristics served as mediators {{in the relationship}} between socioeconomic conditions and infant growth in a cohort of Chilean infants. Methods. We studied 999 infants, born between 1991 and 1996, from a longitudinal cohort which began as an iron deficiency anemia <b>preventive</b> <b>trial.</b> SES (Graffar Index), the Life Experiences Survey, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) were assessed in infancy. Using path analysis, we assessed the relationships between the social factors, home environment, and infant growth. Results. During the first year, weight and length gain averaged 540 grams/month and 6. 5 [*]cm/month, respectively. In the path analysis model for weight gain, higher SES and a better physical environment were positively related to higher maternal warmth, which in turn was associated with higher average weight gain. Higher SES was directly related to higher average length gain. Conclusions. In our cohort, a direct relationship between SES and length gain developed during infancy. Higher SES was indirectly related to infant weight gain through the home environment and maternal warmth. As the fastest growing infants are at risk for later obesity, new strategies are needed to encourage optimal rather than maximal growth...|$|E

40|$|Advancing age is {{the focus}} of recent studies on {{familial}} and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting a prolonged pre-clinical phase several decades before the onset of dementia symptoms. Influencing some age-related conditions, such as frailty, may {{have an impact on the}} prevention of late-life cognitive disorders. Frailty reflects a nonspecific state of vulnerability and a multi-system physiological change with increased risk for adverse health outcomes in older age. In this systematic review, frailty indexes based on a deficit accumulation model were associated with late life cognitive impairment and decline, incident dementia, and AD. Physical frailty constructs were associated with late-life cognitive impairment and decline, incident AD and mild cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, non-AD dementias, and AD pathology in older persons with and without dementia, thus also proposing cognitive frailty as a new clinical condition with co-existing physical frailty and cognitive impairment in non-demented older subjects. Considering both physical frailty and cognitive impairment as a single complex phenotype may be central in the prevention of dementia and its subtypes with secondary <b>preventive</b> <b>trials</b> on cognitive frail older subjects. The mechanisms underlying the cognitive-frailty link are multi-factorial, and vascular, inflammatory, nutritional, and metabolic influences may be of major relevance. There is a critical need for randomized controlled trials of intervention investigating the role of nutrition and/or physical exercise on cognitive frail subjects with the progression to dementia as primary outcome. These <b>preventive</b> <b>trials</b> and larger longitudinal population-based studies targeting cognitive outcomes could be useful in further understanding the cognitive-frailty interplay in older age...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{consensus}} that intervention {{and treatment of}} Huntington disease (HD) should occur at the earliest stage possible.

40|$|Summary A {{nationwide}} mammographic {{screening for}} breast cancer was started in Finland in 1987. During the first 2 years of the organised screening programme, 126, 000 women were invited. Most of them (103, 000) belonged to the birth year cohort in the 50 - 59 years ' age groups. Among the 112, 000 screenees, 418 cancers (0. 4 %) were found. Specificity of the test was about 96 %. The screening prevalance was 2. 4 times the annual incidence and a minimum estimate for the detection rate among those invited was 1. 6 times that among those not invited.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} report on a high {{prevalence}} of low bone mineral density (BMD) and to explore the relationship between BMD, sex and body composition among a cohort of Chilean adolescents. Background Osteoporosis, associated with low BMD, is a public health problem. Peak bone mass (PBM) is influenced by genetics, nutrition, body weight and physical activity, with 90 % of PBM obtained by age 18 years. Recent research challenges the belief that obesity protects against low BMD. In a study of overweight and obese adults, researchers noted that overweight status was neutral or protective of BMD, whereas obesity was associated with lower bone mass (Greco et al. 2010). Relationships between adiposity, bone health and fracture risk {{in children and adolescents}} remain under debate. One study reports overweight/obese children have insufficient bone health relative to body weight and may be at increased risk of bone fractures (Goulding et al. 2000). Studies in older adolescents are needed, as bone mass in this period may best predict future bone health.

Subjects ranged from healthy to mildly cognitively impaired enrolled in the control arm of the multidomain intervention in the Multidomain Alzheimer <b>Preventive</b> <b>Trial</b> (MAPT). Nearly all participants presented spontaneous memory complaints. Regional [(18) F]florbetapir (AV 45) standardized uptake volume ratios were obtained via semiautomated quantitative analysis using the cerebellum as reference region. Gait speed was measured by timing participants while they walked 4 meters. Associations were explored with linear regression, correcting for age, sex, education, body mass index (BMI), and APOE genotype. We found a significant association between Aβ in the posterior and anterior putamen, occipital cortex, precuneus, and anterior cingulate and slow gait speed (all corrected p < 0. 05). A multivariate model emphasized the locations of the posterior putamen and the precuneus. Aβ burden explained up to 9 % of the variance in gait speed, and significantly improved regression models already containing demographic variables, BMI, and APOE status. The present PET study confirms, in vivo, previous postmortem evidence showing an association between Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and gait speed, and provides additional evidence on potential regional effects of brain Aβ on motor function. More research is needed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these regional associations, which may involve motor and sensorimotor circuits hitherto largely neglected in the pathophysiology of AD...|$|E

In the present thesis the relationships between some key indicators of NA (depressive symptoms, vital exhaustion, hopelessness, and anger expression) and lifestyle factors, body mass index, serum lipids and blood pressure were investigated. All the four studies that constitute this investigation were based on data from the Helsinki Metabolic Syndrome Prevention Trial, which was an uncontrolled <b>preventive</b> <b>trial</b> aimed at improving prevention of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by developing a practical method for primary health care. The main idea was to screen and identify men with cardiovascular risk clustering and give them individual counselling based on their risk profile. Evaluation of risk was based on a Risk Index that included five factors: body mass index, total serum cholesterol, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), smoking habits, and physical inactivity. The participants in the screening were 40 - 55 year-old-men residing in the north-east Helsinki. Data collection was carried out between May 2001 and June 2004, and all {{the participants were asked to}} answer questionnaires dealing with lifestyle factors and psychosocial risk factors. Study nurses from the Helsinki Heart District interviewed all the participants and recorded basic biomedical measurements (e. g. blood pressure, waist circumference, weight). The size of the sample in studies I-IV was 893, 705, 444, and 710, respectively. The findings of this study indicate that depressive symptoms had a consistent statistically significant correlation with adverse lifestyle factors and triglycerides. For cholesterol fractions, path analyses indicated the parallel existence of two main pathways: from depression through the adverse health behaviour to an unfavourable cholesterol fraction balance, and from depression through a direct, probably physiological, link to favourable cholesterol levels. not availabl...|$|E

This study investigated the temporal ordering between children’s motor skills and weight status at 5 and 10 [*]years. MethodsParticipants were 668 children (54 % male) who were studied from infancy {{as part of an}} iron deficiency anaemia <b>preventive</b> <b>trial</b> and follow‐up study in Santiago, Chile. All were healthy, full‐term and weighing 3 [*]kg or more at birth. Cross‐lagged panel modelling was conducted to understand the temporal precedence between children’s weight status and motor proficiency. Analyses also examined differences in gross and fine motor skills among healthy weight, overweight, and obese children. ResultsA higher BMI at 5 [*]years contributed to declines in motor proficiency from 5 to 10 [*]years. There was no support for the reverse, that is, poor motor skills at 5 [*]years did not predict increases in relative weight from 5 to 10 [*]years. Obesity at 5 [*]years also predicted declines in motor proficiency. When compared with normal weight children, obese children had significantly poorer total and gross motor skills at both 5 and 10 [*]years. Overweight children had poorer total and gross motor skills at 10 [*]years only. The differences in total and gross motor skills among normal weight, overweight and obese children appear to increase with age. There were small differences in fine motor skill between obese and non‐obese children at 5 [*]years only. ConclusionsObesity preceded declines in motor skills and not the reverse. Study findings suggest that early childhood obesity intervention efforts might help prevent declines in motor proficiency that, in turn, may positively impact children’s physical activity and overall fitness levels...|$|E

Hence, we sought to explore the cross-sectional relationship between fatigue and cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) in 269 elderly individuals reporting subjective memory complaints from the Multidomain Alzheimer <b>Preventive</b> <b>Trial.</b> Standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were generated by [18 F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) using the cerebellum as a reference. Cortical-to-cerebellar SUVRs (cortical-SUVRs) were obtained using the mean signal from the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, precuneus, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate. Other brain regions independently assessed were the anterior cingulate, anterior putamen, caudate, hippocampus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, occipital cortex, parietal cortex, pons, posterior cingulate, posterior putamen, precuneus, semioval center, and temporal cortex. Fatigue was defined according to two questions retrieved from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Chronic fatigue was defined as meeting fatigue criteria at two consecutive clinical visits 6 months apart between study baseline and 1 year (visits were performed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year then annually). Cross-sectional associations between fatigue variables and cerebral Aβ were explored using fully adjusted multiple linear regression models. We found no statistically significant cross-sectional associations between fatigue assessed at the clinical visit closest to PET and Aβ in any brain region. Similarly, chronic fatigue was not significantly associated with Aβ load. Sensitivity analysis in subjects with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0. 5 showed that fatigue reported at the clinical visit closest to PET was, however, weakly associated with increased Aβ in the hippocampus (B-coefficient: 0. 07, 95 % CI: 0. 01, 0. 12, p[*]=[*] 0. 016).

Methods: Participant demographic data of 43 Phase 1 and Phase 2 A trials conducted in the United States were examined. Distributions of participants by racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identity were calculated. The racial/ethnic distribution of participants was compared to that of the former study and over time by US geographic region. Racial and ethnic distributions from 2011 to 2015 were compared to CDC data on the number of new HIV diagnoses in the same time period. Recruitment strategies used by trial sites were reviewed to account for differences in minority enrollment by region. Results: A total of 3, 469 participants were included in the analysis. Thirty three percent of all participants identified as a racial/ethnic minority, a significant increase from the previous time period. The proportions of enrollment of Black and Hispanic/Latinx participants were substantially less than their respective proportions of new HIV diagnoses in all regions. No conclusions were able to be made on data regarding sexual orientation and gender identity due to inconsistencies in collection and reporting. Conclusions: Although the proportion of all racial and ethnic minority group members enrolled in HVTN <b>preventive</b> vaccine clinical <b>trials</b> in the US has increased from the previous time period, comparison to data on new HIV diagnoses in the country reflects a need to continue to enhance diversity among the trial participant pools. More standardized data collection for sexual orientation and gender identity is required for any meaningful future analysis of these populations...|$|R
40|$|Current drug {{treatments}} for Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{appear to be}} symptomatic. There is an increasing priority to find effective and safe disease-modifying and preventive treatment strategies for cognitive decline, AD, and dementia. Recent developments have allowed the identification of possible pathogenic processes and pathways, and potential targets for intervention. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of ß-amyloid and tau, and neuroimaging including amyloid PET tracer retention show that the pathogenic process begins many years before symptoms appear. A number of <b>preventive</b> <b>trials</b> have been completed but so far none has demonstrated significant benefits and some were potentially harmful. New preclinical treatment trials are underway in people at the highest risk of developing AD in the following few years. A US National Institutes of Health panel {{found no evidence of}} even moderate scientific quality to clearly support the association of any modifiable factors with a reduced risk of cognitive decline or AD. The best current evidence suggests that heart-healthy eating patterns such as the Mediterranean diet may help to protect the brain. Future preventive approaches will need to harness the increased technological advances concerning biomarkers with new hypotheses driven by {{a better understanding of the}} relevant risk factors...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{patterns of}} satiety responsiveness {{and its relationship}} to eating in the absence of hunger (EAH), in a cohort of adolescents. We also assessed whether sex, body mass index and duration of breastfeeding, during infancy, predicted satiety responsiveness and eating behavior at 16 years. METHODS: Adolescents (n¼ 576) from a longitudinal cohort, which began as an iron deficiency anemia <b>preventive</b> <b>trial,</b> participated in an unlimited breakfast after an overnight fast, and reported satiety response on a visual analog scale after the meal, followed by an EAH procedure. Height, weight and body composition were measured before breakfast. Latent profile analysis generated profiles that captured individual differences in satiety responsiveness. Multivariable regressions, adjusted for potential confounders, evaluated the association between: (1) satiety responsiveness and EAH, and (2) breastfeeding in infancy, satiety responsiveness and EAH in adolescence. RESULTS: Participants were on average 16. 7 -year old, 48 % female, 37 % overweight/obese and 76 % were breastfed as the sole source of milk for o 6 months. We found three latent profiles of satiety responsiveness: 1 : ‘responsive’ (49 %); 2 : ‘not responsive’ (41 %); 3 : ‘still hungry’ (10 %). Participants in the ‘not responsive’ or ‘still hungry’ profile were more likely to eat during the EAH procedure (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) ¼ 1. 8 – 3. 6). Being breastfed for o 6 months was related to higher odds of being in the ‘not responsive’ or ‘still hungry’ profile (OR¼ 1. 8, 95 % CI¼ 1. 2 – 2. 6) and EAH (OR¼ 2. 2, 95 % CI¼ 1. 4 – 3. 3). Satiety responsiveness was not influenced by sex and overweight/obesity. CONCLUSION: After an ad libitum meal, we found varied satiety responses, which related to EAH. Furthermore, shorter breastfeeding duration was associated with poorer satiety response and higher consumption during an EAH procedure. Understanding if breastfeeding influences the development of satiety responsiveness and eating behavior may be important in an era characterized by abundant calorie-dense foods and a plethora of environmental cues promoting consumption...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ankle sprains {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} injuries of the musculoskeletal system, with yearly around 680. 000 new sprains in the Netherlands. Of these, about 130. 000 people will visit the general practitioner (GP) each year. In addition, patients have an increased risk of a recurrent ankle sprain and about a third report at least one re-sprain. No optimal treatment strategy has proven to be effective in general practice, however promising results were achieved in a <b>preventive</b> <b>trial</b> among athletes. Therefore, the objective is to examine the (cost) -effectiveness of an unsupervised e-health supported neuromuscular training program in combination with usual care in general practice compared to usual care alone in patients with acute ankle sprains in general practice. Method/Design: This study is a multi-center, open-label randomized controlled trial, with a one-year follow-up. Patients with an acute lateral ankle sprain, aged between 14 and 65 years and visiting the GP within three weeks of injury are eligible for inclusion. Patients will be randomized in two study groups. The intervention group will receive, in addition to usual care, a standardized eight-week neuromuscular training program guided by an App. The control group will receive usual care in general practice alone. The primary outcome of this study is the total number of ankle sprain recurrences reported during one year follow-up. Secondary outcomes are subjective recovery after one year follow-up, pain at rest and during activity, function, return to sport, cost-effectiveness and compliance of the intervention. Measurements will take place monthly for the study period of 12 months after baseline measurement. Discussion: For general practitioners the treatment of acute ankle sprains is a challenge. A neuromuscular training program that has proven to be effective for athletes might be a direct treatment tool for acute ankle sprains in general practice. Positive results of this randomized controlled trial can lead to changes in practice guidelines for general practitioners. In addition, since this training program is e-health supported, positive results can also lead to a novel way of injury prevention. Trial registration: Dutch Trial Registration: NTR 4765...|$|E
40|$|Background: Approximately 2. 2 billion (2200 million) of {{the world}} {{population}} {{are living in the}} area with Iodine deficiency (ID), most of them in the developing countries. In IRAN about 2 million are exposed to Iodine deficiency. Most of the complications of ID are not curable, especially brain damage. On the other hand, adding iodine to daily salt is a suitable program for decreasing iodine deficiency. This has been the main aim of IDD National committee since 1986. This study is a before‑after <b>preventive</b> <b>trial,</b> and was conducted to determine the effect of iodized salt in preventing the disorders of Iodine deficiency. Methods: This study was a preventive field trial in 2 stages before and after prevention. Since 1995, Iodized salt has been distributed in Tabas in Yazd province. Sample of 2, 150 students aged 6 ‑ 18 years were chosen by stratified cluster random sampling method from 24 schools, 12 schools from rural and 12 from urban areas. Goiter frequency and educational status were determined using WHO criteria and mean scored, respectively. Results: Prevalence of goiter has decreased from 34 to 25 percent after 10 years (P < 0. 001). The prevalence in urban areas has decreased from 35. 8 to 23. 5 percent and in rural from 35. 6 to 28. 5 percent (P = 0. 02). Prevalence of Goiter has changed from 32. 8 to 20 percent and from 39. 5 to 31. 5 in boys and girls, respectively (P < 0. 001). There was a statistically significant relation between educational status and goiter frequency before and after prevention (P = 0. 01). There was also a statistically significant relation between educational status in 2 stages, before and after intervention (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Although, there are some confounding variables, such as: educational resources development, improved educational methods, and enhanced family emphasis on extracurricular education, increased frequency of students in higher education after intervention shows the iodine effects on mental function...|$|E
40|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} element whose significance to health is increasingly appreciated. In 1961 essentiality of zinc for humans was recognized. A systematic literature search was done to identify relevant studies investigating the role of zinc in human health. This review concerns the importance of zinc in health {{and the consequences of}} its deficiency. Zinc deficiency leads to complications of pregnancy and childbirth, low birth weight and poor growth in childhood, reduced immunocompetence, and increased infectious disease morbidity. Pregnant women with zinc deficiency are at risk of premature labour and miscarriages, inefficient labour and delivery, stillbirths, lower mental ability of the child, retarded foetal growth and low immunity of both mother and baby. Zinc can reduce the duration, severity and incidence of diarrhoea in children. Zinc deficiency was indicated as a risk factor for immune deficiency and susceptibility to infection in the elderly. Zinc is used in <b>preventive</b> <b>trials</b> and treatment of diarrhoea, pneumonia, common cold, respiratory infections and malaria. Sufficient zinc is essential in maintaining immune system function. Supplementation of zinc and with other micronutrients may be beneficial during periods of greatest vulnerability such as early childhood, pregnancy and elderly. Ensuring adequate levels of zinc intake should be a key component in efforts to reduce illness...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of breast cancer}} risk is important in determination of personalized breast cancer prevention strategy and evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} intervention drugs. In this thesis, two MR imaging biomarkers, parenchyma volume and parenchyma enhancement were proposed, quantified and tested their abilities to assess the breast cancer risk. This thesis is a sub-study of a pre-existing two-armed, double-blinded clinical trial in which patients were randomized into one treatment group receiving tamoxifen daily for one year and placebo group receiving no treatment and received repeated MRI scans every 6 months for 2 years. The quantification of these biomarkers involves developing a quantitative analyzing pipeline. The test of the association between the biomarker and breast cancer risk changes was performed by comparing the mean response of the biomarker over time between groups. The results showed that the parenchyma enhancement rate in the treatment group decreases significantly compared with placebo group; the parenchyma volume in treatment group decreases more quickly than that in placebo group but was not statistically significant at p-value level of 0. 05. The conclusion of this thesis is these MR imaging biomarkers are correlated with breast cancer risk changes and have the potential to be surrogate endpoints for breast cancer <b>preventive</b> <b>trials.</b> ...|$|R
