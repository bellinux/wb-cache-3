Consequently, {{merchant}} marine officers and seamen, both veterans and beginners, are hired for voyages through union hiring halls or directly by shipping companies. Hiring halls rank the candidates by the length of time the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> out of work and fill open slots accordingly. Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports.|$|E

25|$|When {{the immune}} system of a {{vertebrate}} encounters a virus, it may produce specific antibodies which bind to the virus and neutralize its infectivity or mark it for destruction. Antibody presence in blood serum {{is often used to}} determine whether a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> exposed to a given virus in the past, with tests such as ELISA. Vaccinations protect against viral diseases, in part, by eliciting the production of antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, specific to the virus, are also used for detection, as in fluorescence microscopy.|$|E
