40|$|<b>Purge</b> {{operation}} {{is an effective}} way to remove the accumulated liquid water in the anode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This paper studies the phenomenon of the two-phase now as well as the pressure drop fluctuation inside the flow field of a single cell during the <b>purge</b> process. The flow patterns are identified as intermittent <b>purge</b> and annular <b>purge,</b> and the two <b>purge</b> processes are contrastively analyzed and discussed. The intermittent <b>purge</b> greatly affects the fuel cell performance and thus it is not suitable for the in situ application. The annular <b>purge</b> process requires a higher pressure drop, and the critical pressure drop is calculated from the annular <b>purge</b> model. Furthermore, this value is quantitatively analyzed and validated by experiments. The results show that the annular <b>purge</b> is appropriate for removing liquid water out of the anode in the fuel cell. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Presented is a {{nonlinear}} {{model of}} a, lean NOx trap with applications to diagnostics {{and to a}} lean burn engine control strategy for <b>purging</b> NO x from a trap. A lean NOx trap <b>purging</b> strategy is proposed based on a fundamental understanding of trap behavior and {{a model of the}} propagating transient reductant front through the trap during <b>purge.</b> ^ <b>Purging</b> a lean NOx trap of NOx emissions is challenging for several reasons. First, the engine air/fuel ratio must be controlled such that lean and rich operation are possible. Secondly, spark ignition engine torque changes with air/fuel ratio. Therefore, engine torque control is necessary for lean burn applications. Thirdly, the engine a. ir/fuel ratio <b>purge</b> profile, which determines the rich exhaust gas profile used to <b>purge</b> the lean NO x trap, must accomplish two goals. The profile must be designed such that the fuel economy penalty, during <b>purge,</b> is minimized to ensure the overall fuel economy during both lean and rich operation is maximized. In addition, the <b>purge</b> profile must send reductant to reduce NOx and oxygen stored in the trap without excessive tailpipe emissions. The focus of this work is the development of a lean NOx trap model to be used in conjunction with a model based <b>purge</b> profile which meets the aforementioned goals. ^ The <b>purge</b> profile proposed in this work is based on the development of a nonlinear lean NOx trap <b>purge</b> model. The model includes critical <b>purging</b> phenomena such as NOx storage and release dynamics, NO x and oxygen reduction dynamics, and includes an on-line stored oxygen estimate. A first principle based chemical model describing the reduction of NOx during <b>purge</b> forms the fundamental lean NOx trap <b>purge</b> model. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are considered the most effective reductants and a method of estimating exhaust gas hydrogen content downstream of a catalyst is presented. Validation of the NOx <b>purge</b> model is achieved through engine dynamometer experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To further refine our {{understanding}} of impulsivity, obsessions, and compulsions in anorexia nervosa (AN) by isolating which behaviours [...] binge eating, <b>purging,</b> or both [...] are associated with these features.

RESULTS: <b>Purging,</b> but not binge eating, was associated with higher scores on impulsivity, obsessions, and compulsions. <b>Purging</b> was also associated with worst eating rituals and with worst eating preoccupations.
