2500|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> {{views the}} rights of an {{individual}} to self-determination. This is rooted in society's respect for individuals' ability {{to make informed decisions}} about personal matters. Autonomy has become more important as social values have shifted to define medical quality in terms of outcomes that are important to the patient rather than medical professionals. The increasing importance of autonomy can [...] be seen as a social reaction to a [...] "paternalistic" [...] tradition within healthcare. Some have questioned whether the backlash against historically excessive paternalism in favor of patient autonomy has inhibited the proper use of soft paternalism to the detriment of outcomes for some patients. Respect for autonomy is the basis for informed consent and advance directives.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{effect of}} this [...] "most disgraceful event in Greek history", as Will Durant {{characterized}} it, was the establishment of Sparta in a formalized position {{at the top of}} a Greek political system enforced by the Great King. [...] Using their mandate to protect and enforce the peace, the Spartans proceeded to launch a number of campaigns against poleis that they perceived as political threats. Near at hand, they forced the city of Mantinea in Arcadia, to disband into its constituent villages. The largest intervention was a campaign in 382 BC to break up the federalist Chalcidian League in northeastern Greece, as violating the autonomy principle of the Great King's decree. [...] On the way there, in 383 the Spartan commander Phoebidas, invited by a pro-Spartan faction, seized the Theban Kadmeia (the Theban acropolis) and left a Laconophile oligarchy supported by a Spartan garrison; even the pro-Spartan Xenophon could only attribute the act to madness. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> proved to be a flexible tool in the hand of a hegemonic power.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1895, Duncan {{was elected}} {{secretary}} of the Granite Cutters' National Union. He was also named {{the editor of the}} union's journal, the Granite Cutters' Journal. He moved the union's headquarters to Quincy, Massachusetts in 1900, where he took up residence. The Granite Cutters' National Union had been organized in 1877 as the Granite Cutters' International Union of the United States and the British Provinces of America. The union's founder and first president was Thompson H. Murch, of Maine. He was elected to Congress in 1878, and was replaced by Josiah B. Dyer. Dyer moved the union's headquarters from Maine to Concord, New Hampshire. The union was, at best, a loose federation of largely independent locals. Although it claimed jurisdiction over and had locals in Canada, the Canadian members were an afterthought to the union. In 1880, the union changed its name to the Granite Cutters' National Union and changed its constitution to reduce its jurisdiction to the United States. During his first few years in office, Duncan proposed and won passage of numerous amendments to the union's constitution, forming the Granite Cutters' National Union {{into one of the most}} effective unions in the country. He was not, however, a supporter of civil rights for African Americans. Duncan negotiated several contracts in the Deep South which required employers to fire black granite cutters and hire Caucasian ones. [...] When the American Federation of Labor (AFL) later complained about the agreements, Duncan strongly defended them and invoked the AFL's <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> for member unions in defense. The matter was dropped.|$|E
2500|$|The Formula of Autonomy takes {{something}} important {{from both the}} Formula for the Universal Law of Nature and the Formula of Humanity. The Formula for the Universal Law of Nature involves thinking about your maxim {{as if it were}} an objective law, while the Formula of Humanity is more subjective and is concerned with how you are treating the person with whom you are interacting. The Formula of Autonomy combines the objectivity of the former with the subjectivity of the latter and suggests that the agent ask what she would accept as a universal law. To do this, she would test her maxims against the moral law that she has legislated. The <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> is, “the principle of every human will as a will universally legislating through all its maxims.” (4:432) Kant thinks that the Formula of Autonomy yields another “fruitful concept,” the kingdom of ends. The kingdom of ends is the “systematic union” of all ends in themselves (rational agents) and the ends that they set. All ends that rational agents set have a price and can be exchanged for one another. Ends in themselves, however, have dignity and have no equivalent. In addition to being the basis for the Formula of Autonomy and the kingdom of ends, autonomy itself plays an important role in Kant’s moral philosophy. Autonomy is the capacity to be the legislator of the moral law, in other words, to give the moral law to oneself. Autonomy is opposed to heteronomy, which consists of having one’s will determined by forces alien to it. Because alien forces could only determine our actions contingently, Kant believes that autonomy is the only basis for a non-contingent moral law. It is in failing to see this distinction that Kant believes his predecessors have failed: their theories have all been heteronomous. [...] At this point Kant has given us a picture of what a universal and necessary law would look like should it exist. However, he has yet to prove that it does exist, or, in other words, that it applies to us. That is the task of Section III.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the best}} {{speakers}} in the House, though not {{at that time in}} the cabinet, was making an admirably warm and convinced defence alike of the policy and the bill while these proceedings were going on. But Mr. Fowler was listened to by men of pre-occupied minds. All knew what (M123) momentous business was on foot {{in another part of the}} parliamentary precincts. Many in the ranks were confident that abstention would carry the day. Others knew that the meeting had been summoned for no such purpose, and they made sure that the conveners would have their way. The quiet inside the House was intense and unnatural. As at last the news of the determination upstairs to vote against the bill ran along the benches before the speaker sat down, men knew that the ministerial day was lost. It was estimated by the heads of the “Chamberlain group” that if they abstained, the bill would pass by a majority of five. Such a bill carried by such a majority could of course not have proceeded much further. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> would have been saved, and time would have been secured for deliberation upon a new plan. More than once Mr. Gladstone observed that no decision taken from the beginning of the crisis to the end was either more incomprehensible or more disastrous.|$|E

60|$|The {{centre of}} {{interest}} lay in the course that might be finally taken by those who declared that they accepted {{the principle of the}} bill, but demurred upon detail. It was upon the group led from Birmingham that the issue hung. “There are two principles in the bill,” said Mr. Chamberlain at this time, “which I regard as vital. The first is the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy,</b> to which I am able to give a hearty assent. The second is involved in the method of giving effect to this autonomy. In the bill the government have proceeded on the lines of separation or of colonial independence, whereas, in my humble judgment, they should have adopted the principle of federation as the only one in accordance with democratic aspirations and experience.”(207) He was even so strong for autonomy, that he was ready to face all the immense difficulties of federation, whether on the Canadian or some other pattern, rather than lose autonomy. Yet he was ready to slay the bill that made autonomy possible. To kill the bill was to kill autonomy. To say that they would go to the country on the plan, and not on the principle, was idle. If the election were to go against the government, that would destroy not only the plan which they disliked, but the principle of which they declared that they warmly approved. The new government that would in that case come into existence, would certainly have nothing to say either to plan or principle.|$|E

40|$|As an {{important}} labor market institution, collective bargaining plays {{an important}} role in resolving labor conflicts, regulating parties’ interests and adjusting working conditions. But current Labor Law only provide limited regulations on how to resolve the dispute during bargaining, namely, there are merely two paths of mutual consultation and coordination with the Government. The limitation of current resolution regulation lies mainly in three aspects: invalidation of construction between party autonomy and national compulsory intervention, no regulation of the relationship among government coordination, arbitration, and litigation, no explicit provisions of the relationship between collective bargaining and industrial conflict.
