Small generators are sometimes used to provide electricity to power tools at construction sites. Trailer-mounted generators supply temporary installations of lighting, sound amplification systems, amusement rides etc. You can use a wattage chart to calculate the estimated power usage for different types of equipment {{to determine how many}} watts are necessary in a portable generator. Trailer-mounted generators or mobile generators, diesel generators are also used for emergencies or backup where either a redundant system is required or no generator is on site. To make the hookup faster and safer, a tie-in panel is frequently installed near the building switchgear that contains connectors such as camlocks. The tie-in panel may also contain a <b>phase</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>indicator</b> (for 3-phase systems) and a circuit breaker. Camlock connectors are rated for 400 amps up to 480-volt systems and used with 4/0 type W cable connecting to the generator. Tie-in panel designs are common between 200- and 3000-amp applications.|$|E

This research examines the short-term impact of a one-time addition of compost on the soil health in a rainfed dryland organic winter-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fallow system. Field plot experiments were established in 2015 in a semiarid dryland organic wheat field in Snowville, Utah with the following treatments: control (C), compost at 12. 5 Mg/ha dry weight (CM 1), 25 Mg/ha (CM 2), 50 Mg/ha (CM 3), positive control 25 Mg compost + 40 lb N feather meal (PC), and 2 Mg chicken manure (CMU). Soil samples were taken in May 2016 {{at a depth of}} 0 - 10 cm from the plots in the wheat <b>phase</b> of the <b>rotation.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of soil health and fertility were determined such as microbial biomass C, enzyme activities involved in the cycling of C and P, total organic carbon and nitrogen determined. The application of compost appeared to promote microbial activities with the greatest effect at CM 3. Acid and alkaline phosphatase enzyme activities significantly increased by as much as 61 % and 47 % respectively. Microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase enzyme activity, readily mineralizable carbon, total organic carbon and total nitrogen were highest at CM 3. Based on our findings so far, compost addition stimulated soil microbial activities and boosted organic C and N in the surface layers of the soil.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a cyclic prefixed conjugate transmission technique with adaptive receiver {{to cancel out}} the ICI in OFDM systems using MMSE equalizer. The receiver design {{is based on the}} phase rotated conjugate cancellation (PRCC) concept, where two individual <b>phase</b> <b>rotations</b> are employed on the two receive paths, rather than only one <b>phase</b> <b>rotation</b> is adopted for the two transmit paths in the PRCC scheme. Cyclic prefix increases signal spacing and makes the signal more robust to ISI. The two <b>phase</b> <b>rotations</b> are chosen properly using the criterion of maximizing the carrier-to-interference ratio such that an additional phase distortion on the detected symbol could be completely removed. Block least mean-squared algorithm is applied to adaptively update the two <b>phase</b> <b>rotations</b> with the frequency offset variation. BER performance of the proposed method with MMSE and Zero Forcing Equalizer is compared. Simulation results shows that MMSE equalizer based approach can further improve the performance of proposed scheme at low to medium SNRs...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} closed-form {{precoding}} schemes with optimal performance for constructive interference (CI) exploitation in the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink. We first consider an optimization where we maximize {{the distance between}} the constructive region and the detection thresholds. The cases of both strict and non-strict <b>phase</b> <b>rotation</b> are considered and can further be formulated as convex optimization problems. For optimization with strict <b>phase</b> <b>rotation,</b> we mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure with Lagrangian and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. By formulating its dual problem, the optimization problem is further shown to be equivalent to a quadratic programming (QP) over a simplex, which can be solved more efficiently. We then extend our analysis to the case of non-strict <b>phase</b> <b>rotation,</b> where it is mathematically shown that a K-dimensional optimization for non-strict <b>phase</b> <b>rotation</b> is equivalent to a 2 K-dimensional optimization for strict <b>phase</b> <b>rotation</b> in terms of the problem formulation. The connection with the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) precoding is also discussed. Based on the above analysis, we further propose an iterative closed-form scheme to obtain the optimal beamforming matrix, where within each iteration a closed-form solution can be obtained. Numerical results validate our analysis and the optimality of the proposed iterative scheme, and further show that the proposed closed-form scheme is more efficient than the conventional QP algorithms with interior-point methods, which motivates the use of CI beamforming in practical wireless systems.
