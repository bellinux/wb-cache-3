40|$|<b>Posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> is a {{major source}} of {{disability}} following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a common cause of medically-intractable epilepsy. Previous attempts to prevent the development of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> with treatments administered immediately following TBI have failed. Recently, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) pathway has been implicated in mechanisms of epileptogenesis and the mTORC 1 inhibitor, rapamycin, has been proposed to have antiepileptogenic effects in preventing some types of epilepsy. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that rapamycin has antiepileptogenic actions in preventing the development of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in an animal model of TBI. A detailed characterization of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in the mouse controlled cortical impact model was first performed using continuous video-EEG monitoring for 16 weeks following TBI. Controlled cortical impact injury caused immediate hyperactivation of the mTORC 1 pathway lasting at least one week, which was reversed by rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin decreased neuronal degeneration and mossy fiber sprouting, although the effect on mossy fiber sprouting was reversible after stopping rapamycin and did not directly correlate with inhibition of epileptogenesis. Most posttraumatic seizures occurred greater than 10 weeks after TBI, and rapamycin treatment for one month after TBI decreased the seizure frequency and rate of developing <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> during the entire 16 week monitoring session.

An animal model of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> that reliably reproduces the clinical sequelae of human {{traumatic brain}} injury is essential to identify the molecular and cellular substrates of posttraumatic epileptogenesis, and perform preclinical screening of new antiepileptogenic compounds. We studied the electrophysiologic, behavioral, and structural features of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> induced by severe, non-penetrating lateral fluid-percussion brain injury in rats. Data from two independent experiments indicated that 43 % to 50 % of injured animals developed epilepsy, with a latency period between 7 weeks to 1 year.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) greatly {{increases}} the risk {{for a number of}} mental health problems {{and is one of the}} most common causes of medically intractable epilepsy in humans. Several models of TBI have been developed to investigate the relationship between trauma, seizures, and epilepsy-related changes in neural circuit function. These studies have shown that the brain initiates immediate neuronal and glial responses following an injury, usually leading to significant cell loss in areas of the injured brain. Over time, long-term changes in the organization of neural circuits, particularly in neocortex and hippocampus, lead to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission and increased risk for spontaneous seizures. These include alterations to inhibitory interneurons and formation of new, excessive recurrent excitatory synaptic connectivity. Here, we review in vivo models of TBI as well as key cellular mechanisms of synaptic reorganization associated with <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> The potential role of inflammation and increased blood brain barrier permeability in the pathophysiology of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> is also discussed.

40|$|D’Ambrosio and Miller {{argue that}} brief (i. e., {{one to a}} few seconds), rhythmic {{electrographic}} events accompanied by behavioral arrest, which they have observed in rats after lateral fluid percussion (i. e., in an animal model of traumatic brain injury), should be considered seizures in this model of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (1). A counter argument is that these events are not characteristic of the seizures seen clinically in <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> or in other forms of acquired epilepsy. Furthermore, several types of brief, rhythmic activity can be recorded in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of animals and humans without epilepsy.

We hypothesized that TBI-induced inflammation likely contributes to seizure development. We assessed whether genetic variation in the interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 b) gene, IL- 1 b levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, and CSF/serum IL- 1 b ratios would predict PTE development post-TBI. Methods: We investigated PTE development in 256 Caucasian adults with moderate-to-severe TBI. IL- 1 b tagging and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped.

40|$|Aims: Among the {{antiepileptic}} drugs (AEDs) {{applied for}} secondary prophylaxis of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (PTE), carbamazepine (CBZ) may cause severe {{side effects and}} worsen traumatic brain injury (TBI). Presentation of Case: Two days after a bicycle accident causing severe TBI, a 23 yo female developed a questionable seizure and received CBZ. Since then she required substitution of sodium. Six days after the accident she was extubated. Serum sodium was 123 mmol/l. One day after transfer to the general ward, she was found comatose with a serum sodium of 114 mmol/l. Cerebral CT showed diffuse cerebral edema. Electroencephalography did not record paroxysmal activity. After replacement of CBZ by levetiracetam, her condition markedly improved with a favourable outcome. Discussion and Conclusion: CBZ was made responsible for severe hyponatraemia in the presented case after exclusion of all other possible causes. Hyponatraemia may trigger the recurrence of cerebral edema after TBI. Hyponatraemia from CBZ may favourably respond to slow substitution of sodium with physiologic saline. CBZ for secondary prophylaxis of PTE may cause hyponatraemia, cerebral edema, and deterioration of pre-existing TBI. Replacement of CBZ by levetiracetame may resolve the condition.

40|$|Human <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (PTE) {{is highly}} heterogeneous, ranging from mild remitting to {{progressive}} disabling forms. PTE results in simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures {{with a wide}} spectrum of durations and semiologies. PTE variability is thought to depend on the heteroge-neity of head injury and patient’s age, gender, and genetic background. To better understand the role of these factors, we investigated the seizures resulting from calibrated fluid percussion injury (FPI) to adolescent male Sprague [...] Dawley rats with video electrocorticography. We show that PTE incidence and the frequency and severity of chronic seizures depend on the location and severity of FPI. The frontal neocortex was more prone to epileptogenesis than the parietal and occipital, generating earlier, longer, and more frequent partial seizures. A prominent limbic focus developed in most animals, regardless of parameters of injury. Remarkably, even with carefully controlled injury parameters, including type, severity, and location, the duration of posttraumatic apnea and the age and gender of outbred rats, there was great subject-to-subject variability in frequency, duration, and rate of progression of seizures, indicating that other factors, likely the subjects ’ genetic background and physiological states, have critical roles in determining the characteristics of PTE...|$|E

There was no difference of age (P= 0. 53), gender male (P= 1. 00), presence of focal lesion on head CT (P= 0. 89), hypotension (P= 0. 28), and hypoxia (P= 0. 15). Mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was significantly lower in patients of ESG than DSG (8. 75 and 11. 7, resp., P= 0. 02). There {{was no difference between}} the groups in relation to death (P= 0. 13), unfavourable outcome (P= 0. 41), late <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (P= 0. 64), and smell-and-taste disturbances (P= 1. 00). Only one patient (3. 5 %) evolved meningitis during follow-up. Conclusion. We found no difference between the ESG and DSG in respect to death, unfavourable outcome, LPE, and STD...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is one of}} the leading causes of death and {{disability}} around the world. The lack of validated biomarkers for TBI is a major impediment to developing effective therapies and improving clinical practice, as well as stimulating much work in this area. In this review, we focus on different settings of TBI management where blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers could be utilized for predicting clinically-relevant consequences and guiding management decisions. Requirements that the biomarker must fulfill differ based on the intended context of use (CoU). Specifically, we focus on fluid biomarkers in order to: (1) identify patients who may require acute neuroimaging (cranial computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (2) select patients at risk for secondary brain injury processes; (3) aid in counseling patients about their symptoms at discharge; (4) identify patients at risk for developing postconcussive syndrome (PCS), <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (PTE) or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); (5) predict outcomes with respect to poor or good recovery; (6) inform counseling as to return to work (RTW) or to play. Despite significant advances already made from biomarker-based studies of TBI, there is an immediate need for further large-scale studies focused on identifying and innovating sensitive and reliable TBI biomarkers. These studies should be designed with the intended CoU in mind...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{synaptic}} inhibition is {{an important}} factor contributing to posttraumatic epileptogenesis. Axonal sprouting and enhanced excitatory synaptic connectivity onto rodent layer V pyramidal (Pyr) neurons occur in epileptogenic partially isolated (undercut) neo-cortex. To determine if enhanced excitation also affects inhibitory circuits, we used laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate and whole-cell recordings from GAD 67 -GFP [...] expressing mouse fast spiking (FS) interneurons and Pyr cells in control and undercut in vitro slices to map excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Results are 1) the region-normalized excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes and proportion of uncaging sites from which EPSCs could be evoked (hotspot ratio) ‘‘increased’’ significantly in FS cells of undercut slices; 2) in contrast, these parameters were significantly ‘‘decreased’ ’ for inhibitory postsy-naptic currents (IPSCs) in undercut FS cells; and 3) in rat layer V Pyr neurons, we found significant decreases in IPSCs in undercut versus control Pyr neurons. The decreases were mainly located in layers II and IV, suggesting a reduction in the efficacy of interlaminar synaptic inhibition. Results suggest that there is significant synaptic reorganization in this model of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> resulting in increased excitatory drive and reduced inhibitory input to FS interneurons that should enhance their inhibitory output and, in part, offset similar alterations in innervation of Pyr cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (PTE) usually {{develops}} {{in a small}} percentage of patients of traumatic brain injury after a varying latent period. Modeling this chronic neurological condition in rodents is time consuming and inefficient, which constitutes a significant obstacle in studying its mechanism and discovering novel therapeutics for its prevention and treatment. Partially isolated neocortex, or undercut, is known to induce cortical hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity in vitro, and has been used extensively for studying the neurophysiological mechanism of posttraumatic epileptogenesis. However, whether the undercut lesion in rodents causes chronic epileptic seizures has not been systematically characterized. Here we used a miniature telemetry system to continuously monitor electroencephalography (EEG) in adult C 57 BL mice for up to 3 months after undercut surgery. We found that 50 % of animals developed spontaneous seizures between 16 - 50 days after injury. The mean seizure duration was 8. 9 ± 3. 6 seconds, and the average seizure frequency was 0. 17 ± 0. 17 times per day. There was no progression in seizure frequency and duration over the recording period. Video monitoring revealed behavioral arrests and clonic limb movement during seizure attacks. A pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) test further showed increased seizure susceptibility in the undercut mice. We conclude that undercut lesion in mice is a model of chronic PTE that involves spontaneous epileptic seizures...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of animal models of {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) are already available for studies on mechanisms and experimental treatments of TBI. Immediate and early seizures have been described {{in many of these}} models with focal or mixed type (both gray and white matter damage) injury. Recent long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring studies have demonstrated that TBI produced by lateral fluid-percussion injury in rats results in the development of late seizures, that is, epilepsy. These animals develop hippocampal alterations that are well described in status epilepticus-induced spontaneous seizure models and human <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (PTE). In addition, these rats have damage ipsilaterally in the cortical injury site and thalamus. Although studies in the trauma field provide a large amount of information about the molecular and cellular alterations corresponding to the immediate and early phases of PTE, chronic studies relevant to the epileptogenesis phase are sparse. Moreover, despite the multiple preclinical pharmacologic and cell therapy trials, there is no information available describing whether these therapeutic approaches aimed at improving posttraumatic recovery would also affect the development of lowered seizure threshold and epilepsy. To make progress, there is an obvious need for information exchange between the trauma and epilepsy fields. In addition, the inclusion of epilepsy as an outcome measure in preclinical trials aiming at improving somatomotor and cognitive recovery after TBI would provide valuable information about possible new avenues for antiepileptogenic interventions and disease modification after TBI. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Levetiracetam-induced rage {{is a rare}} neurobehavioral {{adverse effect}} of {{levetiracetam}} that is characterized by seething rage, uncontrollable anger, fits of fury, depression, violence, and suicidal tendencies. It occurs more in patients with prior mood or psychotic disturbances. No such case {{has been reported in}} Nigeria. Method: We report two cases of levetiracetam-induced rage. The first patient was a 29 -year-old male with a 14 -year history of intractable <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> He was initially placed on sodium valproate and phenobarbitone and later had phenobarbitone replaced with levetiracetam. Within the first week of initiating levetiracetam, he became aggressive, bursted into fits of fury, and attacked his siblings. Levetiracetam was stopped, and the seething rage ceased only to reappear when it was reintroduced; hence, the complete withdrawal of levetiracetam. Naranjo probability score for adverse drug reaction was 8. Results: The second patient was a 23 -year-old lady who developed seething rage and made several attempts to kill herself with a knife following addition of levetiracetam to the clonazepam and carbamazepine that she was taking for treatment-resistant epilepsy. Withdrawal and reintroduction of levetiracetam by the relatives led to cessation and reemergence, respectively, of the rage and suicidal tendencies. Naranjo score was 8. Levetiracetam was discontinued. Conclusion: Neuropsychiatric evaluation for prior mood or psychiatric disorders in those initiating levetiracetam therapy is suggested alongside monitoring for early features of levetiracetam-induced rage by both caregivers and physicians. This will help stem the morbidity and potential mortality associated with this life-threatening adverse drug reaction...|$|E
