2500|$|A {{commonly}} proposed {{approach to}} ensuring fail-safe beam targeting {{is to use}} a retrodirective phased array antenna/rectenna. A [...] "pilot" [...] microwave beam emitted {{from the center of the}} rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave <b>power</b> <b>beam</b> is automatically defocused. Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its <b>power</b> <b>beam</b> anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.|$|E

40|$|Laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> {{from the}} Earth's surface is an {{innovative}} and potentially cost-effective option for reliably providing electrical power for {{applications such as}} space transportation, Earth-orbiting satellites, and lunar development. The maturation of laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> technology can support low power applications such as upgraded conventional communications satellites in the present decade. <b>Power</b> <b>beaming</b> systems to support extensive lunar base operations that may consume extremely large amounts of power can be implemented early in the 21 st century. The synergistic advantages of high-thrust, high specific-impulse electric propulsion may make enhanced, low cost space logistics an area of unique significance for laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming.</b> Economic forces will continue as a driving factor {{in the selection of}} major system elements for both commercial applications as well as the avant-garde national space missions envisioned for the 21 st century. As a result, the implementation of laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> systems will only take place if they can demonstrate clear economic benefits without sacrificing performance, personnel safety, or the environment. Similarly, the development activities that are a necessary precursor to any operational system will take place only if key industry and government leaders perceive laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> systems as an achievable goal with realistic payoffs in comparison to competing energy options. This paper summarizes NASA's current research to evaluate laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> systems as they apply to applications of greatest interest, and it includes a summary of the current laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> program within the NASA Headquarters Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology. This research effort will quantify some key technical certainties and uncertainties pertaining to laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> systems appropriate for space applications as well as establish a path of development that includes maturation of key technology components for reliable laser and millimeter wave <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> systems during the 1990 's.

50|$|In a <b>Power</b> <b>Beam</b> Challenge, {{each team}} designs and builds a climber (a machine capable of {{traveling}} {{up and down}} a tether ribbon). In a Tether challenge, each team attempts to build the longest and strongest cable. In the <b>Power</b> <b>Beam</b> challenge climber carry a payload. Power is beamed from a transmitter to a receiver on the climber. With each competition, the tethers reach higher altitudes, and the climbers are expected to climb further. Each competition can have minimum lengths and maximum weight per meter for cables, and minimum speed and distance goals for climbers.|$|E
50|$|The {{games are}} divided into two categories: the <b>Power</b> <b>Beam</b> Challenge and the Tether Challenge. In the <b>Power</b> <b>Beam</b> Challenge, each team designs and builds a climber (a machine capable of {{traveling}} {{up and down a}} tether ribbon). The climber must carry a payload.

50|$|There are two <b>power</b> <b>beams,</b> which {{originate}} {{in the region of}} Jupiter and are directed towards the Sun. They are out of the plane of Jupiter's orbit so that they are never intercepted by another planet or asteroid; they are reflected to Earth, one directed to the Eastern Bloc and one to the West.

25|$|Laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> was {{envisioned by}} some at NASA as a {{stepping}} stone to further industrialization of space. In the 1980s, researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space <b>power</b> <b>beaming,</b> focusing primarily {{on the development of}} a solar-powered laser. In 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space. In 1991 the SELENE project (SpacE Laser ENErgy) had begun, which included the study of laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> for supplying <b>power</b> to a lunar base. The SELENE program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.|$|R
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>Beam</b> {{competitions}} {{were held}} in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009. They were directed at space elevator applications. Teams built mechanical devices (climbers) that could propel themselves up a vertical cable. The power supply for the device was not self-contained but remained on the ground. The technical challenge was to transmit the power to the climber and transform it into mechanical motion, efficiently and reliably.|$|E

25|$|Power {{transmission}} via {{radio waves}} {{can be made}} more directional, allowing longer-distance <b>power</b> <b>beaming,</b> with shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, typically in the microwave range. A rectenna {{may be used to}} convert the microwave energy back into electricity. Rectenna conversion efficiencies exceeding 95% have been realized. <b>Power</b> <b>beaming</b> using microwaves has been proposed for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth and the <b>beaming</b> of <b>power</b> to spacecraft leaving orbit has been considered.|$|R
50|$|Wireless energy {{transfer}} such as laser <b>power</b> <b>beaming</b> is currently {{considered the most}} likely method. Using megawatt powered free electron or solid state lasers in combination with adaptive mirrors approximately 10 m wide and a photovoltaic array on the climber tuned to the laser frequency for efficiency. For climber designs <b>powered</b> by <b>power</b> <b>beaming,</b> this efficiency is an important design goal. Unused energy {{would need to be}} re-radiated away with heat-dissipation systems, which add to weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{radiation}} pattern {{referred to above}} is usually the horizontal {{radiation pattern}}, which is plotted {{as a function of}} azimuth about the antenna, although the vertical radiation pattern may also have a main lobe. The beamwidth of the antenna is the width of the main lobe, usually specified by the half <b>power</b> <b>beam</b> width (HPBW), the angle encompassed between the points {{on the side of the}} lobe where the power has fallen to half (-3 dB) of its maximum value.|$|E
50|$|The {{accidents}} {{occurred when}} the high-power electron beam was activated instead of the intended low <b>power</b> <b>beam,</b> and without the beam spreader plate rotated into place. Previous models had hardware interlocks in place to prevent this, but Therac-25 had removed them, depending instead on software interlocks for safety. The software interlock could fail due to a race condition. The defect was as follows: a one-byte counter in a testing routine frequently overflowed; if an operator provided manual input to the machine at the precise moment that this counter overflowed, the interlock would fail.|$|E
50|$|This was a {{competition}} {{to build a}} wirelessly-powered ribbon-climbing robot. The contest involves having the robot lift a large payload within a limited timeframe. The first competition in 2005 would have awarded US$50,000, US$20,000, and US$10,000 to the three best-performing teams, meeting the minimum benchmark of 1 m/s. However, no team met this standard, with only two teams climbing under beam power. This prize also increased to US$200,000 in 2006, but no team was able to accomplish the full set of requirements.
