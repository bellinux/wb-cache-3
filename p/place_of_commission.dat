Regional Trial Courts shall have jurisdiction over cases involving violations of the Act.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with sexual}} {{violence}} against women, sexual violence against men can take different forms, and occur {{in any kind}} of context, including at home or in the workplace, in prisons and police custody, and during war and in the military. The practice of sexually assaulting males is not confined to any geographical area of the world or its <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>commission,</b> and occurs irrespective of the victim’s age. The various forms of sexual violence directed against males include rape, enforced sterilization, enforced masturbation, and genital violence. Sexual violence against males also encompasses emasculation, which can take place through [...] "feminization" [...] or [...] "homosexualization" [...] of the victim, and the prevention of procreation.|$|E

40|$|A {{taxonomy}} of alibis is proposed involving {{two forms of}} supporting proof: physical evidence and person evidence. Levels of physical evidence and person evidence were combined to create 12 cells in the taxonomy. Participants (n D 252), who were asked to {{assume the role of}} detectives, evaluated alibis representing these 12 cells. The believ-ability of the alibis generally followed the taxonomy’s predicted pattern, but physical evidence, when present, tended to overwhelm the person evidence more than had been expected. In addition, alibi evaluators seemed to not consider the possibility that a stranger who corroborated an alibi might be mistaken about the identity of the person. Trait inferences regarding the alibi providers tended to follow the believability data, even when the traits themselves were not relevant to believability of the alibi. We call {{for the development of a}} literature on the psychology of alibis, recommend the taxonomy as a framework, and suggest several avenues of inquiry. KEY WORDS: alibi, alibi witness, corroborator, alibi provider, belief. Alibi; n. A plea of having been at the time of the commission of an act elsewhere than at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>commission...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{multifaceted}} {{process of}} identifying and proving the infringement {{of intellectual property}} rights is further complicated and aggravated in the so-called analogue environment. The development of Information Technologies {{has given rise to}} a new set of problems. The digital technology has facilitated the infringement of intellectual property rights and additionally aggravated the process of proving these infringements. Hence, it is the duty of digital forensics to identify relevant (valid) evidence and present it in the court of law, which is not an easy task. In that course, the problems are twofold: legal and technical. First of all, the legislation in many countries is not adjusted to resolving the issues constantly emerging in the digital environment and there are apparent differences in the manner of regulating these issues. On the other hand, there is no standardized and unified technology which would provide for a uniform qualification and comprehensive treatment of these issues. Moreover, the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> of these criminal offences as a rule does not coincide with the place of occurring legal consequences. Yet, in spite of all these difficulties, there are technological methods and tools which facilitate the detection of cybercrime and provide evidence for securing relevant punishment. In the time to come, the developments in this area are expected to be aimed at strengthening the protection of legitimate interests of holders of intellectual property rights...|$|E
