5000|$|Early {{commercial}} LCR bridges used {{a variety}} of techniques involving the matching or [...] "nulling" [...] of two signals derived from a single source. The first signal was generated by applying the test signal to the unknown and the second signal was generated by using a combination of known-value R and C standards. The signals were summed through a detector (normally a <b>panel</b> <b>meter</b> with or without some level of amplification). When zero current was noted by changing the value of the standards and looking for a [...] "null" [...] in the <b>panel</b> <b>meter,</b> it could be assumed that the current magnitude through the unknown was equal to that of the standard and that the phase was exactly the reverse (180 degrees apart). The combination of standards selected could be arranged to read out C and DF directly which was the precise value of the unknown. An example of this is the GenRad/IET Labs Model 1620 and 1621 Capacitance Bridges.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{evaluations}} of the DT- 236 /PD U. S. Army battlefield personnel dosimeter were performed at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) from the summer of 1984 to the spring of 1985. This personnel dosimetry system is being procured by the U. S. Army for use by combat forces in theaters of operation where tactical nuclear weapons could be used. In operation, the wristwatch-style dosimeter is worn by a soldier to record both instantaneous and residual gamma and neutron radiations that are released from the detonation of a nuclear weapon, plus gamma radiation from fallout. The dosimeter contains a block of radiophotoluminescent glass as the gamma detector and a silicon diode as the neutron detector. Properties of these detectors have been described in various review articles (1). The reader unit simultaneously evaluates both of the radiation detectors and presents a total dose reading on a <b>panel</b> <b>meter.</b> Earlier tests of this dosimetry system at the U. S.
