5|$|The Bold Orion missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 199B (WS-199B), was a {{prototype}} air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) developed by Martin Aircraft during the 1950s. Developed in both one- and two-stage designs, the missile was moderately successful in testing, and helped <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way for development of the GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. In addition, the Bold Orion was used in early anti-satellite weapons testing, performing the first interception of a satellite by a missile.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} argument, {{the decision}} to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market, which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay {{fiber optic cable}} paid the town {{to pass through the}} former corridor. The town used part of its payment to <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E

5|$|During the 1999 Marlboro 500 CART race, Canadian driver Greg Moore {{died in a}} crash {{along the}} backstretch of the track. It was {{determined}} that after sliding along the infield grass, Moore's car hit the edge of oncoming pavement, which caused the car to flip into a concrete retaining wall. The incident prompted the track owners, ISC, to <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> backstretch of both Auto Club Speedway and its sister track Michigan International Speedway {{in an attempt to}} prevent a similar accident. Shortly after the crash, CART mandated the use of a head-and-neck restraint system on all ovals. The rule eventually became mandatory on all tracks.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Shawangunk, Montgomery and the Walden began {{applying}} for over $600,000 in TEA-21 grants {{to create a}} paved, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)-accessible trail between Walden and Wallkill. The total cost of paving the trail {{was expected to be}} $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten their privacy.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} {{following}} PedroII's majority in 1840, however, that the Academy became a powerhouse, {{part of the}} Emperor's greater scheme of fomenting a national culture and consequently uniting all Brazilians in a common sense of nationhood. PedroII would sponsor the Brazilian culture through several public institutions funded by the government (not restricted to the Academy of Fine Arts), such as Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute and Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera. That sponsorship would <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way {{not only for the}} careers of artists, but also for those engaged in other fields, including historians such as Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen and musicians such as the operatic composer Antônio Carlos Gomes.|$|E

Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious state, however, {{in the two}} civil wars that were caused by the clash between generals Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla starting from 88 BC. In the Battle of the Colline Gate at the very door {{of the city of}} Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The trail, {{like the}} Wallkill Valley Rail Trail to the north, {{is part of}} the former Wallkill Valley Railroad's rail corridor.

The portion of the trail in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former town supervisor Jesse McHugh. Plans to <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> trail between Walden and Wallkill were discussed since 2001, and the route was finally paved between 2008 and 2009.

5|$|As {{one of the}} {{earliest}} shooting games, it set precedents and helped <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers, in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes {{published}} The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.|$|E
