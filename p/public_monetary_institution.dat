What better place to discuss the international financial architecture than in Venice, the pinnacle of brilliant architecture. My home town, Amsterdam, sometimes called the Venice of the north, also combines water and outstanding architecture, but in a more sober manner. And it is in a sober, if not rather somber, fashion that I will discuss the the international financial architecture (IFA). My main focus will be on the existing framework of the IFA and the challenges for the future, but I also consider it instructive to explain how we got where we are now. Hence, the reference to yesterday, today and tomorrow. Central bankers are not a jolly lot, and having spent my entire career working at <b>public</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions,</b> I wish right from the start to make clear that I belong to the school that views the pangs of renewed exuberance that can be detected, especially {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic, with some skepticism. There is probably still a long way to go before the advanced Western countries will see unempoyment coming down. I also belong to the school of thought that believes that a major overhaul of the international financial system is very much needed if we want to avoid anther big mess in about ten years time...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews central banks’ {{legal reform}} in Latin America during the 1990 s and {{discusses}} {{the status of}} central bank independence in the region. Based on this information, it builds a simplified index of central bank independence which, {{in addition to the}} commonly used criteria of political and economic independence, incorporates provisions of central banks’ financial autonomy, accountability, and lender-of-last-resort. The paper finds a moderate negative correlation between increased central bank independence and inflation during 1999 – 2001 in 14 Latin American countries. Dissagregating the index, the same analysis suggests that economic independence is the key component driving the observed negative correlation between legal central bank independence and inflation.

This paper analyses how internal and external exchange rate flexibility affect macroeconomic adjustment in EMU and non-EMU countries. To do so, a model is constructed in which three countries interact: two countries that decide to form a monetary union and a third country that does not participate in the monetary union. Numerical simulations of a representative example are used to characterise the adjustment dynamics induced by monetary and fiscal policies before and after the start of the EMU...|$|R

The paper identifies four broad principles of central bank autonomy that have been shared by the majority of countries.
