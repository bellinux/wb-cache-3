In 2010, 250 {{of the total}} 320 {{personnel}} worked in Park Protection and Conservation, mostly male due to {{the rigors of the}} job, based at twelve ranger stations. This number is inadequate given the size of the territory to be patrolled.

5000|$|The term is {{frequently}} used in for deliberately <b>qualifying</b> <b>poorly</b> at short track racing events. Some tracks/series start the fastest qualifiers {{at the rear}} of the field and the slowest qualifiers at the front of the field. So faster cars sometimes deliberately <b>qualify</b> <b>poorly</b> so they have to pass fewer cars (and only slower cars). To counteract sandbagging, tracks and series often invert some of the fastest qualifiers and start slower cars behind them. The number of cars to be inverted are typically not known to the drivers as they qualify, and often the fastest qualifier (who wins a cash bonus) will typically participate in a random drawing to determine the number of inverted cars after qualifying has concluded. Other tracks give bonus points to the fastest qualifier(s), which can drastically affect end of season awards. Still other tracks use [...] "passing points" [...] to reward the most cars passed in a heat race with a better chance to advance to the feature.|$|R

60|$|These two {{printers}} I found <b>poorly</b> <b>qualified</b> {{for their}} business. Bradford had been bred to it, {{and was very}} illiterate; and Keimer, though something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of presswork. He {{had been one of}} the French prophets, and could act their enthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess any particular religion, but something of all on occasion; was very ignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of the knave in his composition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford's while I worked with him. He had a house, indeed, but without furniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and my chest of clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first happened to see me eating my roll in the street.|$|E

The following race in Singapore, Button <b>qualified</b> <b>poorly</b> in 12th but performed much better on race day to take fifth place; Barrichello could manage only sixth. With three races and 30 points remaining, this put Button 15 points {{ahead of his}} teammate and 25 ahead of Vettel, with Webber now unable to win. A week later at the Japanese Grand Prix, the Brawn GP cars struggled again, Barrichello and Button finishing seventh and eighth respectively.|$|R

However, after the Lotus GP drivers opted to sit out the practice session for the second round to conserve tires, Gutiérrez <b>qualified</b> <b>poorly</b> in 14th due to the difference in conditions, but eventually made up enough places to score a point with tenth, and then finished fourth in the sprint race. At the race in Catalunya, he managed another double points-scoring result with tenth and seventh-place finishes, and also the fastest lap in the feature race.|$|R
6000|$|... but no clamour at {{all about}} our {{national}} waste of inventive talent, our mean standard of intellectual attainment, our disingenuous criticism, and the consequent failure to distinguish men of the quality needed {{to carry on the}} modern type of war. Almost universally we have the wrong men in our places of responsibility and the right men in no place at all, almost universally we have <b>poorly</b> <b>qualified,</b> hesitating, and resentful subordinates, because our criticism is worthless and, so habitually as to be now almost unconsciously, dishonest. Germany is beating England in every matter upon which competition is possible, because she attended sedulously to her collective mind for sixty pregnant years, because in spite of tremendous defects she is still far more anxious for quality in achievement than we are. I remember saying that in my paper. From that, I remember, I went on to an image that had flashed into my mind. [...] "The British Empire," [...] I said, [...] "is like some of those early vertebrated monsters, the Brontosaurus and the Atlantosaurus and such-like; it sacrifices intellect to character; its backbone, that is to say,--especially in the visceral region--is bigger than its cranium. It's no accident that things are so. We've worked for backbone. We brag about backbone, and if the joints are anchylosed so much the better. We're still but only half awake to our error.

5000|$|A foot injury forced Gusmeroli {{out of the}} 1999-2000 Grand Prix season. She made a {{coaching}} change, moving from Didier Lucine to Stanislav Leonovitch. Debuting a free skate to the Legends of the Fall soundtrack, Gusmeroli won her first French National Championship and finished 4th at the Japan Open in January 2000. At the European Championships in Vienna, Gusmeroli skated well in all three portions of the competition, concluding her free skate in tears. She finished in 4th place overall because of her placement in the qualifying round. At the 2000 World Championships in Nice, Gusmeroli skated <b>poorly</b> in the <b>qualifying</b> group and lost her chance at a medal but her short and free programs moved her up into 4th overall.|$|R
5|$|The 1966 world {{championship}} season opened with the Monaco Grand Prix. Brabham {{was affected by}} a cold, and <b>qualified</b> <b>poorly</b> before retiring when the BT19's gearbox failed. Surtees led the race in his Ferrari before his differential failed on lap 15; the race was won by Jackie Stewart in a 2-litre BRM P261. At the following Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit, Brabham survived an enormous 135miles per hour (215km/h) slide in the rain on the first lap. The shower eliminated half the field, including Stewart, who would miss the next race with his injuries. The BT19, using Goodyear tyres that were not suited to the conditions, came home fourth of five classified finishers. Surtees won the race for Ferrari, the last before he quit the Italian team.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Andy Roxburgh {{took charge}} of Scotland for the 1988 European Championship {{qualifying}} section. Scotland performed <b>poorly</b> in the <b>qualifying</b> group, although an away victory against Bulgaria handed qualification to the Republic of Ireland. Following this failure, Scotland regrouped for the 1990 World Cup and qualified narrowly. They beat France 2-0 at Hampden Park in heavy rain, with Mo Johnston scoring twice. Scotland looked on course to qualify comfortably, but they then lost heavily in both France and Yugoslavia, leaving them needing to avoid defeat at home to Norway in the final game. Scotland were leading 1-0 when a bad error from goalkeeper Jim Leighton allowed the Norwegians to equalise. Had the Norwegians scored again, Scotland would have been out, but the 65,000 crowd {{breathed a sigh of}} relief when the final whistle went.|$|R

Season 2008-09 saw a further improvement in the league position with Penicuik finishing in fourth place. Penicuik’s best performance in the local cup competitions was reaching the semi final of the St. Michael’s Cup only to lose out at home to Linlithgow Rose in a penalty shoot out. However the following season, Penicuik started <b>poorly.</b> Failure to <b>qualify</b> from the sectional league cup was followed by a first round knock out in the Scottish Junior cup. A run of only one win in seven league matches before an enforced break for bad weather saw Penicuik drop into second bottom spot in the Premier League. McKean resigned in December 2009 {{and was replaced}} by the duo of the then club captain Craig Meikle, and former player Brian Ryrie.|$|R

Rosenqvist held the lead {{for the rest of}} the race and crossed the start/finish line after 44 laps to secure his (and Mahindra's) first victory in Formula E. Elsewhere in the field, after <b>qualifying</b> <b>poorly</b> which meant he started down the field, Buemi was able to recover ground and finished fifth on the road, but was later disqualified after the first race because it was discovered in post-race scrutineering determined that all four tyres on both his cars were below the minimum mandated pressure of [...] with both Buemi and Renault e.Dams co-owner Alain Prost speaking of their disappointment over the decision but chose to switch their attention towards the second race.|$|R

On the opening lap of race one, Lowndes made contact with both Garth Tander and James Courtney before being spun into the wall by Will Davison, failing to finish a race {{for the first time}} since 2012. Lowndes and Davison both received points penalties for their roles in each incident, while Todd Kelly also received a points penalty for an incident with Jack Perkins. Lowndes' teammate Jamie Whincup capitalised to win the race ahead of a recovering Tander and Davison. Tander went on to win the second race with Courtney in second place, while polesitter Fabian Coulthard finished third. Lowndes had more problems on Sunday, with a grid penalty dropping him from first to third on the grid, gifting pole to Jason Bright, before an overheating engine dropped him to twenty-third position. Whincup won again, with Tander in second and Shane Van Gisbergen in third. Championship leader Mark Winterbottom <b>qualified</b> <b>poorly</b> during the weekend, but managed to finish in the top ten in two of the races to maintain his series lead, with Whincup moving up to second, 96 points behind, and Lowndes dropping to sixth behind Coulthard, Van Gisbergen and Courtney.|$|R

50|$|During the 1996 season, Speed {{earned his}} first career NASCAR pole, albeit in a non-points event, the Winston Open. At the Miller 400 at Michigan, the {{normally}} {{blue and yellow}} Spam Ford was graced in red, white and gold in honor of 50 years of Melling's parts company being in operation. Speed and the Melling Racing team notched an eighth at Pocono in the Miller 500. Speed stunned everyone in qualifying for the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis with a third-place effort. During the race, Speed made a daring three-wide pass to take the lead. The finishing order saw Speed finish 13th after leading two laps. At the second race in Michigan, the GM Goodwrench Dealer 400, Speed led seven laps and looked poised to possibly capture his second NASCAR Winston Cup victory before getting {{caught up in a}} wreck started by Sterling Marlin. Though Speed <b>qualified</b> <b>poorly</b> for the Southern 500, he quickly moved his way through the field. Just as he neared running in the top ten, a right front tire cut and Lake had to pit under the green flag, losing two laps. However, the strength of the car would prove itself as Speed worked his way back to finish 10th, the final top ten finish of his career.|$|R
50|$|James Moffat {{took his}} first win and the maiden victory for Nissan Motorsport in the 60/60 Sprint race at Winton, Nissan's first win in an Australian Touring Car Championship or V8 Supercar race since 1992. His {{teammate}} Michael Caruso, who led {{the first half of}} the race, finished in second with Jason Bright completing the podium for Brad Jones Racing. Controversy surrounded Moffat's victory, however, as the two Nissans used an E70 fuel blend (compared to the usual E85) in an effort to evaluate its potential in balancing fuel economy between the engines used by Nissan and Erebus Motorsport and those used by Ford and Holden. Championship leader and pole-sitter Jamie Whincup encountered a gearbox problem while leading, forcing his retirement. Whincup's troubles continued in the second race, involved in a first lap crash after <b>qualifying</b> <b>poorly.</b> The crash also affected Caruso, Alex Davison, Russell Ingall, Alexandre Prémat and Garth Tander. Mark Winterbottom won the race for Ford Performance Racing, ahead of pole-sitter Bright and James Courtney. Courtney started on pole for the final race and went on to win ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Chaz Mostert. The race saw differing strategies with many drivers pitting for fresh tyres during a late safety car period and then making their way through the field.|$|R

In Belgium, Edwards outqualified Hill {{for the first}} time, starting 21st and 29th respectively. Both cars finished a race {{for the first time}} as Hill finished eighth (two laps down) and Edwards 12th (three laps down). [...] At Monaco, Hill qualified 19th and Edwards 24th, but the race proved to be the most successful yet, the team narrowly missing out on their first Championship points with Hill in seventh and Edwards eighth, again two and three laps down respectively. The team went one better in Sweden after starting 15th and 18th, with a point for Hill as he finished sixth (the last point of his career), with Edwards seventh. Both cars were only one lap adrift of winner Jody Scheckter. Edwards again outqualified Hill at the Dutch Grand Prix as they started 14th and 19th, but the race ended in retirement for both cars, Hill with gearbox failure and Edwards with fuel system failure.

50|$|The Holden Racing Team's Garth Tander {{took his}} second win {{of the season}} in the 60/60 Sprint race at Phillip Island, ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Alex Davison, who scored his first podium of the season. The race {{included}} on a controversial incident between Craig Lowndes and Mark Winterbottom, who came together while battling for the lead on the last lap {{of the first half of}} the race, resulting in the pair dropping to fifteenth and fifth places respectively. Other incidents during the first half allowed Jamie Whincup, who had <b>qualified</b> <b>poorly,</b> to move up to sixth place. Whincup would go on to finish fourth in the race to retake the championship lead while Winterbottom finished fifth and Lowndes recovered to eighth. The race was marred by a major accident involving Alexandre Prémat and James Courtney. Prémat had a tyre failure going into turn three before sliding across the damp grass and hitting the driver's door of Courtney's car, causing significant damage to both cars while Courtney also suffered slight tissue damage on his right leg. Triple Eight Race Engineering dominated Sunday's races, with Lowndes winning the first race ahead of teammate Whincup and Shane Van Gisbergen. Whincup went on to win the final race ahead of Winterbottom and Lowndes. This left Whincup with a 20-point lead over Lowndes in the championship heading into the final round, with Winterbottom 124 points off the lead.|$|R
