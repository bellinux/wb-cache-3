The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th century, and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910. This included restoring a pitched roof and adding new aisles, although the nave arches are original. In 1935, a new two manual Harrison & Harrison organ was installed, a fine example of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>action</b> instrument. Recent years have seen the construction of several new facilities, such as the Bricstan room extension. The church lists itself as being of the low church branch of the Church of England. The church also hosts the town's Catholic congregation.|$|E

5000|$|The 1980s {{followed}} with a specialization in the restoration sector. Ever {{since the end of}} the 1970s, restoring valve chest organs and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actions</b> had become fashionable again. In the fight against timber worm and other natural enemies more environmental friendly and material safe techniques, such as gassing, were being used.Also in the 1980s, the company concentrated in voicing in the Southern German baroque style. This characteristic of the instruments was enhanced by restoring old baroque organ pipes. However, organs with a strong, [...] "romantic"-like sound were also inherited.In 1988 the company moved to a larger and more modern workshop and prepared to change leadership. Positive developments under master organ builder Hans-Georg Vleugels (born in Stuttgart 1958) shaped organ building in Hardheim in the 1990s and into the 21st century: ...|$|R

2500|$|The organ {{was built}} by Henry Willis and {{completed}} in 1855 with 100speaking stops across four manual divisions (of non-standard compass, 63notes GG to a) and pedals (30notes). It comprised a total of 119ranks of pipes, plus 10couplers, 10composition pedals, and 36pistons to set combinations of stops. It was initially tuned to meantone temperament to the specification of S.S.Wesley but in 1867 W.T.Best, city organist, retuned it to equal temperament. [...] The organ was rebuilt in 1896 when the key action was changed from the Willis-Barker lever assisted tracker (i.e. pneumatic assisted mechanical) action to <b>pneumatic</b> <b>action.</b> Also the manual compass was changed to the now standard CC to c, 61notes, making the bottom 5pipes on every manual stop redundant.|$|E

25|$|The {{electro-pneumatic}} {{action was}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, and {{is considered by many}} to be the single most significant development in pipe organs. Up to the turn of the 20th century, all pipe organs were operated by a tracker, tubular pneumatic, or <b>pneumatic</b> Barker-lever <b>action,</b> where the keys and pedals were physically connected to the pipe valves via wooden trackers, except in the case of tubular <b>pneumatic,</b> where all <b>actions</b> were operated by air pressure. Hope-Jones' electro-pneumatic action eliminated this by using wind pressure, controlled by electric solenoids, to operate the pipe valves, and solenoids and pistons to control and operate the various stop tabs, controls, keys and pedals on the console. This action allowed the console to be physically detached from the organ. All signals from the console were transmitted by an electric cable to an electro-pneumatic relay, and from there to the pipes and effects in the organ chambers.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} foot blowing gear {{required the}} services of four men to raise sufficient wind. With the advent of modern technology, it was unsurprising that, in 1894, the Leeds firm of Abbott and Smith {{replaced it with a}} Shipley gas engine and compressor. At the same time, a new organ console was provided with a <b>pneumatic</b> stop <b>action.</b> The Schulze key actions and the borrowed Solo manual remained. They also converted the pedal <b>action</b> to <b>pneumatic</b> operation, with the new supply of wind allowing the addition of thumb pistons and other gadgetry.|$|R

This was soon followed by {{the restoration of the}} George Fincham organs at Church of All Nations (1876, 2/13), Carlton and Trinity Uniting (1884, 2/14), Brighton in 1992, and in 1993 Victoria's prime historic organ at St Mary Star of the Sea (1899, 3/38) West Melbourne.|$|E
50|$|Pipe organ {{manufacturing}} in Hardheim has existed since 1855, when organ-builder Ignaz DÃ¶rr startet his own workshop. In 1958 Orgelbaumeister Hans Theodor Vleugels (born 1931) took over Maximilian Bader's workshop {{and two years}} later his brother's Wilhelm Bader. From 1960 to 1966 Paul Mund and Hans Theodor Vleugels led the company together. In 1967 Hans Theodor Vleugels founded the Orgelbau-Vleugels GmbH. While following traditional south German models, the company initially built instruments incorporationg modern technologies such as electric stop action. Cases had very contemporary designs, such as the organ in Cologne-Gremberg, set on a mushroom-shaped concrete pedestal, or in another organ that has free hanging steel frame with plexiglass used for the swell box and rollerboards, thus enabling a free view into the workings of the instrument. During the 1970s the firm abandoned the use of tropical woods and laminates in favour of solid woods, and electric action likewise was discarded in favor of mechanical action. While continuing to build new organs in the 1980s the firm began to devote attention to the restoration of older instruments, including organs of the South German Baroque, and Romantic instruments with valve chests and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actions.</b> in 1988 the company moved into a large, open, and modern shop; that same year, Hans-Georg Vleugels (born in Stuttgart in 1958) became director of the firm. In 1991 Hans-Georg Vleugels took over the company chair and currently runs the company together with his son Johannes D.C. Vleugels (born 1983) {{in the second and third}} generation. Today there are three generations of master pipe organ builders in the Vleugels family working together.|$|R
25|$|For a {{mechanical}} tracker action and its couplers to operate under these higher wind pressures, pneumatic assistance {{provided by the}} Barker lever was required, which CavaillÃ©-Coll included in his larger instruments. This device {{made it possible to}} couple all the manuals together and play on the full organ without expending a great deal of effort. He also invented an ingenious <b>pneumatic</b> combination <b>action</b> system for his five-manual organ at Ã‰glise Saint-Sulpice, Paris. All these innovations allowed a seamless crescendo from pianissimo all the way to fortissimo, something never before possible on the organ. His organ at the Basilique Ste-Clotilde, Paris (proclaimed a basilica by Pope Leo XIII in 1897) {{was one of the first}} to be built with several of these new features. Consequently, it influenced CÃ©sar Franck, who was the titular organist there. The organ works of Franck have inspired generations of organist-composers who came after him.|$|R
5000|$|The use of <b>pneumatic</b> and {{electric}} <b>actions</b> were introduced during this period, as the specifications and voicing became {{determined by the}} tonal and musical ideals of the romantic period. Innovations by Gustav Rieger included combined registers â€” using [...] "extension" [...] to get two stops out of one rank â€” and free stop-combination based on a mechanical action (used on the 1890 concert organ at the Deutsches Haus, Brno). There were 1072 organs on the firm's opus-list {{by the end of}} 1903, which saw the death of Otto and the end of an era.|$|R

In 1805, after Rotunda had been broken up, the great reeds were taken out and the organ taken to Evesham.This organ was replaced as part of the Victorian restoration of the church. In 1875 a new organ, built by Nicholson with 3 manual positions and a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>action,</b> was installed in the new organ loft.In 1904, as a memorial of the foundation of Evesham Abbey (701) and the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901), the organ was enlarged and improved by the addition of a third manual <b>pneumatic</b> <b>action</b> and extra stops. In 1967 the organ was significantly enlarged by Nicholson. In 1991 the organ was significantly rebuilt by Nicholson, now with electronic controls and a mobile console.|$|E

Then in 1874, Carl Schuricht performed the organ restoration; however, no further details are recorded. In 1902 Berlin based company of brothers Oswald and Paul Dinse carried out further reconstruction of the organ, introducing a <b>pneumatic</b> tracker <b>action</b> and {{reducing the number of}} registers to 14 (2 manuals and a pedal).When, between the years 1934-1935, Joseph Goebel was restoring the great organ, he also took care of the choir organ.

50|$|During the Romantic era, {{technological}} advances allowed new features {{to be added}} to the organ, increasing its potential for expression. The work of the French organ builder Aristide CavaillÃ©-Coll in particular represented a great leap in organ building. CavaillÃ©-Coll refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters. He invented an ingenious <b>pneumatic</b> combination <b>action</b> system for his five-manual organ at Saint-Sulpice. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing (final regulation of the pitch and tone) techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe, and the flute. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils, allowing for the use of higher wind pressures. For a mechanical tracker action to operate under these higher wind pressures, pneumatic assistance provided by the Barker lever was required, which CavaillÃ©-Coll included in his larger instruments. This pneumatic assist made it possible to couple all the manuals together and play on the full organ without expending a great deal of effort. All these innovations allowed the organist to execute a seamless crescendo from pianissimo all the way to fortissimo: something that had never before been possible by the organ. Composers were now able to write music for the organ which mirrored that played by the symphony orchestra. For this reason, both the organs and the literature of this time period are considered symphonic.|$|R
