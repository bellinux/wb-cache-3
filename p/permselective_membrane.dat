In designing sensors, interference from non-glucose analytes can be minimized by use of filtration membranes or electron transfer mediators that allow polarization at low potentials. If oxygen is required for the enzymatic reaction with glucose, then the outer <b>permselective</b> <b>membrane</b> must have substantial oxygen permeability. For this reason, during development of permselective membranes, permeability studies (such as performed by Tipnis and colleagues in this issue) can be used to measure transport of glucose and oxygen and optimize membrane structure. Tipnis and colleagues present a novel biosensor based with separate layers for glucose-oxygen permselectivity, enzymatic conversion, and avoidance of interference. They also address sensor stability, in part by comparing sensor function during ascending vs descending glucose levels. By measuring the difference, they were able to minimize this aspect of instability (hysterisis), which assisted them in selecting a promising <b>permselective</b> <b>membrane</b> based on iron and humic acid...|$|E

In this process that depends on reversible reactions, the yield is usually limited by the establishment of thermodynamic equilibrium in the reactor. The styrene yield can be increased by using a hybrid process, with reaction and separation simultaneously. It is proposed using <b>permselective</b> composite <b>membrane</b> to remove hydrogen and thus suppress the reverse and secondary reactions. This paper describes the simulation of a dehydrogenation process carried out in a tubular fixed-bed reactor wrapped in a <b>permselective</b> composite <b>membrane.</b> A mathematical model was developed, incorporating the various mass transport mechanisms found in each of the membrane layers and in the catalytic fixed bed. The effects of the reactor feed conditions (temperature, steam-to-oil ratio, and the weight hourly space velocity), the fixed-bed geometry (length, diameter, and volume), and the membrane geometry (thickness of the layers) on the styrene yield were analyzed.

Transplantation of islets of Langerhans by their infusion into vascularized organs is an experimental clinical protocol, the first approach to attain cure. However, it is associated with lifelong use of immunosuppressants. To overcome the need for immunosuppression, islets are encapsulated and separated from the host immune system by a <b>permselective</b> <b>membrane.</b> The lead material for this application is alginate which was tested in many animal models and a few clinical trials. This review discusses all aspects related to the function of transplanted encapsulated islets such as the basic requirements from a <b>permselective</b> <b>membrane</b> (e. g., allowable hydrodynamic radii, implications of {{the thickness of the}} membrane and relative electrical charge). Another aspect involves adequate oxygen supply, which is essential for survival/performance of transplanted islets, especially when using large retrievable macro-capsules implanted in poorly oxygenated sites like the subcutis. Notably, islets can survive under low oxygen tension and are physiologically active at > 40 Torr. Surprisingly, when densely crowded, islets are fully functional under hyperoxic pressure of up to 500 Torr (> 300 % of atmospheric oxygen tension). The review also addresses an additional category of requirements for optimal performance of transplanted islets, named auxiliary technologies. These include control of inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and the intra-capsular environment.

In systems with <b>permselective</b> electronegative <b>membranes</b> and KCl solutions, the electroosmotic water transport was 16 moles/faraday.

40|$|A {{membrane}} reactor is potentially superior to conventional reactors such as, plug flow, continuous stirred tank, and batch reactors. Both, catalysis and product enrichment, can be effected {{by the use}} of an appropriate set of permselective and catalytic membranes. Previous {{membrane reactor}} experiments have employed synthetic membranes which are most suitable for mild operating conditions, such as those found in biological and biochemical processes. For this reason, a relevant enzymatic reaction was sought to demonstrate the practical application of membrane reactors. Because of its industrial importance in the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins, the enzymatic deacylation of benzylpenicillin to produce 6 -aminopenicillanic acid was chosen as a candidate reaction system. ^ The membrane reactor studied consists of a two-layer composite of permselective and catalytic membranes. Reactant diffuses from a feed compartment through the permselective film into the catalytic membrane. The reaction product exits the membrane composite through a product compartment adjacent to the catalytic film. The <b>permselective</b> <b>membrane</b> is chosen such that it rejects the backdiffusion of product into the feed compartment. An immobilized liquid membrane (ILM) is used as the perm-selective film. Permeation of anionic species through the ILM is achieved by introducing a carrier species capable of forming ion-pairs which are soluble in the organic solvent confined in the liquid membrane. The use of this mode of transport has been incorporated into an integral membrane reactor model to predict reactor performance. The analysis leads to the realization that this permeation mode is also capable of increasing catalyst effectiveness by the proper modulation of the carrier species concentration {{on either side of the}} membrane composite. ^ The deacylation of benzylpenicillin was successfully conducted in a membrane reactor consisting of a composite of immobilized liquid and catalytic membranes.
