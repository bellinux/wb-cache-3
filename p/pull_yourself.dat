[...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Seventh Fleet's escort {{carriers}} {{found themselves}} {{under attack from}} the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours, a message was received from Admiral Nimitz: [...] "Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders". The tail end of this message, The world wonders, was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat {{on the deck of}} the bridge and began cursing. Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Robert [...] "Mick" [...] Carney, confronted him, telling Halsey [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? <b>Pull</b> <b>yourself</b> together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? <b>Pull</b> <b>yourself</b> together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Welsh {{classical}} singer Katherine Jenkins {{recorded a}} cover version of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] on her 2009 album Believe. Jenkins said: [...] "I'd mentioned that I {{wanted to try}} Evanescence's Bring Me to Life and David [...] said 'you can't sing that'. I came out there questioning my vocal abilities.

[...] Jenkins decided to change the [...] guitar-led and percussive original version and instead, [...] "make it more orchestral with the percussion coming from the strings." [...] Alfred Hickling of The Guardian gave a mixed review of Jenkins' cover, calling it [...] "histrionic." [...] However, a writer of BBC Online chose her version of the song as a highlight on the album. On October 23, 2009, the song was available for digital download as the second single from Believe. On November 23, 2011, Jenkins sang the song live at the Leicester Square station in London.|$|E

500|$|Feeder {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album Pushing the Senses. The album was seen by Grant as more of an extension to Comfort in Sound, as it focused on the same lyrical themes and musical styles, and also said that it had more of an organic sound, with more upbeat tracks added into the mix. It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with [...] "Frequency" [...] being an example. [...] "Frequency" [...] was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson, while {{for the rest of}} the album, Gil Norton was on production duties. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding". Grant later added [...] "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don't want to give too much away but there's one track called [...] "Bitter Glass". Its quite dark but uplifting too. Its about <b>pulling</b> <b>yourself</b> out of a big hole".|$|R

2500|$|Pushing the Senses {{contains}} {{music in}} the same rock styles featured on Feeder's 2002 album Comfort in Sound, but it focuses more on pianos, rather than a string orchestra. Only [...] "Pain on Pain" [...] on the album mainly used strings, including samples from a mellotron. Frontman Grant Nicholas {{said he did not}} think the album needed them. He also called the album the band's [...] "Recovery album" [...] as he felt he was more at ease writing the songs than he was with Comfort in Sound, after the loss of their drummer Jon Lee, alongside stating that he was inspired by artists such as John Lennon within the piano playing and writing the songs. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London.

500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize {{that we were going to}} make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like <b>pulling</b> <b>yourself</b> out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying.

6000|$|A {{particularly}} objectionable {{thing in}} these water drops, the dabbler insists upon my spying {{at is the}} furious activity of everything you see in them. You look down his wretched tube, and there, bright and yellow with the lamplight in the round field of the microscope, is a perfect riot of living things. Perhaps it's the water he got from Hampstead, and a dozen flat things the shape of shortbreads will be fussing about. They are all quite transparent and colourless, and move about like galleys {{by means of a}} lot of minute oars that stick out all over them. Never a moment's rest. And, presently, one sees that even the green plant threads are wriggling across the field. The dabbler tries to moralise on this in the vein of Charles Kingsley, and infer we have much to learn from these ridiculous creatures; but, so far as I can see, it's a direct incentive to sloth to think how low in the scale of creation these things are, in spite of all their fussing. If they had sat about more and thought, they might be fishing the dabbler out of ponds and examining him instead of his examining them. Your energetic people might do worse things than have a meditative half-hour at the microscope. Then there are green things with a red spot and a tail, that creep about like slugs, and are equally transparent. Euglena viridis the dabbler calls them, which seems unnecessary information. In fact all the things he shows me are transparent. Even the little one-eyed Crustacea, the size of a needle-point, that discredit the name of Cyclops. You can see their digestion and muscle and nerve, and, in fact, everything. It's at least a blessing we are not the same.

It was literally (or littorally) walking down to the shore, and throwing your line into the Atlantic. I should not have known what might take hold of the other end, whether Proteus or another. At any rate, if you could not pull him in, why, you might let him go without being <b>pulled</b> in <b>yourself.</b> And they knew by experience {{that it would be a}} Striped Bass, or perhaps a Cod, for these fishes play along near the shore.|$|R

Bloody Disgusting's Jonathan Barkan called the album [...] "another winner", stating, [...] "Even though Hide and Seek is criminally short, it’s a catchy, addictive album that I found myself spinning {{over and over}} again without caring that I’d already heard the tracks before". D. Gabrielle Jensen of Blogcritics characterized the album as [...] "consistently good from beginning to end, making favorite songs a nearly impossible task"; echoing previous reviews, she commented that the album could have benefited from having 2 or 3 more tracks, and that the album felt like it ended too soon. Comparing the record to their previous albums, Gregory Burkart of FEARnet commented [...] "...you may find <b>yourself</b> <b>pulled</b> to a darker place by the more pensive lyrics and shadowy mood, delivered with less of a wink and a smile than you might be expecting from their previous work". COMA Magazine and ReGen Magazine both gave the album mixed reviews, praising Chibi's [...] "mature" [...] sounding vocals, theme and production, but noted the album still follows a [...] "familiar formula".

5000|$|Ann Nocenti, who co-created Longshot, says of {{his primary}} superhuman trait, [...] "Longshot has access to probabilities and luck.

If you <b>pull</b> probabilities towards <b>yourself,</b> you're {{probably}} taking them away from other people, so it's actually something that he shouldn't even be doing." [...] He was genetically engineered and augmented by magical means to have certain superhuman abilities. The mystical augmentation gave him the ability to affect probability fields through psionic means in order to give himself [...] "good luck" [...] in his activities. This allows incredibly unlikely events to happen in Longshot's favor. This power operates even when Longshot does not consciously will it to do so. This ability is tied into the positive aspects of his personality: should he attempt to use his powers for a selfish or evil act, or should he give up hope, his powers will fail to function or even backfire, giving him bad luck. Echoing Nocenti's words on the adverse side effects of his powers, Longshot's luck is fickle, and can backfire if he overuses it, creating an equal and opposite [...] "bad luck" [...] effect elsewhere, that can affect others or even Longshot himself. Longshot's left eye glows brightly when he uses his superhuman powers.|$|R
40|$|The Liberals {{look like}} a {{political}} party visiting from a foreign country, writes DAVID BURCHELL VISITORS {{from out of state}} (and particularly from that great city on the Yarra) often observe how different NSW politics is. Different from politics elsewhere, is what they mean. But perhaps they also mean different from what politics ought to be, at least as we imagine it. For a start, there’s the radio commentary. Those talkback hosts with their incendiary tongues, and the listeners who complain about everything under the sun - but especially the supposed demise of law and order, the crookedness of politicians everywhere, and declining public morals. Then there’s the frenetic tone of political debate. State parliament used to be affectionately known as The Bearpit - because almost everything seemed to be allowed there. Half-baked attacks on personal character, read off pieces of paper under parliamentary privilege. Outrageous figures claiming to prove that there are almost no police on the beat, or that criminals are hardly ever caught, or that when they are they live in the lap of luxury. Finally, there’s the rancorous tone pervading ethnic politics. The Lebanese Muslim community might as well take up arms and start a civil war tomorrow, for all that it would change some people’s view of them. At the same time, Lebanese Sydneysiders are a formidable political force. And so the state government deplores the activities of some of their members out of one side of its mouth, and goes cap in hand for votes with the other. In fact, you could do worse than describe the business of governing NSW as the politics of the two-sided mouth. If you want to improve conditions in prisons somewhat, be careful to accompany this with thunderous attacks upon the criminal class. If you want to improve funding for community services, match this with a lot of huff and puff about tough love and <b>pulling</b> <b>yourself</b> up by your bootlaces. If you want to trim the budget, conjure up a new and more efficient railway timetable which will make everybody’s trip quicker. If there’s a simple explanation of why Labor has now run NSW for so long - and why, despite many tribulations, it {{will continue to do so}} after 24 March - it’s the party’s skill in the politics of the two-sided mouth. Notoriously, the former premier Bob Carr used to request a transcript of the calls to the city’s leading talkback radio host on his desk for the start of every working day. He wouldn’t listen to the program himself, mind you. (In his personal tastes Carr adored classical music, loathed sport, and used to wash his hands after every bout of flesh-pressing.) But he wanted to keep in constant touch with what was going on it the neighbourhoods. It’s no coincidence that NSW Labor is better at this game than its political rivals, despite the fact that the “shock jocks” lean heavily towards the conservative side of politics. After all, constituency politics in Sydney - as in Chicago or New York - has long been a matter of stitching up majorities out of the ethnic patchwork quilt of an immigrant city. Sympathise with one group in their quarrels with the next, and vice versa. And get all of them - Lebanese, Turks, Vietnamese, Sudanese, whoever - off to the polls before closing time. By the same token, the perennial problems of the NSW Liberal Party are tied up with their limited skills in the politics of broad-mouthedness. On account of Sydney’s peculiar electoral geography, the Liberals’ heartland is locked up in that vast middle-class Anglo ghetto on the city’s North Shore. There are migrant communities there - mostly members of the ethnic Chinese and South East Asian diaspora. But they’re doing well enough for themselves as individuals that they don’t have an urgent need to lobby anybody. Liberal leader Peter Debnam has a private school headmaster’s air of authority, but too often he sounds as if he’s faking it in this street-smart town. By contrast, current NSW premier Morris Iemma has deliberately turned his unassuming, family-man image into a political strength. For all his vaunted literary skills, Carr was an intellectually lazy man, and by the time he left office Labor looked complacent and lacking in ideas. Iemma has been busily distancing himself from the later Carr years, making much of his own community instincts and concerns. He attends football matches like a previous era of politicians used to go to church. And so he’s ridden out a series of nasty political crises - such as an alleged sex-offending minister and a girlfriend-beating MP - with an air of imperturbable calm. In the end, the biggest threat to the Coalition is the NSW Liberal Party itself. Until it broadens its core base beyond the hang-’em-high set, and gets a wider range of types into its branches, it’s doomed to {{look like a}} political party visiting from a foreign country. • David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney, and is associate editor of APO.
