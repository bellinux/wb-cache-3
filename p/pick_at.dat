5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with the first <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. The decision was highly controversial as the fans in Montreal had hoped the team would take francophone star Denis Savard. Wickenheiser's transition to the NHL was difficult; his popularity was harmed by comparisons of his struggles to Savard's immediate success with the Black Hawks. He {{was traded to the}} Blues midway through the 1983–84 season.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2006 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, Kershaw was {{considered}} the top high-school pitcher available. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Kershaw with the seventh overall pick in the draft. He had committed to Texas A University, but turned down the scholarship offer to sign with the Dodgers, with a bonus estimated at $2.3 million. The bonus was the largest to any Dodgers draft <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the time, and was eventually topped by Zach Lee in the 2010 draft.|$|E
5|$|G. tibicen longirostris, the long-billed magpie, {{is found}} across {{northern}} Western Australia, from Shark Bay into the Pilbara. Named in 1903 by Alex Milligan, it is a medium-sized subspecies {{with a long}} thin bill. Milligan speculated the bill may have been adapted for the local conditions, slim fare meaning the birds had to <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> dangerous scorpions and spiders. There is a broad area of hybridisation with the western dorsalis in southern central Western Australia from Shark Bay south to the Murchison River and east to the Great Victoria Desert.|$|E

5|$|After leading DJK Würzburg to {{promotion}} {{and with his}} Abitur and military service behind him, Nowitzki looked to the NBA for his future. Projected to be seventh pick in the 1998 NBA draft, he passed up many college offers and went directly into the NBA as a then-still rare prep-to-pro player. In particular, Rick Pitino and Don Nelson, head coaches of the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks respectively, were highly interested in acquiring him. After a 45-minute private workout with Pitino, where Nowitzki showcased his versatile shooting, rebounding, and passing skills, the Boston coach immediately compared him to Celtics legend Larry Bird; Pitino assured Nowitzki that he would draft him with the Celtics' first-round draft <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> #10.|$|E
5|$|Don McCormack {{was born}} in Omak in 1955. He later entered {{baseball}} and made his major league debut as a catcher with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980, after being chose as fourth round draft <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft. McCormack would end up participating {{in a total of}} five games in the major league between 1980 and 1981 and spent nine years playing in the minor leagues for the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Tigers farm teams. McCormack later managed the Reading Phillies (Eastern League) and served as the bench coach of the Long Island Ducks (Atlantic League) for a short period, but was replaced.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} {{consecutive}} year UConn successfully recruited the top ranked high school player in Elena Delle Donne, but shortly before enrolling at UConn Delle Donne requested a release from her scholarship, giving up basketball {{in order to stay}} closer to home and play volleyball at the University of Delaware; Delle Donne would eventually play basketball at Delaware, having a great college career that culminated in the #2 <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> 2013 WNBA draft. Despite losing Delle Donne the Huskies were ranked #1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from the 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene who recovered from her knee injury.|$|E

5|$|While {{new owner}} Charlie Thomas {{expressed}} interest in renewing with Moses Malone, who had been again chosen as MVP in 1981–82, the Rockets traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for Caldwell Jones, as a declining regional economy made the Rockets unable to pay Malone's salary. When the Rockets finished a league worst 14–68, Celtics coach Bill Fitch was hired to replace outgoing Del Harris, and the team won the first pick of the 1983 NBA draft, used to select Ralph Sampson from the University of Virginia. Sampson had good numbers and was awarded the NBA Rookie of the Year award, but the Rockets still finished last overall, again getting the top <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the upcoming 1984 NBA draft, used to select Hakeem Olajuwon from the University of Houston.|$|E
25|$|The Rangers {{accumulated}} 4 {{first round}} and supplemental round picks for the 2010 draft; the <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> 15, awarded for {{their failure to}} sign Matt Purke from the 2009 pick, their natural <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> 22, and picks 45 and 49 {{from the loss of}} free agents Iván Rodríguez and Marlon Byrd respectively. This was the most 1st round picks the Rangers had acquired since 2007 when the Rangers had 5 1st round picks.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the names}} are given at a child's baptism. Non-Christian, but traditional, Slavic names are usually accepted, but the priest may {{encourage}} parents to <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> least one Christian name. In the past, two Christian names were given to a child so {{that he or she}} had two patron saints instead of just one. At confirmation, people usually adopt yet another (second or third) Christian name, however, it is never used outside church documents.|$|E

25|$|Speculation {{prior to}} the draft {{predicted}} the Rangers would acquire a ‘safe' <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> 15 because if they failed to sign the pick the Rangers would receive no further compensation for the pick. It was also speculated the Rangers would select players expected to be signed close to slot due to financial difficulties with the bankruptcy process and being required to follow the budget the team had set out {{prior to the}} season and approved by MLB.|$|E
25|$|Red Bull {{gained the}} top {{seed in the}} Fiesta Conference but dealt Enrico Villanueva to San Miguel Beermen for Rommel Adducul.

Despite the strong performance of Larry Fonacier {{and the emergence of}} Cyrus Baguio, Red Bull lost to Talk 'N Text led by the strong performance of Mark Cardona in a six-game series.|$|E
25|$|The Canadiens traded Gilmour to the Maple Leafs for a sixth round draft <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the 2003 NHL trade deadline.

Gilmour officially announced his retirement on September 8, 2003 after John Ferguson, Jr. made a public announcement that the Maple Leafs would not re-sign the veteran center.|$|E

The following month, Edmonton selected Nail Yakupov as the first overall <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.

Two Maple Leafs captains were obtained through the draft, Darryl Sittler in the 1970 draft; as well as Wendel Clark in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. The Maple Leafs have had 11 top-five draft picks since the draft's inception in 1963. Two of these picks were the first overall draft pick; Clark in the 1985 draft, and Auston Matthews in the 2016 draft. Timothy Liljegren was the most recent player selected by the Maple Leafs in the first round, using the seventeenth overall <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the 2017 draft.|$|E
25|$|Max tries {{programming}} his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. In {{the middle}} of printing out its picks, Euclid prints out a seemingly random 216-digit number, {{as well as a}} single <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max tosses the printout away. The next morning, he checks the financial pages and sees that the pick Euclid made was accurate. He searches desperately for the printout but cannot find it. Sol becomes unnerved when Max mentions the number, asking if it contained 216 digits. When Max questions him about the number, Sol indicates that he came across it many years ago. He urges Max to slow down and take a break.|$|E

Toronto offered Melky Cabrera a $15.3 million qualifying offer which Cabrera subsequently declined. Cabrera eventually {{signed with the}} Chicago White Sox on December 14, 2014 pending a medical, which he passed the following day. Toronto was compensated with a draft <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} first round. On December 16, Toronto signed Daric Barton to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. Then Brandon Morrow signed with the San Diego Padres on December 16, 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} year's dismal finish {{came with}} one highlight: the {{team won the}} draft lottery and the rights to power forward Elton Brand. Since the team lost Harper, Wennington and Barry in the offseason, Brand and fellow rookie Ron Artest led the team throughout the year, especially after Kukoc missed {{most of the season}} due to injury and was then dealt for a draft <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> the trading deadline. Brand recorded the first 20–10 average for the Bulls since the days of Artis Gilmore. He led all rookies in scoring, rebounds, blocks, field goal percentage and minutes, while Artest led all rookies in steals and finished second on the team in scoring. For his efforts Brand was named 1999–2000 co-Rookie of the Year with Houston's Steve Francis, and to the all-rookie first team, while Artest was named to the all-rookie second team. However, the team established a franchise low at 17–65, second worst in the league.|$|E
25|$|An unusual feeding {{strategy}} {{is that of}} the oxpeckers of Africa. They perch on living animals and glean parasites from the animals' hides. On furry animals, such as buffalo, giraffe, and donkey, these birds run their bills through the fur of the animal, using a scissors-like motion to extract ticks and lice from near the skin. When they pull the insect out {{to the end of the}} fur, they catch it and eat it. (On animals with bare hides, such as rhinoceros and hippopotamus, oxpeckers <b>pick</b> <b>at</b> any open wounds the animals happen to have, consuming blood and pus, and possibly keeping the wounds free of maggots.) Historically, rhinoceros and other large wild mammals have been among the favored hosts, but as the populations of large mammals in the African savanna have declined in modern times, the population and range of both red-billed and yellow-billed oxpecker have also changed, and now the birds will use donkeys and domestic cattle as hosts.|$|E
