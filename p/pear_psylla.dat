50|$|These can {{be traced}} back to the {{mechanisms}} of action, which lead to a wide field of effects, including direct lethality, excitant-repellant behavioral effects, and chemosterilization for the target species. In addition, it generally causes low damage to nontarget species, which is one of the advantages of amitraz. Furthermore, amitraz is especially effective against insects such as spider mites and ticks in their juvenile and resistant forms.For agricultural purposes amitraz is primarily used to control the <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> (Cacopsylla pyricola) on Oregon pear crops and whiteflies and mites on cotton or pear crops.It's also applied to pome fruit, citrus fruit, cotton, stone fruit, bush fruit, strawberries, hops, cucurbits, aubergines, capsicums, tomatoes and ornamental plants to control all stages of tetranychid and eriophyid mites, pear suckers, scale insects, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids and eggs and first instar larvae of lepidoptera.To apply amitraz, various techniques can be used such as an airblast and concentrate spray to pears or by ground boom and aircraft to cotton.Territorial differences in amitraz use depend on the species of mites that infest the crops/trees/etc., the local practice, and the number and size of the pear trees. An infestation e.g. by Tetranychus spp requires higher rates of amitraz. Taking those factors into consideration the application volumes of amitraz have been standardized in terms of maximum spray concentration and in the rate of amitraz per hectare.|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{conservation}} biological control of <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> Cacopsylla pyricola, in the Pacific Northwest, USA. We hypothesized that insecticides applied against the primary insect pest, codling moth Cydia pomonella, negatively impact natural enemies of <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> thus causing outbreaks of this secondary pest. Hence, {{the objective of this}} study was to understand how codling moth management influences the abundance of <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> and its natural enemy complex in pear orchards managed under long-term codling moth mating disruption programs. We conducted this study within a pear orchard that had previously been under seasonal mating disruption for codling moth for eight years. We replicated two treatments, “natural enemy disrupt” (application of two combination sprays of spinetoram plus chlorantraniliprole timed against first-generation codling moth) and “natural enemy non-disrupt” four times in the orchard. Field sampling of psylla and natural enemies (i. e., lacewings, coccinellids, spiders, Campylomma verbasci, syrphid flies, earwigs) revealed that <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> populations remained well below treatment thresholds all season despite the reduced abundance of key <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> natural enemies in the natural enemy disrupt plots compared with the non-disrupt treatment. We speculate that <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> are difficult to disrupt when pear orchards are under long-term codling moth disruption...|$|E
40|$|Pear suckers (Cacopsylla sp. or <b>pear</b> <b>psylla)</b> {{are widely}} {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} pest in pear orchards. Sustainable control of <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> relies on their natural suppression by beneficial arthropods and a well-tuned integration of crop protection treatments. Predatory bugs (Anthocoris sp.) are efficient predators of pear suckers, playing a crucial role in the control of <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> summer generations. However, their poor presence early and late in the season and their high mobility makes it difficult for growers to build up persistent predatory bug populations in their orchards to efficiently control <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> the whole season. Therefore, we investigated alternative natural enemies which potentially play an important role in the suppression of <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> especially during early spring and autumn. To this end, a large-scale monitoring study was executed comprising extensive samplings throughout the year in fourteen pear orchards, and comparing psylla as well as beneficial fauna population developments between organic and IPM pear orchards. Organic orchards clearly displayed a lower <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> pressure correlating with higher proportions of specific predator populations, in particularly velvet mite (Trombidiidae) and spider (Araneae) populations. In addition, predation of C. pyri was verified by PCR-based gut content analysis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 This thesis {{addressed}} {{the potential of}} endemic predaceous and parasitic arthropods of the Hood River Valley, Oregon to suppress the <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> Cacopsylla pyricola F 8 rster. Natural enemies adequately suppressed psylla in three of seven unsprayed orchards of differing vegetational settings, orchard age, and size. Relatively few psylla natural enemies dispersed to unsprayed pear mini-orchards, dspite abundant populations on surrounding noncultivated vegetation. <b>Pear</b> <b>psylla</b> natural enemies were more abundant on arboreal rather than herbaceous non-pear hosts. Selective programs of pear pest control based on diflubenzuron were moderately successful in controlling the <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> with natural enemies aiding in suppression in six of fourteen commercial trials of selective programs. In both unsprayed and commercial pear orchards, late-season psylla densities appeared to be best suppressed when levels of natural enemies were high during early-season. Classification analysis confirmed that orchard site, chemical regime, type (mini- or commercial), and season affected proportions of natural enemies and their <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> prey. Complexes of natural enemies and <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> immatures from commercial orchards where biological control was successfully demonstrated were taxonomically similar. Effective natural enemy complexes in commercial orchards were characterized by earwigs, lacewing larvae, and moderate proportions of <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> immatures during early season and Deraeocoris brevis, earwigs, and lacewings during mid-season. Plagiognathous guttatipes (Uhler) or Diaphnocoris provancheri (Burque) dominated effective natural enemy seasonal complexes at each of two mini-orchards. The functional response to <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> eggs was measured for five predaceous mirids. Functional response parameters differed among species and their life-stages, but all destroyed large numbers of psylla eggs. Further experimental directions {{for the implementation of}} <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> biological control are proposed. General investigative strategies include: (1) augment natural enemies on non-pear vegetation adjacent to the target orchard, and (2) modify the orchard habitat to both encourage natural enemy colonization and allow permanent complexes of natural enemies to develop. Specific tactics include: plant hedgerows of filbert or willow, cultivate snakeflies, introduce Anthocoris nemoralis, adjust early season psylla densities with suitable timing and kind of delayed dormant sprays, using a more effective selective psyllacide, and reduce winter pruning to allow development of natural enemies which overwinter in the egg stage...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Factors {{influencing}} pesticide susceptibility {{and resistance}} were studied in Psylla pyricola Foerster, and its mirid predator, Deraeocoris brevis Knight in the Rogue River Valley, Oregon. Factors studied {{were at the}} biochemical, life history, and population ecology levels. Studies on detoxification enzymes showed that glutathione S-transferase and cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenase activities were ca. 1. 6 -fold higher in susceptible R. brevis than in susceptible <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> however, esterase activity was ca. 5 -fold lower. Esterase activity was ca. 18 -fold higher in resistant <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> than in susceptible D. brevis, however, glutathione S-transferase and cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenase activities were similar. Esterases {{seem to be a}} major factor conferring insecticide resistance in P. Pvricola. Although the detoxification capacities of P. pyricola and D. brevis were quite similar, <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> has developed resistance to many insecticides in the Rogue River Valley, whereas D. brevis has remained susceptible. Biochemical factors may be important in determining the potential of resistance development, however, they are less important in determining the rate at which resistance develops. Computer simulation studies showed that life history and ecological factors are probably of greater importance in determining the rate at which resistance develops in P. pvricola and D. brevis. High fecundity and low immigration of susceptible individuals into selected populations appear to be major factors contributing to rapid resistance development in <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> compared with D. brevis.

40|$|Development and {{behaviour}} of the <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> Psylla pyricola Foerster, were observed under field and laboratory conditions. Bioassay chambers {{were used in}} the laboratory to determine the susceptibility of different taxa of pear to <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> attack. The selected plant material and the insects were collected from the field, at the Jordan Experimental Farm, Jordan Station, Ontario. Psylla behaviour in the chambers was compared to field observations and in both cases most adult <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> migrated to the leaves of pear by early evening. <b>Pear</b> <b>psylla</b> tested on different plant species and different cultivars of pear did not show significant differences in the relative number of insects per plant species or cultivar. Psylla produced frass in a consistent and reproducible manner on the different taxa tested. Frass deposition was also accompanied by egg laying in the majority of cases. Results indicate that <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> fed differentially on the different plants tested. <b>Pear</b> <b>psylla</b> development in the field after 21 days was also observed and the data recorded from it paralleled the data obtained for the same plants tested under bioassay conditions in the laboratory. A cursory analysis of lipid and polar soluble phenolic compounds was performed. The ratio of the common number over the total number of different polar phenolics between the two taxa compared shows a grouping trend among the taxa tested, which is similar to the results from the bioassays and the field study. According to the results obtained in the field, in bioassays, and two-dimensional chromatography of phenolic compounds in the plants tested, these plants can be arranged in three categories: (1) most preferred hosts for Psylla pyricola (Bosc and Old Home), (2) intermediate hosts (Bartlett, Kieffer, and d'Anjou), and (3) least preferred hosts (Clapp, P. ussuriensis, and quince). The present work indicates that <b>pear</b> <b>psylla,</b> tested on the Niagara Peninsula, is a specific pest of the pear crop, but it could feed on quince under unfavorable conditions.

40|$|In Belgium, two {{cultivation}} methods of pear are widely applied, namely organic farming and {{integrated pest management}} (IPM).

It is generally considered that these two {{cultivation methods}} have different effects on the density of beneficial arthropods in the orchard and the occurrence of common pests as well. Therefore, a large-scale monitoring study was executed comprising extensive samplings throughout the year in 14 pear orchards and comparing beneficial fauna population developments between organic and IPM pear orchards. Pear sucker (Cacopsylla sp. or <b>pear</b> <b>psylla)</b> which is considered the major pest of pear in Belgium, was monitored as well. Organic orchards clearly displayed a lower <b>pear</b> <b>psylla</b> pressure correlating with higher proportions of specific predator populations, particularly velvet mites (Trombidiidae) and spiders (Araneae).

40|$|The campylomma bug (or mullein plant bug; Hemiptera: Miridae) causes {{sporadic}} {{damage in}} Utah apple orchards.

No prolonged (> 10 min) phloem ingestion was performed by nymphs and adults in the resistant selection.
