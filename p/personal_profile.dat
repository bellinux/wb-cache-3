40|$|Online {{communication}} is increasingly used in education, {{but it is}} not without problems. One significant difficulty is a lack of social presence. Social presence relates to the need for users of technology-based communication to perceive each other as real people. Low social presence can be a particular issue in text-based, asynchronous systems such as discussion forums, leading to feelings of impersonality and disengagement from online learning. Features of online communication systems have the potential to increase social presence. One possibility, advocated in the literature on online learning, is the use of <b>personal</b> <b>profiles</b> and photos to help participants to learn something about each other and feel more connected. This paper discusses the question: To what extent do <b>personal</b> <b>profiles</b> enhance social presence in online learning communities? It presents research findings from two studies which investigated learners’ use and perceptions of <b>personal</b> <b>profiles</b> in online forums. The findings suggest that <b>personal</b> <b>profiles</b> and photos help some online learners to feel in touch with each other. Other learners, however, do not feel the need for these facilities, have privacy concerns or prefer to focus on the forum postings...|$|R

40|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>profiling</b> is {{a dynamic}} {{learning}} process designed to enable individuals to identify their strengths, needs and aspirations in order to set strategic and behavioural goals. This single-site case study seeks to explore undergraduate occupational therapy students' attitudes and experiences {{of the process of}} <b>personal</b> <b>profiling</b> in the context of early professional development. The profiling system aims to support students through the process of integrating their University-based and practice-based learning experiences for personal and professional development. The investigation was carried out in two phases, a pilot study and main study, using an inclusive approach for inquiry. From the initial research question several sub-themes emerged during the pilot study which informed the overarching design of the main study. Students' attitudes towards the existing system were examined using a cohort study approach which employed a survey design of quantitative and qualitative data-gathering questionnaires. Attitudes and experiences of students were further explored through semi-structured interviews. A cross-sectional approach which included a sample of students from each year was adopted. In addition questionnaire data was collected from tutors and practice educators who {{play a significant role in}} students' professional education. Findings indicate students generally appear to have a positive attitude to <b>personal</b> <b>profiling.</b> The value is experienced at varying psychological levels, depending on students' willingness, motivation to engage with the process and psychological preparedness. A model of levels of engagement in profiling is proposed. Students' report the process of profiling was a challenging, psychologically messy and uncertain process yet worthwhile in the overall pursuit of professional development. Tutors perceived it as an enabling process in the students' learning. The conclusion drawn is that students have the intellectual capability and potential to benefit from <b>personal</b> <b>profiling.</b> Students appear to self-consciously recognise, articulate and acknowledge the value of <b>personal</b> <b>profiling</b> in facilitating early professional development.

Student interview data (N = 87) were analyzed in order to reveal students' conceptions of knowledge, thinking, and reasoning. The individual answers were examined and rated on a scale from absolutist to evaluativist thinking. On the basis of the student answers, three <b>personal</b> epistemology <b>profiles</b> were identified from the data: (i) absolutist profiles; (ii) relativistic profiles; and (iii) evaluativist profiles consisting of the subgroups entitled “limited” and “sophisticated. ” The categorization of <b>personal</b> epistemology <b>profiles</b> was compared with background variables such as age, major subject, and study phase.

The {{questions}} to be answered are: how do people form their <b>personal</b> <b>profiles?</b> Does the method of how one markets him/herself, within an online dating service, vary among different age groups? Material/method: 100 <b>personal</b> <b>profiles</b> have been downloaded and analysed from Sweden's largest dating website, Match. com.
