40|$|During the 535 th {{meeting of}} the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, September 7 - 8, 2006, we {{reviewed}} the proposed direct final rule to amend 10 CFR 50. 68, “Criticality Accident Requirements. ” During our review, we {{had the benefit of}} discussions with representatives of the NRC staff and the Nuclear Energy Institute, and the documents referenced. RECOMMENDATION 1. The proposed direct final rule to amend 10 CFR 50. 68 should be issued for public comment. 2. The NRC staff should complete the research to quantify the reactivity effects of fission products in the fuel. The results of this research may enable additional burnup credit to be allowed in the guidance for 10 CFR Part 71 and 72. BACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION The staff has proposed to amend 10 CFR 50. 68, so that the requirements governing criticality control for spent fuel pool storage racks do not apply to the fuel within a spent fuel transportation <b>package</b> or storage <b>cask</b> when a <b>package</b> or <b>cask</b> is in a spent fue...|$|R
5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is <b>packaged</b> either into <b>casks</b> for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|R
40|$|Under current practices, spent {{nuclear fuel}} (SNF) {{assemblies}} are taken out of SNF pools at nuclear power plants after an initial decay period and <b>packaged</b> in dry <b>casks</b> for storage at Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSIs). Some dry storage cask designs utilize austenitic stainless steel canisters surrounded by concrete shielding structures. The concrete structures have vents open to the outside atmosphere for cooling. Should the ISFSI be located where chlorides may be deposited on the austenitic stainless steel canisters, then under certain conditions, the potential may exist for initiating chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC).

40|$|A {{package to}} be used for the {{transport}} of hazardous /radioactive materials must demonstrate to fulfil the International standards requirements in order to provide protection to the human being and environment even under accident conditions, such as rigorous fire events. In these conditions, the system (<b>package</b> or <b>cask),</b> constituted, in general, by a massive sealed steel vessel, must thus demonstrate to be robust, safe and reliable so to guarantee both structural strength and radiation shielding. The present study deals with the evaluation of the thermo-structural response and performance of an Italian design type IP- 2 packaging system, provided by Sogin, that should be adopted for the transportation of low and intermediate level radioactive solid/solidified wastes. To evaluate its performance, a FEM model has been set up and implemented in a rather refined way taking into account all the packaging system components. Numerical simulations addressed fire scenarios as specified in the IAEA regulations: packaging subjected to an engulfing fire of 800 °C for 30 minutes. All the heat transfer mechanisms, inside the system and between the system itself and the environment, have been considered in the thermal analyses performed. The results of the thermal analyses are presented and discussed. Analysing the results obtained it is possible to conclude that although any potential damage the integrity of IP 2 packaging system is assured...|$|R

40|$|According to {{plans of}} the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) it is {{intended}} to directly emplace spent fuel elements from high-temperature reactors (HTR-FEs) in a salt mine repository. In analogy to the concept for horizontal drift emplacement of the fuel elements from light-water reactors (LWR-FEs) <b>packaged</b> in POLLUX <b>casks,</b> the BfS sees advantages in a comparably designed HTR-FE horizontal drift emplacement concept over the concept of an emplacement in boreholes pursued until early in the nineties on the basis of thin-walled HTR-FE packages. For the final disposal of spent HTR-FEs from the two decommissioned THTR 300 and AVR high-temperature reactor plants, which have been packaged in CASTOR THTR/AVR transport and storage casks for long-term storage in the Ahaus interim storage facility and the AVR store at Jülich, an appropriate horizontal drift emplacement concept based on the CASTOR THTR/AVR transport and storage cask is developed and presented in this report. First of all, the essential design and conceptual features of the AVR and THTR fuel elements will be described and the HTR-FE quantity structure for final disposal compiled. Furthermore, the findings and experience gained experimentally and by safety-related studies and calculations as well as, in particular, the results and experience obtained for the borehole storage concept by long-term safety analyses concerning the storage behaviour of spent HTR-FEs will be described in detail and used as a yardstick for the assessment of the long-term safety of the horizontal driftemplacement concept {{on the basis of the}} CASTOR THTR/AVR cask. For the accident of brine inleakage into the abandoned Underground workings assumed in the long-term safety analyses it will be shown by stress and deformation calculations that the CASTOR THTR/AVR casks on the whole have sufficient safety reserves to sustain the tectonic loads to be expected and that a lifetime is to be expected which is currently also taken as a Standard for POLLUX casks. A comparison of the HTR-FE quantity structure assumed in earlier long-term safety analyses and of the HTR-FE packaging then assumed as non-load-bearing with the THTR-FE and AVR-FE quantity structure firmed up here and the barrier and load-bearing function to be considered as existing here due to the design features of the CASTOR THTR/AVR cask implies that in the model calculations on long-term safety performed on this basis the HTR-FEs would not havesignificantly contributed any more to the radiation exposure to be expected. From the technical and safety-related aspect, therefore, nothing speaks against using also the CASTOR THTR/AVR cask developed and qualified for transport and interim storage for thefinal emplacement of THTR and AVR fuel elements in a repository. The advantage of this concept is evident. It will not be necessary to reload the fuel element cans or refill the fuel elements from the cans into HTR POLLUX casks as envisaged in the earlier concept for a pilot conditioning plant...|$|R
