40|$|We {{assessed}} how preemptive inoculation {{of plant}} leaves with bacteria affected the establishment of secondary colonizers. We quantified the latter in two ways: (i) at the population level, i. e. as counts of colony-forming units and (ii) {{at the level of}} single cells by tracking the reproductive success of individual bacteria. Both analyses showed that the ability of secondary immigrants to establish on the leaf was negatively correlated with the level of pre-population by <b>primary</b> <b>colonizers.</b> This effect was best described by an inverse dose–response curve with an apparent half-point inhibition efficacy of approximately 106 cells of <b>primary</b> <b>colonizers</b> per gram leaf. This efficacy was the same whether calculated from population- or average single-cell data. However, single-cell data revealed that even under conditions of heavy pre-population with <b>primary</b> <b>colonizers,</b> a small fraction of secondary immigrants still produced offspring, although the corresponding population measurement showed no increase in total population size. This observation has direct relevance for biocontrol strategies that are based on the principle of preemptive exclusion of foliar bacterial pathogens: even at seemingly saturating levels of primary inoculum, some secondary colonizers may still be able to reproduce and possibly reach a quorum to trigger behaviours that enhance survival or virulence. ...|$|R

Several maize-associated fungi in the genus Fusarium can metabolize MBOA and BOA. BOA tolerance levels in 10 species of Fusarium and in the maize endophytes Nigrospora oryzae, Acremonium zeae, and Periconia macrospinosa were characterized. BOA tolerance ranged from 0. 25 to 1. 10 mg/ml among species. The influence of substrate alteration by one species on the subsequent growth of another species was assessed in the presence and absence of BOA. The colony area of the secondary colonizer in heterospecific interactions was compared to that in autospecific interactions (one isolate follows itself). In the presence of BOA, four of six secondary colonizers had greater growth (facilitation) when primary colonizers had higher BOA tolerance than the secondary colonizer. When the <b>primary</b> <b>colonizer</b> had lower tolerance than the secondary, three of six secondary colonizers were inhibited (competition) and three not significantly affected. In BOA-free medium, the number of isolates that were facilitated or inhibited was the same regardless of the tolerance level of the <b>primary</b> <b>colonizer.</b> Two of six secondary colonizers were facilitated, two inhibited, and two not significantly affected. This study provides some support for facilitation in stressful conditions under the Menge-Sutherland model.

40|$|Wood {{decaying}} fungi are {{an essential}} part of all forest ecosystems. On their functioning depends a number of other organisms which use substances produced during decay of wood. Enzymes that degrade wood represent indispensable tool for fungi in converting structural compounds of wood to water and carbon dioxide. That makes them {{an essential part}} of the carbon cycle in nature. The dynamic of fungal communities on decaying wood is determined by a range of abiotic and biotic factors. The variability of microclimatic conditions, differences in the wood humidity and a gaseous mode are identifying stress factors which define the presence of species adapted to those conditions. An important factor, with which we can partially predict community composition, is the degree of decomposition of wood and the history of a species on the substrate. Another indicator, which may partly explain the composition of the community is a way of dying of a tree and a type of decaying substrate. Often, the development of a community follows from the <b>primary</b> <b>colonizers,</b> with high tolerance to unfavorable conditions, through the secondary colonizers, which have the ability to obtain the substrate over <b>primary</b> <b>colonizers,</b> but require more stable microclimatic conditions, to late colonizers, who are adapted to stress factors as [...] ...|$|R

Chitosan has been reported to have good biocompatibility and anti-bacterial activity. An osseo-inductive recombinant elastin-like biopolymer (P-HAP), that contains a peptide derived from the protein statherin, has been reported to induce biomineralization and osteoblast differentiation.

The difference in the water contact angle between consecutive layers, the representative peaks in diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the changes in the topography between surfaces with a different number of bi-layers observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM), all indicated the successful establishment of chitosan/P-HAP LbL assembly on the titanium surface.

We have used molecular phylogenetic and ultrastructural evidence to identify the rod-shaped epibionts of the two members of this group, Calkinsia aureus and B. bacati, hand-picked from the sediments of two separate oxygen-depleted, sulfidic environments. We identify their epibionts as closely related sulfur or sulfide-oxidizing members of the epsilon proteobacteria. The epsilon proteobacteria generally have a significant role in deep-sea habitats as <b>primary</b> <b>colonizers,</b> <b>primary</b> producers and/or in symbiotic associations. The epibionts likely fulfill a role in detoxifying the immediate surrounding environment for these two different hosts. The nearly identical rod-shaped epibionts on these two symbiontid hosts provides evidence for a co-evolutionary history between these two sets of partners. This hypothesis is supported by congruent tree topologies inferred from 18 S and 16 S rDNA from the hosts and bacterial epibionts, respectively. The eukaryotic hosts likely serve as a motile substrate that delivers the epibionts to the ideal locations with respect to the oxic/anoxic interface, whereby their growth rates can be maximized, perhaps also allowing the host to cultivate a food source.
