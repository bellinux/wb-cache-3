She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and <b>plotting</b> <b>to</b> kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge.|$|E
5|$|Ignoring Ibn Ra'iq's {{orders to}} retake Khuzistan, Bajkam {{remained}} at Wasit, and began <b>plotting</b> <b>to</b> depose Ibn Ra'iq himself.

In September 938, Bajkam led his troops from Wasit to Baghdad. Ibn Ra'iq tried without success to impede his advance by destroying the great dams of the Nahrawan Canal and flooding the plain, but Bajkam's army entered the Abbasid capital without opposition, and al-Radi immediately transferred Ibn Ra'iq's title of amir al-umara to Bajkam.|$|E

The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is <b>plotting</b> <b>to</b> disrupt an early American space launch with a radio beam weapon.

5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory {{is a product of}} not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators <b>plotting</b> <b>to</b> rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E
5|$|Still in Oriente, Castro was furious. Recognizing the {{establishment}} of a military junta, he ended the ceasefire and continued on the offensive.

Accompanying widespread celebrations as news of Batista's downfall spread across Cuba on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to take responsibility for policing the country, in order to prevent widespread looting and vandalism.|$|E
