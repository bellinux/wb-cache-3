5|$|At the Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College, Giridhar learnt {{the eight}} Ganas of Sanskrit <b>prosody</b> while {{studying}} Chandaprabhā, a work on Sanskrit <b>prosody.</b> The next day, he composed his first Sanskrit verse, in the Bhujaṅgaprayāta metre.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prosody</b> is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. <b>Prosody</b> also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
5|$|Any {{stressed}} syllable carries {{one of two}} tones, {{which give}} Swedish much of its characteristic sound. <b>Prosody</b> is often {{one of the most}} noticeable differences between its dialects.|$|E
40|$|Although {{its role}} is {{frequently}} stressed in acoustic profile for vocal emotion, sound intensity is frequently {{regarded as a}} control parameter in neurocognitive studies of vocal emotion, leaving its role and neural underpinnings unclear. To investigate these issues, we asked participants to rate the angry level of neutral and angry <b>prosodies</b> before and after sound intensity modification in Experiment 1, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) for mismatching emotional <b>prosodies</b> with and without sound intensity modification and for matching emotional <b>prosodies</b> while participants performed emotional feature or sound intensity congruity judgment in Experiment 2. It was found that sound intensity modification had {{significant effect on the}} rating of angry level for angry <b>prosodies,</b> but not for neutral ones. Moreover, mismatching emotional <b>prosodies,</b> relative to matching ones, induced enhanced N 2 /P 3 complex and theta band synchronization irrespective of sound intensity modification and task demands. However, mismatching emotional <b>prosodies</b> with reduced sound intensity showed prolonged peak latency and decreased amplitude in N 2 /P 3 complex and smaller theta band synchronization. These findings suggest that though it cannot categorically affect emotionality conveyed in emotional <b>prosodies,</b> sound intensity contributes to emotional significance quantitatively, implying that sound intensity should not simply be taken as a control parameter and its unique role needs to be specified in vocal emotion studies...|$|R

40|$|Welsh poet R. S. Thomas (1913 - 2000), who {{published}} for over six decades, {{evolved from a}} sub-Georgian imitator in the 1930 s to one of Britain's most stylistically-innovative poets {{in the latter part}} of the century. This thesis traces Thomas's developmental journey by means of close reading, analyzing his various <b>prosodies,</b> including metrical, accentual, linear, and visual. R. S. Thomas's <b>prosodies</b> were largely an extension of his emotional interiors, but there is also in his work an integral relationship between style and place; the environment in which he wrote poems was consistently reflected in the rhythm, language, and structure of the poetry itself. In order to shed light on the workings of Thomas's <b>prosodies,</b> this thesis makes use of poetic theory and examines Thomas's responses to key influences: the Bible; writings in theology and popular science; and the literary works of Irish, American, Welsh, and English writers...|$|R
5|$|Greenlandic <b>prosody</b> {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, <b>prosody</b> is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E

5|$|Nagavarma I, a brahmin {{scholar who}} came from Vengi in modern Andhra Pradesh (late 10th century) was also patronised by Chavundaraya. He wrote Chandombudhi (ocean of <b>prosody)</b> {{addressed}} to his wife. This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in <b>prosody.</b> He also wrote {{one of the earliest}} available romance classics in Kannada called Karnataka Kadambari in sweet and flowing champu (mixed verse and prose) style. It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics. Gajashtaka (hundred verses on elephants), a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct. Other writers such as Manasiga and Chandrabhatta were known to be popular in the 10th century.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{evidence}} supports differential event-related brain potential (ERP) responses for emotional prosodic processing and integrative emotional prosodic/semantic processing. While latter process elicits a negativity {{similar to the}} well-known N 400 component, transitions in emotional prosodic processing elicit a positivity. To further substantiate this evidence, the current investigation utilized lexical-sentences and sentences without lexical content (pseudo-sentences) spoken in six basic emotions by a female and a male speaker. Results indicate that emotional prosodic expectancy violations elicit a right-lateralized positive-going ERP component independent of basic emotional <b>prosodies</b> and speaker voice. In addition, expectancy violations of integrative emotional prosody/semantics elicit a negativity with a whole-head distribution. The current results nicely complement previous evidence, and extend the results by showing the respective effects for {{a wider range of}} emotional <b>prosodies</b> independent of lexical content and speaker voice. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, <b>prosody,</b> and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted <b>prosody,</b> and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to inscriptions, chronicles called Vamshavalis were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, writings on secular subjects became popular. Some well-known works are Chandombudhi, a <b>prosody,</b> and Karnataka Kadambari, a romance, both written by Nagavarma I, a lexicon called Rannakanda by Ranna (993), {{a book on}} medicine called Karnataka-Kalyanakaraka by Jagaddala Somanatha, the earliest writing on astrology called Jatakatilaka by Sridharacharya (1049), a writing on erotics called Madanakatilaka by Chandraraja, and an encyclopedia called Lokapakara by Chavundaraya II (1025).|$|E

5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's <b>prosody</b> and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and <b>prosody</b> or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as <b>prosody,</b> tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of {{the sounds of a}} language, as well as the rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E
40|$|The idiom {{principle}} {{outlined by}} John Sinclair has shown how much language consists of reused formulae of a collocational and colligational nature. Resonance seeks {{to look at}} the usage of words and expressions that have retained strong semantic <b>prosodies</b> from earlier usage, <b>prosodies</b> of which the current user may not necessarily be aware. It appears here as a very diffuse form of intertextuality with an initial move from contextual to restricted collocation followed by a gradual move to the purely formulaic. This chapter illustrates this by exploring certain key words from the New Testament to see how they have been used in the works of Shakespeare, the other most cited source in the English language, and finally how these expressions are used in the British National Corpus. Although having become almost purely formulaic, these expressions seem to retain sufficient religious resonance to give them their force...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the discourse of}} academic quality audit reports by drawing upon Appraisal Theory (Martin & White 2005).

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor <b>prosody,</b> tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|In the 1580s and 1590s James VI {{promoted}} {{the literature of}} the country of his birth. His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish <b>Prosody,</b> published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, Scots, to which he applied Renaissance principles. He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, seeing the two in connection. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, the Castalian Band, which included among others William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie, the latter being a favourite of the King. By the late 1590s his championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne, and some courtier poets who followed the king to London after 1603, such as William Alexander, began to anglicise their written language. James' characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the Scottish court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined.|$|E
