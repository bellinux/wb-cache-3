500|$|The Abbey Church is {{the liturgical}} {{center of the}} college. It is {{frequently}} cited as the [...] "heart of campus." [...] The upper church allows the college community to join with the monastic community for the daily celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours. The lower church permits smaller groups {{of the community to}} assemble for worship and houses the Lady Chapel, the Saint Basil Byzantine Chapel, the former offices of Campus Ministry (relocated to Cushing Center), and meeting rooms. The Lower Church is the location of the weekly 9 <b>p.m.</b> <b>Mass</b> held on Wednesday nights. The original monastery was Alumni Hall. An interim monastery existed between 1919 and 1955 in what is now Joseph Hall, adjacent to Alumni Hall. The current monastery, built in 1955, is staffed with only a cook, as the monks perform all other tasks such as cleaning, maintenance and upkeep. Having four floors, including a basement, the monastery can house up to one hundred monks; as of 2012 approximately 30 rooms were filled. The Dean of the College and several members {{of the board of trustees}} live in the monastery, as they are practicing Benedictine monks. Since 2012, Abbot Mark Cooper, O.S.B has been the fifth elected Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey. Male students frequently dine in the monastery as guests; they are required to comply with the Benedictine rule of silence while eating, which allows for contemplation and prayer. The monastery has a refectory, a smaller guest refectory, a smaller chapel, two welcoming rooms near the main entrance and is complete with elevator access to all four floors. The monastery also serves as the mother house for the Woodside Priory School and the abbot serves as the spiritual father for the monks who live there. Saint Anselm Abbey is a member of the American-Cassinese Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. Saint Anselm Abbey was founded from Saint Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey.|$|E

Regression analysis with ordinary least square was employed to characterize the influences of a variety of factors on <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentration. Hourly ambient <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations were 3 - 280 μg/m 3 with a median of 58 μg/m 3, and hourly indoor counterpart were 4 - 193 μg/m 3 with a median of 34 μg/m 3. The median indoor/ambient ratio of <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentration was 0. 62. The diurnal variation of residential indoor and ambient <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations tracked with each other well. Strong correlation was found between indoor and ambient <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations on the community basis (coefficients: r ≥ 0. 90, p < 0. 0001), and the ambient data explained ≥ 84 % variance of the indoor data. Regression analysis suggested that the variables, such as traffic conditions, indoor smoking activities, indoor cleaning activities, indoor plants and number of occupants, had significant influences on the indoor <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations. <b>PM</b> 2. 5 of ambient origin made dominant contribution to residential indoor PM 2. 5 exposure in the non-heating season under the high ambient fine particle pollution condition. Nonetheless, the large inter-residence variability of infiltration factor of ambient PM 2. 5 raised the concern of exposure misclassification when using ambient <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations as exposure surrogates. PM 2. 5 of indoor origin still had minor influence on indoor <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations, particularly at 11 : 00 - 13 : 00 and 22 : 00 - 0 : 00. The predictive models suggested that particles from traffic emission, secondary aerosols, particles from indoor smoking, resuspended particles due to indoor cleaning and particles related to indoor plants contributed to indoor <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations in this study. Real-time ventilation measurements and improvement of questionnaire design to involve more variables subject to built environment were recommended to enhance the performance of the predictive models...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} if light-duty vehicles idling at drive-throughs elevated ambient <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> more than those emitted by natural sources at a near-by greenspace. Two low-volume samplers (MiniVols), obtained from the Meteorological Services of Canada Air Quality Processes Research Division (ARQP), were set up 1. 4 km apart in the west end of Kitchener, Ontario between the months of August and November, 2002. Four diurnal sampling periods were conducted on various days to determine when <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations were higher and at which location. Although overall results determined that the control site had obtained higher <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentrations than the experimental, a correlation between peak traffic hours (morning and evening rush-hours) and elevated ambient <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> was apparent at both sites.

40|$|Aerosol optical {{thicknesses}} (AOTs) by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Aqua and Terra satellites, and ground-based {{measurements of}} <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations, collected {{over three years}} (2006 – 2008) at two suburban sites which are 20 km apart, are correlated to assess the use of satellite data for regional air quality studies over Southeastern Italy, in the central Mediterranean. Due to the geographical location, this area is affected by local and long-range transported marine, desert (from Sahara), and anthropogenic (from continental Europe) aerosols. 24 -hour averaged <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations span the 1. 6 – 152 µg/m 3 range. Yearly means of <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations decrease from 2006 to 2008 and vary within the 26 – 36 µg/m 3 range. Daily mean values of MODIS AOTs vary up to 0. 8 at 550 nm, while yearly means span the 0. 15 – 0. 17 range. A first assessment of the regression relationship between daily averaged <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations and MODIS-AOTs shows that linear correlation coefficients (R) vary within the 0. 20 – 0. 35 range and {{are affected by the}} sampling year and the site location. The PM 10 -AOT correlation becomes stronger (0. 34 ≤ R ≤ 0. 57) when the analysis is restricted to clear-sky MODIS measurements. The cloud screening procedure adopted within the AERONET network is used in this study to select clear-sky MODIS measurements, since it allows obtaining larger R values than the ones obtained using the cloud fraction MODIS product to select clear-sky MODIS measurements. Using three years of clear-sky measurements to estimate <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations from MODIS-AOTs, the empirical relation we have found is: PM 10 (m g/m 3) = 25 (m g/m 3) + 65 (m g/m 3) × AOT. Over 80 % {{of the differences between the}} measured and satellite estimated <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations over the three years are within ± 1 standard deviation of the yearly means. The differences between yearly means of calculated and measured mass concentrations that are close to zero in 2006, increase up to 4 m g/m 3 at one siteand 8 m g/m 3 at the other site in 2008. The <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentration decrease from 2006 to 2008 contributes to this last result. Our results demonstrate the potential of MODIS data for deriving indirect estimates of PM 10 over Southeastern Italy. It is also shown that a stronger relationship between PM 10 and MODIS-AOTs is obtained when the AOT is divided by the product of the mixing layer height with the ground wind speed and the analysis restricted to clear sky MODIS measurements. However, we have found that the stronger correlation (0. 52 ≤ R ≤ 0. 66) does not allow a significant improvement of MODIS-based-estimates of <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Fine {{particles}} (PM 2. 5) affect {{human life}} and activities directly; the detection of <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentration profile is very essential due to its practical and scientific significance (such as the quantification of air quality and its variability {{as well as the}} assessment of improving air quality forecast). But so far, it has been difficult to detect <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentration profile. The proposed methodology to study the relationship between aerosol extinction coefficient and <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentration is described, which indicates that the <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentration profile could be retrieved by combining a charge-coupled device (CCD) side-scatter lidar with a PM 2. 5 sampling detector. When the relative humidity is less than 70  %, <b>PM</b> 2. 5, <b>mass</b> concentration is proportional to the aerosol extinction coefficient, and then the specific coefficient can be calculated. Through this specific coefficient, aerosol extinction profile is converted to <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> concentration profile.

40|$|The 24 -h PM 2. 5 samples (particles with an {{aerodynamic}} diameter of 2. 5 μm or less) were taken at 6 -day intervals at five {{urban and rural}} sites simultaneously in Beijing, China for 1 month in each quarter of calendar year 2000. Samples at each site were combined into a monthly composite for the organic tracer analysis by GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). Compared to the data obtained from other metropolitan cities in the US, the <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> and fine organic carbon (OC) concentrations in Beijing were much higher with an annual average of 101 and 20. 9 μg m^(− 3), respectively. Over one hundred organic compounds including unique tracers for important sources were quantified in PM 2. 5 in Beijing. Source apportionment of fine OC was conducted using chemical mass balance receptor model (CMB) in combination with particle-phase organic compounds as fitting tracers. Carbonaceous aerosols and major ions (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) constituted 69 % of <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> on average. The major sources of <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> in Beijing averaged over five sites {{on an annual basis}} were determined as dust (20 %), secondary sulfate (17 %), secondary nitrate (10 %), coal combustion (7 %), diesel and gasoline exhaust (7 %), secondary ammonium (6 %), biomass aerosol (6 %), cigarette smoke (1 %), and vegetative detritus (1 %).
