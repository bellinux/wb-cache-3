5|$|There are {{two types}} of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to {{contract}} easily, and <b>pacemaker</b> cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the <b>pacemaker</b> cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The <b>pacemaker</b> cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate – spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.|$|E

Over the past decade, significant improvements {{have been made in}} biological <b>pacemakers,</b> but issues remain in relation to long-term outcomes and safety. Concurrently, efforts to improve electronic <b>pacemakers</b> have also intensified. Whether new generations of electronic <b>pacemakers</b> will erase lingering concerns with regard to electronic pacing or whether biologicals will ultimately supplement or supplant electronics remains to be see...|$|R

40|$|Leadless cardiac <b>pacemakers</b> are {{self-contained}} intracardiac {{devices that}} can be implanted entirely inside the right ventricle of the heart.

5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium.

40|$|Dual chamber (DDD) or “universal” <b>pacemakers</b> {{have had}} a {{significant}} impact on the advancement of artificial <b>pacemakers</b> by providing a more physiologic approach to cardiac pacing. However, with the early generation of DDD <b>pacemakers</b> (<b>pacemakers</b> that sense and pace in both the atrium and the ventricle), a significant number of patients experienced pacemaker-mediated tachycardia because intact ventriculoatrial conduction was sensed in the atrium and a reentrant tachycardia was induced. Newer generation DDD <b>pacemakers</b> have provided longer atrial refractory periods, which should correct this problem. In this study the first and second years of a 2 year experience with DDD <b>pacemakers</b> were compared to determine if the newer generation devices have allowed maintenance of pacing in the DDD mode as opposed to reprogramming to some alternate mode because of pacemaker-mediated tachycardia or other pacing problems. The results showed a significant decrease in pacemaker-mediated tachycardia during the second year and continuation of pacing in the DDD mode in a higher percent of patients. This improvement is attributed to improvement in the pulse generator as well as better patient selection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Apart from {{support of}} heart rate in {{patients}} of symptomatic bradycardia, {{in the last}} two decades, the indications of <b>pacemakers</b> have widened to prevent arrhythmias, optimise hemodynamic functions and suppress tachyarrhythmias. <b>Pacemakers</b> have been successfully used in Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) to reduce LVOT gradient and in improving cardiac output in patients of dilated cardio myopathy (DCM) with class III/class IV heart failure (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy). Nowadays, different <b>pacemakers</b> are being routinely used to treat Sick Sinus Syndrome, Neurocardiogenic Syncope, Heart Transplant patients and to prevent atrial arrhythmias. They are used to prevent fatal ventricular arrhythmias and to prevent bradycardia in patients of long QT syndromes. In future genetically engineered <b>pacemakers</b> could be a possible alternative to implantable electronic devices for the treatment of brady arrhythmias. This article briefly discusses these expanding indications of <b>pacemakers...</b>|$|R

5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the <b>pacemaker</b> of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

5|$|Blue Velvet premiered in {{competition}} at the Montréal World Film Festival in August 1986, and at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on September 12, 1986, {{and a few days}} later in the United States.

Blue Velvet was met with uproar during its audience reception, with lines formed around city blocks in New York City and Los Angeles. There were reports of mass walkouts and refund demands during its opening week. At a Chicago screening, a man fainted and had to have his <b>pacemaker</b> changed.

5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a <b>pacemaker</b> or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac <b>pacemaker.</b> The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E
