40|$|A idéia inicial da justiça em Rawls é a de que todas as pessoas tenham direito a um igual conjunto de bens sociais primários, a partir do qual seja possível para cada uma delas buscar realizar os seus respectivos planos de vida. As pessoas estão sujeitas desde o seu nascimento às contingências naturais e sociais que afetam profundamente as suas perspectivas de vida, especialmente daquelas menos favorecidas. Rawls afirma que é preciso regular esse quadro de desigualdades moralmente arbitrárias e, para isso, elabora dois princípios de justiça. O princípio da igualdade garante o direito a um mais amplo possível sistema de liberdade igual para todas as pessoas. O princípio da diferença admite desigualdades econômicas entre as pessoas somente se tais desigualdades beneficiarem especialmente os menos favorecidos. Os povos também possuem diferentes níveis de riqueza entre si. A justiça entre os povos deve efetivar um princípio - o dever de assistência - pelo qual seja possível mitigar tal condição de desigualdade de modo a fazer com que os povos onerados façam parte da Sociedade dos Povos razoavelmente justa. Assim, a concepção rawlsiana de justiça com equidade é mantida no plano internacional quando é elaborado o Direito dos Povos. Em ambos os casos, as pessoas e os povos menos favorecidos natural e socialmente contam com um princípio que lhes garante dispor de uma condição social suficientemente necessária que os possibilite perseguir os seus planos de vida com dignidade e auto respeito. The {{conception}} of justice as fairness elaborated by John Rawls state the consideration about which terms of cooperation people consider as reasonably just to offer one another {{having in mind}} the society as a cooperative scheme for mutual advantage. The first idea is one that all {{people have a right}} to an equal set of primary social goods which makes possible for each one of them pursue their respective life plans. Nevertheless Rawls notes that people are exposed since they are born to natural and social contingencies and that mental and <b>physical</b> <b>talents</b> and abilities and conditions of wealth and social status are arbitrarily distributed. This affects profoundly peoples perspectives of life. Rawls afirms that is necessary regulate this scene of morally arbitrary inequalities and so he elaborates two principles of justice. The first - the equality principle - guarantees the right to an equal and most extensive system of liberties to all people. The second - the difference principle - admit economic inequalities only if these benefit especially those who are less favoured by the natural and social lucky. In the Rawlsian Society of Peoples there are different levels of wealth among peoples. So, the international justice must establish principles which struggle these inequalities so as to allow burned peoples to join well ordered peoples in the reasonably just Society of Peoples. It is the duty of assistance which makes it possible. So, the Rawlsian {{conception of}} justice as fairness is maintained when the law of peoples is elaborated so that the purpose to be reached by the difference principle in the closed system society is also reached in the Society of Peoples by the duty of assistance. In both cases the less natural and socially lucky persons and peoples rely on a principle which guarantee them a social condition sufficiently necessary that make possible for them to pursue with dignity and self-respect their life plans...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: What drives {{some athletes}} to achieve {{at the highest}} level whilst other athletes fail to achieve their {{physical}} potential? Why does the ‘fire’ burn so brightly for some elite athletes and not for others? A good understanding of an athlete’s motivation is critical to a coach designing an appropriate motivational climate to realize an athlete’s <b>physical</b> <b>talent.</b> This paper examines the motivational processes of elite athletes within the framework of three major social-cognitive theories of motivation. Method: Participants were five male and five female elite track and field athletes from Australia who had finished in the top ten at either the Olympic Games and/or the World Championships in the last six years. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Results and Discussion: Inductive analyses revealed several major themes associated with the motivational processes of elite athletes: (a) they were highly driven by personal goals and achievement, (b) they had strong self-belief, and (c) track and field was central to their lives. The findings are discussed in light of recent social-cognitive theories of motivation, namely, self-determination theory, the hierarchical model of motivation, and achievement goal theory. Self-determined forms of motivation characterised the elite athletes in this study and, consistent with social-cognitive theories of motivation, it is suggested that goal accomplishment enhances perceptions of competence and consequently promotes self-determined forms of motivation...|$|R

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{assumption}} that cultural historical analyses can help our understanding of changes in life cycles and life courses, this article explores {{the way in which}} a specific socio-cultural phenomenon, sport, changed and defined the life courses of women in pre-war Netherlands. While similar questions are often being researched from a psychological or sociological and hence short-term perspective, here a long term and biographical analysis is being applied. Focusing on a group of medal winning participants in the Olympic Games, the leading question is whether their <b>physical</b> <b>talent</b> allowed these women to pursue a different life course. A second question is how their international careers matched with dominant cultural life scripts, which stated that young women should prepare to become wives, mothers and homemakers. It can be concluded that the presented biographies reveal an ambiguous reality. On the one hand, sporting successes opened up several possibilities for the women concerned, who became public figures and their country's first national female sport heroes. Thus, they embodied {{the beginning of a new}} cultural feminine ideal that opened up existing scripts. Their personal life course underwent profound changes as well, albeit of a confusing nature. All coming from lower class families, they saw their social careers set off because of their swimming, but also getting disrupted because of it. Sport-related disagreeing life scripts were tensional rather than advantageous. At least in hindsight, the women blamed their sporting career for the strenuous course their lives took.
