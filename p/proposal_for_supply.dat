40|$|Purpose - Liberalisation of the European {{electricity}} {{sector has}} allowed the industrial consumers to freely choose their electricity suppliers. Proliferation of different contract <b>proposals</b> <b>for</b> such <b>supply</b> means that all proposals need to be carefully evaluated for correct supplier renewal choice. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to propose a methodology for the evaluation of heterogeneous proposals of electricity supply that would help industrial consumers to be ready to face supply contractors. Design/methodology/approach - The method relies on a three-stage analysis: characterisation of electricity consumption in the industrial process; demand forecasts based on energy drivers and consumption characterisation; and finally a detailed tariff analysis. The method is illustrated through a case study of a renewal contract of an Italian industrial plant with a 20 percent incidence of electrical energy cost on the final product. The investigation also includes a sensitivity analysis on combustible basket price and the distribution of daily working load. Findings - The evaluation of 14 <b>proposals</b> <b>for</b> the case study was carried out and the best offer for the case study company was selected. However, the overall price variation is 4 percent among different proposals and the electrical energy price shows an increase of 12 percent compared with the previous year. This suggests limited effectiveness of the competitive market in the Italian context. Practical implications - Themethod can be considered as a practical guide for the electrical energy contract renewal process of any industrial consumer that would help minimize its cost. Originality/value - The proposed method is based on an innovative investigation of the consumption characterisation of the industry based on energy drivers. This approach allows the industries to develop their own strategies for the contract renewal. The analysis presented here could be expanded to include more specific <b>supply</b> clauses <b>for</b> a more comprehensive analysis...|$|R

40|$|The recent EU Commission <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> {{promoting}} the <b>supply</b> {{of power from}} renewable energy sources was originally based on a pan-European, harmonised tradable green certificate (TGC) scheme. We suggest, {{on the basis of}} a multi-disciplinary analysis, that a pan-EU TGC system is not the way forward for Europe. It is vital that the Commission (and the majority of Member States) avoids implementation of such policy designs put forward by a coalition of vested interests. They should instead look at, and act upon, the available evidence from those countries that have experimented with TGCs (e. g. Flanders, UK and Sweden) and design policies that stand a better chance of meeting the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and equity. In particular, the policies must enable EU to meet the immense innovation/industrialisation challenge by inducing the development of a capital goods industry that can, eventually, diffuse a broad range of technologies that use renewable energy sources. Only then we can acquire an ability to implement an industrial revolution in the energy system in a way that broadly meets the criteria of effectiveness and dynamic efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a strawman <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> ensuring electricity <b>supply</b> adequacy {{by means}} of contracting obligations imposed on load serving entities (LSE). The mandatory contracts {{take the form of}} physically covered back stop call options with a high strike price so as not to interfere with normal risk management practices. These call options which can be covered by existing capacity, new investment in generation, or curtailable load contracts are of one year duration and a two year lead time so as to enable new entrant participation. The obligation, which is based on forecasted peak load plus adequate planning reserves, can be met with any forward or option contract that meets the physical cover requirement, has the same delivery period, and has a strike or forward price at or below the backstop strike price. The proposed mechanisms is intended to facilitate smooth transition to an energy only market where voluntary bilateral contracting and spot prices provide the needed incentives for adequate investment in generation capacity. We also describe a central procurement alternative that alleviates the credit problems associated with carrying long term option contracts. The features of the proposed approach are compared to those of the controversial LICAP mechanism proposed by the NEISO and endorsed by FERC...|$|R
