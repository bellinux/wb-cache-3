50|$|The port is a {{compulsory}} <b>pilotage</b> <b>area.</b> Pilotage {{is provided}} by the Great Lakes Pilotage Authority, a Crown corporation of the Government of Canada which includes responsibility for pilotage on the Hudson Bay coast of the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. Pilotage charges between July 20 and October 31 follow a published schedule; outside these dates charges are based on cost recovery.|$|E
50|$|There is a 42-volume American {{navigation}} publication {{published by}} the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Sailing Directions consists of 37 Enroute volumes, 4 Planning Guide volumes, and 1 volume combining both types. Planning Guides describe general features of ocean basins and country-specific information such as firing <b>areas,</b> <b>pilotage</b> requirements, regulations, search and rescue information, ship reporting systems, and time zones; routes describe features of coastlines, ports, and harbors.|$|R
50|$|Country entries {{may contain}} {{information}} on the following subjectsâ€”buoyage systems, currency, firing areas, fishing areas, government, holidays, ice, industries, languages, mined areas, navigational information (to include maritime claims, maritime boundary disputes, and enroute volumes), offshore drilling, <b>pilotage,</b> pollution, prohibited <b>areas,</b> regulations, restricted areas, search and rescue, signals, submarine operating areas, time zone, traffic separation schemes, U.S. embassy, and vessel traffic services. Information that cannot be accurately depicted within the alphabeticized country text may be listed as an appendix {{at the end of}} the dountry text.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{pilotage}} in {{the coastal}} waters of British Columbia, Canada is mandatory. The Pacific Pilotage Authority Canada (PPA) provides marine pilotage services on a coast-wide basis. The coast-wide model of marine pilotage services offers much flexibility to the users of the service; however, it {{has its share of}} operational challenges: inter alia pilot transportation logistics, increasing training and transportation costs, lower responsiveness to local port requirements and a diminishing pool of qualified mariners with coast-wide navigation knowledge and experience. To address the above-mentioned challenges holistically, this analysis recommends that the PPA provide a combination of coastal and port-based <b>pilotage</b> services in <b>areas</b> of high demand and where financially feasible...|$|R
50|$|Prince of Wales Channel: Larger ships transiting Torres Strait {{enter the}} Prince of Wales Channel from the West {{just north of}} Booby Island {{by way of the}} Gannet or Varzin Passages. The minimum depths for deep draught {{shipping}} in the Great Barrier Reef <b>pilotage</b> <b>area</b> are found here (10.3m - Nov 2011). Shipping with a 12.2m static draught or less are permitted to transit the area.|$|E
50|$|Use of harbor pilots is {{mandatory}} for all ships bearing a foreign flag, for ships carrying dangerous cargoes, during hazardous conditions and other circumstances requiring pilot assistance (normally, most ships over 60 m LOA with masters {{unfamiliar with the}} approaches). Pilots must be engaged at least 24 hours prior to arrival (normally by the shipping agent). The Pilot Center can also be contacted using VHF channel 8 or 16 during approach. The <b>pilotage</b> <b>area</b> includes all of the Haihe fairway, all of the Xingang fairway, all of the Dagusha fairway, the BZ28-1 and BZ34 oil fields in the Bohai Bay, and the SZ36 oilfield in Liaodong bay.|$|E
5000|$|Pilot boats often {{also use}} bright colors, like flashy yellow, {{to make them}} clearly visible and {{distinctive}} in even the worst conditions. This last mainly applies to the so-called pilot tenders: the vessels that go to the ships to bring the pilot on board of arriving ships or pick them up from departing ships. Depending on the local situation the tenders might be launched directly from a nearby harbour or they are coming from the central (large) pilot station: a pilot boat located at a pre-defined location at sea near a <b>pilotage</b> <b>area.</b> In earlier days nearly all pilots came from a [...] "pilot station" [...] at sea, but with the modern very fast tenders it is often more practical {{not to have a}} permanently manned pilot station at sea, but transfer the pilots directly to/from shore.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} {{vessels in}} excess of size limits determined by local authorities are handled in confined areas by a marine (or maritime) pilot. Marine pilots are seafarers with extensive seafaring experience and are usually qualified master mariners who have been trained as expert ship-handlers. These pilots are conversant with all types of vessel and propulsion systems, as well as handling ships of all sizes in all weather and tidal conditions. They are also experts in the geographical areas they work.In most countries, the pilot takes over the 'conduct' of the navigation from the ship master. This means that the master and crew should adhere to the pilot's orders in respect of the safe navigation of the vessel when in a compulsory <b>pilotage</b> <b>area.</b> The master may with good cause resume 'conduct' of the vessel's navigation. However this should never be done lightly. In situations where the pilot is an [...] "advisor" [...] {{even though he has}} the , the pilot or his [...] "Association" [...] have no responsibility or liability {{in the case of an}} accident. The master, upon realizing there is a dangerous situation developing, must take such action as to avoid an accident or at least to minimize the damage from one that can't be avoided.In some countries and areas (e.g. Scandinavia and the U.S.A.), the pilot's role is as an advisor. However, in practice, they are likely to have the conduct of the vessel, especially on larger ships using tug boats to assist. The general rule of thumb is that a pilot assumes command of a vessel and is not classed as [...] "an advisor" [...] in the Panama Canal, crossing the sill of a drydock, or in any port in Russia (or, perhaps, all the old Soviet states). This distinction is important because when a pilot is in command, the master can not take any action, but is limited to advising the pilot on any circumstance that creates what he considers a dangerous situation.|$|E
