50|$|The {{improved}} {{appearance of}} the gardens over {{recent years has been}} due to local government projects required as part of a Conservation Management Plan (CMP). The creation of mulched beds around significant trees has improved their condition and large herbaceous beds have been restored using <b>heritage</b> <b>plant</b> stock. The most obvious works include the reconstruction of the western half of the path network along accurately plotted heritage alignments using the original orange-coloured, granitic, sand surface and steel edging. This included the installation of an on-site stormwater dissipation system, which now uses surface runoff to help irrigate lawn areas and minimise water usage. The perimeter hedge around the gardens uses original Lonicera <b>heritage</b> <b>plant</b> stock sourced from Dame Elisabeth Murdoch's 'Cruden Farm.' This hedge will grow to a height of approximately 700mm. The CMP and further detailed historical investigations have led to the design of entry treatments for each of the entrances to the Gardens. Composed of bluestone walls and timber posts, the new entrances have been accurately designed to closely resemble the original appearance and layout of the old entrances. Reconstruction of the entry treatments in the western half of the Gardens commenced earlier this year. The northern and southern border beds have been <b>planted</b> with <b>heritage</b> <b>plant</b> stock in accordance with planting designs prepared by Jill Orr-Young.|$|R

40|$|Marrakesh was {{developed}} {{based on the}} classic model of the garden-city imbedded in an oasis. In the iconography and descriptions of writers and travellers, Marrakesh is indissociable from its palm groves and plants which confer a strong identity to a landscape the city has promoted for tourism. This image has increasingly become disconnected from reality, the garden-city and oasis image is fading away {{in the face of}} the extension and densification of the city. The palm groves and rows of trees have been retreating with encroaching urbanisation, golf courses, tourist complexes and villas, ever since the colonial period and increasingly in recent decades. The composition of this <b>plant</b> <b>heritage</b> is a reflection of various cultural influences which have shaped the current identity of the city. The palette of plant species reveals a qualitative change in landscapes correlated to changes in the tastes and choices of a social class and a population which questions this identity, historically based on a balance between plant and mineral elements.

25|$|The Reading <b>Plant's</b> <b>heritage,</b> {{combined}} with constant innovation and product quality, positioned the Reading site {{as one of}} the largest semiconductor facilities in the world. In 2000, Lucent Microelectronics and Optoelectronics were reorganized as Agere Systems with the intention of spinning it off as an independent company. Agere Systems Inc. produced high-tech components such as opto-electronics products, which use light-wave technologies to transmit information, and integrated circuits, which are miniaturized chips used in computers and communications. The opto-electronics parts were used in systems such as submarine communication cables, cable transmitters, cable receivers, laser components, and network computing devices. The integrated circuits were found in a wide array of electronic products from modems and computers to cell phones and telephone offices to video equipment and digital television. After becoming Agere Systems, by the end of 2000, the Reading Facility became the Muhlenberg plant and had grown its workforce by 800 to 3,000 as the anticipated lightwave business materialized. In 2001, Agere Systems's stock went public in late March. The spin-off was completed on June 1, 2002. By mid-2001, Agere cut 508 jobs at the Reading Works.

40|$|Visual Display Material and an Interactive Database for Vitafoods Geneva, 2002. The {{subject field}} is {{interactive}} and non-interactive exhibition design. The Out of Africa initiative {{was founded by}} the Brussels based Centre for Development and Enterprise. The initiative is committed to raising awareness of Africa’s medicinal <b>plant</b> <b>heritage</b> through exhibiting at important pharmaceutical and nutraceutical trade fairs. The first of these was the Vitafoods trade fair in Geneva in May 2002. Vitafoods is a leading nutraceutical company. 12 African countries donated material to {{form the basis of}} the exhibition. The purpose of the exhibition was to focus visitors on the importance of knowing more about Africa’s medicinal plants as part of an incentive to health address Africa’s own health problems. However the exhibition also targeted visitors who might contribute to Africa’s export earning potential. This was considered important as international herbal companies visit trade fairs such as Vitafoods in Geneva. And the visual material and interactive database were designed with a view to encouraging such companies to use more African plant materials. The exhibition included product samples, technical information and photographs. The researcher designed the display of these. The exhibition display as a whole was designed by British European Design Group in association with Denzil Phillips International. The researcher also designed a computer based interactive database about African medicine which allowed visitors to search by plant and also ailment/medical condition.

30|$|Another {{subject of}} {{criticism}} is the possibly hereditary plant sequences in the genome of the mussel. An example {{could be the}} occurrence of Proteasome subunit α type- 5 A and ADP/ATP carrier protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress). Thale cress grows on edges of agricultural fields, stone walls alongside tracks and roads and Mediterranean scrublands with scattered holm oaks but is no inhabitant of wet lands (Picó et al. 2008). Therefore, we have looked for comparable sequences in MytiBase: a knowledgebase of mussel (M. galloprovincialis) with 3, 275 transcribed sequences (Venier et al. 2009). To our surprise: also in this large list of transcribed proteins, {{a few examples of}} <b>plant</b> <b>heritage</b> were met: first the occurrence of 14 - 3 - 3 -like protein b of Oryza sativa (India Group) [Accession No. ABR 25888] together with 14 - 3 - 3 C 1 protein from Oncorhynchus mykiss [Accession No. Q 6 UFZ 7]. Identical sequences, found for Oryza sativa with those for O. mykiss (the latter between parentheses), are e 16 -e 34 (e 113 -e 131), p 65 -f 80 (p 162 -f 177), l 94 -d 100 (l 191 -d 197) and s 113 -d 134 (s 210 -d 231). It is evident that the sequence for Oryza sativa is 97 amino acids less than that of O. mykiss, due to incomplete DNA. Yet, we can calculate an identity that must be minimally 25 % the same. Since the sequences in case of M. galloprovincialis have been determined via DNA, we have to accept a genetic link between animals and plants, and so the link with proteasome subunit α type 5 A, ADP/ATP carrier protein 3 and Arabidopsis thaliana may be genuine and not artificial.|$|E
