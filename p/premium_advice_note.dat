Summary Research has highlighted fence collisions as a major source of mortality to black grouse and capercaillie but particularly for the rarer capercaillie. Land managers are being urged to minimise as far as practicable the use of fencing in core woodland grouse habitats. As an alternative strategy, various materials have been fixed onto deer fences to make them more visible to the birds. The use of orange barrier netting was examined by the Game Conservancy Trust, and other more durable forms of marking by RSPB. This note summarises the findings to date, and provides interim recommendations, with notes on construction, attachment and indicative costs. Where deer fences have to be used, this Note recommends chestnut paling o...|$|R
