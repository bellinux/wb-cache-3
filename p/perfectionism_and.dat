He has been noted for his <b>perfectionism</b> <b>and</b> love for the medium. Despite its high reputation, S.C.

Williamson was single during this period and, according to The Art of Al Williamson, had a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Much of Sibelius's reputation, {{during his}} {{lifetime}} and subsequently, derived from {{his work as a}} symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time {{there was no reason to}} suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's <b>perfectionism</b> <b>and</b> exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began on May 1, 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach Boys. At the Ramones' request, Ed Stasium {{helped with the}} album's engineering. During the studio work, Spector's recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums. The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible for the lowest feasible budget, with a relatively low production value. With End of the Century, the band experienced Spector's infamous <b>perfectionism,</b> <b>and</b> a budget of $200,000 to fully record and produce the album. This is significant because the band's debut album cost $6,400 total, and their second album cost $10,000. End of the Century {{is the most expensive}} album in the Ramones' career.|$|E

5|$|With {{his budget}} {{concerns}} alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, where on February 3, 1967, {{he and the}} Experience met sound engineer Eddie Kramer. During Kramer's first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method {{that they had been}} using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell's drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding's bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer's unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix's complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then pre-mixed and reduced the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix's <b>perfectionism</b> <b>and</b> Chandler's desire {{to reduce the number of}} takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix's guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, the microphones had been placed about twelve feet away from Hendrix's amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyer M1 60 ribbon microphones, which were typically not used to record loud music.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Hawks {{returned}} to the screwball comedy genre with His Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, which had already been made into a film in 1931 and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to Rudyard Kipling's India for Gunga Din in 1939. In 1941, Hawks made Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Editing), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for Ball of Fire, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck {{to help them with}} modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film The Outlaw, based on the life of Billy the Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to <b>perfectionism</b> <b>and</b> battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.|$|E

40|$|Background This study {{investigated}} the relationships between global <b>perfectionism</b> (its functional <b>and</b> dysfunctional aspects) and three types of health behaviors: fruit and vegetable intake (FVI), consumption of sweet and salty snacks, and physical activity. It was hypothesized that indices of functional perfectionism would predict engaging in healthy behavior, with gender moderating these associations. Participants and procedures Data were collected among 845 adolescents (59. 20 % girls) aged 13 to 20 years old (M = 16. 52, SD = 0. 92). At the baseline, participants filled out the Frost Multidimensional <b>Perfectionism</b> Scale <b>and</b> measures of nutrition behavior and physical activity. The measurement of nutrition behavior and physical activity was repeated at 12 -month follow-up. Results The moderator analysis indicated that FVI as well as consumption of sweet and salty snacks measured at 12 -month follow-up were explained by functional global <b>perfectionism</b> (Organization <b>and</b> Personal Standards dimensions), but this effect was stronger among girls. Physical activity measured at 12 -month follow-up was explained by functional <b>perfectionism</b> (Organization <b>and</b> Personal Standards dimensions), but this effect was stronger among boys. The effects were found after controlling for respective behaviors assessed at the baseline. Dysfunctional dimensions of global perfectionism (Concern over Mistakes, Parental Expectations, Parental Criticism, Doubts about Actions) were unrelated to indices of behavior at follow-up. Conclusions Functional global perfectionism may represent an individual resource variable, facilitating uptake and maintenance of healthy diet and physical activity, and therefore foster prevention of obesity among adolescents...|$|R

25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others.

What does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'.

500|$|Writers {{have pointed}} to the hand tremor that made writing {{difficult}} and to the alcoholism that afflicted him at numerous stages of his life. Others have argued that Sibelius's exalted status as a national hero effectively silenced him; he became afraid that any further major work would {{not live up to}} the expectations of the adoring nation. Andrew Barnett, another of the composer's many biographers, points to Sibelius's intense self-criticism; he would withhold or suppress anything that failed to meet his self-imposed standards: [...] "It was this attitude that brought about the destruction of the Eighth Symphony, but the very same trait forced him to keep on revising the Fifth until it was perfect." [...] The historian Mark McKenna agrees that Sibelius became stifled by a combination of <b>perfectionism</b> <b>and</b> increasing self-doubt. The myth, sustained for more than 15 years, that Sibelius was still working on the symphony was, according to McKenna, a deliberate fiction: [...] "To admit that he had stopped completely would be to admit the unthinkable—that he was no longer a composer".|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} effects of the “Big Five” {{personality}} dimensions <b>and</b> <b>perfectionism</b> on the eating attitudes and body dissatisfaction of young female ballet dancers, non-ballet dancers and non-dancers. It was hypothesised that ballet dancers would demonstrate more eating disorder symptomatology and higher neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>perfectionism</b> than non-ballet dancers and controls. Additionally, the study aimed to investigate whether the personality profile of ballet dancers is the sole cause of their increased risk of developing eating disorders, or whether other factors over and above this are contributing. A new scale termed the Eating Attitudes and Behaviours Questionnaire (EAB-Q) was developed based on the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa to access eating disorder symptomatology. In a cross-sectional design, 113 non-dancers, 57 non-ballet dancers and 39 ballet dancers were asked to complete an online questionnaire package assessing body shape perceptions (BSQ), personality (NEO-FFI), <b>perfectionism</b> (MPS-F) <b>and</b> eating cognitions (EAB-Q) respectively. Principle-components analysis was performed on the EAB-Q, revealing a single factor. This factor correlated significantly with the BSQ, so participants’ scores on the EAB-Q and BSQ were averaged creating a new scale: Attitudes to Eating and Body Shape (AEBS). Four General Linear Models were used to test the hypotheses. In agreement with the hypotheses, ballet dancers showed significantly more disordered eating, and higher neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>perfectionism</b> than non-ballet dancers and non-dancers. Ballet dancers displayed a similar personality profile to individuals with the most disturbed eating. In addition, high neuroticism was the most significant independent predictor of disordered eating in ballet dancers. It is concluded that ballet dancers are at an increased risk of developing eating disorders. This can be partly explained in terms of personality <b>and</b> <b>perfectionism.</b> Possible explanations for these findings are discussed along with suggestions for future research...|$|R
