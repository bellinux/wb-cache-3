40|$|Introduction Open {{smart cards}} like Java Card provide {{application}} developers {{an opportunity to}} develop rapidly applications by offering the possibility to download during <b>post</b> <b>issuance</b> application into the card. The main drawback {{with this kind of}} smart cards is the risk to download a hostile application that may exploit a faulty implementation module of the platform. Security is always a big concern for smart cards, but the issue is getting more intense with multi-applicative platforms, <b>post</b> <b>issuance</b> code downloading and the constant growth of the complexity. Allowing <b>post</b> <b>issuance</b> need to verify that the incoming applet respects the semantics of Java byte code. For this purpose a byte code verifier checks the code during load phase. Unfortunately {{due to the lack of}} smart card resources this piece of code has not yet been implemented on a smart card. As the correct design and implementation of the system is the key to shun an attack, we think that the byte code verifier as a key poi...|$|R

40|$|After {{years of}} {{attempts}} to reform its sixty-year-old patent law, in September of 2011 the United States enacted The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA). The law ushers in substantial changes in U. S. patent law and practice. Significant among the changes {{are a number of}} new trial proceedings though which third parties may challenge patents at U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) once the patent has issued. The AIA law introduced three new or revised <b>post</b> <b>issuance</b> inter partes proceedings: post-grant review, inter partes review, and a specialized post-grant review for certain business methods. These proceedings address rising concerns over a perceived proliferation of poor quality patents due to substantial increases in the number of patent applications in the U. S. The primary avenue for testing the validity of patents in the U. S. has been litigation, which is both costly and time consuming. A primary justification for the new <b>post</b> <b>issuance</b> proceedings was to provide a faster and less expensive alternative to litigation.

40|$|An {{interesting}} phenomenon for Chinese {{firms that}} list both in China and abroad {{is that the}} overwhelming majority first go public abroad and then return to the home market at a later date. We find that when these companies return to issue stock and list, they experience poorer post-issuance stock and operating performance in comparison to purely domestic issuers. Also, they raise more funds relative to their sales, leave less money on the table for investors, and incur lower direct floatation costs.

40|$|Abstract. In the Java Virtual Machine, the byte-code {{verifier}} checks low-level security {{properties that}} {{ensure that the}} downloaded code cannot bypass the virtual machine's security mechanisms. One of the statically ensured properties is type safety. The type-inference phase is the overwhelming resource-consuming part of the verification process. This paper addresses the RAM bottleneck met while verifying mobile code in memory-constrained environments such as smart-cards. We propose to modify the algorithm {{in a way that}} significantly reduces memory consumption. 1 Introduction The Java Card architecture for smart cards allows new applications, called applets, to be downloaded into smart-cards. While bringing considerable flexibility and extending the horizons of smart-card usage this <b>post</b> <b>issuance</b> feature raises major security issues. Upon their loading, malicious applets can try to subvert the JVM's security in a variety of ways. For example, they might try to overflow the stack, hoping to modify memory locations which they are not allowed to access, cast objects inappropriately to corrupt arbitrary memory areas or even modify other programs (Trojan horse attacks). While the general security issues raised by applet download are well known, transferring Java's safety model into resource-constrained devices such as smart-cards appears to require the devising of delicate security-performance trade-offs. Upon download, an applet's byte-code is subject to a static analysis called byte-code verification which purpose {{is to make sure that}} the applet's code is well-typed. This is necessary to ascertain that the code will not attempt to violate Java's security policy by performing ill-typed operations at runtime (e. g. forgin...|$|R
