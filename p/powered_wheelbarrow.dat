5000|$|A retired Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal Tank regiment, Peter Miller (1912 - 2006) {{conceived}} {{the idea in}} the aftermath of a period (1971 - 72) when the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) lost eight ATOs (Ammunition Technical Officers) on active duty in Northern Ireland: an appalling rate of attrition due to the limited options available to an operator faced with an IED. Tasked with finding a solution by Colonel George Styles, Miller [...] "remembered that he had invented a delightful labour-saving technique when he modified my lawnmower. This seemed a possible solution to the problem, so he went to a local garden centre with the intention of buying a gutted lawnmower. The sales manager suggested that the chassis of an electrically <b>powered</b> <b>wheelbarrow</b> might be suitable. He thought it was ideal and bought one on the spot." ...|$|E
40|$|The design, fabrication, {{and testing}} of a {{prototype}} of a wheelbarrow powered by a fuel cell is reported. Usually wheelbarrow does not have motor and need more energy to use. An conceptual study on this project is the idea on how the project can be done properly. The compact systems consist of hydrogen generator, fuel cell, motor and the wheelbarrow. The project focused on the conceptual study of system in the fuel cell that can be <b>powered</b> <b>wheelbarrow.</b> This research define the power of electric motor that need to move 80 kg load is 0. 082 kW for the minimum and 0. 22 kW for the maximum power with velocity 2. 78 m/s. Hydrogen generator cost also has been define, hydrogen cost for this project is RM 39. 90. Number of molar and molar mass of hydrogen has been calculated for move 80 kg load. The number of molar hydrogen is 0. 149 gmol/hr, and the number of molar mass of hydrogen is 3. 003 x 〖 10 〗^(- 4) (kgH_ 2) /(hr. A...|$|E
50|$|<b>Power</b> {{assisted}} <b>wheelbarrows</b> are {{now widely}} available {{from a number}} of different manufacturers. <b>Powered</b> <b>wheelbarrows</b> are used in a range of applications; the technology has improved to enable them to take much heavier loads, beyond weights that a human could transport alone without assistance. Motorized Wheelbarrows are generally either diesel powered or electric battery powered. Often used in small scale construction applications where access for larger plant machinery might be restricted.|$|R
50|$|The presenters are {{tasked with}} {{creating}} their own off-road mobility scooters for rambling in the Welsh countryside. Clarkson builds an eight-wheeler with two engines from two electric scooters, with lawnmower wheels. May makes an electric wheelchair and Hammond creates his machine from a mobility trike and a petrol <b>powered</b> builders' <b>wheelbarrow,</b> with a single wheel at the front and crawler tracks at the back The task ends with a race in the countryside against three wounded soldiers. Only Hammond manages to finish the race, with Clarkson's scooter falling down a hill into a set of trees, and May aborting the mission and getting stuck outside a pub near Crickhowell.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tool library}} adapted Share Starter's free [...] "Tool Library Starter Kit" [...] which {{includes}} start up guidelines, frequently asked questions, and sample documents. The library uses [...] "Local Tools" [...] from [...] "myTurn.com, PBC", a web-based inventory management system to track tool library members and to automatically display the tool availability online. The library has 1724+ specialized tools from power drills and ladders to pressure washers and roto-tillers to loan to community members with all skill levels welcomed. The inventory of equipment includes bike, carpentry and woodworking, electrical and soldering, home maintenance, ladders, measuring, metalworking, plumbing, remodelling, yard and garden. The types of equipment include: hand tools, power tools, propane & gas <b>power</b> tools, <b>wheelbarrows</b> & wagons.|$|R
40|$|In {{oil palm}} harvesting, falling fruit bunches have a {{considerable}} potential energy, {{which can be}} captured and used to <b>power</b> the <b>wheelbarrow</b> in evacuating the fruit bunches. This {{study was conducted to}} design a mechanism of oil palm fresh fruit bunches catchment and its potential energy utilization. The potential energy of falling fruit bunches during oil palm harvesting that stored in the flat spiral spring, and used to drive the wheelbarrow. The actual energy potential and torque performance of flat spiral spring was measured by using a torque and potential energy measuring apparatus. The results showed that the potential energy from falling fruit bunches could store in the flat spiral spring mechanism, with storage efficiency of 39. 39 %. By means of 1. 5 rotation of flat spiral spring, the maximum torque of the flat spiral spring was 53. 35 Nm. The utilization of potential energy that stored in the flat spiral spring has been successfully used to drive the wheelbarrow, with utilization efficiency of 80. 39 %. By using the potential energy of 38. 64 J, wheelbarrow could move as far as 0. 41 m to evacuate 48 kg of total weight loads...|$|R
40|$|In {{oil palm}} harvesting, falling fruit bunches have a {{considerable}} potential energy, {{which can be}} captured and used to <b>power</b> the <b>wheelbarrow</b> in evacuating the fruit bunches. This {{study was conducted to}} measure the engineering characteristics of fruit bunches harvesting, determine the best fruit bunches catchment platform material, analyze the potential energy of falling fresh fruit bunch, and design a conceptual design of the catchment platform and evacuation machine. Measurements of the characteristics of the harvesting were done in an oil palm plantation. Four types of fruit catchment platform materials were tested, namely: steel plate, wood board, expanded steel plate and rubber sheet. The results showed that, bunches fell at a distance between 0. 6 m to 1. 4 m from the tree. Fruit bunches weight was in the range of 16 kg to 32 kg. The rubber catchment platform was superior to the other materials in reducing the scattered loose fruits and bruised fruits. Potential energy of falling fruit bunches were in the range of 0. 44 - 4. 44 kJ. Theoretical traveling distance of the wheel barrow powered by the captured potential energy was in the range of 2. 27 m - 22. 98 m. Based on the data obtained, a conceptual design of catchment platform and evacuation machine was designed...|$|R
5000|$|ToolBank is a {{registered}} term or 'word mark' registered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office used to identify the nonprofit tool lending program model created by the Atlanta Community ToolBank. Each ToolBank increases the impact of its local charitable sector by lending tools to organizations {{for use in the}} fulfillment of their missions. The available inventory of a typical ToolBank includes tools for landscaping, carpentry, plumbing, masonry as well as <b>power</b> tools, ladders, <b>wheelbarrows,</b> and others. The Atlanta Community ToolBank is currently the largest ToolBank in existence, with nearly 200 tool types in its lending inventory. The available inventory of the Atlanta Community ToolBank can be found here. As of December 31, 2016, eight ToolBanks are currently lending tools in Atlanta GA, Baltimore MD, Charlotte NC, Cincinnati OH, Houston TX, Phoenix AZ, Portland OR, and Richmond VA, with the Chicago Community ToolBank projected to open in the summer of 2016. The national network of ToolBanks is administered by the parent organization ToolBank USA, which was founded in 2008 to replicate the impact of the Atlanta ToolBank in cities beyond Atlanta. In 2014, ToolBank USA launched ToolBank Disaster Services, a program to deliver tools to communities affected by disaster. ToolBanks loaned $5.8M worth of tools and equipment to charitable organizations in 2015.|$|R
