The nature of the proposed scheme is as follows: you pay a fixed amount of money for the next one year (an insurance premium) to a designated microfinance institution working with PlaNet Guarantee to cover your crops against dry spells during sowing and maturity. This amount could be paid weekly, every two weeks, or monthly depending on your preferred <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> and the type of insurance contract entered into. Only in the case of an officially acknowledged dry spell occurrence that you will get compensated for any losses incurred on your farms.

40|$|Conflicts between {{wildlife}} and humans {{have been reported}} {{from all over the}} world, but in Croatia the extent and intensity of the conflict is increasing. Agricultural damage by game is a major concern for both agricultural and wildlife agencies at the national level. In this study 4, 695 cases of game damage over a 4 -year period were analysed. Results indicated that the total amount of economic impact on agriculture from game damage was significant. The distribution of payments shows that a majority of payments have lower economic value with an average amount of single payment being 477. 08 €. The annual number of payments was found to have a negative correlation coefficient (- 0. 469) to the total payment amount for damages. According to the number of payments (68 % of the number of payments) and the payment amount (60 % of total payment amount), the crop most often damaged was maize. Analysis of the data found that there was a negative growth trend of <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> and total payment amount for grape vineyards. The correlation between yearly number of payments and yearly production was not calculated for any crop. The high seasonal nature of payments was a determent of seasonal regression using a dummy variable regression (r 2 = 0. 93). A comparison of the monthly number of payments and monthly amounts is depicted by a time series using a seasonal line. The impact of wild boar damage on agriculture crops, in total, leads to the conclusion that this game species is a major problem. The results showed a specific subset of game damage in Croatia and, as such, it can be extrapolated to provide insight into the damage caused by wild boar in other countries...|$|E

40|$|We use {{mechanism}} {{design to}} study efficient intertemporal payment arrangements when {{the ability of}} agents to perform certain welfare-improving transactions is subject to random and unobservable shocks. Efficiency is achieved via a payment system that assigns balances to participants, adjusts them based on the histories of transactions, and periodically resets them through settlement. Our analysis has several implications {{for the design of}} actual payment systems. Efficiency requires that, in order to overcome informational frictions, agents participating in transactions that do not involve monitoring frictions subsidize those that are subject to such frictions. Optimal settlement frequency should balance liquidity costs from settlement against the need to provide intertemporal incentives. Settlement costs must be borne by agents for whom the incentives to participate in the system are highest. Finally, an increase in settlement costs implies that, in order to counter a higher exposure to default, the frequency of settlement must increase and, at the same time, the volume of transactions must decrease. <b>Payment</b> Systems, <b>Frequency</b> of Settlement, Liquidity Costs, Subsidization across Transactions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of {{malpractice}} reforms on average malpractice <b>payment</b> awards, <b>frequency</b> of malpractice claims, and malpractice premiums for internists, surgeons, and OB/GYNs. We also empirically test the physician-induced demand (PID) hypothesis {{in the context of}} the medical malpractice environment. Our results suggest that caps on noneconomic damages and total damages as well as patient compensation funds are successful in reducing average payments, while damage caps and collateral source rule reform were found to lower malpractice claim incidence. When grouping claims by severity level, we find that noneconomic damage caps and patient compensation funds are more effective at reducing average payment with increasing severity level, while total damage caps induce the greatest reductions in payments for cases of medium severity. Also, noneconomic damage caps were found to only significantly decrease the incidence of medium severity claims. Implementation of total damage caps as well as modification of joint-and-several liability were associated with lower malpractice premiums for all specialists. Finally, we evaluate the notion of ‘defensive medicine’ by studying whether higher malpractice premiums result in greater Medicare payments. Increases of $ 10, 000 in OB/GYN premiums are estimated to result in a 0. 82 % rise in total spending. Of the reforms studied, modification of joint-and-several liability had the most significant and consistent effects in reducing Medicare reimbursements for all categories of spending analyzed, and total damage caps was also estimated to effectively slowing the growth of spending in specifications without premiums.

We define hardship financing as having to borrow money with interest or to sell assets to pay out-of-pocket healthcare costs. Methods Using survey data of 5, 383 low-income households in Orissa, one of the poorest states of India, we investigate factors influencing the risk of hardship financing {{with the use of a}} logistic regression. Results Overall, about 25 % of the households (that had any healthcare cost) reported hardship financing during the year preceding the survey. Among households that experienced a hospitalization, this percentage was nearly 40 %, but even among households with outpatient or maternity-related care around 25 % experienced hardship financing. Hardship financing is explained not merely by the wealth of the household (measured by assets) or how much is spent out-of-pocket on healthcare costs, but also by when the <b>payment</b> occurs, its <b>frequency</b> and its duration (e. g. more severe in cases of chronic illnesses). The location where a household resides remains a major predictor of the likelihood to have hardship financing despite all other household features included in the model. Conclusions Rural poor households are subjected to considerable and protracted financial hardship due to the indirect and longer-term deleterious effects of how they cope with out-of-pocket healthcare costs. The social network that households can access influences exposure to hardship financing. Our findings point to the need to develop a policy solution that would limit that exposure both in quantum and in time. We therefore conclude that policy interventions aiming to ensure health-related financial protection would have to demonstrate that they have reduced the frequency and the volume of hardship financing. </p...|$|R

The HTP has three phases: the first phase (launched in May 5, 2014) is focused on reducing OOP payments for inpatient services; the second phase (launched in May 22, 2014) is focused on primary healthcare (PHC) and the third phase utilizes an updated relative value units for health services (launched in September 29, 2014) and is focused on the elimination of informal payments.
