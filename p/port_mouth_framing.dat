50|$|This is a Paleozoic (Ordovician-Devonian) order, {{bearing a}} double row of plates (ambulacra) that abut across the arm axis either {{directly}} opposite one another or slightly offset. In contrast, modern ophiuroids {{have a single}} series of axial arm plates termed vertebrae. In stenurids, as in modern ophiuroids, lateral plates are present {{at the sides of}} ambulacrals, and prominent lateral spines are typical. Stenurids lack the dorsal and ventral arm shields that are found in most ophiuroids. Proximal ambulacral pairs can be partially separated, forming a buccal slit, an expansion of the <b>mouth</b> <b>frame.</b> The arms of some stenurids are slender and flexible, but those of others are broad and comparatively stiff. The central disk varies from little larger than the juncture of the arms to an expansion that extends most of the length of the arms. The content of the order is poorly established, and fewer than 10 genera are known.|$|R

40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} cycle of mercury (Hg) is affected {{not only by}} the physical, chemical and hydrological characteristics of the environment, but also by changes in productivity and biodiversity. In waters the complexes of Hg are related to the salinity and to the load of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the dissolved and in the particulate phases. Surface and bottom seawater were sampled along the Venetian coast at ten sites with different characteristics. Samples were analyzed employing hyphenated techniques and LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) were quantified. Although for some samples both the species were under the LOQ, the presence of methyl mercury (CH 3 Hg+) and ionic mercury (Hg 2 +) {{at the same time in}} surface and in bottom waters were observed. Variability in CH 3 Hg+ concentrations may be due to changes in the phytoplankton communities, which in turn may be affected by nutrient loads from the catchment area and <b>port</b> <b>mouths</b> of the Venice Lagoon. Thus, monitoring these nutrient loads may be essential for the health of the Venetian littoral system, since they may affect blooms, methylation and hyper-bioaccumulation along the trophic web, with effects on the environment and on human health...|$|R

500|$|On 23 June the Spanish fleet {{anchored}} off Porto Longone, {{where it}} was decided during a war council to relieve Orbetello after the most essential repairs had been made. Two days later several Dunkirkers were dispatched to force the Talamone's <b>port</b> <b>mouth,</b> and 8 ships arrived from Naples at Porto Santo Stefano, destroying or capturing about 70 tartanes and barges which contained the supplies of Thomas of Savoy's army during the operation. Du Daugnon, meanwhile, returned to Toulon. Despite his failure, reinforcements could later be carried to Talamone aboard five ships, and Linhares' attempts to dislodge the French siege lines were unsuccessful. Linhares disembarked 3.300 soldiers led by Pimienta, who divided them in two corps and advanced upon the French lines. The first one managed to occupy a hill on [...] which a French cavalry attack was repulsed, but the second corps was dislodged after a 6-hour battle and forced to reembark. 400 wounded men were evacuated; the killed were left on the battlefield. The siege was not lifted until an army under the Duke of Arcos and the Marquis of Torrecuso stormed the besieger camp a month later, killing or capturing over 7,000 men and taking all the artillery and the baggage, which turned the whole French campaign into a failure.|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The Extraxial-Axial Theory (EAT) {{is applied}} to the body wall homol-ogies of asteroids. Attempts to {{characterize}} major plate systems of asteroids as axial or extraxial, particularly those that are highly organized into series, can be problematic. However, the Optical Plate Rule (OPR) is instrumental in establishing that ambulacrals and terminals are axial. It is equally clear that the region aboral to the marginal frame {{is a part of the}} perforate extraxial body wall (with the possible exception of the centrodorsal, which is likely imperforate extraxial). Pre-viously established EAT criteria, particularly those strongly rooted in the embry-ologically expressed boundary between axial and extraxial body wall in larvae, suggest that marginals, and perhaps adambulacrals, are extraxial in origin. We also explore the extraxial nature and phylogenetic significance of the odontophore. Our data from both juveniles and adults show that plate and tube foot addition sequences occur according to the OPR, and shed light on poorly known homologies of the asteroid <b>mouth</b> <b>frame.</b> These data indicate that the mouth angle ossicle must at least contain the first ambulacral, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the first adambulacral also contributes to the construction of this ossicle. The interpretations provided by the EAT for all ossicles suggest a synapomorphy scheme for somasteroids, ophiuroids, and asteroids...|$|R
