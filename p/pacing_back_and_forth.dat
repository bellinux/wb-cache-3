5|$|The Bahá'ís, {{including}} Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after {{a journey}} by {{land and sea}} through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The inhabitants of Acre {{were told that the}} new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying. Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem visited Bahá'u'lláh in April 1871 and {{sent a letter to the}} editor printed in The Times in October. This seems to be the first extended commentary on Bahá'u'lláh in western newspapers. It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh, whose son, Mirzá Mihdí, died at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in prayer and meditation. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of Mazra'ih.|$|E
25|$|As {{young males}} mature and leave their {{maternal}} groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner {{and it is}} rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{in front of the}} other male. They seek out females only during mating time. When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.|$|E
500|$|Before concerts, as {{the others}} of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only {{in a pair of}} black shorts, {{grinding}} his teeth; to focus before the show, he would squeeze a pool ball. His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in Anacortes, Washington, Sub Pop critic Calvin Johnson wrote: [...] "Henry was incredible. <b>Pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen." ...|$|E

60|$|Sabor <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{beneath the}} tree for hours; four times she {{crouched}} and sprang at the dancing sprite above her, but {{might as well}} have clutched at the illusive wind that murmured through the tree tops.|$|R
500|$|Rehearsals {{began at}} Broadway's Belasco Theatre on February 2, 1949. [...] There was no formal chorus; {{each of the}} nurses and Seabees was given a name, and, {{in the case of}} the men, $50 to equip {{themselves}} with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. Don Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. [...] Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. [...] Of the mood backstage, [...] "everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive." [...] He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in Allegro), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. [...] He soon had the Seabees <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> like caged animals during [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage. [...] This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.|$|E
2500|$|Anxiety is {{an emotion}} {{characterized}} by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> somatic complaints, and rumination. It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death. Anxiety {{is not the same}} as fear, which is a response to a [...] real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat. Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Martha later {{suffered}} from ill health, including diabetes, and frequent childbirth further weakened her. Her {{mother had died}} young, and Martha lived with two stepmothers as a girl. A {{few months after the}} birth of her last child, she died on September 6, 1782, at the age of 33 with Jefferson at her bedside. Shortly before her death, Martha made Jefferson promise never to marry again, telling him that she could not bear to have another mother raise her children. Jefferson was grief-stricken by her death, relentlessly <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> nearly to the point of exhaustion. He emerged after three weeks, taking long rambling rides on secluded roads with his daughter Martha, by her description [...] "a solitary witness to many a violent burst of grief".|$|E
6000|$|Hendricks <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> {{around the}} small room. The air {{was full of}} smells of food and perspiration. The others watched him. Presently Tasso pushed through the curtain, into the other room. [...] "I'm {{going to take a}} nap." ...|$|R

60|$|As {{assassination}} is the {{one thing}} to be feared, the proprietors of the hostelries furnish armed guards, who <b>pace</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> through the sleeping-rooms day and night. The number of guards and gorgeousness of their trappings quite usually denote the status of the hotel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{disagreements}} {{between the}} Bahá'ís and the Azalís allowed the Ottoman and Persian authorities to exile Bahá'u'lláh once again. [...] Bahá'u'lláh {{and his family}} left Adrianople on August 12, 1868 and after a journey by land and sea arrived in Acre on August 31. [...] The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions on, and held very trying times for, Bahá'u'lláh. Mirzá Mihdí, Bahá'u'lláh's son, was suddenly killed {{at the age of}} twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in prayer and meditation. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bahá'u'lláh, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after Sultan `Abdu'l-`Aziz's death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places.|$|E
2500|$|When the Aggie {{football}} team is defeated at home (or {{run out of}} time, as Aggie tradition declares the A never loses), the crowd remains in the stands {{at the end of}} the game while the Aggie Yell Leaders conduct a short yell practice, including the singing of the song 12th Man, in preparation for the next week's game. [...] If the Aggies win a home football game, the freshmen in the Corps of Cadets chase them around Kyle Field behind the 20 yard line, and, once they are captured, carry them across campus and toss them into Fish Pond, a fountain full of cold water. [...] A Yell Practice follows after the last Yell Leader has been thrown in. [...] Meanwhile, the Aggie fans follow the Aggie Band as they leave Kyle Field and congregate in front of the A YMCA Building for another Yell Practice. [...] The soaking-wet Yell Leaders then join the crowd, <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> across the steps of the YMCA building as they lead the fans in a yell practice against the following week's opponent.|$|E
2500|$|Cornholio is an {{alter ego}} of Beavis. Though the Cornholio {{character}} {{was developed in}} the episode [...] "The Great Cornholio", Beavis first plays the entity as a passing gag in [...] "Generation in Crisis". Beavis sometimes undergoes a radical personality change, usually after consuming large amounts of sugar and/or caffeine. In [...] "Holy Cornholio", the transformation occurs after Beavis takes many pain pills. He pulls his shirt collar over his head, raises his forearms in a 90-degree angle next to his chest, and then begins to yell or scream erratically, producing a stream of gibberish and strange noises, his eyes wide. Cornholio is a normally dormant persona (apparently the name is derived from the word [...] "cornhole"). Cornholio tends to wander aimlessly while reciting [...] "I am the Great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!" [...] in an odd faux-Spanish accent. Sometimes Beavis will momentarily talk normally before resuming the persona of Cornholio. When he stops acting as the Cornholio persona, Beavis usually has no memory of what happened. In the guise of Cornholio, Beavis becomes a successful beat poet. In [...] "Vaya Con Cornholio" [...] he is deported to Mexico after wrongfully being subjected to immigration detention by an agent of the INS. During his detention the agent and his superior attempt {{to make sense of the}} gibberish, going so far as to look up the definition of [...] "bunghole". In that same episode, he claims to be from Lake Titicaca (because of the scatological sound of its name), but when asked where it is, he responds (incorrectly) with [...] "Nicaragua". Nicaragua may be one of the few things Beavis remembers from class lectures. Beavis' teacher Mr. Van Driessen refers to Nicaragua during a lecture on world economic systems in [...] "The Great Cornholio", after which Beavis repeats the word while <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in the classroom. Cornholio resurfaces in Bungholio, Lord of the Harvest, which he steals candy from everyone and Butt-Head tails him. He had stood up to Todd Ianuzzi, who demanded he move out of the road. He prepared to beat Beavis up in his Cornholio form with his friends. He later spares Beavis deeming him too insane, in favor of beating up the saner Butt-Head.|$|E

60|$|Then indeed did Numa roar. Angry, threatening, hungry, he <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{beneath the}} taunting ape-man.

60|$|Upon {{the slope}} below {{the city the}} loyal troops were {{advancing}} upon the enemy. Old Prince Ludwig <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> behind them, apparently oblivious to the rain of bullets about him.

25|$|The Niklashausen Journey, {{influenced}} by Jean-Luc Godard's Weekend and Glauber Rocha's Antonio das Mortes, consists {{of only about}} {{a dozen or so}} scenes, most of which are either theatrical tableaux where there is no movement of the characters and the camera darts from speaker to speaker or are shots where characters <b>pace</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> while giving revolutionary speeches about Marxist struggles and debates on economic theories.|$|R
60|$|From without Billy {{could hear}} the {{footsteps}} of the sentry <b>pacing</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> within fifty feet of him, all unconscious that the bank he was guarding was being looted almost beneath his eyes.
