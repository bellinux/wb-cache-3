40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence implicating increased {{production of the}} hydroxyl radical and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Significant amounts of hydroxyl radicals will be produced {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide and redox active iron via Fenton chemistry. Increased iron levels within the cytoplasm of vulnerable neurons suggest that this may also be an important site of oxidative activity. We investigated the likelihood that intracellular, rather than extracellular chelation of ferrous <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> iron may be more effective in reducing hydroxyl radical induced cell damage and preserving NAD+ levels and cell viability. Using intracellular NAD(H) measurements as an indicator of cell viability we found that membrane permeable ferrous chelators were most efficient in preserving cellular NAD+ levels. Hydrophilic, ferrous <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> chelators and lipophilic ferric chelators were essentially ineffective in preventing cellular NAD+ depletion when added at physiological concentrations. We propose that lipophilic ferrous chelators, due to their actions inside the cell, are effective agents for moderating neuronal damage in conditions such as AD where intracellular oxidative stress plays a significant role in disease pathology...|$|R

40|$|Mammalian cells {{accumulate}} iron from <b>ferric</b> citrate <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> nitrilotriacetate {{through the}} activity of a transferrin-independent iron transport system [Sturrock, Alexander, Lamb, Craven and Kaplan (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3139 - 3145]. The uptake system might recognize and transport ferric-anion complexes, or cells may reduce ferric iron at the surface and then transport ferrous iron. To distinguish between these possibilities we exposed cells to either [59 Fe]ferric citrate <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> [14 C]citrate and determined whether accumulation of iron was accompanied by the obligatory accumulation of citrate. In HeLa cells and human skin fibroblasts the rate of accumulation of iron was {{three to five times}} greater than that of citrate. Incubation of fibroblasts with <b>ferric</b> citrate <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> ammonium citrate resulted in an enhanced accumulation of iron and citrate; the molar ratio of accumulation approaching unity. A similar rate of citrate accumulation, however, was observed when ferric citrate-incubated cells were exposed to [14 C]citrate alone. Further studies demonstrated the independence of iron and citrate accumulation: addition of unlabelled citrate to cells decreased the uptake of labelled citrate without affecting the accumulation of 59 Fe; iron uptake was decreased by the addition of ferrous chelators whereas the uptake of citrate was unaffected; reduction of ferric iron by ascorbate increased the uptake of iron but had no effect on the uptake of citrate. When HeLa cells were depleted of calcium, iron uptake decreased, but there was little effect on citrate uptake. These results indicate that transport of iron does not require the obligatory transport of citrate and vice versa. The mammalian transferrin-independent iron transport system appears functionally similar to iron transport systems in both the bacterial and plant kingdoms which require the activities of both a surface reductase and a ferrous metal transporter...|$|R

40|$|Fortifying {{food with}} iron {{has been widely}} studied as a {{strategy}} to prevent iron deficiency anaemia. This work comparatively assessed the bioavailability of two forms of iron, ferrous gluconate <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> pyrophosphate encapsulated in liposomes (lipofer), when used as fortificants in meat pate. Three groups of growing rats consumed during 28 days either a control diet (AIN- 93 G), or two diets prepared with enriched pate as the unique source of iron and fat. Body weight and diet intake were measured weekly, and {{during the last week}} faeces were collected. On day 28 animals were sacrificed, livers and spleens were removed and stored. Haemoglobin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were determined. There were not significant differences among the three groups in body weight and apparent iron absorption, although food intake in the two pate groups was significantly higher compared to the control group. There were not differences in liver and spleen iron content and concentration, neither in haemoglobin and TIBC values. These results indicated that iron bioavailability of pate enriched with ferrous gluconate <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> pyrophosphate encapsulated in liposomes was similar, and thus both sources of iron are good candidates to be used as fortifiers in meat based products. The present outcome needs to be validated in humans. © 2007 SAGE Publications. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In Taiwan, Japan, and China, {{methyl ethyl ketone}} {{peroxide}} (MEKPO) {{has caused}} many severe thermal explosions owing to its thermal instability and reactivity originating from the complexity of its structure. This study focused on the incompatible features of MEKPO as detected by calorimetry. The thermal decomposition and runaway behaviors of MEKPO with about 10 wt. % incompatibilities, such as H 2 SO 4, HCl, NaOH, KOH, FeCl 3, and FeSO 4, were analyzed by dynamic calorimeter, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and adiabatic calorimeter, vent sizing package 2 (VSP 2). Thermokinetic data, such as onset temperature, heat of decomposition, adiabatic temperature rise, and self-heat rate, were obtained and assessed. Experimental data were used for determining the incompatibility rating on hazards. From the thermal curves of MEKPO with assumed incompatible substances detected by DSC, all the onset temperatures in the other tests occurring earlier advanced, especially with alkaline <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> materials. In some tests, significant incompatible reactions were found. Adiabatic runaway behaviors for simulating the worst case scenario were performed by using VSP 2. These calorimetric data led to the same results that the alkaline <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> solution was the most incompatible with MEKPO. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis {{requires}} iron, and in {{the absence}} of iron alters its gene expression to increase iron acquisition and to make the best use of the iron it has. During different stages of colonization and infection available iron sources differ, particularly the host iron-binding proteins haemoglobin, transferrin, and lactoferrin. This study compared the transcriptional responses of N. meningitidis, when grown in the presence of these iron donors and ferric iron, using microarrays. Specific transcriptional responses to the different iron sources were observed, including genes that are not part of the response to iron restriction. Comparisons between growth on haemoglobin and either transferrin or lactoferrin identified changes in 124 and 114 genes, respectively, and 33 genes differed between growth on transferrin or lactoferrin. Comparison of gene expression from growth on haemoglobin <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> iron showed that transcription is also affected by the entry of either haem <b>or</b> <b>ferric</b> iron into the cytoplasm. This is consistent with a model in which N. meningitidis uses the relative availability of host iron donor proteins as niche indicators. Growth in the presence of haemoglobin is associated with a response likely to be adaptive to survival within the bloodstream, which is supported by serum killing assays that indicate growth on haemoglobin significantly increases survival, and the response to lactoferrin is associated with increased expression of epithelial cell adhesins and oxidative stress response molecules.
