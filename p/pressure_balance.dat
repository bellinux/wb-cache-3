5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie Option would mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by Earth <b>Pressure</b> <b>Balance</b> Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie Option would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, {{there would have been a}} cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this option would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth Option would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie Option would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.|$|E

The use of some analytical procedures for the characterization of the <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> (also known as piston gauges) becomes more difficult especially for the case of geometries with composite cylinders. Those geometries were also studied with the analytical method developed by the author[1] (based on a simplified model) and described in this paper. This method was also reported in some not original publications from 2003 to 2007.

The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial , but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum. This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of [...] allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs. Six machines were used, all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels. Towards {{the completion of the}} undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled. A [...] gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} interest in high-pressure primary standards {{has given rise}} {{in recent years to}} particular attention to the design and metrological characterisation of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances.</b> To this purpose several simplified and empirical methods are generally used but most of them are not applicable to complex units and they do not allow an optimum design of the unit. The present study is based on a finite-element method developed by the University of Cassino and the CNR-IMGC (Istituto di Metrologia ``G Colonnetti'') of Turin. This method is applied to different kinds of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> to underline its efficiency in metrological characterisation. Finally, the design problems regarding <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> are analysed with particular reference to the dimensional optimisation and to tolerance effects. ...|$|R

[...] Innovative method using Two-Depth Transorbital Doppler (TDTD) of intracranial pressure quantitative absolute (ICP) value measurement relies on the same fundamental principle as used to measure blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. A sphygmomanometer works using a <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> principle - an air-filled pressure cuff wrapped around the arm compresses the brachial artery {{to a point where}} blood can no longer flow. Externally applied pressure is equal to systolic blood pressure in this case. The examiner slowly releases the air from the cuff and uses a stethoscope to listen for the return of blood flow. At the <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> point, where pressure in the cuff equals systolic artery pressure, a ‘whooshing’ noise can be heard as blood flows through the artery again. <b>Pressure</b> <b>balance</b> based non-invasive blood pressure meter does not need a patient specific calibration.|$|E
