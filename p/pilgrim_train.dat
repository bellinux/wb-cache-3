40|$|This paper {{presents}} a crowd simulation system which simulates {{the movement of}} pilgrims in performing one of Hajj rituals, which is Tawaf. Tawaf is a unique case study due to its capacity and various set of pilgrims. Furthermore, {{the density of the}} crowd is extremely high. Tawaf also consist a certain set of rules and regulations that must be followed by the pilgrims. Social Force Model had been chosen to give each agent in the simulation a specific behavior to be followed. The algorithm also specifies how the agents interact with each other to generate collision free movements. To make the simulations {{as close as possible to}} real world scenarios, each agent varies in term of age, gender and behavior. The subjective evaluation of the system revealed that it can be used in <b>pilgrim</b> <b>training</b> before performing the actual Tawaf...|$|R

2500|$|Once preserved, 50002 {{became the}} first class 50 to operate a train for a private {{excursion}} on the South Devon Railway (April 1992), while 50031 {{was the first to}} operate a train for fare paying passengers (Severn Valley Railway May 1992). [...] 50031 was also the first to operate on the mainline, hauling the Past Time Railtours <b>Pilgrim</b> Hoover <b>train</b> from Birmingham International to Plymouth on 1 November 1997. Since then several other members of the class have also been passed for use on Network Rail (was Railtrack) lines. However, with changes in the UK's Rail Access regulations (requiring fitment of additional equipment: TPWS/OTMR/GSMR) some of these locos are no longer of a standard to continue mainline operation. At Present, 50007, 50008, 50017, 50044, 50049 & 50050 are passed for main line running. The owner of 50021 & 50026 aims to restore them to mainline use in the near future.|$|R
50|$|It is {{traditional}} for pilgrims to wear white clothing and conical straw hats and to carry walking sticks. While the route was historically traveled by foot, today pilgrims usually use cars or <b>trains.</b> <b>Pilgrims</b> record their progress {{with a prayer}} book (Nōkyō-chō), which the temple staff mark with red stamps and Japanese calligraphy indicating the temple number, the temple name, and the specific name of the Kannon image. Some pilgrims receive the stamps and calligraphy on wall scrolls (for a decorative hanging) and on their white coats (to be cremated in) as well.|$|R

These include Itwari, Ajni, Kalamna, Khapri, Godhni, Bharatwada, Gumgaon, Kapmtee, Kanhan, Ramtek, Butibori. Itwari has been recently converted into terminus by South East Central Railway. It is the terminus for many passenger and local MEMU trains. Local trains run from Itwari to various north, north-east and eastern sub-suburbs of Nagpur, Ramtek>>Kanhan>>Kamptee>>Kalamna>>Itwari being the hottest for <b>pilgrims.</b> Many passenger <b>trains</b> to destinations like Chhindwara (Narrow Gauge), Jabalpur, Raipur, Gondia, Tatanagar, originate here. Apart from that many trains running on Nagpur-Howrah route halt here. Itwari is mostly used by traders and businessmen from North, North-east suburbs and eastern parts of Nagpur.|$|R

One locomotive, 50017, was hired to Venice Simplon Orient Express (VSOE) to work the Northern Belle service from Bath to Manchester Victoria. As part of the contract it was painted in LMS-style maroon livery. Following this, the loco spent many years dumped at Tyseley locomotive works before being sold to a private individual. The loco has now been restored to working order at the Plym Valley Railway.|$|R

6000|$|Sir Luke had clean forgotten--so Densher read--the rather {{remarkable}} {{young man}} he had formerly gone about with, though he picked him up again, on the spot, with one large quiet look. The young man felt himself so picked, and the thing immediately affected him as the proof of a splendid economy. Opposed to all the waste with which he was now connected the exhibition was of a nature quite nobly to admonish him. The eminent <b>pilgrim,</b> in the <b>train,</b> all the way, had used the hours as he needed, thinking not a moment in advance of what finally awaited him. An exquisite case awaited him--of which, in this queer way, the remarkable young man was an outlying part; but the single motion of his face, the motion into which Densher, from the platform, lightly stirred its stillness, was his first renewed cognition. If, however, he had suppressed the matter by leaving Victoria he would at once suppress now, in turn, whatever else suited. The perception of this became {{as a symbol of}} the whole pitch, so far as one might one's self be concerned, of his visit. One saw, our friend further meditated, everything that, in contact, he appeared to accept--if only, for much, not to trouble to sink it: what one missed was the inward use he made of it. Densher began wondering, at the great water-steps outside, what use he would make of the anomaly of their having there to separate. Eugenio had been on the platform, in the respectful rear, and the gondola from the palace, under his direction, bestirred itself, with its attaching mixture of alacrity and dignity, on their coming out of the station together. Densher didn't at all mind now that, he himself of necessity refusing a seat on the deep black cushions beside the guest of the palace, he had Milly's three emissaries for spectators; and this susceptibility, he also knew, it was something to have left behind. All he did was to smile down vaguely from the steps--they could see him, the donkeys, as shut out as they would. [...] "I don't," [...] he said with a sad headshake, [...] "go there now." ...|$|R
