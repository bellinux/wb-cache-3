5|$|In {{the gold}} rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic material as they searched for <b>pure</b> <b>gold,</b> and {{it was used to}} fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} known anecdote about Archimedes tells {{of how he}} invented a method for {{determining}} the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to Vitruvius, a votive crown for a temple had been made for King Hiero II of Syracuse, who had supplied the <b>pure</b> <b>gold</b> to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had {{to solve the problem}} without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density.|$|E
5|$|Pedro II was acclaimed, crowned and consecrated on 18 July 1841. He {{wore a white}} robe {{that had}} belonged to his {{grandfather}} Francis II, an orange pallium made of feathers from the Guianan cock-of-the-rock (a homage to Brazil's birds and indigenous Brazilian chieftains) woven by Tiriyó Indians especially for the emperor and a green mantle emblazoned with branches of cacao and tobacco, both symbols of the Brazilian empire. After being anointed, he received the Imperial insignia (the Imperial Regalia of Brazil): the Sword (which had belonged to his father), the Scepter (of <b>pure</b> <b>gold</b> with a wyvern on its tip, symbol of the House of Braganza), the Imperial Crown (made especially for the coronation with jewels removed from Pedro I’s crown), the Globe, and the Hand of Justice.|$|E

5|$|Rick leads Evelyn and {{her party}} to the city, where the group {{encounters}} a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick's cowardly colleague Beni Gabor. The expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Against Ardeth's advice to leave the city, the two expeditions continue to excavate. Evelyn searches for the famous Book of the Living, a book made of <b>pure</b> <b>gold.</b> Instead of finding the book, she, Rick, and Jonathan stumble upon the statue of Anubis {{and the remains of}} Imhotep buried underneath. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs.|$|E
5|$|William Legrand has {{relocated}} from New Orleans to Sullivan's Island in South Carolina {{after losing}} his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, {{a friend of}} Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of <b>pure</b> <b>gold.</b> Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for safekeeping. Confused, the narrator takes his leave for the night.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} breweries, {{occasional}} special brews were commissioned upon commemorative dates and retirement of long-serving employees. In 1991 a special bottled beer was produced when Sheffield Wednesday reached the finals of the Football League Cup. Two thousand bottles of Stones Centenary Ale were produced in 1995, celebrating 100 years of rugby league. This {{was followed by}} the 1996 cask conditioned Stones Super League Bitter (4.8 per cent ABV) celebrating Stones' sponsorship of the League, and the 1998 bottled Stones Commemorative Ale which marked the scheduled closure of the brewery. In summer 2007, Everards brewed a one-off cask conditioned Stones <b>Pure</b> <b>Gold</b> (4.1 per cent ABV) golden ale, and in 2011 four cask conditioned sports themed Stones branded ales were made available throughout {{the first half of the}} year, brewed at William Worthington's Brewery in Burton upon Trent.|$|E

5|$|The athletes or teams who place first, second, {{or third}} in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now {{gold-plated}} silver. Every gold medal however must contain {{at least six}} grams of <b>pure</b> <b>gold.</b> The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths. The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics {{as a measure of}} success.|$|E
5|$|With Hagrid's help, Harry {{prepares for}} and {{undertakes}} {{his first year}} of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced {{to many of the}} primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a gifted, bright, and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage. Harry also encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him, the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with, and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team, a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into <b>pure</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{creating}} jewellery, gemstones, coins, {{or other}} precious items are often used, {{and they are}} typically set into precious metals. Alloys of nearly every metal known have been encountered in jewellery. Bronze, for example, was common in Roman times. Modern fine jewellery usually includes gold, white gold, platinum, palladium, titanium, or silver. Most contemporary gold jewellery is made of an alloy of gold, the purity of which is stated in karats, indicated by a number followed by the letter K. American gold jewellery must be of at least 10K purity (41.7% <b>pure</b> <b>gold),</b> (though in the UK the number is 9K (37.5% <b>pure</b> <b>gold)</b> and is typically found up to 18K (75% <b>pure</b> <b>gold).</b> Higher purity levels are less common with alloys at 22 K (91.6% <b>pure</b> <b>gold),</b> and 24 K (99.9% <b>pure</b> <b>gold)</b> being considered too soft for jewellery use in America and Europe. These high purity alloys, however, are widely used across Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually sterling silver, or 92.5% fine silver. In costume jewellery, stainless steel findings are sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Navoiy {{region has}} {{significant}} natural resources, especially natural gas, petroleum, and precious metals, plus {{raw materials for}} construction.

25|$|Although the {{neighboring}} city of Dahlonega {{was known as}} the first site of gold in the United States, the Blairsville area was known to have the <b>purest</b> <b>gold</b> in the mountains.

25|$|Invented by Emil Wohlwill in 1874, this {{produces}} the highest purity gold (99.999%). It is an electrolytic process using <b>pure</b> <b>gold</b> for the cathode (or titanium {{as a starter}} cathode) and chloroauric acid (gold chloride-hydrochloric acid) as the electrolyte; this is made by dissolving gold with chlorine gas {{in the presence of}} hydrochloric acid. Gold is dissolved at the anode, and <b>pure</b> <b>gold,</b> traveling through the acid by ion transfer, is plated onto the cathode. Silver forms an insoluble chloride slime and copper and platinum form soluble chlorides that are removed. This procedure is used on a very large industrial scale and has a large set up cost due to the amount of gold that needs to be permanently dissolved in the electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|Some dealers {{have complained}} about the {{production}} quality of the Gold Maples.
