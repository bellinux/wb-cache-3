He was awarded the Albert Medal for this act on the <b>personal</b> <b>recommendation</b> of General Hugh Trenchard, and in February 1916 was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of Training No. 6 Wing in England.

25|$|Eager to {{establish}} his own legitimacy, Zhu Di voided the Jianwen Emperor's reign and established a wide-ranging effort to destroy or falsify records concerning his childhood and rebellion. This included a massive purge of the Confucian scholars in Nanjing and grants of extraordinary extralegal authority to the eunuch secret police. One favorite was Zheng He, who employed his authority to launch major voyages of exploration into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The difficulties in Nanjing also led the Yongle Emperor to re-establish Beiping (present-day Beijing) as the new imperial capital. He repaired and reopened the Grand Canal and, between 1406 and 1420, directed {{the construction of the}} Forbidden City. He was also responsible for the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, considered one of the wonders of the world before its destruction by the Taiping rebels in 1856. As part of his continuing attempt to control the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, the Yongle Emperor also greatly expanded the imperial examination system in place of his father's use of <b>personal</b> <b>recommendation</b> and appointment.

Competence Description for Personal Recommendations: The {{importance}} of identifying {{the complexity of}} learning and performance situations. Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 11 (3), 141 - 152. For competences development of learners and professionals, target competences and corresponding competence development opportunities have to be identified. Personal Recommender Systems (PRS) provide <b>personal</b> <b>recommendations</b> for learners aimed at finding and selecting learning activities that best match their needs. This article argues that a clear-cut description {{of the concept of}} ‘competence’ is needed for appropriate system-based <b>personal</b> <b>recommendations.</b> We proposed to extend current initiatives on standardization of modelling competences with the concept of ‘Learning and performance situation’ (LP-situation) and claimed that this extension has added value for <b>personal</b> <b>recommendations</b> for adequate selection of learning activities, for determining proficiency levels of competences, for the design of learning tasks, and for accreditation of prior knowledge.

Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate CSTM’s performance.

Greenglass would later claim that he lied at the trial in order [...] "to protect himself and his wife, Ruth, and that he was encouraged by the prosecution to do so." [...] Cohn always took great pride in the Rosenberg verdict and claimed to have played an even greater part than his public role.

2500|$|Born in Cluj (Kolozsvár), Lívia Rusz {{was from}} a Hungarian-Romanian family. She {{grew up in a}} mixed environment, among local Hungarians and Romanians, and, {{according}} to her own recollection: [...] "My road was opened by a school with exceptional spirituality, where I was taught to respect and maintain traditions, to treasure the eternal cultural values, to preserve and take care of our identity so as not to offend the others". Her father, Liviu, was a Romanian Railways employee, amateur artist and calligrapher, who had undergone formal training with painter Sándor Szopos. Rusz was herself avid to train in visual art, copying his paintings, learning how to use watercolors, and entering a class run by Szopos. After graduating from primary school, Rusz continued her education at a high school in her native city, where her talents brought her to the attention of painter and academic Zoltán Kovács. On Kovács' <b>personal</b> <b>recommendation,</b> she applied for the Cluj Art Institute upon passing her baccalaureate examination, and completed her training in 1955. She declared herself [...] "lucky" [...] to have been taught by Kovács, [...] "an artist with virtues recognized even by those who undermined him". As a result of this training and influence, she came to define herself as a [...] "conservative", who did not [...] "renew [...] whenever the fashion changes." [...] Rusz was Assistant at the Institute for the following three years, losing her post to an administrative restructuring.|$|E
