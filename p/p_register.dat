40|$|Aims:  To {{conduct a}} service {{evaluation}} of usability and utility on-line clinical audit tools developed {{as part of}} a UK Classification of Diabetes project to improve the categorisation and ultimately management of diabetes. Method:  We conducted the evaluation in eight volunteer computerised practices all achieving maximum pay-for-performance (P 4 P) indicators for diabetes; two allowed direct observation and videotaping of the process of running the on-line audit. We also reported the utility of the searches and the national levels of uptake. Results:  Once launched 4235 unique visitors accessed the download pages in the first 3  months. We had feedback about problems from 10 practices, 7 were human error. Clinical audit naive staff ran the audits satisfactorily. However, they would prefer more explanation and more user-familiar tools built into their practice computerised medical record system. They wanted the people misdiagnosed and misclassified flagged and to be convinced miscoding mattered. People with T 2 DM misclassified as T 1 DM tended to be older (mean 62 vs. 47  years old). People misdiagnosed as having T 2 DM have apparently 'excellent' glycaemic control mean HbA 1 c 5. 3 % (34  mmol/mol) vs. 7. 2 % (55  mmol/mol) (p <  0. 001). People with vague codes not included in the P 4 <b>P</b> <b>register</b> (miscoded) have worse glycaemic control [HbA 1 c 8. 1 % (65  mmol/mol) SEM =  0. 42 vs. 7. 0 % (53  mmol/mol) SEM =  0. 11, p =  0. 006]. Conclusions:  There was scope to improve diabetes management in practice achieving quality targets. Apparently 'excellent' glycaemic control may imply misdiagnosis, while miscoding is associated with worse control. On-line clinical audit toolkits provide a rapid method of dissemination and should be added to the armamentarium of quality improvement interventions. 11871...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The state-explosion problem limits formal {{verification}} on large sequential circuits {{partly because the}} sizes of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) sizes heavily depend {{on the number of}} variables dealt with. In the worst case, a BDD size grows exponentially with the number of variables. Thus, reducing this number can possibly increase the verification capacity. In particular, this paper shows how sequential equivalence checking can be done in the sum state space. Given two finite state machines I and P with numbers of state variables I and P, respectively, conventional formal methods verify equivalence by traversing the state space of the product machine with I C <b>P</b> <b>registers.</b> In contrast, this paper introduces a different possibility, based on partitioning the state space defined by a multiplexed machine, which can have merely �— � I P CIregisters. This substantial reduction in state variables potentially enables the verification of larger instances. Experimental results show the approach can verify benchmarks with up to 312 registers, including all of the control outputs of microprocessor 8085.

The decompressional component of the exhumation history has induced a statical growth of Spl-pyroxene/Spl-Amph symplectites after Grt in the Grt-peridotites and of Cpx-Pl/Amph-Pl in the eclogites. Textures and T estimates obtained from primary pre-exsolution pyroxene porphyroclasts in Grt-peridotites suggest that these could come from a high-T mantle environment, possibly a mantle wedge overlying a subducting slab, and may have been incorporated as sliced fragments into the crust during the Variscan collision. Metasomatism in the Grt-peridotites seems to confirm this origin. This article demonstrates that the Ulten zone probably represents a deep fragment of the Variscan belt, slightly reworked during the Alpine orogeny. Hence, this poses the problem of the possible occurrence of Variscan remnants with a European affinity in the Austroalpine system (i. e., African plate) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality in Ethiopia. Treatment usually involves lifelong medication use. Enalapril is a common drug for the treatment of hypertension in Ethiopia. However, the drug is expensive and, therefore, there is limited capacity for people to afford the treatment. Locally produced Enalapril is a cost-effective solution to treat the disease. However, as local medicines regulation does not include bioequivalence tests on locally produced drugs, physicians and patients need assurance about the effectiveness and safety of local generics. Evidence on therapeutic equivalence is needed on these untested local drugs. Methods: This is a hospital-based, randomized, partially blinded, three-cycle crossover trial in single patients, comparing a locally produced version of enalapril with enalapril imported from Europe. Patients involved in this trial are not blinded, as there is no local facility to produce relatively small numbers of placebos or encapsulated drugs. To ensure blinding of study investigators and data analysts, study medications are prepared by an independent pharmacy unit using opaque medication packaging. The importance of maintaining blinding is also part of patient pre-trial education. Each N-of- 1 trial will consist of three successive 14 -day treatment pairs, each pair comprising 7 days of 5 - 20 mg local and 7 days of 5 - 20 mg imported enalapril taken once daily in the morning. The primary outcome will be the average difference in systolic blood pressure as measured by home blood pressure measurements. Discussion: The number of locally produced products, such as enalapril, being approved without proof of bioequivalence is dramatically increasing. By bridging the information gap on bioequivalence, the trial will give rigorous evidence on therapeutic equivalence of locally produced enalapril in the treatment of hypertension. If there is no difference, the hypothesized result, then patients can take the local medicine with confidence. This trial will also will determine whether aggregated N-of- 1 studies are feasible to evaluate untested generic drugs in resource-limited countries where bioequivalence testing centers are unavailable.
