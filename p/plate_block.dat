2500|$|Before 1912 the {{delivery}} of parcels was controlled and handled by private companies, most of whom operated in cities and urban areas where there was more business to be had. Consequently, delivery of parcels to rural areas was inadequate and frequently hindered farmers who needed various supplies, parts and equipment delivered to their remote locations. To meet this demand Congress approved a law on August 24, 1912 creating postal rates for fourth class mail and providing for parcel post service. The Congressional law authorized the U.S. Post Office to produce the various special purpose postage stamps to pay the parcel fees, which became effective on January 1, 1913, the first day the U.S. Parcel Post began service. The 12 stamps were printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on the flat plate printing press on soft yellowish wove paper made with a single-line watermark bearing the letters 'U S P S' and were perforated with 12 gauge [...] The stamps were designed by Clair Aubrey Houston {{who at the time}} had worked at the Bureau for ten years, while the dies for the individual stamps were produced by several different engravers, with up to four engravers working on each die. The Post Office initially planned to place all dozen stamps on sale before parcel post service began, but Frank Hitchcock, the Postmaster General, deemed the original designs for the 3-cent, 50-cent and 75-cent denominations unsatisfactory, delaying the issue of those values until {{after the first of the}} year. The twelve stamps each bore their own distinctive subject in the vignette and were issued in a single color, [...] "carmine-rose". It was Hitchcock who came up with the idea of printing all the denominations of these stamps in one uniform color. However, because of the common color and similarity in border design Parcel Post stamps during the first six months of use were met with mixed reaction from postal personnel who had difficulty distinguishing the stamps at a glance and often confused the denominations, especially during busy hours. [...] "In an effort to help the stamp clerks an inscription of value in large plain capital letters was added to the [...] margin, next to each plate number. These were first added to plates on January 27, 1913." [...] An example of these large red spelled-out numbers, which appeared on two margins of each pane, can be seen on the illustration of the ten-cent <b>plate</b> <b>block</b> in the section [...] "Other configurations" [...] further down this page. [...] To compound the situation the stamps were larger than ordinary definitive stamps of the period, making it difficult to situate them on smaller parcels with limited space around the address and return address. They were also issued in sheets of 180, with four panes of 45 stamps per sheet, which was an inconvenient number for accounting purposes. By March the Postmaster General was considering using different colors for the individual stamps and a smaller, definitive-sized design [...] (for which plates of the 1 cent, 2 cent and 5 cent denominations were even engraved). Production of the Parcel Post sheets cut into 45 stamps each resulted in a somewhat higher percentage of stamps with straight edges (see image below) than other stamp productions, much to the disappointment of collectors at the time. Some philatelic publishers like Stanley Gibbons were rather unforgiving in their estimation of these new issues, referring to them as [...] "very useless stamps" [...] having an [...] "ugliness" [...] about them.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{practice}} in <b>plate</b> <b>block</b> collecting varies by country and era; the classic 20th century US <b>plate</b> <b>block</b> {{consisted of a}} 2 x 3 block in the middle top, bottom and/or sides of the sheet for flat plate issues (a 2 x 2 block {{in the corner of}} the sheet for rotary press issues). Ambitious collectors will seek to own blocks displaying every known plate number for the stamp; specialized stamp catalogs will list these.

5000|$|Corner <b>blocks</b> or <b>plate</b> <b>blocks</b> - {{compose a}} block of stamps {{from one of the}} four corners of the stamp sheet. Collectors usually opt for {{a block of}} four stamps, {{complete}} with the selvage area which will sometimes have the printing details on it.|$|R

5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s, United States stamps {{included}} {{two rows of}} stamps attached {{to one another in}} a block of four or more, with printing information, including the printing plate number, on attached margin paper. A number is used to identify one specific plate or cylinder used to print the stamps. [...] Then <b>plate</b> <b>block</b> collecting changed in the US due to the addition of up to eight multi-digit numbers which represented different colors used to print the stamps. The numbers were printed along the selvage. This meant collectors needed many more stamps to save a single <b>plate</b> <b>block.</b> This lasted for about ten years before the post office reverted to the traditional single number for most stamps. In a press release dated Dec. 10, 1980, the postal service announced a new plate numbering system that would, except in cases where more than four designs appear on a pane, [...] "establish a <b>plate</b> <b>block</b> as consisting of four stamps regardless of the number of inks used or the press used to print the stamps." [...] Now, new issues often begin with a number such as [...] "11111," [...] with each digit in a different color. Stamps printed in large quantities may have multiple plate numbers so the next plate combination might be identified as [...] "22222" [...] and so on.|$|E

Miller pre-1925) to form a complete collection of 19th century United States postage stamps. In October 2005, he purchased at auction for $2.97 million a unique <b>plate</b> <b>block</b> of the famous 1918 24-cent U.S. airmail stamps known as the [...] "Inverted Jenny," [...] featuring an engraving of a Curtiss JN-4 biplane printed upside-down. He then traded the Inverted Jenny <b>plate</b> <b>block</b> to Donald Sundman, President of Mystic Stamp Company, a stamp dealer, for a 1-cent 1868 [...] "Z Grill" [...] depicting Benjamin Franklin (one of only two known to exist), thus completing Gross's 19th century collection.|$|E
50|$|Printmakers apply {{color to}} their prints in many {{different}} ways. Some coloring techniques include positive surface roll, negative surface roll, and A la poupée. Often color in printmaking that involves etching, screenprinting, woodcut, or linocut is applied by either using separate <b>plates,</b> <b>blocks</b> or screens or by using a reductionist approach. In multiple plate color techniques, a number of <b>plates,</b> screens or <b>blocks</b> are produced, each providing a different color. Each separate <b>plate,</b> screen, or <b>block</b> will be inked up in a different color and applied in a particular sequence to produce the entire picture. On average about 3 to 4 plates are produced, but there are occasions where a printmaker may use up to seven plates. Every application of another plate of color will interact with the color already applied to the paper, and this must {{be kept in mind}} when producing the separation of colors. The lightest colors are often applied first, and then darker colors successively until the darkest.|$|R

Definition: Printing {{is the art}} of taking an impression from an inked form, <b>plate,</b> <b>block</b> or stone. 2. Branches: There are several distinct branches of this important art, and each branch is, practically, a separate art, distinct from its rivals in its theory, its processes, and its applications. These methods are: (a) Steel-plate and Copper-plate Printing, in which the subject is printed from an etching or engraving below the surface of a plate of steel or copper. (b) Lithography, in which the subject is printed from a transferred engraving on the surface of a prepared stone. (c) Xylography, in which the subject is printed from a design engraved on a block of wood in high relief. (d) Typography, in which the subject is printed from a combination of movable metal types cast in high relief. The arts of lithography and copper-plate are useful and beautiful methods of printing, but they do not make books and newspapers. The necessity which compels the making of a new engraving for every new subject restricts them almost exclusively to the field of art and ornament. If no other method of printing were known, encyclopedias and newspapers would be impossibilities. "The art preservative of all arts" is not the art of lithography nor of copper-plate. This distinction rightfully belongs to typography only...|$|E
