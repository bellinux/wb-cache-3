50|$|A variant race attack (which {{has been}} called a Finney attack by {{reference}} to Hal Finney) requires the participation of a miner. Instead of sending both <b>payment</b> requests (<b>to</b> pay Bob and Alice with the same coins) to the network, Eve issues only Alice's <b>payment</b> request <b>to</b> the network, while the accomplice tries to mine a block that includes the <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> Bob instead of Alice. There is a positive probability that the rogue miner will succeed before the network, in which case the <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> Alice will be rejected. As with the plain race attack, Alice can reduce the risk of a Finney attack by waiting for the <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> be included in the blockchain.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the major}} sources of income in the {{territory}} during the 1850s was U.S. government annuity <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> the Ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties. These payments amounted to more than $380,000 per year on average ($ in present-day terms) compared to approximately $120,000 per year ($ in present-day terms) given to the territory itself for development. Because of corruption, and mishandling of the <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> the tribes, {{a great deal of}} the money was used directly by U.S. settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes. At the beginning of the Minnesota Territory, in fact, these payments were the territory's most important source of income since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} businesses {{remained with}} the old banks for winding up. Glitnir and Kaupthing, shorn of their Icelandic operations, obtained moratoria on <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> creditors (similar to Chapter 11 protection) from the District Court of Reykjavík on 24 November.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence {{arose from}} the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last minute, and for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of an up-front <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> {{contracts}} under the reliance damage measure. We find that the efficiency in most cases fails, but {{can be obtained by}} a high enough total <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> assume away the seller’s breach, a high enough up-front <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the seller does not sue, and a high enough trading price to ensure the buyer’s breach when the undesirable state occurs. Edlin’s device (1996), which has a very low trading price to assume away the buyer’s breach and a proper up-front <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> entice the seller to sign, fails to achieve the efficiency under the reliance damage measure.
