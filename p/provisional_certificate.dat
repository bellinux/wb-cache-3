As a precursor to this he registered his 1820 land grant at the Court of Chancery on 14 October 1822.

The certificate could be acquired for 15%, with the rest due over two instalments on 17 January and 14 February 1823. The interest rate was 6% per annum. If the Poyaisian issue successfully emulated its Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean counterparts, MacGregor stood to amass a fortune.|$|R

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 122 p. This dissertation examined how new legislation in vocational education programs affected teachers on becoming fully qualified. It also investigated how legislation has impacted career and technical education teachers holding provisional certificates in Cook County and if these teachers plan to remain in the field. Research strongly revealed career and technical education (CTE) programs have undergone radical change. While current literature focused on the need for qualified teachers, inadequate attention has emerged as to how teachers holding provisional certificates perceive themselves in the present state of affairs regarding new policy changes. A mixed method was used to examine perceptions of career and technical education teachers. A self-designed questionnaire was mailed to 233 secondary education teachers in Cook County who identified themselves as holding a Type- 34 <b>provisional</b> <b>certificate,</b> to which 68 responded. This resulted in a 29 % response rate. Findings indicated that (1) the majority of respondents did not know which courses they needed to complete certification; (2) a high number were not currently enrolled in a program leading to certification; and (3) money was the number one barrier hindering them from completing a certification program. Findings also pointed to a strong need to recruit more female teachers in the field of career and technical education. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} indicated a strong need for collaboration between administrators, business leaders, legislators and educators. Business leaders have a lot at stake. They require highly skilled workers with employability skills that CTE programs and teachers can offer. Future researchers may also wish to examine the process of recruiting and retaining career and technical education teachers and the disenfranchisement of these programs in low-income areas...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>provisional</b> {{referendum}} <b>certificate</b> {{was issued}} on 25 May 2015 and published {{the following day}} in Iris Oifigiúil. Two separate petitions challenging the certificate were lodged within the time limit and considered in the High Court on 5 June 2015. The petitioners, Gerry Walshe and Maurice J. Lyons, were lay litigants. Walsh argued that political parties receiving state funding should have been prohibited from campaigning; that copies of the amendment should have been available at post offices; and that the secrecy of the ballot was compromised by serial numbers on ballot papers and CCTV cameras in some polling stations. Lyons argued that the amendment is too vaguely worded and incompatible with the constitution's Christian ethos and reference to [...] "woman ... in the home"; and also that non-voters should have been counted as no-voters. [...] Nicholas Kearns, President of the High Court, dismissed both applications and awarded costs against the petitioners. Walshe and Lyons appealed the decisions, and on 29 June the Court of Appeal scheduled hearings for 30 July. On 30 July the court upheld the dismissals and the costs awards against both petitioners. The remaining steps were as prescribed by the Referendum Act 1994: on 24 August the High Court's Master formally notified the referendum returning officer Ríona Ní Fhlanghaile {{that it had not}} accepted any petition; on 28 August Ní Fhlanghaile sent the final referendum certificate to the Taoiseach and President; on 29 August the President signing the amendment into law.|$|R
40|$|Concentrating Photovoltaics (CPV) is an {{alternative}} to flat-plate module photovoltaic (PV) technology. The bankability of CPV projects {{is an important issue}} to pave the way toward a swift and sustained growth in this technology. The bankability of a PV plant is generally addressed through the modeling of its energy yield under a baseline loss scenario, followed by an on-site measurement campaign aimed at verifying its energy performance. This paper proposes a procedure for assessing the performance of a CPV project, articulated around four main successive steps: Solar Resource Assessment, Yield Assessment, <b>Certificate</b> of <b>Provisional</b> Acceptance, and <b>Certificate</b> of Final Acceptance. This methodology allows the long-term energy production of a CPV project to be estimated with an associated uncertainty of ≈ 5 %. To our knowledge, no such method has been proposed to the CPV industry yet, and this critical situation has hindered or made impossible the completion of several important CPV projects undertaken in the world. The main motive for this proposed method is to bring a practical solution to this urgent problem. This procedure can be operated under a wide range of climatic conditions, and makes it possible to assess the bankability of a CPV plant whose design uses any of the technologies currently available on the market. The method is also compliant with both international standards and local regulations. In consequence, its applicability is both general and international...|$|R
