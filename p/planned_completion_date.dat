We discuss a distributed version of the original shifting bottleneck heuristic. By using a hierarchical approach we first assign <b>planned</b> ready and <b>completion</b> <b>dates</b> to all lots with respect to a certain work area where a work area is defined as a set of tool groups.

40|$|To monitor {{population}} {{trends of}} Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska, newborn pups are counted during aerial surveys. These surveys {{are scheduled to}} occur after the majority of pups are born, but before pups begin to spend significant time in the water. Some studies have reported dispersal of mother-pup pairs away from breeding beaches during the pupping season (July), which may influence survey results. Using a multistate mark-recapture model with state uncertainty, we estimated the amount of dispersal during the pupping season based on observations of permanently marked sea lions. Research was conducted at land-based observation sites on Marmot Island, Alaska, between 2000 and 2013. Both marked adult females with dependent pups and marked pups were observed at two rookery beaches from May to July. Cumulative dispersal rates were minimal (< 1 %) prior to the planned start of the aerial survey (23 June) and increased to 11. 2 % by the <b>planned</b> survey <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> (10 July). The increased cumulative dispersal rate during {{the remainder of the}} observation period (end of July) suggests potential bias in surveys that occur beyond 10 July, however surveys past this date are rare (< 10 % between 1973 and 2016). As a result, movements of mother-pup pairs during the pupping season are not likely to influence aerial survey estimates...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the conclusions of}} the committee that assessed the cost estimate for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This proton-proton collider will be built at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva, Switzerland. The committee found the accelerator-project cost estimate of 2. 3 billion in 1995 Swiss francs, or about $ 2 billion US, to be adequate and reasonable. The <b>planned</b> project <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of 2005 also appears achievable, assuming the resources are available when needed. The cost estimate was made using established European accounting procedures. In particular, the cost estimate does not include R and D, prototyping and testing, spare parts, {{and most of the}} engineering labor. Also excluded are costs for decommissioning the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) that now occupies the tunnel, modifications to the injector system, the experimental areas, preoperations costs, and CERN manpower. All these items are assumed by CERN {{to be included in the}} normal annual operations budget rather than the construction budget. Finally, contingency is built into the base estimate, in contrast to Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that explicitly identify contingency. The committee`s charge, given by Dr. James F. Decker, Deputy Directory of the DOE Office of Energy Research, was to understand the basis for the LHC cost estimate, identify uncertainties, and judge the overall validity of the estimate, proposed schedule, and related issues. The committee met at CERN April 22 [...] 26, 1996. The assessment was based on the October 1995 LHC Conceptual Design Report or ``Yellow Book,`` cost estimates and formal presentations made by the CERN staff, site inspection, detailed discussions with LHC technical experts, and the committee members` considerable experience...|$|R
