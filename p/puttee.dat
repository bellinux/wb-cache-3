None of this shameless fooling, <b>Puttee</b> Rooge," [...] continued the tyrant, dragging her away. [...] "Captain Gahagan dies three hours from hence." [...] <b>Puttee</b> Rooge gave one scream and fainted--her {{father and the}} Vizier carried her off between them; nor was I loth to part with her, for, with all her love, she was as ugly as the deuce.|$|E
60|$|The sweet <b>Puttee</b> Rooge was not, however, {{to be put}} off by my repartees; she and her maidens recommenced their chorus, and chattered and stormed until I {{lost all}} patience.|$|E
5000|$|The {{regiment}} is nicknamed [...] "The Glamour Boys" [...] or [...] "The Four Dozen". The name [...] "The Glamour Boys" [...] {{was coined}} {{by the other}} regiments that served with the 48th Highlanders during World War II in the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, 1 Brigade. The brigade was being inspected by King George VI but there were not enough regulation khaki <b>puttees</b> (leg wrappings) for all the soldiers. The 48th had to wear unofficial blue <b>puttees.</b> The King inquired {{as to why the}} 48th wore different <b>puttees</b> {{from the rest of the}} brigade. He was told that there were not enough khaki ones for all the units. The King replied that he liked the blue <b>puttees</b> better and that they should keep them. The 48th Highlanders continued to wear blue <b>puttees</b> until battledress was eventually phased out. The nickname [...] "Four Dozen" [...] is a play on The Dirty Dozen and [...] "48" [...] being equivalent to four dozen.|$|R

You shall be second in command of his Highness's forces. Look, here is his commission signed with the celestial seal, and attested by the sacred names of the forty-nine Imaums.

50|$|Petrali’s {{affection for}} {{motorcycles}} began {{growing up in}} California as a child, he would watch the Class A racers of the 1910's, such as Don Johns and Balke also known as Charles “Fearless”. Balke wore leather pants and <b>puttees</b> while racing to keep his legs from burning. He later adopted the style and began to wear similar leather pants and <b>puttees</b> throughout his career.|$|R
6000|$|Just as morn {{began to}} break, two figures were seen to {{approach}} the little fortress of Futtyghur: one was a woman wrapped closely in a veil, the other a warrior, remarkable for the size and manly beauty of his form, who carried in his hand a deal box of considerable size. The warrior at the gate gave the word and was admitted, the woman returned slowly to the Indian camp. Her name was <b>Puttee</b> Rooge; his was-- ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{behaviour}} {{seemed to}} check the Selenites in their desire for our progress for a moment. They faced one another, their queer heads moved, the twittering voices came quick and liquid. Then one of them, a lean, tall creature, {{with a sort of}} mantle added to the <b>puttee</b> in which the others were dressed, twisted his elephant trunk of a hand about Cavor's waist, and pulled him gently to follow our guide, who again went on ahead. Cavor resisted. [...] "We may just as well begin explaining ourselves now. They may think we are new animals, a new sort of mooncalf perhaps! It is most important that we should show an intelligent interest from the outset." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought by}} these means {{to put off}} the fair <b>Puttee</b> Rooge, and hoped {{to be able to}} escape without {{subjecting}} myself to the examination of her curious eyes. After smoking for a while, an attendant came to tell me that my supper was prepared in the inner apartment of the tent (I suppose that the reader, if he be possessed of the commonest intelligence, knows that the tents of the Indian grandees are made of the finest Cashmere Shawls, and contain a dozen rooms at least, with carpets, chimneys, and sash- windows complete). I entered, I say, into an inner chamber, and there began with my fingers to devour my meal in the Oriental fashion, taking, every now and then, a pull from the wine-jar, which was cooling deliciously in another jar of snow.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, <b>Puttee's</b> {{conservatism}} sidelined him as {{the labour}} movement came {{under the influence of}} socialist ideas. He opposed labour militancy and the Industrial Workers of the World in particular. In 1918, the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council withdrew its patronage of the Voice due to the paper's moderate tone, and began publishing a new weekly, the Western Labour News, effectively ending <b>Puttee's</b> influence over the labour movement.|$|R

25|$|In 1881, as {{a result}} of losses in the First Boer War, a Parliamentary Commission sought to equip the army with khaki uniform. Fox Brothers decided to bid for the contract, {{reasoning}} that the new contract for 5,000 <b>puttees</b> would save lives, as well as create employment. Fox Brothers went on to be the major producer of <b>puttees,</b> manufacturing some 850 miles of the cloth in World War One.|$|R
6000|$|I bade Ghorumsaug {{help me to}} {{put away}} my chest of {{treasure}} (my exultation in taking it {{was so great that}} I could not help informing him of its contents); and this done, I despatched him to his post near the prisoner, while I prepared to sally forth and pay my respects to the fair creatures under my protection. [...] "What good after all have I done," [...] thought I to myself, [...] "in this expedition which I had so rashly undertaken?" [...] I had seen the renowned Holkar, I had been in the heart of his camp; I knew the disposition of his troops, that there were eleven thousand of them, and that he only waited for his guns to make a regular attack on the fort. I had seen <b>Puttee</b> Rooge; I had robbed her (I say ROBBED her, and I don't care what the reader or any other man may think of the act) of a deal box, containing jewels to the amount of three millions sterling, the property of herself and husband.|$|E

50|$|In 1910, <b>Puttee</b> {{endorsed}} Fred Dixon as {{a candidate}} for the provincial legislature, and helped create the short-lived Manitoba Labour Party to support him. Dixon was defeated, due to opposition from the Socialist Party of Canada. <b>Puttee</b> also created a provincial Labour Representation Committee in the 1910s, and used The Voice to endorse labour candidates in the elections of 1914 and 1915. In 1918, <b>Puttee</b> helped to create the Dominion Labour Party, which was intended to consolidate labourist activities in various cities throughout the country.|$|E

50|$|When Winnipeg's Liberal MP, R. W. Jameson, died in February 1899, <b>Puttee</b> {{called for}} the {{nomination}} of a Labour candidate to contest the vacant seat in a by-election (which was finally held on January 25, 1900). The trade union council agreed, and with resources promised from local unions, nominated <b>Puttee</b> as its candidate against Liberal E. D. Martin.|$|E
5000|$|The Liberals made strenuous {{efforts to}} appeal to the working class through the {{dispensation}} of patronage among leading trade unionists, and by attacking the trade union council as being radical and uninterested in the needs of ordinary workers. <b>Puttee</b> was painted as a dangerous [...] "revolutionist" [...] backed by [...] "assassins". Bole won the election; <b>Puttee</b> finished in third place.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, 1 Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division {{was being}} {{inspected}} by King George VI. By this date the traditional knee-length <b>puttees</b> {{had been replaced}} with short ankle-length leggings worn with battledress. There were not enough khaki leggings for issue, so the 48th Highlanders made do with unofficial blue ones reportedly cut down from stocks of blue cloth found in regimental stores. The King inquired {{as to why the}} 48th wore different [...] "puttees" [...] {{from the rest of the}} brigade. Upon being told of the shortage, the king replied that he liked the blue <b>puttees</b> better and that they should keep them. The 48th Highlanders continued to wear blue <b>puttees</b> until the regimental service dress was eventually phased out. Reportedly other regiments nicknamed them as [...] "The Glamour Boys" [...] for this distinctive form of legging.|$|R
