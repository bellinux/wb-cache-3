40|$|Ecological {{stoichiometry}} {{suggests that}} plant Nitrogen (N) -to-Phosphorus (P) ratios respond {{to changes in}} both soil N:P stoichiometry and soil N and P availability. Thus we would expect that soil and plant N:P ratios be significantly related along natural gradients of soil development such as those associated with <b>primary</b> ecological <b>successions.</b> Here we explicitly search for linkages between plant and soil N:P stoichiometry along four <b>primary</b> <b>successions</b> distributed across Europe. We measured N and P content in soils and plant compartments (leaf, stem and root) of 72 wild plant species distributed along two sand dune and two glacier successions where soil age ranges from few to thousand years old. Overall we found that soil N:P ratios strongly increased along successional stages, however, plant N:P ratios were neither related to soil N:P stoichiometry nor to changes in soil N and P availability. Instead changes in plant nutrient stoichiometry were "driven" by plant-functional-group identity. Not only N:P ratios differed between legumes, grasses and forbs but each of these plant functional groups maintained N:P ratios relatively constant across pioneer, middle and advanced successional stages. Our evidence is that soil nutrient stoichiometry {{may not be a}} good predictor of changes in plant N:P stoichiometry along natural <b>primary</b> ecological <b>successions,</b> which have not reached yet a retrogressive stage. This could be because wild-plants rely on mechanisms of internal nutrient regulation, which make them less dependent to changes in soil nutrient availability under unpredictable environmental conditions. Further studies need to clarify what underlying evolutionary and eco-physiological mechanisms determine changes in nutrient stoichiometry in plant species distributed across natural environmental gradients...|$|R

40|$|In the ocean, organic {{particles}} harbour diverse bacterial communities, which collectively digest and recycle essential nutrients. Traits like motility and exo-enzyme production allow individual taxa {{to colonize}} and exploit particle resources, {{but it remains}} unclear how community dynamics emerge from these individual traits. Here we track the taxon and trait dynamics of bacteria attached to model marine particles and demonstrate that particle-attached communities undergo rapid, reproducible successions driven by ecological interactions. Motile, particle-degrading taxa are selected for during early successional stages. However, this selective pressure is later relaxed when secondary consumers invade, which are unable to use the particle resource but, instead, rely on carbon from primary degraders. This creates a trophic chain that shifts community metabolism away from the particle substrate. These results suggest that <b>primary</b> <b>successions</b> may shape particle-attached bacterial communities in the ocean and that rapid community-wide metabolic shifts could limit rates of marine particle degradation.

Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of nitrogen insufficiency.

40|$|Summary: <b>Primary</b> <b>successions</b> {{involving}} teatree (Kunzea ericoides var. ericoides {{with some}} Leptospermum scoparium) were studied on shallow landslide scars on soft sedimentary (mudstone) hill country under extensive pastoral {{use in the}} East Cape (Tairawhiti) region, using a 5 - 72 yr chronosequence established from sequential aerial photography {{and the age of}} the oldest teatrees on scars. Dynamics of primary even-aged teatree stands are similar to those in secondary successions on reverting pasture described previously from the region. Height growth rates and basal area indicate that the productivity of teatree stands on landslide scars is similar to that on intact regolith. Although seventy five vascular species were recorded, one-third of them adventive, only five species- all native- were consistently present. Classification and ordination revealed four distinct stages in the evolution of ground layer communities, the first three with 50 % plant cover (principally M. stipoides, from 50 years), reflecting the dynamics- dominated by intraspecific competition- of the teatree stands.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Polar and Alpine {{periglacial}} {{areas are}} traditionally regarded as necessarily submitted to very efficient frost-driven processes {{that control the}} Holocene and ongoing geomorphic activity. During the last decade, the validity of this academic view has been increasingly questioned among the international scientific community. The search for the real past and present processes responsible for landform evolution in cold non-glaciated areas is based mainly on more and more refined monitoring protocols relying upon sophisticated equipment. To assess the representativeness and significance of monitoring data collected in restricted sites, it appears necessary however to widen the perspective by adopting a twofold multiscale approach as proposed in the present paper : (1) in space, by integrating various scales from the general slope system to the bioclimatic nanoenvironment; (2) in time, by {{taking into account the}} landscape history, from Tertiary inherited features to recent process changes induced by the contemporary warming. Reintegrating the historical approach should help both to place the ongoing processes within a succession and/or combination of interoperating processes, and to avoid misinterpretations of features considered wrongly as emblematic of frost action. Overall, both the historical and monitoring approaches tend to reduce the geomorphic efficiency of frost-derived processes. Instead, the role of non cold-related processes, such as chemical, thermal, biogenic and rainfall-induced ones, is being emphasized. Of special interest would be an interdisciplinary discussion between geomorphologists and various disciplines of biological sciences including biochemistry and ecology studying processes of <b>primary</b> <b>successions...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceTropical inselbergs are {{isolated}} rock outcrops {{with a special}} type of vegetation surrounded by rain forest. They are exposed to a harsh climate (alternation of heavy rain and severe drought) and provide few nutrients for plant growth. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} a possible correlation between <b>primary</b> plant <b>succession,</b> size and diversity of soil arthropods. The study site was the Nouragues inselberg, in French Guiana (South America). Nine soil samples (three samples in each vegetation type) were taken for the study of soil arthropod communities and their food habits in three habitat types: Pitcairnia geyskesii (Bromeliaceae), Clusia minor (Clusiaceae) and Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae), which represent three stages in a <b>primary</b> plant <b>succession</b> on this inselberg. Soil arthropods were classified into morphospecies under the dissecting microscope and their food habits were characterized by examining their gut contents under the light microscope. A variation in food habits was observed, cyanobacteria being found in arthropod guts only during the Pitcairnia stage, and were replaced by plant material at the Myrcia stage. Carnivory was prominent in oribatid mites, contrary to temperate records. All our samples contained large numbers of microarthropods, principally mites and collembolans. At the Myrcia stage arthropod density was significantly higher than at the two other stages. Macroinvertebrates are present only at late and intermediate successional stages. The number of macropredators increased by a factor of 10 in species richness and 100 in abundance along the succession. These results suggest that abundance and diversity of soil arthropods increased throughout the plant succession and show the importance of organic matter as a factor which can explain the observed phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>successions</b> of glacier forelands {{are unique}} model systems to {{investigate}} community dynamics and assembly processes. However, successional changes {{of plant and}} insect communities have been mainly analysed separately. Therefore, changes in plant–insect interactions along successional gradients on glacier forelands remain unknown, despite their relevance to ecosystem functioning. This study assessed how successional changes of the vegetation influenced {{the composition of the}} flower-visiting insect assemblages of two plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) Heyw. and Saxifraga bryoides L., selected as the only two insect-pollinated species occurring along the whole succession. In addition, we investigated the links between reproductive output of these plants and pollinator abundance through experimental exclusion of pollinators. Plant community structure changed along the succession, affecting the distribution and the abundance of insects via idiosyncratic responses of different insect functional groups. L. alpina interacted with ubiquitously distributed pollinators, while S. bryoides pollinators were positively associated with insect-pollinated plant species density and S. bryoides abundance. With succession proceeding, insect assemblages became more functionally diverse, with the abundance of parasitoids, predators and opportunists positively related to an increase in plant cover and diversity. The reproductive output of both plant species varied among successional stages. Contrary to our expectation, the obligate insect-pollinated L. alpina showed a reproductive output rather independent from pollinator abundance, while the reproductive output of the self-fertile S. bryoides seemed linked to pollinator abundance. Observing ecological interactions and using functional traits, we provided a mechanistic understanding of community assembly processes along a successional gradient. Plant community diversity and cover likely influenced insect community assembly through bottom-up effects. In turn, pollinators regulate plant reproductive output through top-down control. We emphasise that dynamics of alpine plant and insect communities may be structured by biotic interactions and feedback processes, rather than only be influenced by harsh abiotic conditions and stochastic events...|$|R

40|$|Evaluating {{the success}} of {{ecological}} restoration interventions in establishing self-sustaining development toward distant goals within project timescales is problematic. Trajectory analysis is a promising evaluation strategy to this end yet it has received little research attention and is uncommonly used. This thesis aims to identify indices predictable enough to be suitable for trajectory analysis, focusing plant assemblage structure. The primary objectives were to: a) accurately infer plant assemblage development gradients of <b>primary</b> <b>successions</b> in three different ecosystems of the South Island, New Zealand by means of sampling well aged chronosequences, and b) establish which indices had sufficiently strong and consistent response trajectories to all three inferred vegetation development gradients to be considered predictable. The vascular plant assemblages of at least five development stages {{in each of the}} three sites were sampled intensively using multiple fixed area plots. Ordination and stepwise regression established that age was highly correlated with the main floristic gradient and environmental variables were unimportant in explaining floristic variation. Data for index calculation consisted of plant species cover abundance and leaf area estimates as well as soil chemical properties. Development stage age estimates enabled index response trajectories to be constructed from stage mean values. Regression models were fitted to observed index trajectories for each site to test response strength and predictability. Comparisons of regression statistics and trajectories among the three sites for each index showed that the majority of indices had predictable responses to all sites; these were: soil pH and organic carbon, importance score, Simpson's species diversity, distance from the lognormal model of species relative abundance distribution, growth form diversity, taxonomic distinctness and DCA axis one. Together, these indices are suggested to be able to evaluate if development trajectories indicate progress towards three restoration goals via intermediate objectives. These goals are: 1) a persistent plant assemblage, 2) a plant assemblage with specific structural attributes and 3) a well functioning ecosystem. For trajectory analysis to effectively evaluate restoration success with these goals it is recommended that recovery gradients are long, monitoring periods are at least three decades and multiple indices are used that convey complementary information...|$|R
