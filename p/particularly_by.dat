5|$|Aramaic was {{the primary}} {{language}} of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, {{one of the three}} largest cities of the Empire, and <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in Edessa. Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac literature was the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), {{may occur}} during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E

5|$|Canavan is from Glencull, near Ballygawley, County Tyrone and was {{the tenth}} of eleven children. His older brother, Pascal, played {{with him on the}} Tyrone panel for most of the 1990s. He is married to Finola (sister of former Tyrone team-mate Ronan McGarrity), and has four children, Aine, Claire, Darragh and Ruairi, and has been a Physical Education teacher in Holy Trinity College, Cookstown, {{throughout}} most of his career (Gaelic games are amateur sports). While there, he taught Eoin Mulligan his point-taking technique, and the pair have been known in the media as 'master and student' ever since, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> television commentators.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, {{but they may be}} important for many cold-water species.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{development}} in Sitakunda is largely {{driven by the}} Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area, {{it also has the}} largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies {{on one of the most}} active seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's wealth, however, made it {{a tempting}} target for invasion, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> the Libyan Berbers to the west, and the Sea Peoples, a conjectured {{confederation}} of seafarers from the Aegean Sea. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship. With {{no need for}} elaborate buildings divided up by ritual there was widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration. There was a need to adapt old buildings and build new churches suitable for reformed services, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship.|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, the {{production}} declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, {{the products of}} Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> travelling Jewish traders from the city. At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna, Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained {{an important source of}} income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 francs per annum.|$|E
5|$|Queen Maud Land was {{the first}} part of Antarctica to be sighted, on 27 January 1820 by Fabian von Bellingshausen. It was however among the last to be explored, as it {{required}} aircraft in combination with ships to undertake systematic exploration. Early Norwegian research activities in Antarctica rested entirely on whaling and sealing expeditions funded by ship owners, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> Christen Christensen and his son Lars. The first two Norwegian expeditions were carried out by sealing ships in 1892–93 and 1893–94. While they were primarily sent for exploring, sealing, and whaling possibilities, they also performed scientific research. Further Norwegian expeditions were mounted into {{the first decades of the}} 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Tehama started life some 600,000 years ago. At {{its peak}} activity, it reached {{approximately}} 3,350meters (11,000ft) high, with a basal diameter of approximately 12kilometers. Volcanic activity then declined 400,000 years ago, with other volcanic lava domes forming {{at the edges}} of Mount Tehama later on, the largest and best known of which is Lassen Peak. A combination of continued hydrothermal activity and erosion, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> glaciers during ice ages, removed the central cone of the volcano, leaving a large caldera, the northern edge of which can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution {{was adopted}} on July 9, 1868, {{as one of}} the Reconstruction Amendments. The {{amendment}} addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. The amendment was bitterly contested, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Lady's Realm was a British women's {{magazine}} published from 1896 until 1914, possibly until 1915. It primarily targeted upper-class readers {{as well as}} an aspirational middle-class audience, featuring photographs, poems, fiction, {{and columns}} by popular authors such as Marie Corelli, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Jack London, and H.G. Wells. The London Season was regularly covered, with visuals of significant society figures and débutantes appearing. Fashion trends in Paris and London were frequently discussed as well, <b>particularly</b> <b>by</b> its fashion editor Marian Pritchard.|$|E
