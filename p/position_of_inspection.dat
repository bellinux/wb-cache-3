30|$|In {{the recent}} past, several authors have {{investigated}} improving productivity with production control policies. Most studies {{assume that all}} the parts produced are conforming, which is unrealistic. Standard quality analysis models usually separate the problem of quality preservation in production lines (via the <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> stations, for example) and the optimization of production (via Kanban, CONWIP etc.). However, these two problems are interdependent (see Kim and Gershwin 2005, 2008; Colledani and Tolio 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011). We illustrate this by considering the Kanban strategies introduced by Toyota in the 1960 s that have since become the paradigm of “lean manufacturing”. These strategies essentially advocate areas of limited storage between successive machines in a production line. The storage areas allow a degree of decoupling between machines to increase the productivity of the line. The idea is to limit the impact of shortages on downstream machines and to avoid blocking machines that are upstream from one that is broken down. These areas should be limited because they are associated with frozen capital: they introduce storage costs and extended transit times for parts in the workshop.|$|R

For a given λ, we define Neighborhood(λ) = solutions (inspection stations configurations) obtained by applying a single move to λ. Moving to a new solution involves changing the <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> two <b>inspection</b> stations; the number of stations does not change. Note that we stay in the same level when we move to a neighbor solution. We use Algorithm 2 to evaluate the fitness of each new solution, and we use theses fitness values to compare different solutions.|$|R
30|$|In a real {{manufacturing}} context, simulation {{can be used}} {{to determine}} the optimal buffers’ sizes and the optimal <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> stations by considering all possible scenarios. However, this is not practical when the systems are complex: the number of scenarios is (^n_m) × 100 ^n for a system with n machines and m inspection stations where each buffer of equal size is discretized to 100 levels. Note that the system is required to have an inspection station {{at the end of the}} line. Since the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> this station is known, it is not included in the optimization. An alternative to simulation is to develop a realistic model and a fast optimization technique to solve it. The real model is however very complex because many factors impact quality and production. So, we need elaborate some simplifying assumptions in such a way that the resulting model is still realistic and can be solved optimally.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a surge of {{interest}} in the use of UAVs for asset surveying applications including chimney stacks, power lines, wind turbines and other structural assets. Most commercial systems available are manual, relying on a human operator to fly the UAV or drone, and a manual process of image stitching and analysis to check for faults and defects. Errors in the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> drone make guaranteeing full coverage and accurate defect registration particularly problematic with this approach. This paper details our work at University of Strathclyde, conducted under the UK Research Centre in Non-Destructive Evaluation, in areas that are essential to improving the accuracy of such drone based structural asset inspection; we describe this set of approaches for improving the ability of drones to make such measurements. We present the results of a study aimed at better understanding of the positional accuracy and stability of UAV’s when used in indoor and outdoor environments for inspection purposes, utilising high precision laser tracking and photogrammetric approaches. Coverage path planning approaches were implemented to ensure full area coverage and provide accurate registration of faults. Finally, using image stitching – it is possible to get both full area visualisation of the structure, and more importantly to reconstruct a 3 D CAD model of the surface of the structure under inspectio...|$|R

To measure the rocks stress and to prevent the mountain impact, as well as for basic investigations, a set of optical-electronic deformers and systems was developed and produced. For permanent noncontact bearing <b>position</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> oil-drilling platforms on Sakhalin coast (Russia) we have developed optical-electronic method and system SAKHALIN. Multifunctional laser technological system LSP- 2000 equipped by two Nd-YAG lasers was developed for cutting, welding and surface micro profiling with ablation process (working range of 3 × 2 × 0. 6 m 3, positioning error less than 10 mkm).

40|$|Transportation {{networks}} are {{the backbone of}} modern societies; commuting, freight transportation, leisure travel are mainly accommodated by highways. A natural disaster may disrupt highway operations and therefore multiple community functions, which have to be rapidly restored. In addition, it creates needs for immediate emergency response (relief services etc). It {{is a fact that}} transportation {{networks are}} ""lifelines""; both emergency response and quick restoration of community functions rely heavily on the ability of transportation networks to handle traffic. Unfortunately, transportation infrastructure elements such as bridges and tunnels are highly prone to damages caused by natural disasters (for example earthquakes). Bridges are probably among the most expensive and complex constructions of a transportation network. On the other hand, bridges are vital links within a transportation network; their failure to operate may lead to long bypasses and inability to access communities. Following a natural hazard, the condition of the transportation network elements must be assessed and damages have to be identified. Inspections are therefore necessary, immediately after the catastrophic event. Specialized crews must be dispatched and inspect critical elements of transportation infrastructure such as bridges. The objective of the current paper is the scheduling <b>of</b> bridge <b>inspection</b> crews following an earthquake. A model and a decision support system, parts of a bridge management system currently developed in Greece are presented, which are designed to aid local authorities in optimally assigning inspectors to the bridge network. The procedure followed for scheduling <b>inspections</b> consists <b>of</b> two major steps: • Identifying the area affected by the earthquake, using a special software package. • Assigning inspection crews to the bridges included within that area, taking into account initial reports on probable network link failure (bridge collapses, pavement failures etc). A brief description of the procedure has as follows: After establishing the area affected by the earthquake and the corresponding part of the transportation network, reports are gathered from the local authorities (police, fire department etc) on possible failures of transportation elements. These reports provide information on possible network links that cannot be crossed by inspection crews. According to that information a new plasmatic network is formed (having bridges as nodes) that takes into account possible access difficulties. Availability of crews and the point within the area where the inspection crews start from are also defined. The decision support system already incorporates estimates on travel times between bridges and bridge inspection times. Using a heuristic procedure (Clarke - Wright ""savings"" algorithm), crews are optimally dispatched to bridges. The decision support system (DSS) is incorporated to a BMS under development for a Greek Motorway Authority (Egnatia Motorway Authority, www. egnatia. gr). All information on the original network (the road network structure and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> bridges) is stored in the BMS database. Additional information stored is related to the inspection time estimates for each bridge. Other information pre-included concerns the possible starting <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> crews. Data imported directly by the agency include (a) average travel speeds, (b) the number of crews available, (c) the starting point, (d) the part of the network affected by the earthquake and (e) possible failures in network links through a graphical user interface. The DSS transforms the network and provides the necessary results using the ""savings"" heuristic. The results include the bridges that have to be visited by each inspection crew and the total time needed by each crew for inspecting its assigned set <b>of</b> bridges. <b>Inspection</b> <b>of</b> bridges following an earthquake is vital for the quick restoration of the transportation network. The current study presents a methodology and a corresponding decision support system that can facilitate agencies in quickly scheduling emergency aftershock inspections. The tool is based upon accurate estimates on affected transportation regions and a widely used algorithm scheduling. The decision support system is currently in use by the Egnatia Motorway Authority in Greece. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R

Amputation of the carinal hook during {{passage and}} malpositioning {{of the tube}} to the hook {{are some of the}} potential problems related with left-sided Carlens double lumen tube (DLT). This article reports an amputation of the hook during a difficult selective intubation and aimed at calling the attention to complications associated with DLTs and the importance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Case presentation A 68 year-old woman was scheduled for right-sided thoracotomy in whom blind DLT insertion was performed. Narrowed trachea causes difficulty in rotating the DLT 90 ° counter-clockwise. After carinal hook was noticed upon visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the DLT, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to remove the missing part (with the use of forceps) from the right mainstem bronchus. Conclusion Insertion of DLTs with carinal hook is associated with technical problems and potentially life-threatening hazards have discouraged their use. Fiberoptic evaluation and repositioning solves most of the problems. Although amputation of the carinal hook has not been previously reported, clinicians should be alert. This case report emphasizes the utility of the fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the operating theatre for placement, <b>positioning</b> and <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the carinal hook DLT. </p...|$|R
