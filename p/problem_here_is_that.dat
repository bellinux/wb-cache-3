5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group {{in order to work}} well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
25|$|It {{also must}} {{double as a}} clean room to {{preserve}} the science value of the samples. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> while it {{is relatively easy to}} simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and use them in experiments. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be contained to prevent contamination of Earth. However {{at the same time the}} samples would need to be kept free from contamination by Earth micro-organisms and biological material; even a single amino acid of Earth origin could confuse the analysis. This introduces conflicting requirements. They surely can be reconciled but to date, no facility has had to do this, so new building requirements would need to be imposed.|$|E

500|$|It {{has yet to}} be {{determined}} why such an integumentary change might have occurred. A precedent for feather loss can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians, in which filamentous structures were lost, and scales reappeared.

2500|$|The {{straightforward}} generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. {{using the}} unit ball of an arbitrary Hilbert space instead of Euclidean space, is not true.

5000|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> only {{a slight}} {{addition}} to the thickness of armour plate greatly increased the total weight of the tank, thereby requiring a more powerful and heavier engine.

2500|$|Again, we are {{presently}} unable to calculate results below the critical temperature, because the particle numbers using the above equation become negative.

There is no ground state to accept the condensate and so the equation breaks down.

2500|$|Boot-132 is a {{bootloader}} {{provided by}} Apple for loading the XNU kernel. In mid-2008, a new modified BOOT-132 came {{on to the}} scene.

2500|$|Almost all appeals require permission, a major {{innovation}} {{from the}} previous system, where appeals were, on the request of counsel, almost all automatically put through. The application for permission {{should be made to}} the lower court, although this is not mandatory; it may be asked of the appellate court itself. In Re T (A Child) [...] EWCA Civ 1736, the Civil Division strongly advised that counsel apply at the lower courts, since the judge, fully aware of the facts, will take less time to process, there is no harm if the application fails or if it is approved but counsel decides not to proceed with the case and there are no additional costs involved. The only <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> judgments may occasionally be reserved, and only given later by post – there may not be an opportunity to ask for permission to appeal at the lower court.|$|E
5000|$|Least {{discussed}} is {{the problem}} of finding a non-arbitrary, rigorous distinction between value created and value transferred in respect of services.

50|$|Another {{approach}} is to defer reclamation of removed data elements. One way to defer reclamation is to run the algorithm in an environment featuring an automatic garbage collector; a <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> however <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the GC is not lock-free, then the overall system is not lock-free, even though the data structure itself is.|$|R
