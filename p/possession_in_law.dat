5000|$|... possessory {{judgment}}, {{a judgment}} which establishes {{the right to}} <b>possession.</b> <b>In</b> Scots <b>law,</b> a judgment giving a party the right to possession until the question of <b>possession</b> is decided <b>in</b> due course of law.|$|R
40|$|Examines {{the role}} played by the concept of <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> the common <b>law</b> {{tradition}} and the extent of its significance in the twenty-first century. Considers the early law concept of seisin, the principles of <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> modern <b>law</b> and the operation of original acquisition rules <b>in</b> modern property <b>law.</b> Discusses the concept of adverse possession of land, including the House of Lords ruling in JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham, the relationship between adverse possession and human rights law and the impact of the Land Registration Act 2002...|$|R
5000|$|The {{essential}} ideas {{behind the}} principles of homesteading and squatter's rights hold generally for any type of item or property of which ownership can be asserted by simple use or <b>possession.</b> <b>In</b> modern <b>law,</b> homesteading {{and the right of}} adverse possession refer exclusively to real property. In the realm of personal property, the same impulse is summarized by the adage [...] "finders/keepers" [...] and is formalized by laws and conventions concerning abandoned property.|$|R
5000|$|In {{proof of}} their second proposition, Æquiprobabilists quote the same axiom: in pari delicto melior est conditio possidentis. When the doubt {{concerns}} {{the cessation of}} a law, the <b>law</b> is <b>in</b> <b>possession,</b> and therefore the law must be observed until it is displaced by a stronger probability in favour of liberty. Probabilists reply to this argument that liberty is always <b>in</b> <b>possession,</b> since <b>law</b> and obligation presuppose liberty in the subject.|$|R
2500|$|The {{essential}} ideas {{behind the}} principles of homesteading and squatter's rights hold generally for any type of item or property of which ownership can be asserted by simple use or <b>possession.</b> [...] <b>In</b> modern <b>law,</b> homesteading {{and the right of}} adverse possession refer exclusively to real property.

40|$|Legal rights may erode as {{a result}} of past, uncontested, breach. In light of ongoing violations, the rightholder's {{enforcement}} may result in the loss of the entitlement. The doctrines, of course, of performance <b>in</b> contract <b>law</b> and adverse <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> property <b>law</b> are prominent examples of this widespread erosion phenomenon. In analyzing the effects of such laws, the Article confronts two conflicting intuitions. On the one hand, the "license" to continue breach prospectively encourages opportunism. On the other hand, the risk of erosion may reinforce the rightholder's motivation to take anti-erosion measures, bolstering the credibility of the threat to enforce, thus better preserving the entitlement. The article proves that these two effects of erosion rules always balance out. The same amount of value will be extracted from the right holder irrespective of the law's erosion doctrine. The article also demonstrates the limits of this "irrelevance" claim and the factors that may lead to its collapse. It applies the analysis to offer new perspectives on various prominent legal rules...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} of the House of Lords in J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. Graham [2002] 3 W. L. R. 221 has not only reaffirmed the importance of <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> the common <b>law</b> tradition as had been understood historically, {{but it has also}} explained that it is long sustained possession that is the root of a successful claim to adverse possession. It does not matter that the adverse possessor does not have an actual subjective belief that he is acting as the owner. Neither does it matter that the possessor is willing to pay for the occupation of the land, providing that there is possession which is inconsistent with the paper owner's title...|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos passed Law 108, a {{law that}} decriminalized drug use, while {{continuing}} to prosecute drug <b>possession.</b> <b>In</b> reality, <b>Law</b> 108 set a trap that snared many citizens. Citizens confused the legality of use with the illegality of carrying drugs on their person. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed. In 2007, 18,000 prisoners were kept in a prison built to hold up to 7,000. In urban regions of Ecuador as many as 45% of male inmates were serving time for drug charges; this prison demographic rises to 80% of female inmates. In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the [...] "smuggler pardon" [...] if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2 kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. Later, <b>in</b> 2009, <b>Law</b> 108 {{was replaced by the}} Organic Penal Code (COIP). The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108, but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly. In 2013, the Ecuadorian government left the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act.|$|R
25|$|In March 2016 the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Caetano v. Massachusetts that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts erred in its {{rationale}} <b>in</b> upholding a <b>law</b> that prohibited {{the possession of}} stun guns. Though the ruling didn't explicitly rule that stun guns bans are unconstitutional, the ruling created doubt <b>in</b> <b>laws</b> forbidding their <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> Washington D.C., Hawaii, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and several local <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> other states which led to many legal challenges and legalizations of stun gun <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> some of these jurisdictions.|$|R

50|$|Individual {{state laws}} {{do not always}} conform to the federal standard. State-level {{proposals}} for the rescheduling of cannabis have met with mixed success. As of November 9, 2016, the use of both recreational and medicinal marijuana has been legalized in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The District of Columbia has fully legalized recreational and medical marijuana, but recreational commercial sale is currently blocked by Congress. Twelve states have both medical marijuana and decriminalization laws (three of them being CBD only). Thirteen states, Guam, and Puerto Rico have legalized psychoactive medical marijuana, while another thirteen have only legalized non-psychoactive medical marijuana. One state and the U.S. Virgin Islands have only decriminalized <b>possession</b> <b>laws.</b> <b>In</b> the remaining three states and two inhabited territories, marijuana possession and sales for any use are illegal and prohibited entirely.|$|R

500|$|The {{complications}} {{regarding the}} illegal firearms used in Timoshenko's murder inspired new <b>laws</b> passed <b>in</b> New York City, which authorized new penalties, touted as [...] "part {{of the toughest}} illegal gun <b>possession</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> the country." [...] A public awareness campaign, named [...] "GUNS=PRISON", featured posters {{calling attention to the}} 3 ½year prison sentence given to anyone caught carrying an illegal loaded handgun in New York. [...] At a press conference, Mayor Bloomberg stated, [...] "Police Officer Russell Timoshenko was just the latest victim killed by a gunman firing at close range. [...] If the prospect of {{three and a half years}} in jail deters just one would-be killer from carrying a gun and taking the life of another police officer in another deadly confrontation, then the law and the efforts to publicize it are well worth it." [...] NFL player Plaxico Burress was charged with this new law due to an incident that occurred inside of a New York City nightclub. On August 20, 2009, Burress plead guilty to a gun possession charge and agreed to a two-year prison sentence.|$|R
5000|$|Plamondon {{was indicted}} with John Sinclair in {{connection}} to the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in Ann Arbor on September 29, 1968, {{a year after the}} founding of the group. Upon hearing on the left-wing alternative radio station WABX that he had been indicted, he fled the U.S. for Europe and Africa, spending time in Algeria with exiled Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver. After secretly re-entering the country, and {{on his way to a}} safe house in northern Michigan, he was arrested in a routine traffic stop, joining John Sinclair, who had been sentenced to nine and half years in jail for violating Michigan's marijuana <b>possession</b> <b>laws,</b> <b>in</b> prison. Plamondon was convicted and was in prison when Sinclair was released on bond in 1971 while appeals were being heard on his case. Sinclair's unexpected release came two days after a large [...] "Free John" [...] benefit concert, with performances from John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Bob Seger, and Stevie Wonder, was held at the University of Michigan's Crisler Arena.|$|R

It {{highlights the}} concept that when mortality is salient individuals will dispose their <b>possessions</b> <b>in</b> ways that could {{create a sense of}} symbolic immortality. It also discusses the idea that when mortality is salient individuals will dispose their <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> ways that could allow them to form a socially valued identity...|$|R

50|$|Human <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> {{science fiction}} is an {{extension}} within science-fiction literature and film of the mythology of human <b>possession</b> found <b>in</b> many cultures throughout human history. Typically, <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> science fiction involves extraterrestrial parasitic organisms that can take control of a human host. During the Cold War era in the western world, this was often {{a metaphor for the}} threat of communism.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the state}} of Maryland, a bill signed by former {{governor}} Robert Ehrlich, became <b>law</b> <b>in</b> 2003 permitting patients to use medical necessity defense to marijuana <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> the state. The maximum penalty for these users cannot exceed $100. However, this law does not prevent federal prosecution of patients, as the federal law does not recognize medical necessity. http://www.safeaccessnow.org/article.php?id=2050 ...|$|R
