40|$|A {{series of}} finite-element {{analyses}} {{has been carried}} out to investigate the impact of three-dimensional effects and <b>panel</b> <b>length</b> on horizontal ground movements and changes in lateral stress during the sequential installation of a number of diaphragm wall panels. The analyses show that the magnitude and extent of lateral stress reduction in the vicinity of a diaphragm wall during construction depend on the <b>panel</b> <b>length</b> and are overpredicted in analyses assuming conditions of plane strain. Furthermore, an overall increase in lateral stress below the toe of the wall is calculated in a plane strain analysis, but is not evident following completion of the wall when a three-dimensional analysis modelling the sequential installation of a number of panels is carried out. The analyses also show that three-dimensional effects tend to reduce lateral soil movements during installation of a diaphragm wall in panels compared with the plane strain case, but soil movements increase markedly with <b>panel</b> <b>length</b> at aspect ratios (panel depth: <b>panel</b> <b>length)</b> of less than three...|$|E

For such application, potential field cases were considered whose analysis (according to serviceability and strength criteria) accounted for the mechanical properties reported {{in the first part}} of this paper. The characterization was composed of an experimental program including static and dynamic fatigue tests, and the investigation focused on the ultimate capacity and stiffness (compressive and flexural) of the sandwich structure, as well as its residual strength and rigidity after fatigue conditioning. It was found a residual compressive strength after two million cycles considerably higher than the peak surface pressure resulting from a HS 25 - 44 truck wheel.

40|$|An {{approach}} is presented {{for determining the}} minimum weight design of aircraft wing models which takes into consideration aerodynamics-structure coupling when calculating both zeroth order information needed for analysis and first order information needed for optimization. When performing sensitivity analysis, coupling is accounted for by using a generalized sensitivity formulation. The results presented show that the aeroelastic effects are calculated properly and noticeably reduce constraint approximation errors. However, for the particular example selected, the error introduced by ignoring aeroelastic effects are not sufficient to significantly affect the convergence of the optimization process. Trade studies are reported that consider different structural materials, internal spar layouts, and <b>panel</b> buckling <b>lengths.</b> For the formulation, model and materials used in this study, an advanced aluminum material produced the lightest design while satisfying the problem constraints.

Influences on bifurcation of three factors, the notch depth to panel width, the local constitutive law, and the ratio of the panel width to <b>panel</b> <b>length</b> are investigated.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for simulating the excavation {{and construction of}} subsequent panels is proposed to investigate the effects from the installation of diaphragm walls on the surrounding and adjacent buildings. The method has been combined with a 3 -D nonlinear analysis and a constitutive law providing bulk and shear modulus variation, depending on the stress path (loading, unloading, reloading). From {{the application of the}} method in a normally to slightly over-consolidated clayey soil {{it was found that the}} <b>panel</b> <b>length</b> is the most affecting factor of ground movements and lateral stress reduction during panel installation. Moreover, from the evaluation of horizontal stress reduction and the variation of horizontal displacements arises that the effects from the construction of a panel are mainly limited to a zone within a distance of the order of the <b>panel</b> <b>length.</b> The effects on an adjacent building have also been investigated by applying a full soil structure interaction including the whole building. Settlement profiles and settlements are given at specific points as increasing with subsequent installation of panels, providing the ability of specific monitoring guidelines for the upcoming construction of the diaphragm wall in front of the building. Contrary to lateral movements, which mostly take place at the panel under construction, it was found that the effect of settlements covers a larger area leading to a progressive settlement increase. The effect highly depends on the distance from the panel under construction. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The paper {{presents the results of}} quality studies conducted according to an elaborated method, imitating gluing defects of panels. Glued oak wood panels were studied by the method of resonance vibrations in a special stand within 20 – 2000 Hz frequency range. Defects were imitated making incisions in the places of glue lines. Several defect variants were modeled – defect in the centre of panels, defect at the edge of panels and two defects – in the centre and at the edge. The change of panel amplitude-frequency characteristics was ascertained. It was found, that with increasing linear dimensions of defects, mean vibration amplitudes of panels decrease. It was obtained, that the modulus of elasticity along the grain comprise 12000 – 13000 MPa, while across the grain 933 – 1600 MPa, damping coefficients (tgδ) – 0. 015 – 0. 04. With increasing incision, the modulus of elasticity in the longitudinal direction practically did not change, meanwhile transversely they decreased down to 321 – 760 MPa, damping coefficients augmented up to 0. 02 – 0. 05. Critical incision lengths were ascertained under significant changes of transverse panel bend forms.
