60|$|The letters which Waverley had {{hitherto}} {{received from}} his relations in England were not such as required any particular notice in this narrative. His father usually wrote {{to him with}} the pompous affectation of one who was too much oppressed by public affairs to find leisure to attend to those of his own family. Now and then he mentioned persons of rank in Scotland to whom he wished his son should pay some attention; but Waverley, hitherto occupied by the amusements which he had found at Tully-Veolan and Glennaquoich, dispensed with paying any attention to hints so coldly thrown out, especially as distance, shortness of leave of absence, and so forth furnished a ready apology. But latterly the burden of Mr. Richard Waverley's paternal epistles consisted in certain mysterious hints of greatness and influence which he was speedily to attain, and which would ensure his son's obtaining the most rapid promotion, should he remain in the military service. Sir Everard's letters were of a different tenor. They were short; for the good Baronet was none of your illimitable correspondents, whose manuscript overflows the folds of their large <b>post</b> <b>paper,</b> and leaves no room for the seal; but they were kind and affectionate, and seldom concluded without some allusion to our hero's stud, some question {{about the state of}} his purse, and a special inquiry after such of his recruits as had preceded him from Waverley-Honour. Aunt Rachel charged him to remember his principles of religion, {{to take care of his}} health, to beware of Scotch mists, which, she had heard, would wet an Englishman through and through, never to go out at night without his great-coat, and, above all, to wear flannel next to his skin.|$|E

We left Houston around noon, the weather didn’t clear until then. Flew to Foster Field, {{headquarters}} of this God Forsaken place, and then made the hop out the Gulf to Matagorda Island, more lovingly referred to as “Wake’s Wake. ” This is some field- trees, - no; animals, - thousands of rabbits; windy, - my God what a perpetual gale. As for entertainment there’s a movin’-picture, period. The field itself is alot [sic] bigger than Eglin’s Aux’s but it’s {{scattered all over the}} place. The buildings are all dispersed; it looks like the builder’s just decided to slap ‘em up wherever they chose. Tonight I asked for the P. X. and a guy just pointed in the direction I should walk. Trouble was there were several buildings between me and the P. X. It was hell battering my way through them but I made it (the P. X. was closed, by the way). There isn’t a corner on the field, all the roads are circles interconnected by twenty foot straight-aways. A ruler would go mad in this place. I guess the gunnery meet is tomorrow, nobody knows, as usual. The only reason they know that the meet was here is that somebody read about it in the <b>Post</b> <b>paper.</b> I wrote you in Houston but forgot to mail it until I got to Foster Field, then I gave it to some G.

I guess I won’t be home for our anniversary angel. If I’m not I’ll be thinking about you, maybe next month we’ll be together, I sure hope so. I love you my darling I hope I’ll be seeing you soon, I miss you so much. Honey, you’re so sweet and lovely, you’re a wonderful wife angel. I’ll love you always.

In this survey we will show how notions of a complete r. e. set and many-one reducibility from <b>Post's</b> 1944 <b>paper</b> influenced the study of NP-complete languages in structural {{complexity theory}}. 1 Introduction Emil Post's 1944 address to the American Mathematical Society, "Recursively enumerable sets of positive integers and their decision problems" [2], had a great impact on later research in recursive function theory and theoretical computer science. The line of research which started with this paper culminated in the invention of NP-completeness, the central notion of structural complexity theory and the favorite paradigm of the whole field of computer science. In <b>Post's</b> <b>paper,</b> in recursive function theory and structural complexity theory the concept of decision problem is the main subject of research. Connected with every decision problem are an infinite family of instances and a question. For any instance [...] ...|$|R
