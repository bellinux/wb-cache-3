Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record.

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E

Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E

Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E
