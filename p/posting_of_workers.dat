40|$|One of the {{patterns}} European firms follow {{to work in}} various European countries is that of providing services in countries different from the country of origin. This can occur through the temporary mobility of workers – the <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b> The <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> {{gives rise to a}} mutual conflict between legal systems, because it allows firms to exploit inter-country differences in pay and stringency of labour law standards, and to enter new markets without complying with regulations and local rules. In other words, the <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> could be a shortcut to the exploitation of the benefits of a less protective labour law (social dumping) and could be exploited to provoke the destabilization of national social rights. In this article we study, from a legal and economic point of view, the relationship between the phenomenon of the <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> and labour market regulation in the EU area. We first describe the issue in the light of current law; then we propose an empirical analysis of the causal relationship between the number of workers posted across Europe, at country level, and disaggregated indicators of labour market regulation (OECD) for each country. The econometric analysis is carried out on an original dataset. The results show that inter-country temporary worker mobility rises, in general, with increasing employment regulation.

40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{complicated}} {{relationship between the}} EU legal framework for <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> and collective labour law. It examines this topic {{from the perspective of}} EU law and of international labour law. In doing so, it builds upon a solid interdisciplinary foundation, which looks at sociological and economic aspects of the posting phenomenon, taking also into account issues related to industrial relations. However, the immediate focus of the present book is on the creation and evolution of the said EU legal framework. Hence, it provides an in-depth analysis of the drafting process of the <b>Posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Workers</b> Directive (96 / 71) as well as an exhaustive examination of the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU dealing with <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b> This evolving legal framework is subsequently considered in its broader context. Two tensions are thus identified. On the one hand, the book investigates the growing conflict between the EU framework for <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> and the international protection of social rights. It argues that, as regards the relationship here at stake, the EU is presently violating the standards set by the Council of Europe and by the International Labour Organisation. On the other hand, the book critically considers the impact of the trend towards decentralisation of collective bargaining on the application of collective agreements to posted workers. In particular, it analyses the so-called “New Economic Governance” of the EU, and its role in fostering such a trend. The author outlines the far-reaching implications of the lack of coherence between the action of the EU institutions involved in the “New Economic Governance” and the case law of the Court of Justice dealing with <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|E

Based on the analysis, the conclusion is that the institutional integration-mechanisms, which are expressed in the <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> directive and the European Court of Justice’s interpretation of the directive, leads to social dumping in Denmark, as they reduce the national opportunity for regulation of the labour market...|$|E

40|$|Abstract   The overall aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of {{ideologies}} and norms on a legal system. Against a background of a description of the hierarchy of norms in Swedish labour law and in European Union law, respectively, the paper aims to specifically demonstrate the problems caused by the different hierarchies of norms when implementing EU directives in Swedish labor law.   The research question examines how the trade unions’ right to industrial action towards an undertaker providing transnational services by <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers,</b> is affected by the implementation of the Directive 96 / 71 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> in the framework of the provision of services. The paper answers the question under what conditions the Swedish trade unions have the right to take industrial action in situations of <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b>   Through the study of sources of law and adhering to traditional jurisprudence, this paper investigates the legislation regarding trade unions’ rights to take industrial action in situations of <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b>   In addition to the jurisprudential research, a glance at the history of ideologies is provided. The purpose of this is to explain the role of ideologies in the origins and history of Swedish labour law, as well as their role in the current development of law. With the ideological and historical discussion as a background, this paper investigates Swedish law and EU law using a comparative approach. The purpose is to illustrate how differences in ideological bases are determinant of differences in current legislation and legal practice.   The paper studies the development of law since the 1990 s with regards to the right to industrial action in situations of <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b> The Swedish labour law has been revised since Sweden joined the European Union. The presentation looks particularly at the following cases in the Swedish Labour Court: AD 1989 No. 120 (the Britannia case) and AD 2005 No. 49 (the Vaxholm case). The paper studies the <b>Posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Workers</b> Directive and presents an analysis of the European Court of Justice Case C- 341 / 05 Laval un Partneri Ltd (the Laval case). To allow for analysis and a broad discussion on the implementation of the <b>Posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Workers</b> Directive, an account is made of the different government committee instructions, committee of inquiry reports, and governmental legislative proposals of importance for the implementation of the directive into the Foreign Posting of Employees Act, and for the legislative changes prompted by the Laval case (i. e. the lex Laval).   The main conclusion drawn from the study of the legislative development is that the level of legislation of the Swedish labour market will increase due to the tendency of europeanisation. The study also establishes the importance of ideologies, norms and values for the development of a legal system. This paper does not fully answer whether the set of norms on which Swedish labour law is based is about to change, but the trend is that on the whole no such changes have been observed. The existence of lex Laval has not affected the basic set of norms of Swedish labour law...|$|E

The evaluation of the so-called 'Lex Laval' however provides for an occasion to implicitly scrutinise the whole framework of EU law regulating the posting phenomenon. The present contribution hence analyses the relationship of the decision delivered by the ECSR with two aspects of EU law. On the one hand, the contribution deals with the case law of the CJEU about the (complicated) relationship between fundamental social rights and fundamental economic freedoms of the internal market. On the other hand, it will examine the more specific issue of <b>posting</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b> Both topics reveal the existence of a sharp contrast between EU-law and the system of values, principles and rights embodied in the European Social Charter...|$|E

Although migrants in the meat sector have more opportunities to fight the exclusionary effects <b>of</b> <b>posted</b> employment because they usually reside for longer periods in the Netherlands than the more mobile migrants in construction, both groups <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> experience similar social and economic vulnerabilities, and a lack of protection mechanisms to change their precarious position...|$|R
