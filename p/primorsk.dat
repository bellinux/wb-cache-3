25|$|The icebreaking {{capability}} of the double acting tankers proved to be superior to other ships since the beginning — in shuttle service between <b>Primorsk,</b> Russia, and the Finnish refineries the tankers require no icebreaker assistance and have even acted as an icebreaker for other merchant ships that have utilized the wide channel opened by the Aframax tanker. However, {{this has not been}} intentional — when the world's largest 1A Super class ice tanker Stena Arctica, also owned by Neste Shipping, became stuck in ice outside the port of <b>Primorsk</b> during the winter of 2009–2010, a decision was made to leave the assisting to Russian icebreakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{western part}} of the Karelian Isthmus is an {{important}} transport corridor linking Scandinavia and Central Russia. <b>Primorsk,</b> terminus of the Baltic Pipeline System, which has recently {{become one of the most}} efficient Russian sea ports, is also located here.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, {{projects}} are being discussed {{to construct a}} cargo railway along the northern shore of the Vuoksi River from Losevo to Kamennogorsk to ship crude oil to the sea port of <b>Primorsk</b> bypassing the Saint Petersburg– Vyborg line. An alternative is reconstruction of the Sosnovo– Michurinskoye– Zhitkovo– Vyborg railway.|$|E
50|$|During {{planning}} and construction stages {{the project was}} criticized by environmentalists, {{mainly because of the}} Baltic Sea's status as a particularly sensitive sea area and <b>Primorsk’s</b> proximity to the Beryozovye Islands nature reserve, a major bird sanctuary protected by the Ramsar Convention.|$|R
25|$|While the {{scrapping}} of the obsolete steam-powered icebreaker {{was planned}} already in 1967, Volynets remained in service until 1985. In the following year, {{she was used}} to supply steam during the construction of the naval port in <b>Primorsk,</b> but was afterwards returned to Lomonosov. She was finally slated for demolition in late 1987.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major and}} {{historical}} {{activity in the}} gulf is fishing, especially on the northern coast near Vyborg, <b>Primorsk</b> and on the southern coast near Ust-Luga. Commercial fish species are herring, sprats, European smelt, whitefishes, carp bream, roaches, perch, European eel, lamprey and others. In 2005, the catchment was 2000 tons by the ships of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast alone.|$|E
25|$|There {{are declining}} amounts of these {{benchmark}} oils being produced each year, so other oils are more commonly {{what is actually}} delivered. While the reference price may be for West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, the actual oil being traded may be a discounted Canadian heavy oil—Western Canadian Select— delivered at Hardisty, Alberta, and for a Brent Blend delivered at Shetland, {{it may be a}} discounted Russian Export Blend delivered at the port of <b>Primorsk.</b>|$|E
25|$|MT Mastera is a Finnish Aframax {{crude oil}} tanker {{operated}} by Neste Shipping. She and her sister ship, Tempera, are the first ships to utilize the double acting tanker (DAT) concept, developed by Aker Arctic, in which the vessel is designed to travel ahead in open water and astern in severe ice conditions. The two icebreaking tankers are used to transport crude oil year round from the Russian oil terminal in <b>Primorsk</b> to Neste Oil refineries in Porvoo and Naantali.|$|E
25|$|MT Tempera is a Finnish Aframax {{crude oil}} tanker. Built at Sumitomo Heavy Industries in Japan in 2002, {{she was the}} first ship to utilize the double acting tanker (DAT) concept, {{developed}} by Aker Arctic, in which the vessel is designed to travel ahead in open water and astern in severe ice conditions. Tempera and her sister ship Mastera, built in 2003, were used mainly to transport crude oil, year-round, from the Russian oil terminal in <b>Primorsk</b> to Neste Oil refineries in Porvoo and Naantali.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} Tempera and Mastera {{have been used}} mainly for year-round transportation of crude oil from the Russian oil terminal of <b>Primorsk</b> to company's own oil terminals in Porvoo and Naantali, {{where they have been}} the only ships capable of operating without delays or problems during the harshest winters. Occasionally they have carried cargoes in the Gulf of Bothnia and even outside the Baltic Sea depending on the amount of oil in the refineries' storage tanks. However, due to draft restrictions the ships could not carry a full cargo of 100,000 tons to the port of Naantali until April 2010 — they had to stop at Porvoo on the way and unload 20,000 tons of oil to reduce the draft of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Lomonosov (general cargo, containers, metals), Vyborg (general cargo), <b>Primorsk</b> (oil and {{petroleum}} products), Vysotsk (oil and coal), Ust-Luga (oil, coal, timber, containers); in Finland: Helsinki (containers), Kotka (containers, timber, agricultural products; it is {{the main}} transhipment cargo port for Russia), Hanko (containers, vehicles), Turku (containers, rail ferry), Kilpilahti/Sköldvik harbour (oil refinery); in Estonia: Tallinn (grains, refrigerators, oil), Paldiski, Sillamäe. Gulf of Finland {{is also part of}} the Volga-Baltic Waterway and White Sea – Baltic Canal. Important goods include apatite from the Kola Peninsula, Karelian granite and greenstone, timber from Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda, ferrous metals from Cherepovets, coal from Donbass and the Kuznetsk Basin, pyrite from Ural, potassium chloride from Solikamsk, oil from Volga region, and grains from many regions of Russia.|$|E

Tempera has also visited Murmansk, where she loaded crude oil from FSO Belokamenka.

2500|$|The Gulf of Finland ( [...] ; [...] ) is [...] the easternmost {{arm of the}} Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) {{all the way to}} Saint Petersburg in Russia, {{where the}} river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most {{important}} oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including <b>Primorsk).</b> As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 Fortum ordered two [...] {{double acting}} Aframax tankers from Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan, {{to replace the}} company's older tankers that, because of their lower ice class, had traffic {{restrictions}} during {{the worst part of}} the winter and could not deliver their cargo {{all the way to the}} refineries in Porvoo and Naantali because they were not given icebreaker assistance. When this happened, the oil had to be transported to smaller ships of higher ice class at the edge of the ice — a practice that was both uneconomical and hazardous. The new ships are equipped with one pulling-type 16 MW Azipod unit — the most powerful ice-strengthened pod ABB has ever produced — and have the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super. They are designed to be capable of independent navigation and icebreaking in Baltic ice conditions with a possibility to operate also in the Pechora Sea. The ships follow the double acting principle with a bulbous bow for open water performance and stern designed with icebreaking performance in mind. The first double acting tanker, Tempera, was delivered in 2002 and its sister ship, Mastera, in 2003. The icebreaking capability of the vessels proved to be superior to other ships — in shuttle service between <b>Primorsk,</b> Russia, and the Finnish refineries the tankers required no icebreaker assistance and even acted as icebreakers for other merchant ships. The ships can break level ice up to [...] thick at [...] when operating astern.|$|E
