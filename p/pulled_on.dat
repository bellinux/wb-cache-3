5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being <b>pulled</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{match was}} {{followed}} by the Tag Team Championship match. The match started slowly, but both teams soon began brawling in the ring. The Harts focused on Pierre, but Jacques was eventually able to tag in to rescue him. After Pierre regained the advantage, Owen tagged in and took control of the match. He applied the Sharpshooter to Jacques, but Pierre broke the hold. Bret tagged in but fell out of the ring and kayfabe hurt his knee when the Quebecers' manager <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the ropes. The Quebecers focused on Bret's knee until Bret regained the advantage and attempted to apply the Sharpshooter. He was not able to stand, however, so the referee stopped the match and awarded the victory to the Quebecers. After the match, Owen yelled at Bret for not tagging out of the match. He then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring.|$|E

5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E

25|$|However, this stint of concerts also {{featured}} many unsavoury crowd control problems, with the shows often descending into violent confrontations between young concert-goers and the police.

On occasion Led Zeppelin were refused service in restaurants and in Texas they had a gun <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> them.|$|E
25|$|A {{golf bag}} {{is used to}} {{transport}} golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. Golf bags can be carried, <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play. Golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.|$|E
25|$|Over {{long time}} scales, ice sheet mass balance {{is governed by}} the amount of {{sunlight}} reaching the earth. This variation in sunlight reaching the earth, or insolation, over geologic time is in turn determined by the angle of the earth to the sun and shape of the Earth's orbit, as it is <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> by neighboring planets; these variations occur in predictable patterns called Milankovitch cycles. Milankovitch cycles dominate climate on the glacial–interglacial timescale, but there exist variations in ice sheet extent that are not linked directly with insolation.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, a seal knob is also {{referred}} to as a seal nose (yin bi 印鼻): [...] "the nose of seal"; bi (鼻) means [...] "nose", perhaps because in ancient time people needed a rope to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the seal through its top, just like <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> an ox or slave through his nose.|$|R

25|$|Trains {{were driven}} by a {{locomotive}} {{for part of the}} journey, but on inclined planes were <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> ropes by steam-driven stationary winding engines located at Tyler Hill and Clowes Wood. The locomotive used was the Invicta, an 0-4-0 inclined cylinder tender locomotive built by Robert Stephenson, the son of engineer George Stephenson. Whitstable harbour was opened by the railway company in 1832, and the rail line was extended to enable goods, mainly coal, to be directly transferred from ships onto the trains. In 1834, the world's first season tickets were issued for the C line.|$|E
25|$|One day the moon, {{hearing of}} this, <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> a black cloak over her yellow hair {{and went to}} see for herself. She fell into a pool, and a snag bound her there. She saw a man coming toward the pool and fought to be free until the hood fell off; the light helped the man make his way to safety and scared off the evil creatures. She {{struggled}} to follow until the hood fell back over her hair, and all the evil things {{came out of the}} darkness, trapping her under a big stone with a will-o'-the-wyke to sit on the cross-shaped snag and keep watch.|$|E
25|$|Pathogens can {{suppress}} amygdala activity. Rats {{infected with}} the toxoplasmosis parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within {{the body of the}} cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats. In a separate experiment, rats with lesions in the amygdala did not express fear or anxiety towards unwanted stimuli. These rats <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> levers supplying food that sometimes sent out electrical shocks. While they learned to avoid pressing on them, they did not distance themselves from these shock-inducing levers.|$|E

25|$|At independence, the {{northern}} region had two functioning political parties: the SNL, representing the Isaaq clan-family that constituted a numerical majority there; and the USP, supported {{largely by the}} Dir and the Daarood. In a unified Somalia, however, the Isaaq were a small minority, whereas {{the northern}} Daarood joined members of their clan-family from {{the south in the}} SYL. The Dir, having few kinsmen in the south, were <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the one hand by traditional ties to the Hawiye {{and on the other hand}} by common regional sympathies to the Isaaq. The southern opposition party, the Greater Somalia League (GSL), pro-Arab and militantly pan-Somalist, attracted the support of the SNL and the USP against the SYL, which had adopted a moderate stand before independence.|$|E
25|$|On 20 January 2017, Gerrard rejoined Liverpool in {{an academy}} {{coaching}} role after rejecting the vacant managers job at MK Dons. On 11 April 2017, {{it was reported}} that Gerrard would be taking charge of the Liverpool Under-18 side ahead of the 2017–18 season after impressing Jurgen Klopp and Alex Inglethorpe with his work ethic, knowledge and attitude towards academy coaching. However, before he took the next step on the path to receive his coaching credentials, Gerrard <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the Liverpool shirt one last time in a friendly against Australian club Sydney FC {{at the end of this}} Premier League campaign. On 7 September 2017, the club announced Gerrard will manage the Under-19 team in the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League.|$|E
25|$|The Sharks {{returned}} to the playoffs in 1997–98, with goalie Mike Vernon, whom they acquired from the Red Wings, and new head coach Darryl Sutter. For the next two years, the Sharks made the playoffs, yet never advanced past the first round. In 1999, San Jose acquired former Toronto and Montreal star Vincent Damphousse. San Jose's luck changed in the 1999–2000 season, when the Sharks finished with their first-ever winning record. In an upset on par with the one they had <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> Detroit six years earlier, the Sharks managed to eliminate the St. Louis Blues, who had finished first overall in the league that year, in seven games. However, the Sharks were defeated {{in the second round}} of the playoffs by the Dallas Stars. It was their second time losing to Dallas.|$|E

25|$|On 8 May Comus {{sent her}} boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended {{by a strong}} fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed felucca, which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The {{boarding}} party, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Watts, cleared her deck of her crew and the boats started to pull her out (the Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> a hawser. Eventually the boarding party cut the hawser and the boats succeeded in pulling the felucca out, an operation they conducted under fire. The felucca was the packet ship San Pedro de Apostol, which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, San Pedro de Apostol had captured the Lord Keith, which had been sailing from London to Mogador.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} from Australia, Cowdrey decided {{to drop out of}} Oxford so he could {{concentrate}} on his career with Kent and England. No longer an undergraduate he was called up for national service, but discharged after two weeks in the Royal Air Force due to a hereditary disability of rigid toes on which he previously had an operation. This caused some controversy as he promptly made 44, 101, 5, 139, 48, 44, 115 not out and 103 not out, hardly the scores of an invalid. The press suggested that strings had been <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his behalf and questions were asked in the House of Commons by Gerald Nabarro MP, though he apologised after the true facts became known. Cowdrey received hate mail from the parents of national servicemen, and took great care to answer them personally. He was called up for the Third Test against South Africa, but was battered by the fast bowlers Peter Heine and Neil Adcock making 1 and 50, which he considered to be the worse bruising of his career and Cowdrey pulled out of the series rather than add to his injuries.|$|E
25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|E
