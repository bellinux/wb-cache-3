5|$|The {{properties}} of thorium vary widely {{depending on the}} degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually thorium dioxide (ThO2); even the <b>purest</b> thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g/cm3 calculated from thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E

5|$|The <b>purest</b> metal is {{obtained}} from nickel oxide by the Mond process, which achieves a purity of greater than 99.99%. The process was patented by Ludwig Mond {{and has been}} in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century. In this process, nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide {{in the presence of a}} sulfur catalyst at around 40–80°C to form nickel carbonyl. Iron gives iron pentacarbonyl, too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary, the nickel may be separated by distillation. Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by-product, but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid.|$|E

Of the union's numerous rivers, the Volga is the most famous, not only because it is the longest in Europe, but also because of its major role in history. In Siberia the Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among the longest rivers in the world.|$|E
5|$|Racism, {{especially}} antisemitism, was {{a central}} feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered by the Nazis to be the <b>purest</b> branch of the Aryan race and were therefore viewed as the master race. Millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.|$|E

5|$|Strongly built, {{and compact}} yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and tails. Their most common coat color is gray, {{although}} {{they can be}} found in many other colors.

A sub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders to be the <b>purest</b> strain of Andalusian, though there is no genetic evidence for this claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however, and is preferred by breeders because buyers pay more for horses of Carthusian bloodlines. There are several competing registries keeping records of horses designated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the Andalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the legalities of stud book ownership. At least one lawsuit is in progress , to determine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the <b>purest</b> industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E

5|$|Many adult insects use six {{legs for}} walking and {{have adopted a}} tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and {{the front and rear}} left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The <b>purest</b> form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E
5|$|Progressive rock {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the <b>purest</b> representatives of the genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is {{at least in part}} due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. Cultural factors were also involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as the complex arrangements of Rush, the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and the eclectic fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie Dregs. British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles.|$|E
