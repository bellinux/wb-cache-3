Alekry said that while walking him, riot <b>police</b> <b>also</b> broke his nose and damaged his left eye so badly in the process that he {{temporarily}} lost his sight. He was then taken to a police bus, where his pants were pulled down by an officer who threatened Alekry with sexual assault; though the threat was not carried out.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists dug up the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. <b>Police</b> <b>also</b> searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. Nothing was found {{that could be used}} as evidence.|$|E
5|$|As the {{shooting}} occurred outside the Tucson city limits in unincorporated Casas Adobes, the Pima County Sheriff's Department started the initial investigation with {{assistance from the}} Tucson Police Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The Federal Bureau of Investigation director Robert Mueller was ordered to the location by President Obama, and the FBI took over the investigation. The United States Capitol <b>Police</b> <b>also</b> conducted an investigation.|$|E

50|$|Tone <b>policing</b> (<b>also</b> tone trolling, tone {{argument}} and tone fallacy) is an ad hominem and antidebate appeal based on genetic fallacy. It attempts to {{detract from the}} validity of a statement by attacking the tone {{in which it was}} presented rather than the message itself.|$|R

5|$|During {{the night}} of 1–2 February, Mubarak {{supporters}} and protesters clashed in Alexandria, where shots were reportedly fired into the air. Government forces and the <b>police</b> <b>also</b> fired into the crowd {{in an attempt to}} disperse the protesters. In Cairo, many protesters from the previous day had remained in Tahrir Square overnight.|$|E
5|$|Each of the A, B, C and E {{categories}} of gun license allows {{the person to}} buy a B or C category of gun.

5|$|<b>Police</b> <b>also</b> {{conducted}} a routine re-examination of other unsolved murder cases dating back 20 years {{in areas where}} Smith had lived. Officers from West Midlands Police held a conference in October 2001 with representatives from several other forces, including Gloucestershire and West Mercia, to share information about unsolved murder cases in their areas. Detectives interviewed Smith three times, {{but he refused to}} answer their questions, and no further charges were brought.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} investigations levelled accusations at Silverio Nungo (who {{was later}} executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado. The latter {{had made no}} secret of his distrust of Mondlane, seeing him as too conservative a leader, and the Tanzanian <b>police</b> <b>also</b> accused him of working with PIDE (Portugal's secret police) to assassinate Mondlane. Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.|$|E
5|$|The <b>police</b> <b>also</b> arrested six men for {{involvement}} in the attack, but they were later released for lack of evidence. As of 7 November 2012, Mullah Fazlullah, the cleric who ordered the attack on Yousafzai, was confirmed to be hiding in Eastern Afghanistan by US sources there.|$|E
5|$|The riots were {{condemned}} by football authorities with threats of expulsion of national football teams from European competition being given out if similar events happened again. The Danish <b>police</b> <b>also</b> were criticized for their {{handling of the}} riots.|$|E

50|$|This type of <b>policing</b> <b>also</b> {{allows for}} law {{enforcement}} agencies to ‘predict’ where, when or by whom a crime may occur {{in the future and}} respond accordingly. Big data analytical tools are used to identify patterns in crime, allowing authorities to map high risk areas, times and days for certain types of crime. Through such software, <b>police</b> are <b>also</b> able to create profiles of potential criminals and associated behaviours. Developments in technology within smart cities allow for the scope of predictions to be increased as well as the types of responses available to law enforcement bodies.|$|R

5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. <b>Police</b> <b>also</b> found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The <b>police</b> <b>also</b> organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Police</b> <b>also</b> {{found that}} the cell phone of a former Ocean Club {{restaurant}} worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion {{was that he had}} been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Croatian Guards Brigade (1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug - HGZ) {{arrived in}} the Knin area to connect with {{elements}} of the 4th, 7th and 9th Guards Brigades, tasked with a northward advance the next day. The Split Corps command moved to Knin as well. The Croatian special police proceeded to Gornji Lapac and Donji Lapac arriving by 2p.m. and completing {{the boundary between the}} Gospić and Split Corps AORs. The Croatian special <b>police</b> <b>also</b> made contact with the 4th Guards Brigade in Otrić and the Gospić Corps units in Udbina by 3p.m. By 7p.m., a battalion of the special police reached the border near Kulen Vakuf, securing the area.|$|E
5|$|The mounted <b>police</b> <b>also</b> {{purchased}} various boats {{for work}} along Canada's coasts and rivers. The Keewatin, a sailing vessel, was bought in 1890 {{for use on}} Lake Winnipeg, but it capsized later the same year. In 1902, the steamboat Vidette was acquired to transport the police along the Yukon River, supported by three launches. Redwing, a small steamer, was purchased for transport on Lake Winnipeg in 1905. The police had the Rouville steamer specially constructed for patrolling in the far north in 1906, but tests demonstrated it burnt through too much fuel, and it was never deployed. By 1919, however, the Victory, Duncan, Lady Borden and Chakawana motor vessels were patrolling the far north and the west coast.|$|E
5|$|There {{were over}} 13,000 Royal Military Police (“redcaps”). They were unpopular, {{at a time}} when the police were often unpopular with young men from big cities. Besides policing, a large part of their job was {{maintaining}} discipline on the march and keeping roads running smoothly, and collecting stragglers from a battle. During the March 1918 retreat 25,000 stragglers were rounded up and sent back to fighting units. Royal Military <b>Police</b> <b>also</b> fought on occasion if headquarters areas were threatened by an enemy advance. Although soldiers sometimes told lurid tales of men who refused to fight being shot by Military Police, no reliable first-hand accounts exist of this happening.|$|E

5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the <b>police.</b> <b>Also,</b> the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The <b>police</b> <b>also</b> stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. <b>Police</b> <b>also</b> suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
