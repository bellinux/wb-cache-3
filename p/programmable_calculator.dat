5|$|The Sinclair Scientific {{calculator}} was a 12-function, pocket-sized {{scientific calculator}} introduced in 1974, dramatically undercutting in price other calculators {{available at the}} time. The Sinclair Scientific Programmable, released a year later, was advertised as the first budget <b>programmable</b> <b>calculator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A <b>programmable</b> <b>calculator</b> in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|Satoru Iwata {{was born}} on December6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural official. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata {{displayed}} leadership skills through service as class president, student council president, and club president at various times. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines. Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple numeric game, called Game 31, until he mastered it. With money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first <b>programmable</b> <b>calculator,</b> in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year. The several simple number games Iwata produced, such as Volleyball and Missile Attack, made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates.|$|E
50|$|One {{important}} feature of <b>programmable</b> <b>calculators</b> is the availability of some form of persistent memory. Without persistent memory, programs have to be re-entered whenever power is lost, making the device cumbersome. Persistent memory can be internal or on a separate device. Some <b>programmable</b> <b>calculators</b> employ both schemes.|$|R

50|$|<b>Programmable</b> <b>calculators</b> are calculators {{that can}} {{automatically}} {{carry out a}} sequence of operations under control of a stored program, much like a computer. The first <b>programmable</b> <b>calculators</b> such as the IBM CPC used punched cards or other media for program storage. Hand-held electronic calculators store programs on magnetic strips, removable read-only memory cartridges, or in battery-backed read/write memory.|$|R
25|$|The Monroe Epic <b>programmable</b> <b>calculator</b> came on {{the market}} in 1967. A large, printing, {{desk-top}} unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) {{at the end of the}} operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any conditional branch (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a <b>programmable</b> <b>calculator</b> from a computer.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century {{also saw}} the designs of Charles Babbage calculating machines, first with his {{difference}} engine, started in 1822, {{which was the first}} automatic calculator since it continuously used the results of the previous operation for the next one, and second with his analytical engine, which was the first <b>programmable</b> <b>calculator,</b> using Jacquard's cards to read program and data, that he started in 1834, and which gave the blueprint of the mainframe computers built {{in the middle of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The first Soviet {{programmable}} desktop calculator ISKRA 123, {{powered by}} the power grid, was released {{at the start of}} the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered <b>programmable</b> <b>calculator,</b> Elektronika B3-21, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the start of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the board computer.|$|E
