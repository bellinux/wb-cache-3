50|$|Metallurgy is {{a domain}} of {{materials}} {{science and engineering}} that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their inter-metallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys.

[Master's thesis] Water has always been {{closely associated with the}} mining and processing of precious metals. Either it served as a secondary source from which gold was gained by gold-washing, or as a tool for further processing of primary mined ore. Thesis is divided into two sections which describe both of these options. In the first part, thesis deals with gold-panning. It describes sources for the history study of gold-panning in Slovakia and it presents current state of research. On the basis of historical knowledge from "De Re Metallica libri XII. " (G. Agricola 1556) are presented the different types of chutes, which are used for gold-washing. This section also includes excursion about mining archaeology and excursion about origin and appearance of gold in Slovakia. The second part describes different steps in the processing of primary mined ores. Since there was no archaeological research of medieval facilities for processing ores in Slovakia, in the paper are presented examples of two researches of mining facilities from Czech Republic.

40|$|Kutná Hora and its {{surrounding}} environment was affected by mining Ag, later Pb - Zn ore, lasting several centuries. As a result of mining, extreme concentrations of heavy metals and metalloids, especially As, in waters, soils and plants are. The aim of this work was to study the elemental composition of soils and tree rings, including processes between soil and plants on contaminated and uncontaminated area to describe biogeochemical processes between soil and plants. Elemental composition (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sb, Tl, Pb) were determined in soils and tree rings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) using ICP - MS. The measured concentrations of elements indicate contamination of soils and tree rings due to mining and metallurgical activities. The highest concentrations of As in soil (14 977 mg/kg) were found at contaminated site (Kaňk) at depth of 40 - 50 cm. This locality is situated on the heap, where waste from the mining and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>ores</b> are deposited, together with minerals and weathering products containing As. The uncontaminated area (Sukov) exhibited the maximum concentration of As in soils 124, 38 mg/kg {{at a depth of}} 5 - 10 cm, due to the contamination by dust from the contamined sites.

40|$|The {{grade of}} a mineral deposit is {{determined}} by the effectiveness of a geological ore forming process, which {{is the result of the}} interaction between an ore forming mechanism and the environment in which it operates. Properties of a mineral deposit controlled by ore forming processes include the distribution, density and nature of ore minerals and gangue, and the metal content and impurities of the ore minerals. More efficient ore forming processes tend to develop in the larger mineralizing systems giving rise to richer deposits. As the geological environment within which a mineral deposit evolves becomes more complex a greater number of variables interact to determine the grade of the deposit. This is reflected in the greater variability of the grade distribution, resulting in greater difficulties in obtaining reliable estimates of the recoverable grade, and increased difficulties in the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>ores.</b> In response to economic fluctuations the working grade of heterogeneous orebodies, that form in geologically complex environments, can often be altered to ensure the continued viability of a mining venture. In contrast the evenly mineralized orebodies that tend to develop in geologically simple environments do not have this flexibility. All the important decisions in the mining industry, such as feasibility studies, choice of ~ining and processing methods, selection and planning, are made on the basis of, or are related to, grade estimates. If the geological controls of grade are fully understood, then it is possible to optimize the selection of the various mining alternatives, leading to the efficient exploitation of ore deposits.
