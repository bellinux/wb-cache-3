40|$|Abstract. While the {{fluorescence}} and {{the ground}} counter techniques {{for the detection of}} ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) were being developed for decades, the interest in the radio detection diminished after the initial experiments in the 1960 s. As a result, the fluorescence and the surface array techniques are more mature today, providing more reliable measurements of the <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> energy, chemical composition and the inelastic cross-section. The advantages of the radio technique are 100 % duty cycle and lower deployment and operational costs. Thus, the radio technique can greatly complement the fluorescence {{and the ground}} array detection and can also work independently. With the ANITA balloon detector observing UHECRs and the success of LOPES, CODALEMA and other surface radio detectors, the radio technique received a significant boost in recent years. Reliable Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are needed in order to obtain the energy and other parameters of the primary cosmic ray particle from the radio observations.

In this diploma thesis, an effort to measure the multiplicity distribution of cosmic muons and their arrivaltime with the H 1 detector at DESY (Deut­ sches Elektronen Synchrotron) was initiated. For this purpose, new Level 1 and Level 2 triggers, as well a new Level 4 filter were designed. In Level 1 a new trigger element, MU_ 3 _BAR, was created to select events with at least three muon candidates. In addition, the topological Level 2 trigger selects events fulfilling some topological conditions. In Level 4 a filter, looking for events with multiple muon candidates, was installed. The total output of this triggering scheme is below 0. 1 Hz. This allows to include the triggersalso in normal ep running mode of the experiment.

40|$|In {{radiation}} protection, the Q-factor {{has been}} defined to describe the biological effectiveness of the energy deposition or absorbed dose to humans in the mixed radiation fields at aviation altitudes. This particular radiation field is generated by the interactions of <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles</b> with the atoms of the constituents of the Earth’s atmosphere. Thus the intensity, characterized by the ambient dose equivalent rate H*(10), depends on the flight altitude and the energy spectra of the particles, mainly protons and alpha particles, impinging on the atmosphere. These charged cosmic projectiles are deflected both by the interplanetary and the Earth’s magnetic field such that the corresponding energy spectra are modulated by these fields. The solar minimum is a time period of particular interest since the interplanetary magnetic field is weakest within the 11 -year solar cycle and the dose rates at aviation altitudes reach their maximum due to the reduced shielding of galactic cosmic radiation. For this reason, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) performed repeated dosimetric on-board measurements in cooperation with several German airlines during the past solar minimum from March 2006 to August 2008. The Q-factors measured with a TEPC range from 1. 98 at the equator to 2. 60 in the polar region. ...|$|R
