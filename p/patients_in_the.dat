This Receiving Station {{took over the}} site near Jericho, occupied by the main dressing station during the two Transjordan attacks, which could accommodate 200 patients in mud huts, 400 patients in tents, and 700 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abandoned Desert Mounted Corps headquarters.|$|E
5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Casson's uncle, Isambard Owen, {{vice-chancellor}} at University of Bristol, {{promised her}} a place studying medicine {{if she could}} be formally matriculated to the university. She struggled with her Latin exams for two years, but eventually passed them and registered to study medicine on 1 October 1913 {{at the age of}} 32. She graduated with her Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1919, and took on a role at the West Hertfordshire Hospital in Hemel Hempstead. There she noticed that <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women's wards were enjoying using artistic talents, and decided that such pursuits were important to treatment. She realised that these pursuits were not only keeping the patients occupied but also helping them gain self-esteem and work through their issues.|$|E

5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested {{for the murder of}} an elderly widow. Rumours had been circulating since 1935 regarding the frequency of his being named in patients' wills (132 times between 1946 and 1956) and the gifts he was given (including two Rolls Royces). Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers, but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which gripped the nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck off for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he is thought to have killed up to 163 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastbourne area.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E

An increased level of serum cTnI also independently predicts poor prognosis of critically ill <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of acute coronary syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} has almost 1,000 beds, and serves {{half a million}} people every year through Brazil's unified public health system, SUS, performing on average 40 surgeries and 13 births every day. In the 2000s, the hospital was changed from a primary and secondary care to a specialized tertiary care center, receiving complex cases from other hospitals and clinics in the region, but around 60% of <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital are still cases that could be handled by local health centers.|$|E
5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
