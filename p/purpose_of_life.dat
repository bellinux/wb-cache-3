5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} soul and the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology and the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E
5|$|Meher Baba gave {{numerous}} teachings on {{the cause}} and <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> including teaching reincarnation and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is imagination, that God is what really exists, and that each soul is really God passing through imagination to realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also taught about the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in his principal books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E

During a four-week period of silence, individuals undergo a series of directed meditations on the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and contemplations on the life of Christ.

This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the Confucians who believed that while love should be unconditional, {{it should not be}} indiscriminate.

25|$|Mormonism {{teaches that}} the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> on Earth is to gain {{knowledge}} and experience and to have joy. Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus {{have the potential to}} progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow. The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise, rather the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil. Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world, so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.|$|E
