25|$|The zygote divides {{inside the}} female's uterus {{to become an}} embryo, which {{over a period of}} 38 weeks (9 months) of {{gestation}} becomes a fetus. After this span of time, the fully grown fetus is birthed from the woman's body and breathes independently as an infant for the first time. At this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of personhood earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993, Burundi's first {{democratically elected}} president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by Tutsi officers, {{as was the}} <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> succeed him under the constitution. This sparked a {{genocide}} in Burundi between Hutu political structures and the Tutsi military, in which [...] "possibly as many as 25,000 Tutsi" [...] were murdered by the former and [...] "at least as many" [...] {{were killed by the}} latter. Since the 2000 Arusha Peace Process, today in Burundi the Tutsi minority shares power in a more or less equitable manner with the Hutu majority. Traditionally, the Tutsi had held more economic power and controlled the military.|$|E
2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} may be predicated upon an improper disposal, removal, transportation, delivery, or {{transfer of possession}} of property to one not authorized by the owner to receive the property. The Restatement (Second) of Torts states that, with some exceptions, one who makes an unauthorized delivery of a chattel to a person not entitled to its immediate possession is subject to liability for conversion to another who is so entitled. [...] A bailee, agent, or servant who re-delivers to his bailor, principal, or master is not liable for conversion unless the <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> immediate possession had made an adverse claim upon him. [...] A bailee, agent or servant who delivers the chattel to a third person pursuant to the instructions of his bailor, principal or master is not liable for conversion unless he has knowledge or reason to know that his bailor, principal, or master is not authorized so to dispose of it.|$|E

60|$|The {{question}} as to the <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the honor and reward for having captured the king long continued a matter of dispute between the people of Lucena and Vaena. On the 20th of October, 1520, about thirty-seven years after the event, an examination of several witnesses to the fact took place before the {{chief justice of the}} fortress of Lucena, at the instance of Bartolomy Hurtado, the son of Martin, when the claim of his father was established by Dona Leonora Hernandez, lady in attendant on the mother of the alcayde of los Donceles, who testified being present when Boabdil signalized Martin Hurtado as his captor.|$|E

Mr Melmotte did put out his hand in token of amity. Then Mr Broune {{departed}} and Melmotte tinkled his bell. As Nidderdale was shown in he crumpled up the cheque, {{and put it into}} his pocket. He was at once clever enough to perceive that any idea which he might have had of prosecuting Sir Felix must be abandoned. 'Well, my Lord, and how are you?' said he with his pleasantest smile. Nidderdale declared himself to be as fresh as paint. 'You don't look down in the mouth, my Lord.' ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} morning the capitaine and Marie were {{formally}} betrothed. This was done with some little ceremony, in the presence of all the guests who were staying at the establishment, and with all manner of gracious acknowledgments of Marie's virtues. It seemed as though La Mere Bauche could not be courteous enough to her. There was no more talk of her being a child of charity; no more allusion now to the gutter. La Mere Bauche with her own hand brought her cake with a glass of wine after her betrothal was over, and patted her on the cheek, and called her her dear little Marie Campan. And then the capitaine was made up of infinite politeness, and the guests all wished her joy, and the servants of the house began to perceive that she was a <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> respect. How different was all this from that harsh attack that was made on her the preceding evening! Only Adolphe,--he alone kept aloof. Though he was present there he said nothing. He, and he only, offered no congratulations.|$|E
60|$|Almost all the {{citizens}} of Al-Madinah who have not some official charge about the temple qualify themselves to act as Muzawwirs. They begin as boys to learn the formula of prayer, and the conducting of visitors; and partly by begging, partly by boldness, they often pick up a tolerable livelihood at an early age. The Muzawwir will often receive strangers into his house, as was done to me, and direct their devotions during the whole time of their stay. For such service he requires a sum of money proportioned to his guests' circumstances, but this fee does not end the connexion. If the Muzawwir visit {{the home of his}} Zair, he expects to be treated with the utmost hospitality, and to depart with a handsome present. A religious visitor will often transmit to his cicerone at Meccah and at Al-Madinah yearly sums to purchase for himself a prayer at the Ka'abah and the Prophet's Tomb. The remittance is usually wrapped up in paper, and placed in a sealed leathern bag, somewhat like a portfolio, upon which is worked the name of the <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> receive it. It is then given in charge either to a trustworthy pilgrim, or to the public treasurer, who accompanies the principal caravans.|$|E

6000|$|... "Whatever was it {{that you}} really did say to Robin about her room? Young Bute came round to me on Monday quite upset about it. He says {{it is going to}} be all windows, and will look, when finished, like an {{incorrect}} copy of the Eddystone lighthouse. He says there will be no place for the bed, and if there is to be a fireplace at all it will have to be in the cupboard, and that the only way, so far as he can see, of her getting in and out of it will be by a door through the bathroom. She said that you said she could have it entirely to her own idea, and that he was just to carry out her instructions; but, as he points out, you can't have a room in a house as if the rest of the house wasn't there, even if it is your own room. Nobody, it seems, will be able to have a bath without first talking it over with her, and arranging a time mutually convenient. I told him I was sure you never meant him to do anything absurd; and that his best plan would be to go straight back to her, explain to her that she'd been talking like a silly goat--he could have put it politely, of course--and that he wasn't going to pay any attention to her. You might have thought I had suggested his walking into a den of lions and pulling all their tails. I don't know what Robin has done to him, but he seems quite frightened of her. I had to promise that I would talk to her. He'd better have done it himself. I only told her just what he said, and off she went in one of her tantrums. You know her style: If she liked to live in a room where she could see to do her hair that was no business of his, and if he couldn't design a plain, simple bedroom that wasn't going to look ridiculous and make her the laughing-stock of all the neighbourhood, then the Royal Institute of British Architects must have strange notions of the sort of <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> go about the country building houses; that if he thought the proper place for a fire was in a cupboard, she didn't; that his duty was to carry out the instructions of his employers, and if he imagined for a moment she was going to consent to remain shut up in her room till everybody in the house had finished bathing it would be better for us to secure the services of somebody possessed of a little commonsense; that next time she met him she would certainly tell him what she thought of him, also that she should certainly decline to hold any further communication with him again; that she doesn't want a bedroom now of any sort--perhaps she may be permitted a shakedown in the pantry, or perhaps Veronica will allow her an occasional night's rest with her, and if not it doesn't matter. You'll have to talk to her yourself. I'm not going to say any more.|$|E
