The growing <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> {{increasingly}} {{limits the}} usefulness {{and efficiency of}} classical firewall architectures and, therefore, increases {{the need for the}} deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this contribution a concept is proposed that combines an anomaly-based IDS with mechanisms typically applied in honeynets as well as with additional functions. A first prototype implementation of this concept indicates that it allows to combine the advantages of both approaches in order to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection {{while at the same time}} avoiding unnecessary restrictions for the users of suspicious systems as well as minimising the risk for the rest of the production network. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis was to evaluate business potential of wireless local area networks (WLAN, Wireless LAN). At first, the scope of business potential evaluation of technology was introduced. Next, a general framework of business potential evaluation of technology based on literature was presented. In addition, convergence of cellular networks and data networks was studied {{in order to get}} an insight of current situation of mobile telecommunications industry. Finally, wireless local area networks business potential was evaluated. A wireless local area network is a data communication system, which combines data connectivity with mobility and is implemented in unlicensed frequency bands, allowing new business opportunities to emerge. The main markets of WLAN are corporate networks, public area networks and access networks. At the moment the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> WLAN <b>terminals</b> is low which derives to low demand of wireless LAN services. In addition, unlicensed spectrum forces the teleoperators to set the service price relatively low. The business potential is in integrating wireless LANs to cellular networks and in offering value added services to end users. The future of wireless LAN is to be complementary network to cellular networks. In this vision cellular networks provide voice and low data services and broadband wireless networks enable multimedia services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract] Due to {{the high}} {{instability}} of wind and the big-amplitude fluctuation of wind power hence resulted, the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> wind power in the electrical grid can hardly exceed 10 %. The paper proposed a novel mentality of developing the non-grid-connected wind power, namely the large-scale wind power that is directly applied, without connecting it to the electrical grid, to a series <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> users that are adaptable to the property of wind power. The original mentality of directly applying the large-scale non-grid-connected wind power explores its own creative way for the large-scale application of wind power.

50|$|Penetration {{is also a}} value {{characteristic}} of phage-host infection that involves the injection of the phages genetic material inside the bacterium. <b>Penetration</b> <b>of</b> nucleic acid takes place after the irreversible adsorption phase.

This penetration mechanism can involve electrochemical membrane potential, ATP molecules, enzymatic splitting of peptidoglycan layer, or {{all three of these}} factor can be vital for the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the nucleic acid inside the bacterial cell. Studies have been done on the T2 bacteriophage (T4-like phage) mechanism <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> and it has shown that the phages tail does not penetrate inside the bacterial cell wall and <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> this phage involves electrochemical membrane potential on the inner membrane.|$|R

40|$|Many fungal {{pathogens}} penetrate plant {{leaves from}} a specialized cell called an appressorium. The rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea can also penetrate synthetic surfaces such as poly(vinyl chloride). Previous experiments {{have suggested that}} penetration requires an elevated appressorial turgor pressure. In the present report we have used nonbiodegradable Mylar membranes, exhibiting a range of surface hardness, to test the proposition that penetration is driven by turgor. Reducing appressorial turgor by osmotic stress inhibited <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> these membranes. The size of the turgor deficit required to inhibit penetration was {{a function of the}} surface hardness. <b>Penetration</b> <b>of</b> the hardest membranes was inhibited by small decreases in appressorial turgor, while <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the softer membranes was sensitive only to large decreases in turgor. Similarly, <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the host surface was inhibited in a manner comparable to <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the hardest Mylar membranes. Indirect measurements of turgor, obtained through osmotically induced collapse of appressoria, indicated that the infection apparatus can generate turgor pressures in excess of 8. 0 MPa (80 bars). We conclude that <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> synthetic membranes, and host epidermal cells, is accomplished by application of the physical force derived from appressorial turgor...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{estimate}} the in vitro ungual <b>penetration</b> depth <b>of</b> sodium fluorescein and nile blue chloride by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Methods: The depth, uniformity and pathways <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> both markers into human nail during passive and iontophoretic experiments were investigated. The <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> sodium fluorescein into the dorsal, ventral and intermediate {{layers of the}} nail was also studied. Transversal images were used to estimate directly the relative <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the markers {{with respect to the}} complete thickness of the nail. "Exposed layer" images allowed estimating the depth <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> by taking xy-plans, starting by the exposed layer, and following the z axis into the nail. Results: The fluorescent markers penetrated 7 - 12 % of the nail thickness. Iontophoresis increased <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> both markers compared to passive diffusion. However, ungual penetration was not modified by the intensity <b>of</b> current applied. <b>Penetration</b> into the dorsal, ventral, and intermediate nail layers was similar. The method developed allowed inter- and intra- nail variability to be accounted for. Conclusions: Iontophoresis enhanced moderately the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the two markers into the nail plate as compared to passive diffusion. The confocal images suggested the transcellular pathway to be predominant during both passive and iontophoretic experiments...|$|R

The {{study on the}} <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> chloride ions into concrete {{is very important for}} the durability assessment and design of reinforced concrete structures. A cyclic wetting and drying test is conducted to evaluate the effects of concrete mix proportions on the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> chloride ions. Based on the experimental results, the variations in chloride ion content at various points in concrete with the water/cement ratio, maximum aggregate diameter, aggregate gradation, fly ash content, and anticorrosion agent content are analyzed quantitatively. It is found that the water/cement ratio, aggregate gradation, maximum aggregate diameter, and fly ash all have a larger influence on the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> chloride ions. These conclusions can provide theoretical evidence for the design optimization of concrete properties...|$|R
