5|$|Excavation of the {{downtown}} bus tunnel began in early 1987, and construction reached the University Street area later that year. The twin tunnel boring machines used to excavate the tunnel reached University Street in October 1987, and continued north towards Westlake station. In December, Metro agreed to pay $2.4 million to real estate developer Marathon Company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station for equipment staging and storage, delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site. During excavation and construction of the University Street tunnel station, cracks and minor settling {{were found in the}} historic Seattle Tower, located nearby. The ground around the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement, and was renovated with <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 {{the poet}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge rented the cottage. While he lived there he wrote {{many of his}} better known works. He was visited by William Wordsworth and other early members of the Romantic movement. Coleridge moved out in 1799 and the {{building}} was refurbished. Almost 100 years after his occupation some of his admirers leased the property and eventually bought it, after a national campaign and significant <b>private</b> <b>funding.</b> In 1909 they handed {{it over to the}} National Trust who have run it as a writer's home museum since then. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries further renovation and expansion was undertaken, since when it has won awards as a tourist attraction.|$|E

The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to E Shed, the current home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated {{on the side of the}} Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre.

5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's public and <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> was earmarked for scientific {{work in the}} Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

5|$|Still Impressed with Riefenstahl's work, Hitler {{asked her}} to film Triumph des Willens ("Triumph of the Will"), a new {{propaganda}} film about the 1934 party rally in Nuremberg. More than one million Germans participated in the rally. Initially, according to Riefenstahl, she resisted {{and did not want}} to create further Nazi Party films, instead wanting to direct a feature film based on Hitler's favourite opera, Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland ("Lowlands"). Riefenstahl received <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> for the production of Tiefland, but the filming in Spain was derailed and the project was cancelled. Hitler was able to convince her to film Triumph des Willens on the condition that she would not be required to make further films for the party, according to Riefenstahl. The motion picture was generally recognized as an epic, innovative work of propaganda filmmaking. The film took Riefenstahl's career to a new level and gave her further international recognition.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the late}} 2000s, The Washington Post wrote that the museum {{struggled}} with low attendance, modest budget, concealed location, and leadership turnovers. Thirty years after joining the Smithsonian, the museum {{remains one of the}} smallest museums in the complex, with 213,000 visitors in 2016about half of the 2009 count and {{less than one percent of}} the 28 million annual Smithsonian visitors. This is due, in part, to its location, which is hidden from the National Mall by the original Smithsonian Institution Building, known as the Castle. Visitor numbers have fluctuated between 200,000 and 400,000 since the 2000s, and in the mid-2000s were comparable with its underground neighbor museum, the Sackler Gallery. The museum's annual budget has fluctuated from $4.3 million (late 1990s) to $6 million (mid-2000s), and was $5 million in 2016. By comparison, the museum had a 34-person staff in 2016, down from 48 in the late 1990s. Like many other museums in the 2000s, the institute has sought <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> and endowments. It trailed behind other Smithsonian entities in fundraising campaigns, into which the museum was expected to pay about $2.1 million. In late 2016, the museum held its first annual African Arts Awards Dinner for over 500 guests.|$|E

Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other company with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E

5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved public and <b>private</b> <b>funding.</b> At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for {{the acquisition of}} the land and construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the <b>Private</b> <b>Funding</b> Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine cable system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E
