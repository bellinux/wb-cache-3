5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend Uppsala University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>theology</b> and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E
