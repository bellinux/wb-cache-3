5|$|Around Europe several {{relatively}} small cities, such as Durham, England; Znojmo, Czech Republic; Riga, Latvia; and Valletta, Malta, have implemented congestion pricing to reduce traffic crowding, parking problems and pollution, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> peak tourism season.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the {{forget-me-not}} {{was again}} {{used as a}} Masonic emblem at the first annual United Grand Lodges of Germany convention in 1948.

5|$|In 2009, {{intersection}} of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 (Scoharie Road) near Picton saw {{the introduction of}} a traffic roundabout, the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province, to replace the at-grade intersection. The MTO felt that the area had reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> busy summer months, and so felt a traffic roundabout was needed.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, brevet {{promotions}} were {{common in the}} United States armed forces. New officers received brevet rank until authorized positions were made available, or they could be brevetted to fill higher positions for gallantry.

5|$|Millen {{stood for}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade {{candidate}} for Bourke in 1891, but was defeated; he contested the seat again in 1894 and won. He {{became known as}} a strong advocate for land reform, urging changed pastoral conditions and suggesting additional government assistance to deal with Australia's dry climate, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1890s drought.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{resistance}} was praised by contemporaries for {{its contribution to}} the Allied war effort; <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> later period. In a letter to Lieutenant-General Pire, commander of the , General Eisenhower praised {{the role that the}} Belgian resistance had played in disrupting German supply lines after D-Day. The continuing actions of the resistance stopped the Germans ever being able to use the country as a secure base, never fully becoming pacified.|$|E

During the three-day docking, the Russian, Canadian, and American crew transferred supplies and equipment between Atlantis and Mir, moved several long-term experiments, and upgraded the station with new equipment, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> installation of the docking module.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet with {{fruit and vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|After the crown, {{the most}} {{important}} government institution in the late Middle Ages was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers. Unlike its counterpart in England, the king's council in Scotland retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by parliament, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} switch of coaches, Thorpe {{indicated}} that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400m and 200m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E
5|$|Critics such as James Berardinelli praised Connery's performance, the femme fatale {{character}} of Fiona Volpe, and the underwater action sequences, remarking {{that they were}} well choreographed and clearly shot. He criticised {{the length of the}} scenes, however, stating they were in need of editing, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> film's climax. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an 86% rating. In 2014 Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors, and stunt actors to list their top action films; Thunderball was listed at number 73.|$|E
5|$|In January 1999 {{the then}} Culture Secretary Chris Smith {{launched}} {{a project to}} construct the new museum in Trafford, Greater Manchester. The Trafford Park area has strong associations with the Second World War on the British home front; factories in the area produced Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines used {{by a number of}} Royal Air Force combat aircraft. By 1945 the area employed 75,000 people. The area was consequently heavily bombed, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Manchester Blitz, when 684 people were killed in raids over two nights in December 1940. By the time of Chris Smith's announcement, the museum had already received outline planning permission (in October 1997), with full approval in April 1999.|$|E

This period of growth {{became known as the}} Celtic Tiger. The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999, in which year the Republic joined the euro. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in {{the world in terms of}} GDP per capita.|$|E

5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
