"If {{the public}} would only attend," [...] {{observed}} Mr Bright, in commenting on these facts, [...] "to the regulations laid down for their guidance by the Post-Office--as detailed in our Directories and <b>Postal</b> Guides--such <b>errors</b> would seldom occur, for I believe that things of this sort {{are the result of}} ignorance rather than dishonesty." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sequim, Washington [...] - [...] "In 1879 {{the first}} post office was built and named 'Seguin' for the {{surrounding}} area. ...

It has been known as Sequim ever since." ...|$|R

5000|$|As noted earlier, the Republican Secretary of State in Michigan {{was found}} purging voters from voting rolls when voter ID cards were {{returned}} as undeliverable. In the court challenge, {{the federal judge}} ordered the state to reinstate the voters. [...] The judge ruled that the state's actions were {{in violation of the}} NVRA. His decision noted {{that there was no way}} to prevent qualified voters from being disfranchised as their cards may be returned as undeliverable by <b>postal</b> <b>error,</b> clerical error, inadvertent routing within a multi-unit dwelling, or even simple misspelling or transposition of numbers in an address.In December 2007, Kansas Republican Chair Kris Kobach sent an email boasting that [...] "to date, the Kansas GOP has identified and caged more voters in the last 11 months than the previous two years!"Republicans sent out fundraising mailers to voters in five Florida counties: Duval, Hillsborough, Collier, Miami-Dade and Escambia, with 'do not forward' on the letters. The mailers included inaccurate voter ID numbers and ostensibly confirmed with voters they were registered as Republican. The RNC declined to discuss the mailer with the St. Petersburg Times. A representative denied that the mailing had anything to do with caging. Two top Florida elections officials, both Republicans, faulted the Republican mailing, calling it [...] "confusing" [...] and [...] "unfortunate" [...] because of a potential to undermine voter confidence by making them question the accuracy of their registrations." [...] Some officials expressed concern that the RNC would try to use a caging list derived from the mailers.In Northern California, reports of voter caging emerged when letters marked 'do not forward' were sent to Democrats with fake voter ID numbers. The description of the letters matches the letters that were sent out in Florida. See the caging letter that was sent out here. Many details on the letters were false; for example, the letters referred to a Voter Identification Division, but RNC personnel said they had no such department. The RNC did not return calls from a news organization regarding the letters.On October 5, 2008 the Republican (but elected on the Democratic ticket) Lieutenant Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties that trend Democratic. The purges included decorated war veterans and active duty soldiers.Terri Lynn Land, the Secretary of State of Michigan, was found to be purging thousands of voters from voting rolls based on Voter ID cards being returned as undeliverable. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the purges. Judge Stephen J. Murphy ruled the purge illegal under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 and directed Land to reinstate the affected voters. (See full ruling here [...] ).The New York Times found in its review of state records that unlawful actions in six states led to widespread voter purges, which could have impacted the 2008 elections. Some of the actions were apparently the result of mistakes by the states in handling voter registrations and files as they tried to comply with a 2002 federal law related to running elections. Neither party was singled out, but because the Democratic Party registered more new voters this year, Democratic voters were more adversely affected by such actions of state officials.|$|E
