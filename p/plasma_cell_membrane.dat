50|$|SV40 {{consists}} of an unenveloped icosahedral virion with a closed circular dsDNA genome of 5.2 kb. The virion adheres to cell surface receptors of MHC class I by the virion glycoprotein VP1. Penetration into the cell is through a caveolin vesicle. Inside the cell nucleus, the cellular RNA polymerase II acts to promote early gene expression. This results in an mRNA that is spliced into two segments. The small and large T antigens result from this. The large T antigen has two functions: 5% goes to the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> and 95% returns to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus the large T antigen binds three viral DNA sites, I, II and III. Binding of sites I and II autoregulates early RNA synthesis. Binding to site II takes place in each cell cycle. Binding site I initiates DNA replication at the origin of replication. Early transcription gives two spliced RNAs that are both 19s. Late transcription gives both a longer 16s, which synthesizes the major viral capsid protein VP1; and the smaller 19s, which gives VP2 and VP3 through leaky scanning. All of the proteins, besides the 5% of large T, return to the nucleus because assembly of the viral particle happens there. Eventual release of the viral particles is cytolytic and results in cell death.|$|E

Binding of SU glycoprotein to CD 4 molecule, enables HIV to adsorb to target cell membrane and also initiates conformational changes in SU glycoprotein that enable it to bind to a second receptor (coreceptor). This coreceptor belongs to a family of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> molecules that acts, in vivo, as chemokine receptors. The SU glycoprotein binding to coreceptor molecule triggers further conformational changes and consequently the exposure of a hydrophobic region of viral envelope transmembrane glycoprotein (TM), named fusion peptide that ultimately leads to viral envelope fusion with target cell membrane. Nowadays, 19 of these chemokine receptors have been thus considered, in vitro, as coreceptors for HIV. Interestingly, despite this extensive range of potential coreceptors, only CCR 5 and CXCR 4 seem to be relevant in HIV transmission and in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. Identification of cell surface coreceptors, specific for HIV envelope SU glycoprotein, has provided an elucidative explanation for molecular mechanisms involved in viral cell tropism and pathogenesis. Furthermore, the recognition of a coreceptor-mediated HIV's entry has also provided novel viral and cellular targets for antiretroviral intervention.

In fact, labeling of the Mr 52, 000 polypeptide was barely detectable. The amount of D-glucose-sensitive [3 H]cytochalasin B covalent insertion into these membrane components was increased 11 +/- 2 (n = 4) -fold in starved versus fed <b>cell</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes.</b> Photoaffinity labeling of both polypeptides in starved <b>cell</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>membranes</b> was inhibited by D-glucose, 3 -O-methylglucose, 2 -deoxyglucose, cytochalasin B, and cytochalasin A but not by D-sorbitol, L-glucose, or cytochalasin E.

This phenomenon of antigenic movement has not been analyzed in detail to date. In addition to normal kidneys we also studied localization of the antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody 5 - 1 - 6 in protamine sulfate-perfused rat kidneys, in which slit diaphragms {{are known to be}} functionally modified. Isolated glomeruli as well as ultrathin kidney cryosections were labeled by the immunogold technique to clarify the relation between this antigen and the slit diaphragm. Sequential localization of injected monoclonal antibody was visualized using a post-embedding immunogold method in rats 2 hours to 12 days after injection of antibody. Ultrastructural immunogold labeling demonstrated that under normal conditions antigenic molecules were expressed mainly in the area beneath the slit diaphragms. Occasionally labeling was found {{at the base of the}} foot process, facing the glomerular basement membrane. After protamine sulfate treatment antigenic sites were dislocated due to the lifting and disruption of slit diaphragms, indicating that this antigen is associated with slit diaphragms. Injected antibody was localized at the filtration slits at 2 hours, and by 12 hours it had moved onto the apical <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> of foot process. In addition, from 3 days onwards patch or cap-like formation on the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> of podocytes was seen. Possible shedding of antibody from podocyte cell surface membrane was occasionally encountered, but internalization of antibody was a minor event. Elution experiments in isolated glomeruli at day 3 indicated that antigen and antibody were both localized on the podocyte cell surface membrane, suggesting redistribution of immune complexes. In conclusion, filtration slits (slit diaphragms) and the apical membrane of foot process of podocytes demonstrate structural continuity, as revealed by the movement of the antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody 5 - 1 - 6 as antigen-antibody complexes...|$|E

30|$|The {{discovery}} of potent endogenous danger signals released from injured/necrotic cells clearly adds {{to our understanding}} of the pathogenesis of “sterile inflammation,” as well as SIRS when tissue injury is sufficient to produce systemic inflammation. Alarmins represent nothing less than the proximal endogenous mediators linking cell necrosis and the inflammatory response generated by tissue injury. The identification of alarmins from mitochondria that are ancient bacteria sheltered inside of cells makes a lot of sense. Mitochondria have retained throughout the evolution some molecules of their bacterial ascent that, when found extracellularly, can be recognized as “non-self” by cells from the immune system. Other alarmins, such as ATP, also are strictly intracellular molecules that when found extracellularly will be sensed as a “danger molecule,” meaning for the immune system: “rupture of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> and tissue injury.” Although extracellular ATP does not seem to be capable of mediating a great deal of inflammation, it is an important cofactor, an enhancer of the inflammatory reaction in response to mitochondrial danger molecules and to microbial-associated molecular patterns.|$|E

Acute inflammation is the hallmark of the acute tissue reaction to crystals in both gout and pseudogout. The mechanisms leading to joint inflammation in these diseases involve first crystal formation and subsequent coating with serum proteins.

Ultimately, gout resolution involves several mechanisms including monocyte differentiation into macrophage, clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages, production of Transforming Growth Factor (TGF-β) and modification of protein coating on the crystal surface.

The notion that adult mammalian epithelial progenitors can function as a repository for H. pylori broadens the view of host habitats available to this and perhaps other pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The Cosic Resonance Recognition Model (RRM) for {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} {{was applied to}} the classes of proteins displayed by four strains (Sudan, Zaire, Reston, Ivory Coast) of Ebola virus that produced either high or minimal numbers of human fatalities. The results clearly differentiated highly lethal and non-lethal strains. Solutions for the two lethal strains exhibited near ultraviolet (~ 230 nm) photon values while the two asymptomatic forms displayed near infrared (~ 1000 nm) values. Cross-correlations of spectral densities of the RRM values of the different classes of pro-teins associated with the genome of the viruses supported this dichotomy. The strongest coeffi-cient occurred only between Sudan-Zaire strains but not for any of the other pairs of strains for sGP, the small glycoprotein that intercalated with the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> to promote insertion of viral contents into cellular space. A surprising, statistically significant cross-spectral correlation occurred between the “spike ” glycoprotein component (GP 1) of the virus that associated the anc-horing of the virus to the mammalian cell plasma membrane and the Schumann resonance of the earth whose intensities were determined by the incidence of equatorial thunderstorms.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} the {{cholesterol}} content of the plasma membrane on the intracellular concentration of oxygen in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and their mutants was investigated by EPR oximetry. Total and free cholesterol content was significantly higher in 25 RA CHO cells as compared to wild-type and M 19 CHO cells, {{with most of the}} free cholesterol in normal and mutant CHO cells located in the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane cholesterol content also was altered by various biochemical means, and the effect on the oxygen gradient was studied. Comparing the three cell lines, the gradient was larger with increased content of cholesterol in the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane.</b> This result also is supported by an additional increase in the oxygen gradients with the incorporation of additional cholesterol in the plasma membrane and a decrease in the oxygen gradient when the cholesterol was depleted from the plasma membrane. The results indicate that the concentration of cholesterol in the plasma membrane can be an important factor for the magnitude of the oxygen gradient observed across the cell membrane. The concentration of oxygen within cells is an important parameter in many physiological and pathological processes. A number of methods have been developed to measure it, using polarographic electrodes, mass spectrometry, NMR...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{expression}} at the cell surface of human thymic epithelial cells (TEC) of a neurotensin (NT) -like immunoreactivity. NT radio-immunoassay (RIA) revealed that cultured human TEC contain ± 5 ng immunoreactive (ir) NT/ 106 cells, of which 5 % {{is associated with}} <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> HPLC analysis of NT-ir present in human TEC showed a major peak of NT-ir corresponding to NT 1 – 13. NT-ir was not detected in the supernatant of human TEC cultures. Using an affinity column prepared with a anti-MHC class I monoclonal antibody, NT-ir-related peptides were retained on the column and eluted together with MHC class I-related proteins. According to the elution time on HPLC of these peptides, they correspond to intact NT 1 – 13, {{as well as to}} smaller fragments of NT 1 – 13. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Summaryβ cells rely on {{adenosine}} triphosphate-sensitive potassium (KATP) {{channels to}} initiate and end glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through changes in membrane potential. These channels may also {{act as a}} constituent of the exocytotic machinery to mediate insulin release independent of their electrical function. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby the β <b>cell</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> maintains an appropriate number of KATP channels are not known. We now show that glucose increases KATP current amplitude by {{increasing the number of}} KATP channels in the β <b>cell</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane.</b> The effect was blocked by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) as well as by depletion of extracellular or intracellular Ca 2 +. Furthermore, glucose promoted recruitment of the potassium inward rectifier 6. 2 to the plasma membrane, and intracellular KATP channels localized in chromogranin-positive/insulin-negative dense-core granules. Our data suggest that glucose can recruit KATP channels to the β <b>cell</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>membrane</b> via non-insulin-containing dense-core granules in a Ca 2 +- and PKA-dependent manner...|$|R
