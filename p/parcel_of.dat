5|$|Several other {{portions}} of the old highway were leased for construction. At the east end, land was leased to Sir Philip Warwick who built Warwick House (now the location of Warwick House Street) and to Sir John Denham; this <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land {{became part of the}} grounds of Marlborough House. Portions leased at the west end included the land between St James's Palace and the tennis court at the corner of St James's Street, and a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land leased to the Duchess of Cleveland that became the site of 8â€“12 Cleveland Row and Stornoway House. The 18th-century London bookseller Andrew Millar also lived in a townhouse designed by Robert Adam, at 34 Pall Mall.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

5|$|Snakes {{have been}} part and <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> culture and religion. Vivid scale {{patterns}} have been thought to have influenced early art.

5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and {{society of the}} north had modernized more slowly {{than those of the}} south, there was a more pronounced conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and farmland had a major social status; ownership of even a small <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land created a motivation to fight against the Reds.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{war started}} they made {{numerous}} improvements to the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land. On June 14, 1832 five men were attacked by a Kickapoo war party, three whites were killed instantly, including Spafford. In total at least one Native and four white settlers {{were killed in the}} action. Two men managed to escape. One mistakenly feared for days that Fort Hamilton had been captured, before finally seeking refuge there. The incident at Spafford Farm eventually led to the Battle of Horseshoe Bend (also known as the Battle of Pecatonica).|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E

5|$|Greek Revival residences {{were first}} built in Troy along Second Street {{in the late}} 1820s. In 1839, six local {{businessmen}} bought a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land between Second and Third {{at the south end}} of what was then the developed area of the city and created Washington Park. Modeled on contemporary British residential squares such as those found in London's Bloomsbury neighborhoods, its first phase, on Washington Place, featured rows of townhouses with a unified facade fronting on a park reserved exclusively for residents, whose deeds require a monthly maintenance fee. It retains its integrity despite some later alterations and damage, and is one of only two privately owned urban parks in New York.|$|E
5|$|Heat bursts {{are rare}} {{atmospheric}} phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a {{rapid increase in}} temperature and decrease in dew point (moisture). Heat bursts typically occur during night-time and are associated with decaying thunderstorms. In association with wake lows, heat bursts are caused when rain evaporates (virga) into a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air denser than its surroundings. The parcel descends rapidly, warming due to compression, overshoots its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a downburst.|$|E
5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} site in Hong Kong's Central District {{was less}} than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World WarII, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.|$|E
5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E

5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land owned by Hamar JernstÃ¸peri. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot from the bank. The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled {{in the city of}} Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim {{to take control of the}} synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> land were greater.|$|E
5|$|David Hudson (February 17, 1761â€“ March 17, 1836) was an American {{businessman}} {{noted for}} founding Hudson Township, the present-day Hudson, Ohio.
