40|$|Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has the {{responsibility}} of Transmission, most of the Generation and Distribution of electric power in Sri Lanka. Contamination-driven insulator failure {{is a problem that}} incessantly plagues distribution systems. It erodes power quality and diminishes system reliability. Contamination levels can continue to grow unless abated by natural cleaning or if not taken measures to wash insulators at the distribution level in a preventative maintenance mode. When contamination is combined with moisture, a pollution layer forms and provides a path for leakage current to flow. Increases in contamination severity result in heightened levels of leakage current activity. As a result of rapid development and growth of populated areas, several high voltage power transmission systems operating at various voltages up to 132 kV have been put into service and flashover difficulties with insulators of these systems caused by pollution of different types have been experienced. Not only the transmission network but also the distribution network of 33 kV, running in coastal belt, has experienced frequent insulator flashover making a burden to the maintenance Engineers. In order to assess the pollution behavior of insulators in the distribution network, 33 kV pin type insulator was selected as a sample insulator and been subjected to natural pollution at three selected localities for considerable period. The naturally polluted, insulators have been subjected for conductivity test and by which the equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) which points out the pollution severity is calculated. Subsequently, artificially contaminated insulators of different pollution severities were tested for power frequency and impulse test in the High Voltage Laboratory of University of Moratuwa. To better understand the progression of insulators from a healthy state to failure, the flashover voltage (FOV) of insulator must be studied. This study was focused on the following key areas.  Experiment of 33 kV <b>Pin</b> <b>Insulator</b> contamination severity based on Zone categorization (Zone-I, 2 and 3) • Prediction of surface flashover voltage of Insulators over ESDD and tabulate the figures for reasonable ESDD values. • Streamline the process of Insulators treatment under preventive maintenance. • Review the levels of insulator's specific creepage distances placed at different pollution severity in Sri Lanka co-relating with IEC regulation. Experimented results state that insulator contamination level improves over the duration in ad hoc basis and could be utilized to build up a trend curve to predict a relationship against the insulator exposure duration. It is recommended that insulators in Zone 1 have to be treated after 8 months from the date of last treatment and those in Zone 2 & 3 to be treated after 18 months under preventive maintenance to get away from flashover. It is also recommended to review the required specific creepage distance of insulator installed in non-polluted areas {{due to the fact that}} the current practice of insulators placement in all over is with specific creepage distance of 25 mm/kV which is recommended for high polluted zones as per IEC regulatio...|$|E

40|$|A {{majority}} of utilities conduct maintenance of transmission line components {{based on the}} results of routine visual inspection. The inspection is normally done by inspectors who detect defects by visually checking transmission line components either from the air (in helicopters), from the ground (by using high-powered binoculars) or from the top of the structure (by climbing the structure). The main problems with visual inspection of transmission lines are that the determination of the defects varies depending on the inspectors' knowledge and experience and that the defects are often reported qualitatively using vague and linguistic terms such as "medium crack", "heavy rust", "small deflection". As a result of these drawbacks, there is a large variance and inconsistency in defect reporting (which, in time, makes it difficult for the utility to monitor the condition of the components) leading to ineffective or wrong maintenance decisions. The use of inspection guides has not been able to fully address these uncertainties. This thesis reports on the application of a visual inspection methodology that is aimed at addressing the above-mentioned problems. A knowledge-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is designed using Matlab's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox as part of the methodology and its application is demonstrated on utility visual inspection practice of porcelain cap and <b>pin</b> <b>insulators.</b> The FIS consists of expert-specified input membership functions (representing various insulator defect levels), output membership functions (indicating the overall conditions of the insulator) and IF-THEN rules. Consistency in the inspection results is achieved because the condition of the insulator is inferred using the same knowledge-base in the FIS rather than by individual inspectors. The output of the FIS is also used in a mathematical model that is developed to suggest appropriate component replacement date. It is hoped that the methodology that is introduced in this research will help utilities achieve better maintenance management of transmission line assets...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the single phase earth fault in medium voltage {{distribution}} networks that are high impedance grounded. Networks are normally radially operated but partially meshed. First, the basic properties of high impedance grounded networks are discussed. Following this, the characteristics of earth faults in distribution networks are determined based on real case recordings. Exploiting these characteristics, new applications for earth fault indication and location are then developed. The characteristics discussed are the clearing of earth faults, arc extinction, arcing faults, fault resistances and transients. Arcing faults made up {{at least half of}} all the disturbances, and they were especially predominant in the unearthed network. In the case of arcing faults, typical fault durations are outlined, and the overvoltages measured in different systems are analysed. In the unearthed systems, the maximum currents that allowed for autoextinction were small. Transients appeared in nearly all fault occurrences that caused the action of the circuit breaker. Fault resistances fell into two major categories, one where the fault resistances were below a few hundred ohms and the other where they were of the order of thousands of ohms. Some faults can evolve gradually, for example faults caused by broken <b>pin</b> <b>insulators,</b> snow burden, downed conductor or tree contact. Using a novel application based on the neutral voltage and residual current analysis with the probabilistic method, it is possible to detect and locate resistive earth faults up to a resistance of 220  kΩ. The main results were also to develop new applications of the transient based differential equation, wavelet and neural network methods for fault distance estimation. The performance of the artificial neural network methods was comparable to that of the conventional algorithms. It was also shown that the neural network, trained by the harmonic components of the neutral voltage transients, is applicable for earth fault distance computation. The benefit of this method is that only one measurement per primary transformer is needed. Regarding only the earth faults with very low fault resistance, the mean error in absolute terms was about 1. 0  km for neural network methods and about 2. 0  km for the conventional algorithms in staged field tests. The restriction of neural network methods is the huge training process needed because so many different parameters affect the amplitude and frequency of the transient signal. For practical use the conventional methods based on the faulty line impedance calculation proved to be more promising. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Today, the {{insulation}} of overhead transmission lines with composite insulators is common practice world-wide. A large variety of designs of such insulators {{is available on}} the market for all currently used service voltage levels. It is well known that the electrical field distribution of insulator sets equipped with composite insulators differ from those equipped with “conven-tional “ insulators (ceramic longrod, ceramic or glass cap and <b>pin</b> type <b>insulators).</b> Generally, the field distribution of a composite longrod insulator set is more non-linear than of a set with conventional insulators. This is caused by missing intermediate metal parts and by the dielectric material characteristics of the polymeric materials used for composite insulators. The field distribution along non-polluted composite insulators is mainly influenced by the earth and high voltage (hv) capacitances. The real situation can only be calculated numerically e. g. using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The tower arrangement of an insulator set and its clearances to tower crossarms and to the shaft are of great importance for the electrical field distribution.

5000|$|The pole may be {{grounded}} {{with a heavy}} bare copper or copper-clad steel wire running down the pole, attached to the metal <b>pin</b> supporting each <b>insulator,</b> and at the bottom connected to a metal rod driven into the ground. Some countries ground every pole while others only ground every fifth pole and any pole with a transformer on it. This provides a path for leakage currents {{across the surface of}} the insulators to get to ground, preventing the current from flowing through the wooden pole which could cause a fire or shock hazard. [...] It provides similar protection in case of flashovers and lightning strikes. A surge arrester (also called a lightning arrester) may also be installed between the line (ahead of the cutout) and the ground wire for lightning protection. The purpose of the device is to conduct extremely high voltages present on the line directly to ground.|$|R
40|$|High tension {{insulators}} {{are generally}} built of several porcelain discs in series, the discs being connected by galvanized steel hardware. When alternating voltage is impressed across such a string the voltage is not distributed symmetrically because the charging current {{is not the}} same through the string. There is capacitance from each connector to the next, from each connector to the ground and to the line wire, as well as capacitance from one connector to one which is not adjacent. If the voltage impressed is direct and all the units or discs are exactly alike, then such an air insulator string would have across each unit the same value of voltage. A certain leakage current flows through each insulator, and the d. c. voltage across each unit will be the leakage current multiplied by the resistance of each unit. In the transmission of high-voltage direct current, such as the Thury system found in Europe, high-tension porcelain insulators can be used to insulate the line from the ground. Such insulators are exposed to changing weather conditions of humidity and temperature. Also, these insulators on account of being subjected to mechanical stresses, electrical stresses, and repeated temperature cycles, depreciate in resistance, become faulty, and unless detected may interfere with the operation of the transmission system. If the resistance of the insultors forming the string, and the effect produced on the resistance by temperature, humidity, etcetera, are known then it is possible to predict to a certain degree of approximation what service the insulators can give. Besides determining the condition of such insulators, a knowledge of the resistance would give a basis for comparing different types of insulators, and likewise would furnish a means for arriving at the voltage distribution of different makes and types and the uniformity with which a given type could be expected to run. In the investigation carried out, the results of which are tabulated below, particular attention was given to the determination of the surface and interior resistance, and the effect of change of temperature and humidity on the electrical resistance of various types and makes of high-tension porcelain insulators. The humidity effect is not an internal one, but manifests itself by changing the surface of the insulator so that a greater freedom is given to the flow of current over the surface between the cap and the <b>pin</b> of the <b>insulator...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{that in an}} antiferromagnetic metal a steady-state transport current generates a current-induced out-of-plane spin density, resulting in torques on the magnetization. This spin density is parameterized by a velocity that {{is proportional to the}} current. The generalization of the non-linear sigma model equation of motion for antiferromagnetic magnetization dynamics in an antiferromagnetic metal {{in the presence of a}} transport current is presented. From this equation of motion a current-induced shift of the spin-wave dispersion is found, as well as current-induced torques that lead to current-driven antiferromagnetic domain wall motion. A key finding is that the form of the current-induced spin density, expressed in terms of the Néèl vector is similar to the current-induced spin density in ferromagnets with the Néèl vector replaced by the magnetization direction. The velocity that characterizes the efficiency of the coupling between current and magnetization is calculated, using linear-response theory in the Boltzmann transport regime. In the absence of dissipation, current-driven antiferromagnetic domain walls are found to move with this characteristic velocity. When magnetization damping is included, the domain wall moves a finite amount and then stops, similar to the intrinsic pinning of current-driven ferromagnetic domain walls. Like in the latter case, including dissipative coupling or non-adiabatic effects between current and magnetization removes this intrinsic <b>pinning.</b> In magnetic <b>insulators</b> there is no transport of electronic charge. Still, there can be transport of spin in the form of spin waves, or, in their quantized form, magnons. Spin transport, carried by quasi-equilibrium magnons, in a magnetic insulator within a Boltzmann transport framework is considered. The spin resistivity of quasi-equilibrium magnons is found to be strongly reduced in comparison with equilibrium magnons, a property that may be useful in designing magnon spintronics applications. The contribution of magnon interactions to their resistivity has been studied for the reason that these dominate in the materials that are experimentally relevant, such as yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG). Firstly, the spin resistivity of a magnon gas using the simplest model, the Heisenberg model, is used. The investigation of material-specific models, in particular for YIG, is then presented. Despite the simplified model, the main qualitative result, the reduction of spin resistivity as a result of enhancing the magnon number by pumping, remains valid. This is because it only depends on the bosonic nature of the magnon excitations that leads to enhanced scattering into states that are already occupie...|$|R
