50|$|The radio {{spectrum}} scope (also radio <b>panoramic</b> <b>receiver,</b> panoramic adapter, pan receiver, pan adapter, panadapter, panoramic radio spectroscope, panoramoscope, panalyzor and band scope) {{was invented by}} Marcel Wallace and measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within one or more radio bands - e.g. shortwave bands. A spectrum scope is normally a lot cheaper than a spectrum analyzer, because the aim is not high quality frequency resolution - nor high quality signal strength measurements.|$|E

The system described can be used for detecting objects that represent a threat, by using a sensor and a system for discriminating characteristic signals...|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} the first Wild Weasel SEAD (air defense suppression) {{aircraft}} whose specially trained crews were tasked with locating and destroying enemy air defenses. Four F-100F Wild Weasel Is were fitted with an APR-25 vector radar homing and warning (RHAW) <b>receiver,</b> IR-133 <b>panoramic</b> <b>receivers</b> with greater detection range, and KA-60 panoramic cameras. The APR-25 could detect early-warning radars and emissions from SA-2 Guideline tracking and guidance systems. These aircraft deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in November 1965, began flying combat missions with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing in December. They were joined by three more aircraft in February 1966. All Wild Weasel F-100Fs were eventually modified to fire the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile.|$|R
40|$|Periodic signals {{processing}} is {{an important}} part of electronic support measures (ESM) technologies on which a variety of different modern technical systems are based. Thus, the problem of frequency synchronization in telecommunication systems is still relevant [1]. The same applies to <b>panoramic</b> <b>receivers,</b> the main feature of which is fast detec-tion of signals with a priori unknown parameters [2]. Coherent processing algorithms that are used in the receiver require measurements of phase and frequency of weak radio signals in the presence of noise. Signals in Global Satellite Navigation Systems besides have a large frequency (Doppler) uncertainty at the receiver that is consequence of the high relative satellite-to-receiver velocity [3]. The specificity of power systems of grid-connected converter type is high-precision frequency tuning to known nominal value and ensuring phase syn-chronization [4 — 5]. In the most of above-mentioned systems, the signal (x) can be considered as a single-tone (s) with additive white Gaussian noise (η) :,,,sinx s i j 1 i i i i i j i...|$|R
40|$|The {{past few}} decades have {{witnessed}} the widespread adaptation of wireless devices such as cellular phones and Wifi-connected laptops, and demand for wireless communication {{is expected to continue}} to increase. Though radio frequency (RF) communication has traditionally dominated in this application space, recent decades have seen an increasing interest in the use of optical wireless (OW) communication to supplement RF communications. In contrast to RF communication technology, OW systems offer the use of largely unregulated electromagnetic spectrum and large bandwidths for communication. They also offer the potential to be highly secure against jamming and eavesdropping. Interest in OW has become especially keen in light of the maturation of light-emitting diode (LED) technology. This maturation, and the consequent emerging ubiquity of LED technology in lighting systems, has motivated the exploration of LEDs for wireless communication purposes {{in a wide variety of}} applications. Recent interest in this field has largely focused on the potential for indoor local area networks (LANs) to be realized with increasingly common LED-based lighting systems. We envision the use of LED-based OW to serve as a supplement to RF technology in communication between mobile platforms, which may include automobiles, robots, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). OW technology may be especially useful in what are known as RF-denied environments, in which RF communication may be prohibited or undesirable. The use of OW in these settings presents major challenges. In contrast to many RF systems, OWsystems that operate at ranges beyond a few meters typically require relatively precise alignment. For example, some laser-based optical wireless communication systems require alignment precision to within small fractions of a degree. This level of alignment precision can be difficult to maintain between mobile platforms. Additionally, the use of OW systems in outdoor settings presents the challenge of interference from ambient light, which can be much brighter than any LED transmitter. This thesis addresses these challenges to the use of LED-based communication between mobile platforms. We propose and analyze a dual-link LED-based system that uses one link with a wide transmission beam and relaxed alignment constraints to support a more narrow, precisely aligned, higher-data-rate link. The use of an optical link with relaxed alignment constraints to support the alignment of a more precisely aligned link motivates our exploration of a <b>panoramic</b> imaging <b>receiver</b> for estimating the range and bearing of neighboring nodes. The precision of such a system is analyzed and an experimental system is realized. Finally, we present an experimental prototype of a self-aligning LED-based link...|$|R
