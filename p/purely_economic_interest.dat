5000|$|Justice Blackmun, {{writing for}} the majority, began his opinion by giving a brief {{overview}} of the Virginia pharmacy regulation statutes, and then distinguished previous challenges to such regulations, explaining that such previous cases had been based on economic due process under the Fourteenth Amendment rather than on free speech grounds. [...] Blackmun reasoned that this case concerned not only commercial regulation, but the free flow of information. This case was just as much about the consumers’ right to receive information as it was about the pharmacists’ right to provide it, and that the right to free speech is just as much about the “listener” as it is about the “speaker”.Blackmun further described how the court’s past precedent had whittled down the “commercial speech” exemption through past precedent; for example, Bigelow v.

40|$|Characteristic {{features}} of traditional Roma professions are high proportions of flexibility and independence. In contrast to dependent wage workers they sell services and trade {{to the majority}} population. Contact with the Gadže is limited to <b>purely</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interest.</b> This independence is guaranteed by carrying out the professions together in economic communities. Irrespective of whether the group leads a settled or nomadic life, in a traditional Roma community all members have the same occupation – provided that the conditions allow it.

Also those groups who {{have been forced to}} assimilate try to maintain these structures to a smaller extent.

At {{the beginning of the}} 21 st century, the German-Polish relationship, despite all efforts at European integration, remains a deeply emotional matter, overshadowed by the mental consequences of the population politics and destruction carried out by Germans during National Socialism. In my reading, Milchwald reveals that diplomacy can only be successful, if it engages the agents of intercultural exchange, people in their daily interactions with one another, on an emotional level. The imagery of the EU as 2 ̆ 2 family 2 ̆ 2, and the altruistic rhetoric surrounding European integration, cover up the fundamentally materialist motivations at the basis of the German-Polish relationship {{around the time of the}} film 2 ̆ 7 s release.

40|$|The article {{provides}} an alternative theoretical framework for evaluating contemporary issues facing education, specifically vocational {{education and training}} (VET) in Europe. In order to accomplish this, it draws on the theoretical insights of the capability approach {{in the work of}} Amartya Sen; the concept of vulnerability as intrinsic to every human being, established by Fineman and Grear; and the concept of oppression advanced by Iris Marion Young. By developing the core concepts of each of these theories, the paper presents a human-based evaluative tool for education and argues that a fundamental misconception has arisen as to the purpose of post-compulsory education, a misconception generated by the wholesale application of the language of skills and productivity to the field of education, thus relinquishing its role to <b>purely</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interests.</b> The social justice framework presented herein aims to present a possible alternative approach to discuss and evaluate VET, in which humanistic concepts such as the recognition of human vulnerability and agency are central to the debate.

40|$|Many {{experts are}} {{concerned}} about the would-be character of smart grid users—specifically, that they will not engage with smart grid technologies out of disinterest or a lack of knowledge. This has been considered problematic because users are considered key to unlocking the full potential of the smart grid. This paper studied smart grid users from the Norwegian demo Steinkjer pilot and, through focus group interviews, collected articulations of everyday smart grid enactments. Eliciting little lack in knowledge or interest, users were able to articulate relevant smart grid enactments through a spectrum of skepticism, pragmatism and enthusiasm. Utilizing the concept of material publics [22], this paper argued that smart meters can bridge the green political economy of climate challenge issues with the user context of everyday energy consumption. The paper found evidence that user articulations, whether skeptical or enthusiastic, are rooted in political engagement as opposed to <b>purely</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interest.</b> This suggests a case for involving material publics in the smart grid and indicates that explanations for user disengagement can be found in active, subversive co-articulations among users rather than passive disinterest or a lack of knowledge. This paper suggests acknowledging smart grid users as politically engaged material publics...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, I {{review the}} {{literature}} on central banking and the Federal Reserve relating to the Fed’s administrative legitimacy. In the literature, the Fed has been studied extensively. It has not just {{been the subject of}} scores of books and articles, but inspired almost two hundred dissertations. Fortunately, much of this literature is of <b>purely</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interest,</b> so I exclude it. Even after doing so, much literature remains, as many economists have studied both the Fed’s economic and its institutional aspects. Overall, the literature I study is of six types: (1) general overview of the Fed; (2) central banking theory and practice; (3) political-administrative relations; (4) the politics of monetary policy; (5) leadership; (6) critiques. In chapter one, I presented the introductory literature. In the chapters on 1970 - 1995, I will discuss the scholarly critiques, depending on when they were published. As a result, only four types of literature are examined here: central banking theory and practice; political-administrative relations; the politics of monetary policy; and leadership. By proceeding this way, my narrative should be more interesting, and the answers to my research questions should be clearer. CENTRAL BANKING THEORY & PRACTIC...|$|E

He passionately studied music and {{immediately}} had results, and was taught under Giuseppe Busi and Lauro Rossi. At just eighteen, he composed the opera I Goti which was staged on 30 November 1873 at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. The work was an unprecedented success. Within a short period he was the [...] "Freeman of the City of Bologna" [...] and appointed Member of Honor of the Accademia Filarmonica in Bologna and appointed Knight of the Crown of Italy granted by King Vittorio Emanuele II. Under pressure from music publishers and their <b>purely</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interests,</b> his later works such as Luce (1875) and Cordelia (1881), were inevitably marked by conflicting adversity.

He died on 17 December 1913 and was buried at the Cimitero Monumentale Della Certosa.|$|R
40|$|Although both Germany and the United States {{have strong}} market-based economies {{characterized}} by rigorous protection {{of private property}} rights, the two countries have different conceptions of land ownership based on distinct notions of the individual’s place in society. Whereas property protection under the U. S. Constitution emphasizes individual freedom, German law explicitly considers the individual’s place in and relationship to the social order in defining ownership rights. The property clause in the German Grundgesetz (The Basic Law, the German constitution) contains an affirmative social obligation alongside its positive guarantee of ownership rights. The U. S. Constitution, on the other hand, does not explicitly recognize an affirmative social obligation of property use. At the same time, courts have not considered property a fundamental right and are reluctant to use a language of natural rights to describe ownership relations. Thus, in locating a limit on the social obligation of ownership, the U. S. Supreme Court has employed rhetoric emphasizing the <b>purely</b> <b>economic</b> impact of regulation rather than its effect on a property owner’s dignity or autonomy, as in Germany. Beginning {{with the assumption that}} both legal systems recognize a significant social obligation (in the language of German court decisions) or expansive regulatory power (in the language of U. S. courts), this note will compare how the scope of that regulatory authority is circumscribed in the respective jurisdictions by the different values protected by the respective property clauses. In depicting the German social obligation, I will pay particular attention to the positive guarantee of property rights codified in the German constitution, not only to illustrate this as a limit on the social obligation, but also to show that German courts are comfortable with highly individualized determinations into the personal meaning of property for property owners (invoking what are referred to in Anglo-American jurisprudence as personhood interests) and use such determinations to exclude <b>purely</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> from constitutional protection. In considering these differences between U. S. and German constitutional property regimes, I aim to address the question of what, if anything, the Fifth Amendment positively guarantees for property owners...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} three decades the interplay between Services of General <b>Economic</b> <b>Interest</b> and the EU law of {{competition}} and State aid has shifted from near anonymity to the centre stage of political and legal debate.

The inclusion of Article 14 TFEU in the ‘Principles’ part of the Treaty coupled with the evolution of the European Court of Justice’s approach towards the services in question places the issue beyond purely competition law.
