40|$|Abstract. Recently, a good set {{of logic}} {{programming}} semantics {{has been defined}} for capturing <b>possibilistic</b> logic program. Practically all of them follow a credu-lous reasoning approach. This means that given a <b>possibilistic</b> logic program one can infer a set of <b>possibilistic</b> models. However, sometimes it is desirable to as-sociate just one <b>possibilistic</b> model to a given <b>possibilistic</b> logic program. One of the main implications of having just one model associated to a <b>possibilistic</b> logic program is that one can perform queries directly to a <b>possibilistic</b> program and answering these queries in accordance with this model. In this paper, we introduce {{an extension of the}} Well-Founded Semantics, which represents a sceptical reasoning approach, in order to capture <b>possibilistic</b> logic programs. We will show that our new semantics can be considered as an approx-imation of the <b>possibilistic</b> semantics based on the answer set semantics and the pstable semantic. A relevant feature of the introduced semantics is that it is poly-nomial time computable. ...|$|E
40|$|When the {{information}} about uncertainty cannot be quantified in a simple, probabilistic way, the topic of <b>possibilistic</b> decision theory is often a natural one to consider. The development of <b>possibilistic</b> decision theory has lead to the proposition a series of <b>possibilistic</b> criteria, namely: optimistic and pessimistic <b>possibilistic</b> qualitative criteria [7], <b>possibilistic</b> likely dominance [2] and [9], binary <b>possibilistic</b> utility [11] and <b>possibilistic</b> Choquet integrals [24].

40|$|<b>Possibilistic</b> {{logic is}} a {{well-known}} framework for dealing with uncertainty and reasoning under inconsistent knowledge bases. Standard <b>possibilistic</b> logic expressions are propositional logic formulas associated with positive real degrees belonging to [0, 1].
