5|$|In May {{that year}} Josephson {{addressed}} a symposium held {{to welcome the}} Maharishi to Cambridge. The following month, at the first Canadian conference on <b>psychokinesis,</b> {{he was one of}} 21 scientists who tested claims by Matthew Manning, a Cambridgeshire teenager who said he had psychokinetic abilities; Josephson apparently told a reporter that he believed Manning's powers were a new kind of energy. He later withdrew or corrected the statement.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of popular}} and {{government}} interest at the time in quantum mechanics – the American government was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and <b>psychokinesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Josephson {{travelled}} to California to meet {{two leading}} {{members of the}} group, laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, authors of Mind Reach (1977). Targ and Puthoff {{had set up a}} parapsychology ("psi") lab at SRI and had had papers published about their work – which included testing later-discredited claims by Uri Geller that he could make objects move using <b>psychokinesis</b> – in Nature and other peer-reviewed journals. The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson's visit.|$|E
5|$|The main {{antagonist}} of {{the game}} is Liquid Snake, leader of a now-terrorist splinter cell of the organization FOXHOUND, and genetic counterpart to Solid Snake. An elite special forces unit, FOXHOUND contains experts specializing in unique tasks. Members are Revolver Ocelot, a Western-style gunslinger and expert interrogator whose weapon of choice is the Colt Single Action Army; Sniper Wolf, a preternatural sniper; Vulcan Raven, a hulking Alaskan shaman armed with an M61 Vulcan torn from a downed F-16; Psycho Mantis, a psychic profiler and <b>psychokinesis</b> expert; and Decoy Octopus, a master of disguise.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychokinesis</b> {{experiments}} {{have historically been}} criticized for lack of proper controls and repeatability. There is no convincing evidence that <b>psychokinesis</b> is a real phenomenon, and the topic is generally regarded as pseudoscience.|$|E
25|$|The American parapsychologist J. B. Rhine {{coined the}} term extra-sensory {{perception}} to describe receiving information paranormally from an external source. Following this, he used the term <b>psychokinesis</b> in 1934 to describe mentally influencing external objects or events {{without the use of}} physical energy. His initial example of <b>psychokinesis</b> was experiments that were conducted to determine whether a person could influence the outcome of falling dice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychokinesis</b> and telekinesis have {{commonly}} {{been used}} as superpowers in comic books, movies, television, computer games, literature, {{and other forms of}} popular culture.|$|E
25|$|A 1952 study {{tested for}} experimenter's bias {{with respect to}} <b>psychokinesis.</b> Richard Kaufman of Yale University gave {{subjects}} the task of trying to influence eight dice and allowed them to record their own scores. They were secretly filmed, so their records could be checked for errors. Believers in <b>psychokinesis</b> made errors that favored its existence, while disbelievers made opposite errors. A similar pattern of errors was found in J. B. Rhine's dice experiments, which were considered the strongest evidence for PK at that time.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{study that}} {{utilized}} a magic trick to investigate paranormal belief on eyewitness testimony revealed that believers in <b>psychokinesis</b> {{were more likely}} to report a key continued to bend than non-believers.|$|E
25|$|Tales of his {{exploits}} often attributed various supernatural abilities, such as teleportation, <b>psychokinesis,</b> and precognition, {{and these}} attributions contribute to his continued prominence in popular culture. He {{died at the}} age of 55.|$|E
25|$|Physicist Sean M. Carroll {{has written}} that spoons, like all matter, {{are made up of}} atoms and that any {{movement}} of a spoon with the mind would involve the manipulation of those atoms through the four forces of nature: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravitation. <b>Psychokinesis</b> would have to be either some form of one of these four forces, or a new force that has a billionth the strength of gravity, for otherwise it would have been captured in experiments already done. This leaves no physical force that could possibly account for <b>psychokinesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Science writers Martin Gardner and Terence Hines and {{the philosopher}} Theodore Schick have written that if <b>psychokinesis</b> were possible, {{one would expect}} casino incomes to be affected, but the {{earnings}} are exactly as the laws of chance predict.|$|E
25|$|Physicist John Taylor, who has {{investigated}} parapsychological claims, {{has written that}} an unknown fifth force causing <b>psychokinesis</b> would have to transmit {{a great deal of}} energy. The energy would have to overcome the electromagnetic forces binding the atoms together, because the atoms would need to respond more strongly to the fifth force than to electric forces. Such an additional force between atoms should therefore exist all the time and not during only alleged paranormal occurrences. Taylor wrote there is no scientific trace of such a force in physics, down to many orders of magnitude; thus, if a scientific viewpoint is to be preserved, the idea of any fifth force must be discarded. Taylor concluded that there is no possible physical mechanism for <b>psychokinesis,</b> and it is in complete contradiction to established science.|$|E
25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in <b>psychokinesis.</b> He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of <b>psychokinesis</b> have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in <b>psychokinesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|PK {{hypotheses}} {{have also}} been considered {{in a number of}} contexts outside parapsychological experiments. C. E. M. Hansel has written that a general objection against the claim for the existence of <b>psychokinesis</b> is that, if it were a real process, its effects would be expected to manifest in situations in everyday life; but no such effects have been observed.|$|E
25|$|Parapsychologists divide psychokinetic {{phenomena}} {{into two}} categories: macro-psychokinesis - large-scale psychokinetic effects {{that can be}} seen with the naked eye, and micro-psychokinesis - small-scale psychokinetic effects that require the use of statistics to be detected. Some phenomena – such as apports, levitation, materialization, psychic healing, pyrokinesis, retrocausality, telekinesis, and thoughtography – are considered to be examples of <b>psychokinesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Magicians have {{successfully}} simulated {{some of the}} specialized abilities of <b>psychokinesis,</b> such as object movement, spoon bending, levitation and teleportation. According to Robert Todd Carroll, there are many impressive magic tricks available to amateurs and professionals to simulate psychokinetic powers. Metal objects such as keys or cutlery can be bent using {{a number of different}} techniques, even if the performer has not had access to the items beforehand.|$|E
25|$|Internationally {{there are}} {{individual}} skeptics of the paranormal and skeptics' organizations who offer cash prize money for {{demonstration of the}} existence of an extraordinary psychic power, such as <b>psychokinesis.</b> Prizes have been offered specifically for PK demonstrations: for example, businessman Gerald Fleming's offer of £250,000 to Uri Geller if he can bend a spoon under controlled conditions. The James Randi Educational Foundation offered the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge to any accepted candidate who managed to produce a paranormal event in a controlled, mutually agreed upon experiment.|$|E
25|$|Paranormal {{claims for}} {{the origin of}} EVP include living humans {{imprinting}} thoughts directly on an electronic medium through <b>psychokinesis</b> and communication by discarnate entities such as spirits, nature energies, beings from other dimensions, or extraterrestrials. Paranormal explanations for EVP generally assume production of EVP by a communicating intelligence through means other than the typical functioning of communication technologies. Natural explanations for reported instances of EVP tend to dispute this assumption explicitly and provide explanations which do not require novel mechanisms that are not based on recognized scientific phenomena.|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, CICAP was {{primarily}} concerned with parapsychology (telepathy, <b>psychokinesis,</b> etc.). With time, CICAP began branching out into other areas of pseudoscience (such as alternative medicine), both historical (such as those involving dragons or the sword in the rock) and above all, contemporary legends (urban legends). The rise in popularity of other pseudoscientific phenomena prompted the organization to change its name. In September 2013, CICAP announced a change in its name altering the P of the acronym from paranormale (paranormal) to pseudoscienze (pseudosciences). The new name includes not only supernatural phenomena, but also pseudoscientific ideas and claims regarding treatments whose efficacy is not scientifically proven, conspiracy theories, urban legends and historical falsifications.|$|E
500|$|Josephson became {{interested}} in philosophy of mind {{in the late sixties}} and, in particular, in the mind–body problem, {{and is one of the}} few scientists to argue that parapsychological phenomena [...] (telepathy, <b>psychokinesis</b> and other paranormal themes) may be real. In 1971 he began practising transcendental meditation (TM), which had become popular with several celebrities, most famously the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{looks through}} various X-Files and discovers one {{about a young}} boy named Anthony Fogelman who possessed <b>psychokinesis.</b> She learns that Fogelman later {{changed his name to}} Oliver Martin. She meets with Dr. John Rietz (John Aylward), a parapsychologist who worked with the young Fogelman. Rietz claims that, despite being {{extremely}} lonely, Martin was not dangerous and that his power faded as he grew up. Reyes makes the connection that Fogelman changed his name to Oliver based on Cousin Oliver from The Brady Bunch. Scully notes that, in the show, Oliver was portrayed as a [...] "jinx", and the three agents deduce that Fogelman must see himself as one, too.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Evan Harris Walker and Richard Mattuck {{published}} a parapsychology paper proposing a quantum explanation for <b>psychokinesis.</b> Physicist Victor J. Stenger wrote that their explanation contained assumptions {{not supported by}} any scientific evidence. According to Stenger their paper is [...] "filled with impressive looking equations and calculations that {{give the appearance of}} placing <b>psychokinesis</b> on a firm scientific footing... Yet look what they have done. They have found the value of one unknown number (wavefunction steps) that gives one measured number (the supposed speed of PK-induced motion). This is numerology, not science." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Psychokinesis</b> (from Greek ψυχή [...] "mind" [...] and κίνησις [...] "movement"), or telekinesis (from τηλε- [...] "far off" [...] and κίνηση [...] "movement"), is {{an alleged}} psychic ability {{allowing}} {{a person to}} influence a physical system without physical interaction.|$|E
2500|$|The Enemies of Reason is {{a two-part}} {{television}} documentary, written and presented by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, {{in which he}} seeks to expose [...] "those areas of belief that exist without scientific proof, yet manage to hold the nation under their spell", including mediumship, acupuncture and <b>psychokinesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, the United States National Academy of Sciences, at {{the request}} of the US Army Research Institute, formed a {{scientific}} panel to assess the best evidence for <b>psychokinesis.</b> Part of its purpose was to investigate military applications of PK, for example to remotely jam or disrupt enemy weaponry. The panel heard from a variety of military staff who believed in PK and made visits to the PEAR laboratory and two other laboratories that had claimed positive results from micro-PK experiments. The panel criticized macro-PK experiments for being open to deception by conjurors, and said that virtually all micro-PK experiments [...] "depart from good scientific practice in a variety of ways". Their conclusion, published in a 1987 report, was that there was no scientific evidence for the existence of <b>psychokinesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, an American psychic named Felicia Parise {{allegedly}} moved a pill bottle {{across a}} kitchen counter by <b>psychokinesis.</b> Her feats were {{endorsed by the}} parapsychologist Charles Honorton. Science writer Martin Gardner wrote Parise had [...] "bamboozled" [...] Honorton by moving the bottle by an invisible thread stretched between her hands.|$|E
2500|$|Even in {{civilian}} form, Mamoru demonstrates {{a variety of}} psychic powers throughout each series. In both the anime and manga he uses psychometry to read past, present, and future events through touch, and heals others' wounds through <b>psychokinesis.</b> Inconsistently, he is shown teleporting; just once in the anime while under [...] Queen Beryl's power, ...|$|E
2500|$|In a telepathy experiment, the [...] "sender" [...] {{looks at}} a series of cards while the [...] "receiver" [...] guesses the symbols. To try to observe clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden from {{everyone}} while the receiver guesses. To try to observe precognition, {{the order of the}} cards is determined after the guesses are made. Later he used dice to test for <b>psychokinesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|According to Planer, [...] "All {{research}} {{in medicine and}} other sciences would become illusionary, if the existence of PK {{had to be taken}} seriously; for no experiment could be relied upon to furnish objective results, since all measurements would become falsified {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, according to his PK ability, by the experimenter's wishes." [...] Planer concluded that the concept of <b>psychokinesis</b> is absurd and has no scientific basis.|$|E
2500|$|... : Masaru (born 1980) is {{overweight}} and physically confined either {{to a wheelchair}} or a special floating chair {{as a result of}} developing polio at a young age.

Masaru looks after the well-being of his friends, especially that of Kiyoko who is physically frail.|$|E
2500|$|PK {{parties have}} been {{described}} as a campaign by paranormal believers to convince people of the existence of <b>psychokinesis,</b> on the basis of nonscientific data from personal experience and testimony. The United States National Academy of Sciences has criticized PK parties on the grounds that conditions are not reliable for obtaining scientific results and [...] "are just those which psychologists and others have described as creating states of heightened suggestibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uri Geller ( [...] ; born 20 December 1946) is an Israeli illusionist, magician, {{television}} personality, and self-proclaimed psychic. [...] He {{is known}} for his trademark television performances of spoon bending and other illusions. It has been frequently claimed that Geller has used conjuring tricks to simulate the effects of <b>psychokinesis</b> and telepathy, which Geller has consistently denied. Geller's career as an entertainer has spanned more than four decades, with television shows and appearances in many countries.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian psychic Alla Vinogradova {{was said}} {{to be able to move}} objects without {{touching}} them on transparent acrylic plastic or a plexiglass sheet. The parapsychologist Stanley Krippner had observed Vinogradova rub an aluminum tube before moving it allegedly by <b>psychokinesis.</b> Krippner suggested no <b>psychokinesis</b> was involved; the effect was produced by an electrostatic charge. Vinogradova was featured in the Nova documentary Secrets of the Psychics (1993) which followed the debunking work of James Randi. Vinogradova demonstrated her alleged psychokinetic abilities on camera for Randi and other investigators. Before the experiments she was observed combing her hair and rubbing the surface of the acrylic plastic. Massimo Polidoro has replicated the feats of Vinogradova by using an acrylic plastic surface and showing how easy it is to move any kind of object on top of it due to the charges of static electricity. The effect is easily achieved if the surface is electrically charged by rubbing a towel or a hand on it. The physicist John Taylor has written [...] "It is very likely that electrostatics is all that is needed to explain Alla Vinogradova's apparently paranormal feats." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideas of}} <b>psychokinesis</b> and telekinesis violate several {{well-established}} laws of physics, including the inverse square law, the second law of thermodynamics, and {{the conservation of}} momentum. Because of this, scientists have demanded a high standard of evidence for PK, in line with Marcello Truzzi's dictum [...] "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof". The Occam's razor law of parsimony in scientific explanations of phenomena suggests that the explanation of PK in terms of ordinary ways — by trickery, special effects or by poor experimental design — is preferable to accepting that {{the laws of physics}} should be rewritten.|$|E
