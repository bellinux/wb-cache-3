40|$|The Pacific coast Wilson's warbler (Wilsonia pusilla chryseola) is a {{widespread}} and common Neotropical migrant breeding in moist coastal woodlands or along streams, from Santa Barbara County, California to southwestern British Colombia. Evidence of loca 1 decline in breeding Pacific coast populations {{over the past few}} decades has been indicated from Breeding Bird Survey data. While these declines have been attributed in part to the loss of riparian breeding habitat, the role of cowbird parasitism and nest predation as contributing factors have not been elucidated. In this study, I examined the dynamics of brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and nest predation by various <b>predatory</b> <b>vertebrates</b> in Wilson's warblers. The first research object was, to document the occurrence and frequency of brood parasitism and nest predation in Wilson's warblers and second, to evaluate their effects on warbler reproductive success. I also investigated the influence of nest-site selection on the probability of both brood parasitism and nest predation. Finally, I applied a mathematical model predicting population trends for Wilson's warblers breeding in coastal riparian habitats in Marin County, California. During the breeding seasons of 1997 to 2000, nesting data was collected along Lagunitas Creek and Redwood Creek in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in coastal Marin County, California. Of the 90 warbler nests located and monitored, 30 nests were parasitized by cowbirds and 54 nests were preyed upon by various <b>predatory</b> <b>vertebrates.</b> Nest success, as calculated by the Mayfield method, was 7. 65...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} studies in community ecology often simplify their study system by lumping together {{species on the}} basis of trait similarities (e. g., their taxonomy, resource or microhabitat usage) and then assume species sharing similar traits are functionally similar. To date, no study has directly tested whether species more similar with respect to any of these traits are more similar in their functional effects on population or ecosystem processes. In this study, we examined the association between traits and functional effects of six different aquatic <b>predatory</b> <b>vertebrates.</b> We demonstrated that functional similarity across multiple response variables was not correlated with trait similarity, but differences in trait values were associated with significantly different effects on individual response variables. The exact relationship between species traits and functional effect of predators, however, was different for each response variable. Using traits to predict functional similarity among species may be useful when considering individual response variables, but only if it is known which traits have the greatest influence on the response variable of interest. It is doubtful that any one scheme will predict the functional similarity of species across a diverse array of response variables because each response will likely be strongly influenced by different traits...|$|R
40|$|Examining the {{geological}} past {{of our planet}} allows us to study periods of severe climatic and biological crises and recoveries, biotic and abiotic ecosystem fluctuations, and faunal and floral turnovers through time. Furthermore, the recovery dynamics of large predators provide a key for evaluation of the pattern and tempo of ecosystem recovery because predators are interpreted to react most sensitively to environmental turbulences. The end-Permian mass extinction was the most severe crisis experienced by life on Earth, and the common paradigm persists that the biotic recovery from the extinction event was unusually slow and occurred in a step-wise manner, lasting up to eight to nine million years well into the early Middle Triassic (Anisian) in the oceans, and even longer in the terrestrial realm. Here we survey the global distribution and size spectra of Early Triassic and Anisian marine <b>predatory</b> <b>vertebrates</b> (fishes, amphibians and reptiles) to elucidate the height of trophic pyramids {{in the aftermath of}} the end-Permian event. The survey of body size was done by compiling maximum standard lengths for the bony fishes and some cartilaginous fishes, and total size (estimates) for the tetrapods. The distribution and size spectra of the latter are difficult to assess because of preservation artifacts and are thus mostly discussed qualitatively. The data nevertheless demonstrate that no significant size increase of predators is observable from the Early Triassic to the Anisian, as would be expected from the prolonged and stepwise trophic recovery model. The data further indicate that marine ecosystems characterized by multiple trophic levels existed from the earlies...|$|R
40|$|The Early Triassic {{vertebrate}} {{record from}} low paleolatitudes is spotty, {{which led to}} the notion of an ‘equatorial vertebrate eclipse’ during the Smithian. Here we present articulated ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), collected from the marine Lower Triassic Thaynes Group at three new localities in Elko County (Nevada, USA), which were deposited within the equatorial zone. From the Smithian of the Winecup Ranch, we describe two partial skulls of the predatory actinopterygian Birgeria (Birgeriidae), attributed to B. americana new species and Birgeria sp. Birgeria americana n. sp. is distinguished from other species by a less reduced operculogular series. With an estimated total length of 1. 72 – 1. 85 m, it is among the largest birgeriids. We confirm that Birgeria encompasses species with either two or three rows of teeth on the maxilla and dentary, and suggest that species with three well-developed rows are restricted to the Early Triassic. From the latest Smithian of Palomino Ridge, we present a three-dimensional, partial skull of the longirostrine predator Saurichthys (Saurichthyidae). This and other occurrences indicate that saurichthyids were common in the western USA basin. From the early late Spathian of Crittenden Springs, we describe a posterior body portion (Actinopterygii indet.). This find is important given the paucity of Spathian osteichthyan sites. We provide a summary of Early Triassic vertebrate occurrences in the United States, concluding that vertebrate fossils remain largely unstudied. The presence of <b>predatory</b> <b>vertebrates</b> in subequatorial latitudes during the Smithian confirms that Early Triassic trophic chains were not shortened and contradicts the ‘equatorial vertebrate eclipse’...|$|R
40|$|While {{most studies}} of the {{utilisation}} of food resources in aquatic ecosystems have focused on comparing the diets of closely related taxa, {{the present study was}} aimed at elucidating whether the diets of five species, representing two distant taxa, were correlated and overlapped. We have thus compared the diets of a fish species (the flathead, Platycephalus speculator) with those of two small species of cormorant (little pied, Phalocrocorax melanoleucos, and little black, P. sulcirostris) and two larger species of cormorant (pied, P. varius, and black, P. carbo) in a temperate southwestern Australian estuary. The flathead and the two smaller cormorants consumed predominantly shrimp and small, short-lived teleosts, whereas the two larger cormorants fed almost exclusively on larger species of teleost. Although the diet of flathead were correlated with and overlapped those of the two smaller cormorant species, there was no correlation or overlap between the diets of these three species and those of either of the larger species of cormorant. Our observations of P. speculator are consistent with the results of previous studies which have shown that platycephalids are ambush predators, whereas cormorants are pursuit surface plungers, with the little pied cormorant feeding solitarily and the little black cormorant feeding communally. Flathead preyed on both demersal and mid-water teleosts. The little pied cormorant fed almost exclusively on demersal teleosts and the little black cormorant exploited predominantly mid-water schooling fish. Thus, differences in the fish components of the diets of these three predators can be related to differences in the mode of foraging and the level in the water column in which feeding takes place. The respective daily consumption of shrimp and teleosts in the estuary was estimated as 1, 000 kg and 450 kg by flathead and as 180 kg and 150 kg by the four species of cormorants combined. The results of this study show that, in estuaries, the degree to which diets were correlated and overlapped amongst <b>predatory</b> <b>vertebrates</b> can be greater between representatives of distant taxa than between species within the same genus...|$|R
40|$|As {{animal life}} diversified {{over the course}} of the Phanerozoic, the {{intensity}} of predator-prey interactions increased in several phases. Crinoids (Phylum Echinodermata: Class Crinoidea) were a dominant constituent of Paleozoic shallow marine faunas and constitute a lesser component of post-Paleozoic faunas; as most of them are sessile suspension feeders, they provide a good case study for the effect of increasing predation pressure on the Paleozoic evolutionary fauna. Herein are presented injury frequencies and examples of anti-predatory adaptations from a variety of modern and fossil crinoids, discussed with reference to those from previous studies. Rates of regenerating injuries in the modern sessile bathyal crinoid Holopus mikihe are shown to be comparable to those of shallow-water Mesozoic relatives and many Paleozoic taxa, and lower than any other measured injury rates in living crinoids. Regenerating injuries on disarticulated spines of Paleozoic crinoids similarly show an increase in regeneration frequency between the Paleozoic and Recent. Changes in arm branching morphology that increase resilience to predation are shown to have begun in the Early Paleozoic and reached their maximum by the Early Devonian; on this basis we infer that predators influenced crinoid evolution from the Ordovician, before the appearance of <b>predatory</b> <b>vertebrates</b> and echinoids known to prey on crinoids during later times. Beginning in the Devonian, snails parasitizing crinoids are associated with more frequent crinoid arm regeneration and with the presence of spines on the oral surface near their usual position, consistent with the hypothesis that the snails were targeted by predators with crinoids incurring collateral damage. Calyx spines were common in the Devonian and less common in the Mississippian, but tegmen spines associated with predation on parasitic snails persist up to the Late Mississippian. We also find indications that predation on crinoids decreased into the Permian. Our results support the hypothesis that escalation in the crinoid-predator relationship occurred during the Paleozoic during several different episodes of escalation related to new ecological developments. However, rather than a consistent upward trend in all types of defensive adaptations, we find that some defenses may be associated with types of hostile interaction that later lost ecological importance...|$|R
5|$|In 2010, the {{increased}} robustness of Balaur {{was compared to}} parallel changes seen in isolated herbivorous mammals. In 2013, it was claimed that Balaur was the only <b>vertebrate</b> <b>predatory</b> island species known to have become more robust and {{it was suggested that}} its broad feet had evolved to improve stability. The 2015 interpretation of Balaur as an omnivorous member of the Avialae, suggested it was the descendant of a flying species that had developed a larger size similar to the development in several other island herbivores. This would then be a rare instance of secondary flightlessness in a paravian looking like a dromaeosaurid, as predicted by Gregory S. Paul.|$|R
40|$|The skull {{morphology}} of Allosaurus {{has been}} the subject of functional interpretations which imply a predatory behaviour radically different from that recorded in any <b>predatory</b> land <b>vertebrate.</b> Those interpretations imply the use of the skull and maxillary dentition as analogues of hand-held, man-made weapons, incorporating the inertia of the predator's dash toward prey to add to the effect of the impact, and using wide jaw gapes as a way to keep the mandible out of the way of such blows. We re-interpret the evident adaptations for gape and for recruitment of neck muscles in head depression of Allosaurus in terms of a muscle-powered bite directed at surfaces with moderate convexity, such as the bodies of very large pres. In our model, the forces leading to penetration of the teeth are generated in the context of the opposition between the maxillary and the mandible. This interpretation allows us to incorporate al 1 the observed adaptations of the Allosaurus skull, while avoiding the problems created by previous models. La morfología craneal de Allosaurus ha sido objeto de interpretaciones funcionales que implican un comportamiento depredador radicalmente distinto para el inferido para cualquier vertebrado depredador terrestre. Esas interpretaciones implican el uso de la dentición superior e inferior como análogos de cuchillos o dagas manufacturadas por el hombre, incorporando la inercia del golpe del depredador contra la presa para añadir el efecto del impacto, y usando amplias aperturas mandibulares para mantener la mandíbula fuera de la línea de acción del impacto. Reinterpretamos las evidentes adaptaciones para amplias aberturas mandibulares, y para la utilización de la musculatura cervical en la depresih de la cabeza de Allosaurus en función de una mordida basada en la fuerza muscular dirigida a superficies moderadamente convexas, como el cuerpo de una gran presa. En nuestro modelo, las fuerzas que producen la penetración son generadas en el contexto de una oposición entre el maxilar y la mandíbula. Esta interpretación nos permite incorporar todas las adaptaciones observadas en el cráneo de Allosaurus, al mismo tiempo que se evitan los problemas creados por modelos alternativos...|$|R
