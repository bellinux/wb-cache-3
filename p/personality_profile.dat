40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to create a {{decision}} tree (DT) to identify <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> of offenders against public safety. A technique meeting this requirement was proposed that uses the C 4. 5 algorithm to derive decision rules for <b>personality</b> <b>profiling</b> of public safety offenders. The Mini-Mult test was used to measure the <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> of 238 individuals. With the test results as our database, a C 4. 5 DT was applied to construct rules that classify each profile into one of two groups, those without and those with records of offences against public safety. The model correctly classified 80 % of the <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> and delivered a set of decision rules for distinguishing the profiles by group, and the principal <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> were interpreted. We conclude that DTs are a promising technique for analysing <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> by their offender or non-offender status. Finally, we believe that the development of a classifying model using DT may have practical applications in the Colombian prison syste...|$|R

40|$|Early {{adolescent}} drinking {{has been}} identified as an important risk factor for the development of alcohol dependence. Both perceived peer drinking and <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> have been implicated as risk factors for early adolescent drinking. However, research is yet to determine how these 2 factors may interact to increase such risk. This study aimed to determine whether <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> moderated the relationship between perceived peer drinking and early adolescent drinking. Baseline data were utilized in the analyses, from 3, 287 adolescents (Mage = 13. 51 years, SD =. 58; 54 % female; 78 % born in Australia) participating in the Climate Schools Combined Study (a cluster randomized controlled trial with 75 schools located across Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, Australia). Lifetime consumption of alcohol, perceived peer drinking, and <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> (Substance Use Risk Profile Scale) were measured. A moderated binary logistic regression found the <b>personality</b> <b>profiles</b> of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and hopelessness were positively related to early adolescent drinking, whereas anxiety sensitivity had a negative association. A significant interaction revealed that adolescents with higher levels of sensation seeking and who perceived their peers to be drinking {{were significantly more likely to}} report early adolescent drinking (consumption of a full standard drink; OR = 1. 043; 95 % CI [1. 018 – 1. 069]). These results indicate that perception of peer drinking is more strongly associated with early adolescent drinking, when adolescents are also high on sensation seeking. Prevention and intervention programs could consider targeting both sensation seeking and perceived peer drinking in adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R
