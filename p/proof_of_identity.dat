500|$|A {{major problem}} impeding Nansen's {{work on behalf}} of {{refugees}} was that most of them lacked documentary <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> or nationality. Without legal status in their country of refuge, their lack of papers meant they were unable to go anywhere else. To overcome this, Nansen devised a document that became known as the [...] "Nansen passport", a form of identity for stateless persons that was in time recognised by more than 50 governments, and which allowed refugees to cross borders legally. Among the more distinguished holders of Nansen passports were the artist Marc Chagall, the composer Igor Stravinsky, and the dancer Anna Pavlova. Although the passport was created initially for refugees from Russia, it was extended to cover other groups. After the Greco-Turkish wars of 1919–1922 Nansen travelled to Istanbul to negotiate the resettlement {{of hundreds of thousands of}} refugees, mainly ethnic Greeks who had fled from Turkey after the defeat of the Greek Army. The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in, and so Nansen devised a scheme for a population exchange whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey, with full financial compensation, while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland. Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange, the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years. In November 1922, while attending the Conference of Lausanne, Nansen learned that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1922. The citation referred to [...] "his work for the repatriation of the prisoners of war, his work for the Russian refugees, his work to bring succour to the millions of Russians afflicted by famine, and finally his present work for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace". Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.|$|E

40|$|Devising an {{efficient}} deterministic – {{or even a}} nondeterministic sub-exponential time – algorithm for testing polynomial identities is a fundamental problem in algebraic complexity and complexity at large. Motivated by this problem, {{as well as by}} results from proof complexity, we investigate the complexity <b>of</b> proving polynomial <b>identities.</b> To this end, we study a class <b>of</b> equational <b>proof</b> systems, <b>of</b> varying strength, operating with polynomial identities written as arithmetic formulas over a given ring. A proof in these systems establishes that two arithmetic formulas compute the same polynomial, and consists of a sequence of equations between polynomials, written as arithmetic formulas, where each equation in the sequence is derived from previous equations by means of the polynomial-ring axioms. We establish the first non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the size <b>of</b> equational <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> polynomial <b>identities,</b> as follows: 1) Polynomial-size upper bounds on equational <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> involving symmetric polynomials and interpolation-based identities. In particular, we show that basic properties of the elementary symmetric polynomials are efficiently provable already in equational proofs operating with depth- 4 formulas, over infinite fields. This also yields polynomial-size depth- 4 <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> the Newton <b>identities,</b> providing a positive answer to a question posed by Grigoriev and Hirsch [6]. 2) Exponential-size lower bounds on (full, unrestricted) equational <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> over certain specific rings. 3) Exponential-size lower bounds on analytic proofs operating with depth- 3 formulas, under a certain regularity condition. The “analytic ” requirement is, roughly, a condition that forbids introducing arbitrary formulas in a proof and the regularity condition is an additional structural restriction. 4) Exponential-size lower bounds on one-way <b>proofs</b> (<b>of</b> unrestricted depth) over infinite fields.

The {{similarity}} {{in the action}} of either dilute sulphuric acid or potassa goes indeed far beyond this, even to the <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> in quantity {{as well as in}} direction of the electricity produced. If a plate of amalgamated zinc be put into a solution of potassa, it is not sensibly acted upon; but if touched in the solution by a plate of platina, hydrogen is evolved {{on the surface of the}} latter metal, and the zinc is oxidized exactly as when immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (863.). I accordingly repeated the experiment before described with weighed plates of zinc (864. &c.), using however solution of potassa instead of dilute sulphuric acid. Although the time required was much longer than when acid was used, amounting to three hours for the oxidizement of 7.55 grains of zinc, still I found that the hydrogen evolved at the platina plate was the equivalent of the metal oxidized at the surface of the zinc. Hence the whole of the reasoning which was applicable in the former instance applies also here, the current being in the same direction, and its decomposing effect in the same degree, as if acid instead of alkali had been used (868.).|$|E
