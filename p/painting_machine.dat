Six children (the intervention group) received instruction with the Music <b>Paint</b> <b>Machine,</b> an interactive music system that allows a musician to make a digital “painting” by playing music while making various movements on a coloured pressure mat. The other six children (control group) received the instruction {{without the use of}} technology. The overall goal of the longitudinal study was (1) to integrate the Music <b>Paint</b> <b>Machine</b> in instrumental music instruction in order to develop good practices and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of instruction with the system on the learning process. To measure the effectiveness of instruction with the system, children were administered the Primary and Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (Gordon, 1986) as pre- and post-test. In addition, pre-tests were organised to map possible confounding variables, such as personality, home musical environment, motor skills and self-regulation skills.

40|$|Through {{recent trends}} in the {{application}} of digitally printed decorative finishes to products, CAD, 3 D additive manufacturing and research in material perception, there is a growing interest in the accurate rendering of materials and tangible displays. Although current advances in colour management and inkjet printing has meant that users can take for granted high-quality colour and resolution in their printed images, digital methods for transferring a photographic coloured image from screen to paper is constrained by pixel count, file size, colorimetric conversion between colour spaces and the gamut limits of input and output devices. This paper considers new approaches to applying alternative colour palettes by using a vector based approach through the application of paint mixtures, towards what could be described as a 2. 5 D printing method. The objective is to not apply an image to a textured surface, but where texture and colour are integral to the mark, that like a brush, delineates the contours in the image. The paper describes the difference between the way inks and paints are mixed and applied. When transcribing the fluid appearance of a brush stroke, {{there is a difference between}} a halftone printed mark and a painted mark. The issue of surface quality is significant to subjective qualities when studying the appearance of ink or paint on paper. The paper provides examples of a range of vector marks that are then transcribed into brush stokes by the <b>painting</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{alternative approaches}} to image making and printing that {{moves from the}} on-screen representation of images and painting applications, to the physical generation and methods for surface deposition or 2. 5 D printing. The research investigates the application of new materials and print processes, {{as an alternative to}} four-colour separation and halftoning and departs from traditional halftone screening that uses a vector approach to image construction. This paper describes the application of pigments that emulates a painting method to create a physical textured surface. The objective is not to apply an image to an extruded or textured surface, but where the relationship of surface deposition and image are integral. The project, led by Carinna Parraman, is motivated by painting and rendering programmes and the need to providing meaningful interaction between software, the printed output and the viscous properties of the medium. Software such as Corel® Painter™, Autodesk® Sketch Book Pro for iPad, Brushes by Taptrix inc. simulate the appearance of drawn marks and brush strokes, paper and canvas textures, oil or watercolour. These examples highlight opportunities for manipulating virtual paint. By painting on touch-screen devices or drawing tablets the user can scroll to select colours and brushes and manipulate paint. The assumption is that images remain screen-based or are shared between mobile platforms. However it does not bridge the gap between. Inspired by the meticulous painting methods by artists such as Van Gogh and Seurat, the objective for the experiment was to create a vector-driven <b>painting</b> <b>machine</b> that applies a brush loaded with paint to paper in a methodical and mechanical way. The difference was that although the vector marks (digital) could be created in the same way, the resulting painted brush strokes (analogue) were not. Based on the placement of the brush on the paper and the flow of paint, that each painted brush stroke was similar but not exactly the same, thus creating a non-uniform but harmonious effect across the paper surface...|$|E
40|$|The final {{instalment}} of Carroll / Fletcher’s four-part exhibition draws together {{works that}} {{turn their attention}} to the systems that govern the art market. In critiquing the ways art is produced, distributed and sold, the artists in the exhibition encourage new modes of thinking and reimagine the ways that art can function in the world. For Stolen Pieces (1995 - 97), artists Eva and Franco Mattes worked in secret over a period of two years stealing dozens of fragments from the most respected museums in the United States and Europe. These ‘stolen pieces’ include, for example, a label peeled from Jeff Koons’ equilibrium tank, a length of shoelace from a Claes Oldenburg soft sculpture, a little blob of lead from an installation by Joseph Beuys and a tiny chip of porcelain from Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain. A CCTV screen above the gallery reception desk, shows footage shot with a hidden camera, documenting the artists’ last heist: appropriating a shred from a painting by Alberto Burri. Meanwhile, Catt (2010) is a sculpture based on an Internet meme, deceptively exhibited as artist Maurizio Cattelan’s work at a gallery in Houston, Texas in 2011. Mishka Henner has described the works in his series Golden Ratio as ‘reducing painting to pure investment value. ’ He began the series in 2014 with the $ 0 painting, and from there the progression of the series follows the Fibonacci sequence, with each successive painting made only once the previous one has sold. The works circulate as a word-of-mouth project only and in that way, reflects the circles in which the artist moves. The first pieces were gifted to close family members or sold to friends. In this way, the series acts as an informal marker of the artist’s worth. For the $ 10, 946 painting, the latest work in the series, Henner mimics the cover design of the influential JRP Ringier series of books of critical writings on art, a reference to how the design of book covers are used to assist in selling ideas. Climbing holds bolted {{to the surface of the}} piece allude to the dizzying nature of each price rise at this stage in the series, and the sense of both thrill and risk implicit in the climb. A portfolio showing all the works in the series to date can be viewed behind the gallery reception desk. Natascha Sadr Haghighian’s I can’t work like this (2007) was first produced in response to a gallery’s invitation to contribute a work for an art fair. Written out solely through the gaps between nails hammered into the wall, her declaration rejects the traditional art object. Instead she presents only the tools for installation used to mount art fair displays, the hammer and nail: symbols of labour itself. With this pointed phrase, the artist expresses her frustrations at the pressures and constraints placed on creative freedoms within a commercial context. In May 1999, news spread through the art world that the Serbo-Slovenian artist Darko Maver had died in the NATO bombing during the Kosovo War. His death precipitated a string of posthumous exhibitions, including a tribute at the 48 th Venice Biennale later that year. A radical and reclusive artist, Maver was best known for his life-size sculptures of murder victims, which he positioned in abandoned buildings and hotel rooms, seeking to draw media attention to the brutality of the war in the Balkans. The models were so gruesomely realistic that it is said they shocked and horrified the people who found them. In fact, it later emerged that no such sculptures had ever existed. And neither had Darko Maver: he was the invention of Eva and Franco Mattes. The images documenting his artworks were photographs of real atrocities found online, several of which had taken place the former Yugoslavia. Thomson & Craighead’s Trigger-happy (1998) is a reworking of the classic arcade computer game Space Invaders, where instead of battling row after row of pixelated alien invaders you must blast your way through passages taken from Michel Foucault’s essay What is an Author? (1969). The game has nine levels and should you complete them all, then you will have traversed an abridged version of the entire text which considers the relationship between author, text, and reader. In this case though the reader is also the player, and, in order to keep going, the text is poetically fragmented as it is destroyed. In 1971, Manfred Mohr presented a series of drawings at ARC - Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, made using a digital computer and drawn by a plotter. Alongside, a large white panel of paper, taken from the plotter machine, was presented on the wall for visitors to write their answers to the question ‘What do you think of aesthetic research made with the help of a computer?’. Here, works from this period of Mohr’s practice are shown beside the original comments board, revealing the range of responses towards what was the first solo presentation in a museum of ‘computer art’. Michael Joaquin Grey’s ZOOB (which stands for Zoology, Ontology, Ontogeny, and Botany) is an open-ended play system featuring five basic elements that snap together in twenty different ways. The elements are limb-like and joint-like, and there are numerous ways to connect them into complex, organic, movable models. The shapes are inspired by nucleotides, the basic structural units of DNA. Inspired by Fröbel’s Gifts and Occupations, ZOOB advances an organic and holistic conception of play and learning based on body empathy and the language of living systems. Ultra Violet Production House (UV) is an Etsy store developed by artists Joshua Citarella and Brad Troemel that provides collectors with high-quality material kits and fabrication guidance for all original works. UV Production House’s product images are digitally composited combinations of pre-existing products found through on-demand Internet retailers such as Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, and Etsy itself. These products have never been fabricated or seen in person by the artists. Collectors assume responsibility for the realization of materials received based on parts, tools, and tutorials sent to them at the point of purchase. UV Production House has no overheads, fabrication facilities, studio, tools, hand shipping, or clearance for visibility. It is a fully outsourced online inventory of material goods, an attempt to lessen the risk and debt associated with artistic production today.
