5|$|Following {{his service}} in the House, Brown resumed his law {{practice}} in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1891, he was {{a candidate for the}} Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The other candidates included Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., son of former Congressman Brutus J. Clay and nephew of abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay; Dr. John Daniel Clardy, later to be elected a U.S. Representative; and Attorney General Parker Watkins Hardin. The party was split between supporters of corporations, such as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and supporters of agrarian interests. Another split was between the more conservative Bourbon Democrats, who supported maintaining the gold standard, and more <b>progressive</b> <b>Democrats,</b> who called for the free coinage of silver. Agrarian voters were about equally split between Clay and Clardy, while Free Silver Democrats were about equally split between Hardin and Clardy. Having lived in the agrarian western part of the state for most of his life, and never having alienated the powerful Farmers' Alliance, Brown was acceptable to most agrarian interests, while the Louisville and Nashville Railroad felt he was a moderate on the issue of corporate regulation. Bourbon Democrats were also pleased with his sound money stand.|$|E

The minority Fianna Fáil government introduced some of the economic reforms that the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Democrats</b> had recommended. Fianna Fáil was however largely supported by Fine Gael where the economy was concerned, and so the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Democrats</b> had difficulty being effective in opposition.|$|E
