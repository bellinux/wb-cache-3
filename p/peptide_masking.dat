40|$|AbstractThe ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) protein family link actin {{filaments}} of cell surface {{structures to}} the plasma membrane, using a C-terminal F-actin binding segment and an N-terminal FERM domain, a common membrane binding module. ERM proteins are regulated by an intramolecular {{association of the}} FERM and C-terminal tail domains that masks their binding sites. The crystal structure of a dormant moesin FERM/tail complex reveals that the FERM domain has three compact lobes including an integrated PTB/PH/EVH 1 fold, with the C-terminal segment bound as an extended <b>peptide</b> <b>masking</b> a large surface of the FERM domain. This extended binding mode suggests a novel mechanism for how different signals could produce varying levels of activation. Sequence conservation suggests a similar regulation of the tumor suppressor merlin...|$|E
40|$|A {{subset of}} lupus {{patients}} with severe nephritis and anti-nRNP reactivity produces autoantibodies primarily against two major epitopes of the nRNP A (also known as U 1 A) protein. These sequences span amino acids 44 - 56 (A 3) and amino acids 103 - 115 (A 6). These two epitopes represent structurally {{different regions of}} the protein, as both epitopes are located on the surface, but the A 6 epitope is functionally masked in vivo by binding between nRNP A and the U 1 RNA. Rabbits were immunized with either the A 3 or A 6 peptides constructed on a branching polylysine backbone. Rabbits immunized with each of these peptides first developed antibodies directed against the peptide of immunization. With boosting, the immune response of rabbits immunized with the A 3 peptide spread to other common antigenic regions of nRNP A. These regions of nRNP A bound by A 3 immunized rabbits are very similar to common epitopes in human systemic lupus erythematosus. These A 3 immunized rabbits also develop antibodies to common antigenic regions of nRNP 70 K, nRNP C, Sm B/B′, and Sm D 1 proteins, as well as clinical symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus such as leukopenia and renal insufficiency. On the other hand, rabbits immunized with the A 6 peptide only develop antibodies to the peptide of immunization. Anti-A 3, but not anti-A 6, antibodies are capable of immunoprecipitating native small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes. Immunization with the A 3 peptide of nRNP A (a surface epitope), but not the A 6 <b>peptide</b> (<b>masked),</b> induces an extensive, varied immune response against multiple small nuclear ribonucleoprotein autoantigens similar to that seen in human systemic lupus erythematosus...|$|R
40|$|Patterned thin-films of {{magnetic}} nanoparticles (MNPs) {{can be used}} to make: surfaces for manipulating and sorting cells, sensors, 2 D spin-ices and high-density data storage devices. Conventional manufacture of patterned magnetic thin-films is not environmentally friendly because it uses high temperatures (hundreds of degrees Celsius) and high vacuum, which requires expensive specialised equipment. To tackle these issues, we have taken inspiration from nature to create environmentally friendly patterns of ferromagnetic CoPt using a biotemplating peptide under mild conditions and simple apparatus. Nano-patterning via interference lithography (IL) and micro-patterning using micro-contact printing (μCP) were used to create a <b>peptide</b> resistant <b>mask</b> onto a gold surface under ambient conditions. We redesigned a biotemplating peptide (CGSGKTHEIHSPLLHK) to self-assemble onto gold surfaces, and mineralised the patterns with CoPt at 18 °C in water. Ferromagnetic CoPt is biotemplated by the immobilised peptides, and the patterned MNPs maintain stable magnetic domains. This bioinspired study offers an ecological route towards developing biotemplated magnetic thin-films for use in applications such as sensing, cell manipulation and data storage...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new method for rejecting noise from LC–MS data sets. The {{algorithm}} reveals peptides at low concentrations by minimizing both {{the chemical and}} the random noise. The goal is reached through a systematic approach to characterize and remove the background. The data are represented as two-dimensional maps, in order to optimally exploit the complementary dimensions of separation of the peptides offered by the LC-MS technique. The virtual chromatograms, reconstructed from the spectrometric data, {{have proved to be}} more suitable to characterize the noise than the raw mass spectra. By means of wavelet analysis, it was possible to access both the chemical and the random noise, at different scales of the decomposition. The novel approach has proved to unveil low-intensity <b>peptides</b> originally <b>masked</b> by the chemical noise and to reduce false positive identification, by filtering noise peaks originally mimicking the peptide morphology. The filtering strategy has been tested in a standard workflow for label-free LC-MS differential analysis. The results showed that the inclusion of a preprocessing step of background subtraction in a common laboratory pipeline can lead to an enhanced inclusion list of peptides selected for fragmentation and, consequently, to better protein identification...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{subcellular}} localization {{is crucial}} for regulating p 53 function. We show that p 53 export is mediated by a highly conserved leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) located in its tetramerization domain. Mutation of NES residues prevented p 53 export and hampered tetramer formation. Although the p 53 -binding protein MDM 2 has an NES and has been proposed to mediate p 53 export, we show that the intrinsic p 53 NES is both necessary and sufficient for export. This report also demonstrates that the cytoplasmic localization of p 53 in neuroblastoma cells is due to its hyperactive nuclear export: p 53 in these cells can be trapped in the nucleus by the export-inhibiting drug leptomycin B or by binding a p 53 -tetramerization domain <b>peptide</b> that <b>masks</b> the NES. We propose a model in which regulated p 53 tetramerization occludes its NES, thereby ensuring nuclear retention of the DNA-binding form. We suggest that attenuation of p 53 function involves the conversion of tetramers into monomers or dimers, in which the NES is exposed to the proteins which mediate their export to the cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|Cyclopropabenzaindoles (CBIs) are exquisitely potent cytotoxins which bind and {{alkylate}} in {{the minor}} groove of DNA. They are not selective for cancer cells, so prodrugs are required. CBIs can be formed at physiological pH by Winstein cyclisation of 1 -chloromethyl- 3 -substituted- 5 -hydroxy- 2, 3 -dihydrobenzo[e]indoles (5 -OH-seco-CBIs). Corresponding 5 -NH 2 -seco-CBIs should also undergo Winstein cyclisation similarly. A key triply orthogonally protected intermediate on the route to 5 -NH 2 -seco-CBIs has been synthesised, via selective monotrifluoroacetylation of naphthalene- 1, 3 -diamine, Boc protection, electrophilic iodination, selective allylation at the trifluoroacetamide and 5 -exo radical ring-closure with TEMPO. This intermediate has potential for introduction of <b>peptide</b> prodrug <b>masking</b> units (deactivating the Winstein cyclisation and cytotoxicity), addition of diverse indole-amide side-chains (enhancing non-covalent binding prior to alkylation) and use of different leaving groups (replacing the usual chlorine, allowing tuning of the rate of Winstein cyclisation). This key intermediate was elaborated into a simple model 5 -NH 2 -seco-CBI with a dimethylaminoethoxyindole side-chain. Conversion to a bio-reactive entity and the bioactivity of this system were confirmed through DNA-melting studies (DeltaTm = 13 deg.

40|$|The {{structures}} of four peptides corresponding {{to parts of}} the coeliac-activating protein A-gliadin were studied by structure prediction and c. d. spectroscopy. Three of the peptides corresponded to parts of the coeliac-activating N-terminal region (residues 3 - 55, 3 - 19 and 39 - 45) and contained two tetrapeptide motifs common to all coeliac-active regions (Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln and Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro). The Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln sequence was also present in the fourth peptide, {{on the basis of}} the C-terminal part of the molecule (211 - 217). These studies showed that beta-reverse turns were the predominant structural feature in all peptides and were predominantly of type I/III in two of the N-terminal peptides and type II in the C-terminal peptide. These turns form when the peptide is dissolved in solvents of low dielectric constant (trifluoroethanol) and high dielectric constant (water and iso-osmotic saline), although their presence in the N-terminal <b>peptides</b> may be <b>masked</b> in the latter solvents due to equilibrium with a poly-L-proline II structure favoured at lower temperatures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInfection of {{different}} human epithelial cell lines with human {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (HRSV) revealed {{significant differences in the}} electrophoretic mobility of the viral attachment glycoprotein (G). Cell-type specific differences in G protein glycosylation were observed with certain lectins and sugar-specific reagents. Furthermore, substantial changes in the reactivity of the G glycoprotein with anti-G monoclonal antibodies were associated to the infected cell type. Strain-specific epitopes—present in a limited number of HRSV isolates of the same antigenic group—were particularly susceptible to cell-type-specific modifications of the mature G protein. Some of these epitopes, which were either exposed in the unglycosylated precursor or reproduced with synthetic <b>peptides,</b> were nonetheless <b>masked</b> in the mature G protein expressed in certain cell lines. Antigenic and electrophoretic mobility changes of the G glycoprotein were reverted in extracts of HEp- 2 cells infected with HRSV grown in other cell types, indicating that phenotypic traits rather than selection of variants were associated to the above stated changes. These results highlight the importance of cell-type-specific modifications for HRSV G glycoprotein antigenicity and raise questions about the actual antigenic structure of this molecule when HRSV replicates in the respiratory tract...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we analyse {{the effect of}} {{glycosylation}} in Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) antigens in antibody responses against the parasite in experimentally infected mice. It has been previously demonstrated that the mouse is a host of high compatibility with E. caproni and develops elevated responses of IgG, IgG 1, IgG 3 and IgM {{as a consequence of}} the infection, though the role of glycans in these responses remains unknown. To this purpose, the responses generated in mice against non-treated excretory/secretory antigens of E. caproni were compared with those observed after N-deglycosylation, O-deglycosylation and double deglycosylation of the antigens by indirect ELISA and western blot. Our results suggest that E. caproni-expressed glycans play a major role in the modulation of the immune responses. The results obtained indicate that IgG subclass responses generated in mice against E. caproni are essentially due to glycoproteins and may affect the Th 1 /Th 2 biasing. The reactivity significantly decreased after any of the deglycosylation treatments and the N-glycans appears to be of greater importance than O-glycans. Interestingly, the IgM response increased after N-deglycosylation suggesting that carbohydrates may <b>mask</b> <b>peptide</b> antigens...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} described a biochemical detection method for peptide products of enzymatic reactions {{based on the}} formation of PDZ domain•peptide ligand complexes. The product sensor is based on using masked or cryptic PDZ domain peptide ligands as enzyme substrates. Upon enzymatic processing, a PDZ-binding motif is exposed, and the product sequence bound specifically by a Eu 3 +chelate-labeled GST–PDZ ([Eu 3 +]GST–PDZ). The practical applicability of this PDZ-based detection method {{is determined by the}} affinity of the PDZ domain•peptide ligand interaction, and the efficiency of the enzyme to process the <b>masked</b> <b>peptide</b> ligand. To expand the use of this PDZ-based detection strategy to a broader range of enzymatic assays, we have taken advantage of the plasticity in ligand recognition by the variety of PDZ domains found in nature. In the original work, the PDZ 3 of PSD- 95 was used, which preferentially recognizes the consensus sequence Ser-X-Val-COOH. Here, we show that NHERF PDZ 1, which binds to the consensus sequence Thr/Ser-X-Leu-COOH, can be used to extend the flexibility in the recognition of the carboxy-terminal amino acid of the ligand, and monitor the enzymatic activity of HIV protease. The choices of detection format, for example, TRET or ALPHA, were also investigated and influenced assay design...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{antibodies}} exhibit {{side effects}} from binding non-target tissues that limit their effectiveness or cause harm, including acneiform folliculitis and gastrointestinal upset (cetuximab and matuzumab) and cardiotoxicity (trastuzumab). These antibodies are approved to treat tumors wherein proteases are aberrantly expressed, including matrix metalloprotease- 9 (MMP- 9). To limit {{the side effects}} of these otherwise potent therapeutics, 2 ̆ 2 masks 2 ̆ 2 that block antibody binding systemically and that are removed by protease exposure are designed, developed and explored to enhance tumor specificity. Herein, a design is demonstrated that leverages synergy in tumor cell death identified for the combination of anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies cetuximab and matuzumab to create a cross-masked antibody design. Specifically, the antibodies 2 ̆ 7 epitope (domain III of the EGFR) was fused N-terminally to a single chain variable fragment (scFv) construct of cetuximab and 425 (matuzumab 2 ̆ 7 s murine precursor) through an MMP- 9 site containing linker. In each mask, mutations were introduced into EGFR domain III (EGFRdIII) to reduce the intramolecular affinity—S 460 P/G 461 N for 425 as determined herein and mutations from the literature for cetuximab. These mask-antibody fusions were mixed to form a heterodimer or cross-masked structure. MMP- 9 exposure increased the affinity 8 -fold in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using immobilized EGFRdIII. Flow cytometry confirmed higher binding after MMP- 9 exposure. We also explored small <b>peptides</b> as <b>masks</b> to replace the EGFRdIII. Using diffraction methods, it was shown that previously described (cetuximab binding) peptides bind to a novel framework binding site, but not the expected complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Size exclusion chromatography and SPR confirmed simultaneous binding of cetuximab, EGFRdIII and the mimotope. Further, the mimotope bound the fragment antigen binding [F(ab) 2 ̆ 7], but not a scFv construct of cetuximab that places a linker across the peptide binding site. While the intention was to use these peptides to occlude the CDRs, these peptides could also be used as an anchor to sterically occlude tumor-derived antigen and thus create a non-covalent mask. Initial studies define critical parameters in implementing this concept. Taken together, modulation of antibody affinity through covalent/non-covalent masking represents a novel and potentially powerful method to improve the targeting of therapeutic antibodies to the tumor. ...|$|R

In addition to identifying compounds effective against a spectrum of sexually transmitted pathogens, {{it will be important}} to ensure that these compounds are safe. Avoiding toxicity, inflammatory responses, or alteration of the function of resident immune cells are important consid-erations for the development of vaginally applied microbicides. Studies were performed with two classes of candidate microbi-cide compounds to determine if they would interfere with the recognition of antigen by CD 41 and CD 81 T lymphocytes. The presence of nontoxic concentrations of the anionic detergent cholic acid or the sulfated polymer lambda carrageenan did not inhibit recognition of immune peptide by antigen-specific T cells. However, antigen recognition by both CD 41 and CD 81 T lymphocytes was inhibited {{in the presence of the}} naphthalene sulfonate polymer PRO 2000. Brief (4 -h) exposure of antigen-presenting cells or T cells to PRO 2000 did not result in inhi-bition of antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells or the ability of specific T cells to respond to antigen stim-ulation, suggesting that the inhibition was temporary. Binding of antibodies specific for CD 18, CD 8, and CD 3 was impaired in the presence of PRO 2000, suggesting that the mechanism by which this microbicide inhibits T cell recognition of antigenic <b>peptide</b> may involve <b>masking</b> or internalization of surface pro-teins involved in T cell signaling or stabilizing T cell-antigen-presenting cell interactions.

Methods: To reach the objects of view, molecular docking of the HIV- 1 SA-V 3 loop structure determined previously with the X-ray conformation of Cyc B was put into practice by Hex 4. 5 program ([URL] hex/) and the immunophilin stretch responsible for binding to V 3 (Cyc B peptide) was identified followed by examination of its 3 D structure and dynamic behavior in the unbound status. To design the Cyc B peptide, the X-ray conformation for the identical site of the native protein was involved in the calculations as a starting model to find its best energy structural variant. The search for this most preferable structure was carried out by consecutive use of the molecular mechanics and simulated annealing methods. The molecular dynamics computations were implemented for the Cyc B peptide by the GROMACS computer package ([URL] www. gromacs. org/).

40|$|Endothelins are potent 21 {{amino acid}} {{vasoconstrictor}} isopeptides produced in different vascular tissues, including vascular endothelium. Endothelin- 1 {{is the main}} endothelin generated by the endothelium and {{probably the most important}} in the cardiovascular system. Endothelin- 1 acts through specific receptors termed ET(A), represented only on smooth muscle cells and having the function of growth promotion and mediating contractions, and ET(B), located both on smooth muscle cells, where they evoke contractions, and on endothelial cells, inducing relaxation by production of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide. In physiological conditions endothelin- 1 administration causes vasodilation and vasoconstriction at low and high concentrations, respectively. However, administration of mixed ET(A) /(B) receptor antagonists causes slight or absent vasodilation, indicating that the direct vasoconstrictor effect of the <b>peptide</b> is probably <b>masked</b> by ET(B) -induced NO-dependent vasodilation. In essential hypertensive patients, the activity of exogenous endothelin- 1 is either increased, similar or decreased as compared to normotensive subjects, depending on which vascular district or scheme of administration is considered. But although available evidence does not indicate increased endothelin- 1 plasma levels in patients with essential hypertension, simultaneous antagonism of ET(A) /(B) receptors causes a greater degree of vasodilation in hypertensives than in normotensive subjects. Moreover administration of a selective ET(B) receptor antagonist causes vasoconstriction in normotensive subjects and vasodilation in essential hypertensive patients. Finally, the vasodilating effect of a mixed ET(A) /(B) receptor antagonist is inversely related to NO availability. Taken together these findings suggest that essential hypertension is characterized by increased endothelin- 1 vasoconstrictor tone. This alteration seems to be dependent on decreased endothelial ET(B) -mediated NO production attributable to impaired NO availability. In such conditions endothelial ET(B) -induced vasodilation no longer compensates for the direct classical endothelin vasoconstrictor effect mediated by smooth muscle cell ET(A) and ET(B) receptors. Therefore endothelin- 1 could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension or of its complications, and blockade of this system is a fascinating new target for therapeutic intervention in this disease...|$|R
40|$|Mn-Mediated radical {{addition}} {{has been}} developed within the Friestad laboratory as a versatile method toward addition to C=N bonds. N-Acylhydrazones generated by condensation between an aldehyde and an N-acylamine serves as the substrate toward radical addition. A bulky directed group attached with the N-acyl moiety and restricted rotation around N-N bond due to a three point chelation with a Lewis acid differentiates {{the faces of the}} C=N bond of the N-acylhydrazones. Radical generation initiated by photolysis of Mn 2 (CO) 10 causing homolysis of C-X bond in alkyl halide serves as the radical donor to the N-acylhydrazones. Radical addition thereafter occurs stereoselectively from the less hindered face of the C=N bond of the N-acylhydrazones. The product N-acylhydrazines can be effectively transformed to α-chiral amines. In this thesis, a new protocol toward generation of non-proteogenic γ-amino esters using Mn-mediated radical addition has been described. Moreover, the utility of the Mn-mediated radical addition has been demonstrated through studies toward synthesis of tubulysin U and V. Chapter 3 describes a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis of γ-amino esters starting from non-amino precursors. The α-substituted γ-amino esters are prevalent in drugs, drug candidates, and in peptidomimetics. As a part of progressing the Mn-mediated radical addition reaction, highly stereoselective reactions were devised for addition to N-acylhydrazonoesters in absence of Lewis acid. Spectroscopic investigations were carried out to decipher the Lewis acid chelation of N-acylhydrazones. Finally, a novel microwave mediated trifluoroacylation of N-acylhydrazinoesters facilitated the cleavage of N-N bond to liberate γ-aminoester. Chapter 4 describes application of Mn-mediated radical addition toward synthesis of tubulysin natural products. Tubulysins are natural products, isolated from myxobacteria, that have exhibited potent cytotoxicity toward cancer cells in the picomolar regime. The Mn-mediated radical addition was used to prepare two chiral amine subunits in highly diastereoselective fashion. The subunits were then assembled after required manipulations into the tetrapeptide structure characteristic of tubulysins. This strategy to synthesize tubulysins is the most stereoselective of all efforts toward the synthesis of this molecule. Synthesis toward tubulysin was achieved in 18 steps as the longest linear sequence with a 31 % overall yield to tubulysin V in benzyl protected form. Chapter 5 describes a new strategy toward installation of N-hydroxymethyl unit into a peptide chain. N,O-Acetals are acid-base labile species that is present in some tubulysin natural analogs. This new approach exploits Fleming-Tamao oxidation and hence introduce the hydroxymethyl unit of the N,O-acetal in a <b>masked</b> form.

40|$|Peptide-based {{fluorescent}} reporters of {{enzyme activity}} in living cells {{have been proposed}} to complement, or provide alternatives to, genetically-encoded probes, such as those based on the Green Fluorescent Protein and its colourful variants. The use of well-established chemical methodologies – especially solid phase synthesis – and the vast array of fluorescent dyes available allow the preparation and the evaluation of compounds with different specificities, making {{a wide range of}} investigations possible. However, cell uptake of these compounds is generally poor, and normally requires invasive methods such as microinjection or electroporation. In these conditions, the usefulness of these probes can be severely limited. The discovery of the so-called cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), more than ten years ago, has actually revealed that some of these compounds can cross efficiently the cell membranes and are able to deliver hydrophilic cargoes, such as DNA, proteins or even nanoparticles inside the cell. Unfortunately, much of the initial enthusiasm dissipated when it was found that endocytosis {{plays a major role in}} the uptake process. The entrapment in endosomal vesicles may in fact impose strict limits in terms of modification and degradation of the cargo of interest. This thesis describes the synthesis of fluorescent peptides and focuses on the problem of their delivery into the cytoplasm of living cells. A negatively charged peptide corresponding to one of the autophosphorylation sequences of the epithelial grow factor receptor (EGFR), namely DADEY 992 L, was taken as an example to investigate the possibility of creating a cell-permeable fluorescent sensor for the EGFR kinase activity in living cells. The use of a conjugate of the cell-penetrating peptide Penetratin and the probe revealed an endosomal localization in one cell type, and surprisingly no uptake in a second cell line tested. Different fluorescent derivatives of Penetratin demonstrated variations in cell uptake under different experimental conditions. During this study, red fluorescent derivatives of the cell-penetrating TAT peptide were also assessed. Although they also showed predominantly accumulation in membrane-bound compartments, these appeared to be different from the endosomal vesicles. One TAT variant in particular, namely TAT(K-LRh), may be potentially exploited as a novel vector, provided that further studies will clarify unambiguously the compartment of its accumulation. To overcome the limits inherent in the use of Penetratin conjugates, a different strategy was implemented, which relied on the chemical modification of the probe with bioactivatable protecting groups. The rationale behind these modifications was to increase the hydrophobic character of the peptide and allow its diffusion into the cells. In particular, acetoxymethyl (AM) esters were used to temporarily mask the negative charges of the aspartate and glutamate residues present in the peptide sequence. These biodegradable esters are promptly removed by ubiquitous non-specific esterases present in cells. The modified fluorescent peptide was able to penetrate easily and distribute homogeneously into the cytoplasm and the nucleus of several cell lines, with a mechanism resembling passive diffusion. Unfortunately, FRET-based assays did not measure any interaction with the EGFR. In vitro analyses showed unmasking of the carboxylate groups, albeit with modifications to the peptide backbone, which may have resulted from intramolecular condensations and formation of aspartimide residues. In particular, mass spectrometry data support this model. A loss of substrate specificity may be expected to result from such modifications, which may explain why the fluorescent peptide did not appear to interact with its enzyme target despite intracellular delivery having been achieved. This work highlights the feasibility of a tailored modification of <b>peptides,</b> either by <b>masking</b> negatively charged groups as, for example, AM esters, or by conjugating to variant of the TAT peptide, for the intracellular delivery of peptidic cargoes. Further refinements may solve the problems of poor endosomal escape or backbone modifications, and may yet offer small molecule alternatives to genetically encoded probes...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{research}} suggests that exposure to inescapable stressors can lead to an endogenous opioid-mediated form of pain inhibition, known as stress-induced analgesia (SIA). Similar results have been found with humans, although the literature is much less extensive and at times contradictory where uncontrollable stressors have led to an increase, rather than a decrease in pain. More recently, {{there has been some}} suggestion that emotions {{play an important role in}} pain modulation, and that particular negative moods are associated with opioid-mediated hypoalgesia. This research aimed to clarify the psychological (cognitive and affective) factors underlying endogenous opioid-mediated pain inhibition in humans. The purpose of Study 1 was to examine the effects of stressor controllability and predictability on pain intensity (PI) and unpleasantness (UP) ratings during a cold pressor task (CPT) in 56 male and female subjects. The stressor involved a timed mental arithmetic task during which three moderately noxious electrical shocks were delivered. Although subjects were informed that shock delivery was contingent on math performance, the shock schedule was preset and identical across conditions. Perceived control over the shocks was manipulated between subjects by altering the difficulty of the math task. Shock predictability was manipulated by changing the colour of the computer screen to warn of an impending shock. Subjects were randomly allocated to four experimental conditions (controllable-predictable, controllable-unpredictable, uncontrollable-predictable, and uncontrollable-unpredictable shocks). Visual analogue ratings of 'perceived self-efficacy' (to avoid the shocks) and mood (anxiety, confusion, discouragement, anger, sluggishness, liveliness) were completed before, during and after the math task. Significantly greater discouragement and lower self-efficacy was reported in 'uncontrollable' conditions indicating that 'controllability' was manipulated effectively. Results indicated that a perceived lack of control over shocks during the math task led to significantly greater decreases in PI, but not UP, ratings during the last stages of a 4 -minute fixed interval CPT after the math task. Shock predictability failed to influence subjective pain ratings alone; however, unpredictability interacted with lack of control to initially increase pain, followed by analgesia. Stress-induced increases in negative affect (anxiety, discouragement, anger) were associated with decreases in cold pressor PI, but with increased shock PI and UP during the math task. It was concluded that lack of control over an aversive event and negative affect led to SIA during a prolonged pain stimulus, whereas shock predictability had little influence on pain. In Study 2, 70 male and female subjects received either an opioid antagonist (naltrexone) or a placebo before the math task (using a double-blind, counterbalanced design), in order to determine the role of endogenous opioids in SIA. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions to investigate whether the shocks themselves may have contributed to analgesia observed after the math task: (1) easy task-few shocks, (2) hard task-few shocks, (3) hard task-many shocks. Increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), anxiety, anger and discouragement indicated that negative affect and sympathetic arousal were induced during the math task. Endogenous opioids inhibited the rise in anger, but not discouragement or anxiety, during the math task. There was some evidence that perceived lack of control over shocks, and not the shocks themselves, led to opioid-mediated decreases in cold pressor UP after the math task. In correlational analyses, discouraged subjects under opioid blockade reported more cold pressor UP after the math task than their placebo counterparts. However, this effect was not strong enough to reach statistical significance in regression analyses. Anxiety, anger, discouragement and lack of control over shocks increased shock PI and UP during the math task. A growing body of research with normotensive subjects has linked increased cardiovascular activity with insensitivity to pain, but the role of endogenous opioids remains contentious. In addition to the investigations outlined above, Study 2 aimed to examine the contribution of endogenous opioids in the cardiovascular-pain relationship. However, there was no evidence of an interaction between pain and cardiovascular activity in this study. Study 3 was carried out to investigate opioid involvement in the effects of an uncontrollable stressor and stress-induced negative mood on cold pressor PI, UP and pain tolerance, and onset/thresholds of the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII). Forty-three male and female subjects were administered either naltrexone or a placebo using a double-blind, counterbalanced design before completing a timed mental arithmetic stressor (identical to the 'hard task-many shocks' condition in Study 2). Increases in physiological (SBP, DBP) and affective measures (anxiety, anger and discouragement) indicated that the math task induced a marked state of stress. Negative affect increased shock PI and UP during the task, whereas self-efficacious subjects taking the placebo experienced less shock pain. However, uncontrollable stress led to an opioid-antagonised increase in cold pressor UP. Stressor controllability had a similar, but marginal, effect on cold pressor PI, but not pain tolerance. Tolerance of cold pressor pain was not associated with subjective PI and UP ratings, but was positively associated with endurance to non-painful, but unpleasant tasks (Valsalva Manoeuvre, Letter-Symbol Matching Task), indicating that pain tolerance was measuring the ability to tolerate discomfort, in addition to pain. Results of hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that increases in discouragement were positively related to increases in cold pressor UP after the math task, for naltrexone recipients only. These findings suggest that discouragement inhibits the UP of a prolonged pain stimulus via opioid mechanisms. RIII latencies and thresholds were not affected by the math task or by opioid blockade; however, these null effects may be due to methodological limitations. Unlike Study 2, higher blood pressure was associated with shock and cold pressor pain inhibition in normotensive subjects, and this relationship appeared to be mediated by opioids. The strong association between chronic pain and depression has led to speculation that the endogenous opioid system and pain modulatory mechanisms may be impaired in depression. At the time that this research was carried out, no studies had examined whether this was the case. In Study 4, the effect of a cognitive stressor (math task used in Study 3) on foot cold pressor PI, UP and pain tolerance and the nociceptive, or R 2 component, of the blink reflex was investigated in 61 participants with or without major depression (as met by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and confirmed by psychometric testing). Naltrexone or placebo was administered to subjects an hour before the math task using a double-blind, counterbalanced design. Increases in physiological (SBP, DBP) and affective measures (anxiety, anger and discouragement) confirmed that the math task induced the targeted emotional state. An opioid-mediated reduction in anxiety occurred mid-way through the math task. Opioid-mediated decreases in foot cold pressor PI and UP were observed in depressed and non-depressed subjects after the math task. R 2 onset to 10 mA was facilitated after the task regardless of opioid blockade, suggesting that endogenous opioids are not involved in the modulation of the BR. Increased anxiety and discouragement led to opioid-mediated inhibition of shock PI and UP during the task and, to a lesser extent, foot cold pressor PI and UP after the math task. Anger increased shock pain without being influenced by opioid blockade. Pain tolerance was not influenced by depression, opioid blockade or mood. These findings failed to support the idea that SIA is impaired in major depression, suggesting instead that uncontrollable aversive events and negative mood (anxiety, discouragement) lead to opioid activation and insensitivity to acute pain. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the inverse relationship between resting blood pressure and foot cold pressor PI and UP was opioid-mediated in controls only, suggesting that opioid dysregulation in depression might influence regulatory functions other than SIA. In Study 4, opioid involvement in hetero-segmental pain inhibitory phenomena termed diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) was examined separately, before psychological stress. Specifically, the effect of a heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulus (CS i. e., hand CPT) on R 2 onset latency was compared before and after drug absorption (before the math task). An inhibitory effect of the first CS was detected at each electrical stimulus intensity consistent with a DNIC effect. However, this effect was not detected during the second CS, suggesting that some other process masked the DNIC effect. In summary, the findings indicate that uncontrollable aversive events and negative emotion (primarily discouragement) activates endogenous opioids and inhibits pain in human subjects, whether depressed or not. Notably, opioids inhibited the affective component of pain perception, or pain UP, more consistently than PI, suggesting that the antinociceptive function of opioids may be secondary to an important emotional-modulatory role. Endogenous opioids also appeared to mediate the cardiovascular-pain relationship in normotensive non-depressed subjects, suggesting an important stress-regulatory role for these <b>peptides.</b> Opioid-mediated <b>masking</b> of this relationship in major depression suggests that functioning of the endogenous opioid system may be impaired in baroreceptor-mediated analgesia. This finding provides preliminary support for the notion that opioid antinociceptive system dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular disease in depression...|$|R
