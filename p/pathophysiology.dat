5|$|The {{proteasome}} and its subunits are {{of clinical}} significance {{for at least}} two reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying <b>pathophysiology</b> of specific diseases, and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies. An improved and comprehensive understanding of the <b>pathophysiology</b> of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the <b>pathophysiology</b> of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E

5|$|Numerous etiologies of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{have been}} described. Pneumomediastinum was first {{recognized as a}} medical entity by Laennec, who reported it {{as a consequence of}} trauma in 1819. Later, in 1939, at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Louis Hamman described it in postpartum woman; indeed, subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes known as Hamman's syndrome. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the <b>pathophysiology</b> in more detail.|$|E
5|$|The goal of elucidating <b>pathophysiology</b> {{has also}} led to {{increased}} interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one step closer towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus. Functional follow up studies of this locus using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have {{shed light on the}} metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate <b>pathophysiology.</b>|$|E

40|$|Obesity {{caused by}} the {{consumption}} of a high-fat (HF) diet is a major risk factor {{for the development of}} associated complications, such as heart and kidney failure. A semi-synthetic triterpenoid, bardoxolone methyl (BM) was administrated to mice fed a HF diet for 21 weeks to determine if it would prevent the development of obesity-associated cardiac and renal <b>pathophysiologies.</b> Twelve week old male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a lab chow (LC), HF (40 % fat), or a HF diet supplemented with 10 mg/kg/day BM in drinking water. After 21 weeks, the left ventricles of hearts and cortex of kidneys of mice were collected for analysis. Histological analysis revealed that BM prevented HF diet-induced development of structural changes in the heart and kidneys. BM prevented HF diet-induced decreases in myocyte number in cardiac tissue, although this treatment also elevated cardiac endothelin signalling molecules. In the kidneys, BM administration prevented HF diet-induced renal corpuscle hypertrophy and attenuated endothelin signalling. Furthermore, in both the hearts and kidneys of mice fed a HF diet, BM administration prevented HF diet-induced increases in fat accumulation, macrophage infiltration and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) gene expression. These findings suggest that BM prevents HF diet-induced developments of cardiac and renal <b>pathophysiologies</b> in mice fed a chronic HF diet by preventing inflammation. Moreover, these results suggest that BM has the potential as a therapeutic for preventing obesity-induced cardiac and renal <b>pathophysiologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Postpartum {{depression}} (PPD) {{is a major}} depressive {{disorder that}} most often emerges within 6 to 12 weeks of delivery, but can happen any time up to 1 year after birth. In developed countries, the incidence of postnatal depression is about 10 - 15 % in adult women depending upon the diagnostic criteria, timing of screening and screening instruments used. Mothers with depressive symptoms {{have been found to}} have more complex behavioral contacts with their children; this situation can damage family relationships, and even leads to infanticide. Various <b>pathophysiologies</b> are proposed for postpartum depression: Nutritional deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia, rapid decrease in the levels of reproductive hormones following delivery, alterations in hypothalamic–pituitary–adernocortical mechanism and alterations in neurotransmitter levels.

What differentiates stable angina from unstable angina (other than symptoms) is the <b>pathophysiology</b> of the atherosclerosis. The <b>pathophysiology</b> of unstable angina is the reduction of coronary flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms, or coronary thrombosis. The process starts with atherosclerosis, progresses through inflammation to yield an active unstable plaque, which undergoes thrombosis and results in acute myocardial ischemia, which, if not reversed, results in cell necrosis (infarction). Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 22:00 and 08:00 when patients are at rest.|$|E
40|$|International audienceCell {{secretion}} is {{a general}} process involved in various biological responses. Exosomes {{are part of this}} process and have gained considerable scientific interest in the past five years. Several steps through investigations across the last 20 years can explain this interest. First characterized during reticulocyte maturation, they were next characterized as a key player in the immune response and cancer immunotherapy. More recently they were characterized as vectors of mRNAs, miRNAs and also lipid mediators able to act on target cells. They are the only type of vesicles released from an intracellular compartment from cells in viable conditions. They appear as a vectorized signaling system operating from inside a donor cell towards either the periphery, the cytosol, or possibly to the nucleus of target cells. Exosomes from normal cells trigger positive effects, whereas those from pathological ones, such as tumor cells or infected ones may trigger non-positive health effects. Therefore regulating the biogenesis and secretion of exosomes appear as a pharmacological challenge to intervene in various <b>pathophysiologies.</b> Exosome biogenesis and molecular content, interaction with target cells, utilisation as biomarkers, and functional effects in various <b>pathophysiologies</b> are considered in this review...|$|R
