5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and <b>pyrazinamide.</b> The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|The {{recommended}} {{treatment of}} new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010, is {{six months of}} a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, <b>pyrazinamide,</b> and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months. Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} (approximately 1%) {{side effect of}} <b>pyrazinamide</b> is joint pains (arthralgia), {{but this is not}} usually so severe that {{patients}} need to stop taking the <b>pyrazinamide.</b> <b>Pyrazinamide</b> can precipitate gout flares by decreasing renal excretion of uric acid.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in the pncA gene of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a pyrazinamidase and {{converts}} <b>pyrazinamide</b> to its active form pyrazinoic acid, {{are responsible}} for the majority of <b>pyrazinamide</b> resistance in M. tuberculosis strains. A few pyrazinamidase resistant strains with mutations in the rpsA gene have also been identified. However, a direct association between these rpsA mutations and <b>pyrazinamide</b> resistance has not been established. It is worth noting that the <b>pyrazinamide</b> resistant M. tuberculosis strain DHMH444 which harbors a mutation in the carboxy terminal coding region of rpsA is fully susceptible to pyrazinoic acid and <b>pyrazinamide</b> resistance of this strain was previously associated with decreased pyrazinamidase activity. Further, this strain was found to be susceptible to <b>pyrazinamide</b> in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Thus, current data indicates that rpsA mutations {{are not likely to be}} associated with <b>pyrazinamide</b> resistance. There are currently three main methods of testing for <b>pyrazinamide</b> resistance: 1) phenotypic tests where a tuberculosis strain is grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of <b>pyrazinamide,</b> 2) measuring levels of pyrazinamidase enzyme produced by the tuberculosis strain, or 3) looking for mutations in the pncA gene of tuberculosis. There have been concerns that the most widely used method for phenotypic resistance testing may overestimate the amount of resistant strains.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pyrazinamide</b> {{was first}} made in 1936 {{but did not}} come into wide use until 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Pyrazinamide</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 2.76 USD per month. In the United States it costs about 100 to 200 USD per month.|$|E
25|$|Global {{resistance}} of tuberculosis to <b>pyrazinamide</b> {{has been estimated}} to be in 16% of all cases, and 60% of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyrazinamide</b> is also {{available}} as part of fixed-dose combinations with other TB drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin (Rifater is an example).|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyrazinamide</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} and patented in 1936 but not used against tuberculosis until 1952. Its discovery as an anti-tubercular agent was remarkable {{since it has}} no activity against tuberculosis in-vitro, due to not being active at a neutral pH, so would ordinarily {{not be expected to}} work in-vivo. However, it was known that nicotinamide had activity against tuberculosis and <b>pyrazinamide</b> was thought to have a similar effect. Experiments in mice at Lederle and Merck confirmed its ability to kill tuberculosis and it was rapidly used in humans.|$|E
25|$|If the {{organism}} {{is known to}} be fully sensitive, then treatment is with isoniazid, rifampicin, and <b>pyrazinamide</b> for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for four months. Ethambutol need not be used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyrazinamide</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. It is not generally recommended {{for the treatment of}} latent tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinoic acid {{was thought}} to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is {{required}} by the bacterium to synthesize fatty acids although this has been discounted. It was also suggested that the accumulation of pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and interferes with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. However, since an acidic environment is not essential for <b>pyrazinamide</b> susceptibility and <b>pyrazinamide</b> treatment {{does not lead to}} intrabacterial acidification nor rapid disruption of membrane potential, this model has also been discounted. Pyrazinoic acid also binds to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibits trans-translation, which may explain the ability of the drug to kill dormant mycobacteria.|$|E
25|$|Products {{containing}} multivalent cations, such as aluminium- or magnesium-containing antacids, {{and products}} containing calcium, iron or zinc invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Other drugs that interact with fluoroquinolones include sucralfate, probenecid, cimetidine, theophylline, warfarin, antiviral agents, phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, <b>pyrazinamide,</b> and cycloserine.|$|E
