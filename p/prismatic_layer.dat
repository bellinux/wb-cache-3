40|$|Boundary-layer meshes are {{important}} for numerical simulations in computational fluid dynamics, including computational biofluid dynamics of air flow in lungs and blood flow in hearts. Generating boundary-layer meshes is challenging for complex biological geometries. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for generating prismatic boundary-layer meshes for such complex geometries. Our method computes a feature size of the geometry, adapts the surface mesh based on the feature size, and then generates the <b>prismatic</b> <b>layers</b> by propagating the triangulated surface using the face-offsetting method. We derive a new variational method to optimize the <b>prismatic</b> <b>layers</b> to improve the triangle shapes and edge orthogonality of the prismatic elements and also introduce simple and effective measures to guarantee {{the validity of the}} mesh. Coupled with a high-quality tetrahedral mesh generator for the interior of the domain, our method generates high-quality hybrid meshes for accurate and efficient numerical simulations. We present comparative study to demonstrate the robustness and quality of our method for complex biomedical geometries. Copyright c ○ 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

50|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} layers in a shell are generally of two types: an outer, chalk-like <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer</b> and an inner pearly, lamellar or nacreous layer.

50|$|Euomphaloid shells {{are mostly}} {{discoidal}} {{and may be}} either orthostrophic (coils wrapped around an erect cone) or hyperstrophic (coils wrapped around an inverted cone); are widely umbilicate and commonly have a channel, presumed exhalent, within the angulation in the outer part of the upper whorl surface. The shell wall is relatively thick, with an external <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer</b> of calcite, which may be pigmented, and an internal layer of lamellar, but not nacreous, aragonite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of a single shell prompts comparisons to the cephalopod Nautilus, but besides its bilateral symmetry and direction of coiling, {{there is not a}} clear equivalence; Nautilus shell is notably different in the possession of septa (and thus a siphuncle). It bears a similar degree of similarity to most other mollusc groups, leading to speculation that it may reflect a relatively unchanged ancestral mollusc. [...] The shell itself is aragonitic, consisting mainly of a <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer,</b> lined with nacre.|$|E
50|$|In {{oysters and}} {{potentially}} most molluscs, the nacreous layer has an organic {{framework of the}} protein MSI60, which has a structure a little like spider silk and forms sheets; the <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer</b> uses MSI31 to construct its framework. This too forms beta-pleated sheets. Since acidic amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, are important mediators of biomineralization, shell proteins tend to be rich in these amino acids. Aspartic acid, which can make up up to 50% of shell framework proteins, is most abundant in calcitic layers, and also heavily present in aragonitic layers. Proteins with high proportions of glutamic acid are usually associated with amorphous calcium carbonate.|$|E
40|$|Gastropod shells {{consist of}} two crystal types of calcium carbonate, an outer, <b>prismatic</b> calcite <b>layer</b> and an inner nacreous layer made of aragonite. In cross-section, the nacre of the nacreous layer {{appears to have}} a regular brick-like {{microstructure}} composed of thin laminae of aragonite crystals, separated by very thin sheets of protein (Lutz and Rhoads, 1980; Nakahara, 1983). In abalone (Genus, Haliotis) and other gastropods, thin layers of non-lamellar pigmented material occur within the nacre and have been termed alternatively, fine lines, growth rings or growth lines (Shepherd et al., 1995). It has been suggested that these pigmented <b>layers</b> are small, <b>prismatic,</b> calcite <b>layers</b> (Shepherd and Avalos-Borja, 1997; Zaremba et al., 1996) but investigations using a Raman laser in Haliotis rubra show that they contain aragonite rather than calcite (Hawkes et al, 1996). Day and Fleming (1992) suggest that the occurrence of pigmented layers is correlated with regular exogenous cues such as reproduction or temperature changes and indeed in some species, pigmented layers in the shell can be used to age abalone (review: Shepherd and Triantafillos, 1997). However, McShane and Smith (1992) suggest that pigmented layers can occur irregularly and therefore may be unreliable indicators of age...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new general method for building simulation programs which {{is intended to}} be used for the modelling of complex facades. The term ‘complex facades’ is used to designate facades with venetian blinds, <b>prismatic</b> <b>layers,</b> light re-directing surfaces, etc. In all these cases, the facade properties have a complex angular dependence. In addition to this, such facades very often have non-airtight layers and/or imperfect components (e. g. non-ideal sharp edges, non-flat surfaces, …). Therefore building planners often had to neglect some of the innovative features and to use ‘work-arounds’ in order to approximate the properties of complex facades in building simulation programs. A well-defined methodology for these cases was missing. This paper presents such a general methodology. The main advantage of the new method is that it only uses measureable quantities of the transparent or translucent part of the facade as a whole. This is the main difference in comparison with state of the art modelling based on the characteristics of the individual subcomponents, which is often impossible due to non-existing heat- and/or light-transfer models within the complex facade. It is shown that the new method can significantly increase the accuracy of heating/cooling loads and room temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{shell wall}} in Spirula is {{composed}} of <b>prismatic</b> <b>layers,</b> whereas the septa consist of lamello-fibrillar nacre. The septal neck is holochoanitic and consists of two calcareous layers: the outer lamello-fibrillar nacreous layer that continues from the septum, and the inner pillar layer that covers the inner surface of the septal neck. The pillar layer probably is a structurally modified simple prisma layer that covers the inner surface of the septal neck in Nautilus. The pillars have a complicated crystalline structure and contain high amount of chitinous substance. The interspaces between the pillars probably are traversed horizontally by numerous chitinous membranes like in the cuttlebone chambers in Sepia. The connecting ring {{is composed of}} similar two layers as that in the extant Nautilus: the outer spherulitic–prismatic layer and the inner chitinous layer. The spherulitic–prismatic layer takes its origin on the outer surface of the septal neck, whereas the inner chitinous layer is the non-calcified continuation of the lamello-fibrillar nacreous layer of the septal neck. The siphuncular structure in Spirula is compared with that in the extant Nautilus, fossil nautilosiphonate nautiloids, and five taxa of coleoids. No funding indicated. </p...|$|R

Some more recently described eggshell fragments have been referred to A. aff. fontllongensis and cf. Ageroolithus. The eggshell has a smooth surface, and at 25-36 mm thick is thinner than most other eggs of the ratite morphotype. Erosion and recrystallization heavily affect most Ageroolithus specimens, but a few fragments are well enough preserved to observe the microstructure. It has two structural layers with a sharp dividing line between them. The inner layer, known as the mammillary layer, is composed of wedges and shows distinct growth lines, whereas the outer layer (the <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer)</b> is not clearly divided into units. It has narrow, straight pore canals measuring 15 to 25 µm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Aspein is {{an unusually}} acidic {{molluscan}} shell matrix protein, {{which may have}} important roles in calcium carbonate biomineralization. The Aspein gene (aspein, Uniprot: Q76K52) encodes a sequence of 413 amino acids, including {{a high proportion of}} Asp (60.4%), Gly (16.0%), and Ser (13.2%), and the predicted isoelectric point is 1.78. This is the most acidic of all the molluscan shell matrix proteins sequenced so far, or probably even of all known proteins on earth. The main body of aspein is occupied by (Asp)2-10 sequences punctuated with Ser-Gly dipeptides. RT-PCR demonstrated that the transcript of aspein is expressed at {{the outer edge of the}} mantle, corresponding to the calcitic <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer,</b> but not at the inner part of the mantle, corresponding to the aragonitic nacreous layer. Aspein is likely responsible for directed formation of calcite in the shell of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata.|$|E
50|$|The age of bivalve {{molluscs}} {{can be estimated}} in several ways. The Noah's Ark clam Arca noae {{has been used to}} compare these methods: the annual growth rings on the exterior of the valves can be counted at one per year and give a satisfactory result, but sometimes spurts of growth occur which may create an extra ring and cause confusion. Early rings may get worn away near the umbones and the narrow rings near the margin may be difficult to interpret in fully grown individuals. Similar annual pallial line scars on the interior of the valves are more easily seen in dark colored shells, but these may be overgrown and obscured by further deposition of hard material. Another method is the examination of the growth lines and bands seen in acetate peel replicas taken in the region of the umbones. The most accurate but most time-consuming method is the microscopic examination of sections through the outer <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer</b> of the shell. Using more than one of these methods should increase the accuracy of the result.|$|E

40|$|Pearl Oysters {{of twenty}} species {{belonging}} to four genera of the superfamily Pteriacea, and thirty eight {{other species of}} bivalves of thirty-one genera belonging to sixteen superfamilies have been examined to investigate the relationship between particular shell structures and the tissues which secrete the precursors of their organic matrices.

Inadequacy of taxonomy of the Australian pearl oysters has been revealed by this study.

A large number of the tissues and glands thought to be involved in the secretion of the precursors of the organic matrices of the different shell layers in the animals studied are described, and where known, the roles of their secretions discussed.

Tetrahedra of variable size, as well as directionally stretched tetrahedracan be generated by specification of a proper background grid, initiallygenerated by a Delaunay algorithm. A marching <b>layer</b> <b>prismatic</b> grid generation algorithm has been developedfor the generation of grids for viscous flows. The algorithm is able to handleregions of narrow gaps, as well as concave regions. The body surface is describedby a triangular unstructured surface grid. The subsequent grid layers in theprismatic grid are marched away from the body by an algebraic procedurecombined with an optimization procedure, resulting in a semi-structured gridof prismatic cells. Adaptive computations using remeshing have been done with use of a gradientsensor. Several key-variables can be monitored simultaneously. The sensorindicates that only the key-variables with the largest gradients give a substantialcontribution to the sensor. The sensor gives directionally stretched grids. An algorithm for the surface definition of curved surfaces using a biharmonicequation has been developed. This representation of the surface canbe used both for projection of the new surface nodes in h-refinement, and theinitial generation of the surface grid. For unsteady flows an algorithm has been developed for the deformationof hybrid grids, based on the solution of the biharmonic equation for the deformationfield. The main advantage of the grid deformation algorithm is that itcan handle large deformations. It also produces a smooth deformation distributionfor cells which are very skewed or stretched. This is necessary in orderto handle the very thin cells in the <b>prismatic</b> <b>layers.</b> The algorithms have been applied to complex three-dimensional geometries,and the influence of the grid quality on the accuracy for a finite volumeflow solver has been studied for some simpler generic geometries.

40|$|The {{shell of}} the {{gastropod}} mollusc, abalone, is comprised of nacre with an outer <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer</b> that is composed of either calcite or aragonite or both, depending on the species. A striking characteristic of the abalone shell is the row of apertures along the dorsal margin. As the organism and shell grow, new apertures are formed and the preceding ones are filled in. Detailed investigations, using electron backscatter diffraction, of the infill in three species of abalone: Haliotis asinina, Haliotis gigantea and Haliotis rufescens reveals that, like the shell, the infill is composed mainly of nacre with an outer <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer.</b> The infill <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer</b> has identical mineralogy as the original shell <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer.</b> In H. asinina and H. gigantea, the <b>prismatic</b> <b>layer</b> of the shell and infill are made of aragonite while in H. rufescens both are composed of calcite.

40|$|Organic {{components}} of typical <b>prismatic</b> <b>layers</b> in several molluscan shells were reexamined by applying {{scanning electron microscopy}} to preparations treated with the freeze-dry or the critical-point-dry method, with the result showing the following: The interior of prisms is almost filled up with a spongy intraprismatic matrix. Also three principal types of prisms are distinguishable {{according to the state}} of development and the histochemical nature of a vertical (interprismatic) wall. Namely, prisms of type 1 are separated from their neighbor by a rigid vertical wall, and are represented by calcite simple prisms of Pinctada and aragonite simple prisms of Anodonta: prisms of type 2 are separated by a compound (partly rigid and partly spongy) vertical wall, and are represented by aragonite simple prisms of Unio; prisms of type 3 are separated by a spongy vertical wall, and are represented by composite prisms of Tapes and Peronidia. These findings suggest that type 2 is intermediate between types 1 and 3, and that transformation of an interprismatic matrix from a "primitive" rigid matrix to a more "advanced" spongy one has probably taken place in the course of evolution of prisms. In addition, the histochemical nature of the rigid matrix is acidophilic like the shell epidermis. Meanwhile, the spongy matrix, regardless of being inter- or intraprismatic, is basophilic, and will have some connections with mineralization of prisms...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{distribution}} of chitin in the shells of Mollusca {{was confirmed by}} {{the application of a}} quantitative and specific enzymatic method. Chitin was found not only in cephalopod shells, but also in mother-of-pearl, pseudonacreous layers, and in many cases, in periostracum and <b>prismatic</b> <b>layers</b> of gastropod and bivalve shells. The presence and the proportion of chitin are highly variable in the periostracum of the bivalve species studied so far. Its permanent presence in the organic matrix, associated with mother-of-pearl, emphasizes the homology of this structure in the whole phylum of Mollusca. The more or less important participation of chitin in the building of the organic matrix of the different shell structures may be related to taxonomic and/or ecological characteristics. Chitin distribution is in good agreement with the classification grouping Arcidae and Glycimeridae among the Filibranchia Taxodonta and isolating Nuculidae in the Protobranchia, but the lower rate of chitin observed in the inner calcified shell layers of seven species of Anisomyaria and the high chitin rate in those of four species of Adapedonta may be a further indication of the homogeneity of both taxa. From an ecological point of view, chitin constitutes an important fraction of the shell organic matter in burrowing species, while this polysaccharide is practically lacking or in very low proportions in the shells of fixed or free species...|$|R
