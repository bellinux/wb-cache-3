5000|$|Starting {{with the}} prism of the {{smallest}} power, the examiner increases the <b>prismatic</b> <b>power</b> slowly, allowing a fusion response for each prism, until the patient can no longer fuse and reports diplopia. The prism power value just previously to that at which diplopia was appreciated is recorded as the break point. From the break point, the examiner slowly reduces the <b>prismatic</b> <b>power</b> until the patient regains BSV. The prism value at which the patientâ€™s BSV is first restored is recorded as the recovery point.|$|E

While there is an international standard for checking focimeters, there is no report of any study on their performance. Method: A sample set of 51 focimeters (11 brands), were used to measure the spherical power of a set of lenses and the <b>prismatic</b> <b>power</b> of two lenses complying with ISO 9342 - 1 : 2005 and other calibrated prismatic lenses and the spherical power of some grey filters. Results: The mean measured spherical power corresponded very closely with the calibrated values; however, the spread of results was substantial and 10 focimeters did not comply with ISO 8598 : 1996. The measurement of prism was much more accurate and precise and all the focimeters complied easily. With the grey filters, about one-third of the foci meters either showed erratic reading or an error with the equivalent of category 4 sunglasses. On the other hand, nine focimeters had stable and accurate reading on a filter with a luminous transmittance of 0. 5 per cent. Conclusions: These results confirm that, in common with all other measurement instruments, {{there is a need to}} ensure that a focimeter is reading accurately and precisely over the range of refractive powers and luminous transmittances. The accurate and precise performance of an automated focimeter over its working life cannot be assumed. Checking before purchase with a set of calibrated lenses and some dark sunglass tints will indicate the suitability of a focimeter. Routine checking with the calibrated lenses will inform the users if a focimeter continues to indicate accurately...|$|E

These are important magnitudes in ophthalmic optics because large amounts of them will disturb the binocular vision of the spectacle wearer. As a practical application of our algorithm, the distribution of optical imbalances and differential <b>prismatic</b> <b>powers</b> {{for a pair of}} progressive addition lenses has been calculated, and we obtain information about the effects of this kind of lens on the binocular vision of the wearer...|$|R
40|$|The mini-dome Fresnel lens {{concentrator}} array, a high-efficiency, lightweight space photovoltaic array concept, is described. The three critical {{elements of}} the array concept are the Fresnel lens concentrator, the <b>prismatic</b> cell <b>power</b> cover, and the photovoltaic cell. Prototype concentrator lenses have been fabricated and tested, with optical efficiencies reaching 90 percent. Work is progressing on the design and fabrication of the panel structure. The impact of recent advances in 30 percent-efficient multijunction photovoltaic cells on array performance is also discussed. Near-term performance goals of 300 w/sq m and 100 w/kg are now feasible...|$|R
40|$|A Jacobian {{matrix of}} a general inline planar {{platform}} is studied. An inline planar platform is a manipulator with three legs, each with RPR joints, such that the revolute joints are free and align on each platform and the <b>prismatic</b> joints are <b>powered.</b> The configurations that cause the Jacobian matrix to become singular form a singularity surface that must be avoided for controllability. The Jacobian matrix is developed in the even Clifford algebra C+(P 2) of the projective space P 2 and its singularity surface is studied. A redundant planar platform manipulator is shown to have a block Jacobian matrix. A composite of singularity sets is developed for a redundant planar platform. A three-dimensional multi-platform manipulator is discussed...|$|R
