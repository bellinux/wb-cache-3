40|$|Welders {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to pneumococcal pneumonia. The mechanisms are yet unclear. Pneumococci co-opt the platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) to infect respiratory epithelial cells. We previously reported that exposure of respiratory cells to welding fumes (WF), upregulates PAFR-dependent <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> The signaling pathway for this response is unknown, however, in intestinal cells, hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF 1 α) is reported to mediate PAFR-dependent infection. We sought to assess whether oxidative stress plays a role in susceptibility to <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> via the platelet activating factor receptor. We also sought to evaluate the suitability of nasal epithelial PAFR expression in welders as a biomarker of susceptibility to infection. Finally, we investigated the generalisability of the effect of welding fumes on <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> and growth using a variety of different welding fume samples. Nasal epithelial PAFR expression in welders and controls was analysed by flow cytometry. WF were collected using standard methodology. The effect of WF on respiratory cell reactive oxygen species production, HIF- 1 α expression, and <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> was determined using flow cytometry, HIF- 1 α knockdown and overexpression, and <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> assays. We found that nasal PAFR expression is significantly increased in welders compared with controls and that WF significantly increased reactive oxygen species production, HIF- 1 α and PAFR expression, and <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> of respiratory cells. In unstimulated cells, HIF- 1 α knockdown decreased PAFR expression and HIF- 1 α overexpression increased PAFR expression. However, in knockdown cells <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> was paradoxically increased and in overexpressing cells infection was unaffected. Nasal epithelial PAFR expression may be used as a biomarker of susceptibility to <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> in order to target individuals, particularly those at high risk such as welders, for the pneumococcal vaccine.

50|$|When {{antibiotics}} {{came into}} {{use for the}} cure of <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infections</b> in the 1950s and 60s, further pneumococcal vaccine development was abandoned.

Austrian also established that persons over 50 years of age, and those with chronic debilitating diseases were the largest group at risk. Austrian established a tremendous knowledge base of pneumococcal biology. He analyzed 83 known types of pneumococci, and determined 14 types were responsible for 80% of invasive <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infections</b> in man, and that the outer coatings or capsules of these organisms should be included in an effective vaccine.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{pathogenic}} mechanisms of disease can be greatly facilitated by studying genetic differences in susceptibility to infection. In the present study, {{we compared the}} severity of <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) and 129 Sv mice. The results showed that 129 Sv mice were remarkably more susceptible to <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> than B 6 mice. Bacterial clearance, proinflammatory mediators, leukocyte recruitment, and phagocyte activities were measured to examine potential immune factors associated with differences in susceptibility to <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> The greater susceptibility of 129 Sv mice was associated only with inadequate alveolar macrophage bacterial killing, as indicated by significantly decreased initial bacterial clearance from the respiratory tract. Effective pneumococcal clearance was not dependent upon Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) expression, oxidative stress, or matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP- 12) expression. Furthermore, phagocytosis analysis suggested that the deficiency found in 129 Sv alveolar macrophages was not {{due to a lack}} of bacterial recognition but, rather, to reduced bacterial uptake. In conclusion, our findings indicate a crucial role of alveolar macrophage phagocytosis during innate defense against <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection,</b> which may explain the association of host genetic risk factors with predisposition to <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|R

40|$|Postinfluenza pneumococcal {{pneumonia}} {{is a common}} {{cause of death in}} humans. However, the role of IL- 27 in the pathogenesis of secondary {{pneumococcal pneumonia}} after influenza is unknown. We now report that influenza infection induced pulmonary IL- 27 production in a type I IFN-a/b receptor (IFNAR) signalling-depen-dent manner, which sensitized mice to secondary <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> downstream of IFNAR pathway. Mice deficient in IL- 27 receptor were resistant to secondary <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection</b> and generated more IL- 17 A-producing cd T cells but not ab T cells, thereby leading to enhanced neutrophil response during the early phase of host defence. IL- 27 treatment could suppress the develop-ment of IL- 17 A-producing cd T cells activated by Streptococcus pneumoniae and dendritic cells. This suppressive activity of IL- 27 on cd T cells was dependent on transcription factor STAT 1. Finally, neutralization of IL- 27 or administration of IL- 17 A restored the role of cd T cells in combating secondary <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> Our study defines what we believe to be a novel role of IL- 27 in impair-ing host innate immunity against <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|R
