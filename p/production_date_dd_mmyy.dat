40|$|The REIMEP- 22 inter-laboratory {{comparison}} {{aimed at}} determining the <b>production</b> <b>date</b> of a uranium certified test sample (i. e. the last chemical separation {{date of the}} material). Participants in REIMEP- 22 on "U Age Dating - Determination of the <b>production</b> <b>date</b> of a uranium certified test sample" received one low-enriched 20 mg uranium sample for mass spectrometry measurements and/or one 50 mg uranium sample for D-spectrometry measurements, with an undisclosed value for the <b>production</b> <b>date.</b> They were asked to report the isotope amount ratios n(230 Th) /n(234 U) for the 20 mg uranium sample and/or the activity ratios A(230 Th) /A(234 U) for the 50 mg uranium sample {{in addition to the}} calculated <b>production</b> <b>date</b> of the certified test samples with its uncertainty. Reporting of the 231 Pa/ 235 U ratio and the respective calculated <b>production</b> <b>date</b> was optional. Eleven laboratories reported results in REIMEP- 22. Two of them reported results for both the 20 mg and 50 mg uranium certified test samples. The measurement capability of the participants was assessed against the independent REIMEP- 22 reference value by means of z- and zeta-scores in compliance with ISO 13528 : 2005. Furthermore a performance assessment criterion for acceptable uncertainty was applied to evaluate the participants' results. In general, the REIMEP- 22 participants' results were satisfactory. This confirms the analytical capabilities of laboratories to determine accurately the age of uranium materials with low amount of ingrown thorium (young certified test sample). The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC- JRC) organised REIMEP- 22 in parallel to the preparation and certification of a uranium reference material certified for the <b>production</b> <b>date</b> (IRMM- 1000 a and IRMM- 1000 b).

50|$|Liquid shellac has {{a limited}} shelf life (about 1 year), so {{is sold in}} dry form for {{dissolution}} before use. Liquid shellac sold in hardware stores is often marked with the <b>production</b> (mixing) <b>date,</b> so the consumer can know whether the shellac inside is still good. Some manufacturers (e.g., Zinsser) have ceased labeling shellac with the <b>production</b> <b>date</b> but the <b>production</b> <b>date</b> may be discernible from the production lot code. Alternatively, old shellac may be tested {{to see if it}} is still usable: a few drops on glass should quickly dry to a hard surface. Shellac that remains tacky for a long time is no longer usable. Storage life depends on peak temperature, so refrigeration extends shelf life.|$|R
