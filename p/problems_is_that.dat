25|$|One of the <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> statisticians {{have tended}} {{not to publish}} their match lists with their findings. It should, however, {{be noted that the}} number of {{differences}} is extremely small in terms of the sport's overall statistics. The status of pre-definition matches is primarily a statistical concern rather than a historical one. Historians record the importance of a match in contemporary terms regardless of statistical hindsight.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} there are textual <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there was no {{copyright}} of writings at the time. As a result, Shakespeare and the playing companies he worked with did not distribute scripts of his plays, for fear that the plays would be stolen. This led to bootleg copies of his plays, which were often based on people trying to remember what Shakespeare had actually written.|$|E
25|$|The various {{services}} are currently not interoperable, though those {{that use the}} same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster, Kazaa and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need plug-ins. Several colleges and universities, such as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. One of the <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8—12) that there be explicit fair dealing exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users {{to do the same}} privately. If adopted, some acrimony may decrease.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} religious <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people fear having a relationship with God and consequently distance themselves from Him. Just as angels serve God without fear despite their lower status in comparison to God, so too human beings should take their model (walk amongst them) and not be afraid of developing a relationship with God and serving Him. This represents a wholeness that we as human beings are capable of only if we {{think of ourselves as}} walking amongst angels. (Sfas Emes, Parshat Beha'alotecha 5636) ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{of these}} <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> inert {{components}} of the breathing gas are dissolved in the blood and transported to the other tissues at higher concentrations under pressure, and when the pressure is reduced, if the concentration is high enough, this gas may form bubbles in the tissues, including the venous blood, which may cause the injury known as decompression sickness, or [...] "the bends". This problem may be managed by decompressing slowly enough to allow the gas to be eliminated while still dissolved, and eliminating those bubbles which do form while they are still small and few enough not to produce symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are cases}} where, {{if the child}} is returned, the {{abductor}} will not or cannot return with the child out of safety concerns. One of the crucial <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> upon return to the foreign country, abducting parents lack resources to hire a lawyer to obtain protective measures against domestic violence. Another concern regarding signing the treaty is the possibility that implementing it would, in practice, [...] "tear the child away from a parent", as a primary caregiver would be unable to accompany the children to countries which have criminalized parental abduction. Colin Jones, a law professor of Doshisha University, commented that [...] "hatever the law says, {{it is very hard to}} imagine it being in the interests of the police and prosecutors to be seen taking crying half-Japanese children away from distraught Japanese mothers." ...|$|E

This led to increased dependency on foreign loans and investments.|$|R

2500|$|The coastal {{migration}} models {{provide a}} different perspective on migration to the New World, {{but they are not}} without their own problems. One of the biggest <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> global sea levels have risen over [...] {{since the end of the}} last glacial period, and this has submerged the ancient coastlines that maritime people would have followed into the Americas. Finding sites associated with early coastal migrations is extremely difficult—and systematic excavation of any sites found in deeper waters is challenging and expensive. On the other hand, there is evidence of marine technologies found in the hills of the Channel Islands of California, circa 10,000 BCE. If there was an early pre-Clovis coastal migration, there is always the possibility of a [...] "failed colonization". Another problem that arises is the lack of hard evidence found for a [...] "long chronology" [...] theory. No sites have yet produced a consistent chronology older than about 12,500 radiocarbon years (~14,500 calendar years) , but research has been limited in South America related to the possibility of early coastal migrations.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{some recent}} {{research}} which tries {{to assess the}} impact of the Internet on profitability. It remains unclear what the total effect of computerization is on the relationship between investments and profits. Some argue that, in reality, computerization by itself does not alter the cost structure of products very much. Others argue, that computerization both enables a much faster turnover of capital, with great productivity gains and fewer employees, and permits entrepreneurs to set up business with computers at a much lower start-up cost than before. Perhaps the main effect of the internet relevant to business is that it has gigantically enlarged the possibilities for market access on a global scale: businesses set up for internet sales can reach vastly more customers in much less time. [...] The proof of that is, that purchases via the internet have constantly increased, often at the expense of ordinary street shops. One of the analytical <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the relative importance of computers, and their potential financial impact, differs considerably between different kinds of business.|$|E
2500|$|One {{source of}} <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people making flu-related Google {{searches}} may {{know very little}} about how to diagnose flu; searches for flu or flu symptoms may well be researching disease symptoms that are similar to flu, but are not actually flu. [...] Furthermore, analysis of search terms reportedly tracked by Google, such as [...] "fever" [...] and [...] "cough", as well as effects of changes in their search algorithm over time, have raised concerns about the meaning of its predictions. In fall 2013, Google began attempting to compensate for increases in searches due to prominence of flu in the news, which was found to have previously skewed results. [...] However, one analysis concluded that [...] "by combining GFT and lagged CDC data, as well as dynamically recalibrating GFT, we can substantially improve on the performance of GFT or the CDC alone." [...] A later study also demonstrates that Google search data can indeed be used to improve estimates, reducing the errors seen in a model using CDC data alone by up to 52.7 per cent.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly's athleticism {{gave his}} moves a {{distinctive}} broad, muscular quality, {{and this was}} a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: [...] "There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete...I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman." [...] He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, [...] "tragically" [...] stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: [...] "Dancing does attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players...but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies." [...] In his view, [...] "one of our <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine." [...] He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as Dancing: A Man's Game (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years.|$|E
6000|$|But {{social science}} {{is by no}} means always content with the normal human soul; it has all sorts of fancy souls for sale. Man as a social idealist will say [...] "I am tired of being a Puritan; I want to be a Pagan," [...] or [...] "Beyond this dark {{probation}} of Individualism I see the shining paradise of Collectivism." [...] Now in bodily ills there is none of this difference about the ultimate ideal. The patient may or may not want quinine; but he certainly wants health. No one says [...] "I am tired of this headache; I want some toothache," [...] or [...] "The only thing for this Russian influenza is a few German measles," [...] or [...] "Through this dark probation of catarrh I see the shining paradise of rheumatism." [...] But exactly the whole difficulty in our public <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some men are aiming at cures which other men would regard as worse maladies; are offering ultimate conditions as states of health which others would uncompromisingly call states of disease. Mr. Belloc once said that he would no more part with the idea of property than with his teeth; yet to Mr. Bernard Shaw property is not a tooth, but a toothache. Lord Milner has sincerely attempted to introduce German efficiency; and many of us would as soon welcome German measles. Dr. Saleeby would honestly like to have Eugenics; but I would rather have rheumatics.|$|E
6000|$|His {{impartiality}} {{is part of}} {{the reserve}} with which he works in most respects, and which at first glance makes us say that he is wanting in humor. But I feel pretty certain that Mr. James {{has not been able to}} disinherit himself to this degree. We Americans are terribly in earnest about making ourselves, individually and collectively; but I fancy that our prevailing mood in the face of all <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of an abiding faith which can afford to be funny. He has himself indicated that we have, as a nation, as a people, our joke, and every one of us is in the joke more or less. We may, some of us, dislike it extremely, disapprove it wholly, and even abhor it, but we are in the joke all the same, and no one of us is safe from becoming the great American humorist at any given moment. The danger is not apparent in Mr. James's case, and I confess that I read him with a relief in the comparative immunity that he affords from the national facetiousness. Many of his people are humorously imagined, or rather humorously SEEN, like Daisy Miller's mother, but these do not give a dominant color; the business in hand is commonly serious, and the droll people are subordinated. They abound, nevertheless, and many of them are perfectly new finds, like Mr. Tristram in [...] "The American," [...] the bill-paying father in the [...] "Pension Beaurepas," [...] the anxiously Europeanizing mother in the same story, the amusing little Madame de Belgarde, Henrietta Stackpole, and even Newman himself. But though Mr. James portrays the humorous in character, he is decidedly not on humorous terms with his reader; he ignores rather than recognizes the fact that they are both in the joke.|$|E
