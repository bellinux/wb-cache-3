5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
25|$|The missile {{carries a}} {{dual-band}} seeker in both IR and visible low-light video. The IR seeker is not cooled, which would restrict some performance for an anti-aircraft missile {{but is a}} major simplification for an infantry missile. In particular it avoids relying on a <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> supply which {{would need to be}} replenished. A data link from the missile presents the seeker images back to the firing station for Man In The Loop control. This also allows a launch to be aborted without detonation, should a collateral civilian suddenly obscure the target.|$|E
500|$|Razer's {{hydraulic}} system pumped pressurised liquid, {{as opposed to}} pneumatics where a force is generated by the controlled release of a <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas.</b> Razer's arm was often said to exert nine tonnes of force; however, it was the hydraulic ram which produced up to nine tonnes of pressure per square inch (1,395kg/cm2, [...] ) at its output, and this was geared down to three tonnes per square inch (465kg/cm2, [...] ) {{at the tip of}} the arm.|$|E

50|$|The pascal is also {{equivalent}} to the SI unit of energy density, J/m3. This applies {{not only to the}} thermodynamics of <b>pressurised</b> <b>gases,</b> but also to the energy density of electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields.|$|R
50|$|The MkIII massively {{improves}} on the MarkII again; {{this time}} {{by a factor of}} five. Around 15,000 kg of thrust could be achieved from this engine; making it the most powerful engine Starchaser have. The <b>pressurising</b> <b>gas</b> was this time Helium.|$|R
500|$|In 1870, some {{close-coupled}} rigid-wheelbase four-wheeled carriages {{were built}} by Oldbury. After some derailments in 1887, a new design of [...] long rigid-wheelbase four-wheelers known as Jubilee Stock {{was built by}} the Cravens Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for the extension line. With the <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> lighting system and non-automatic vacuum brakes from new, steam heating was added later. More trains followed in 1892, although all had been withdrawn by 1912. By May 1893, following an order by the Board of Trade, automatic vacuum brakes had been fitted to all carriages and locomotives. A Jubilee Stock first class carriage was restored to carry passengers during the Met's 150th anniversary celebrations.|$|E

2500|$|The hoses are {{designed}} for use in welding and cutting metal. A double-hose or twinned design can be used, meaning that the oxygen and fuel hoses are joined together. If separate hoses are used, they should be clipped together at intervals approximately [...] apart, although that is not recommended for cutting applications, because beads of molten metal given off by the process can become lodged between the hoses where they are held together, and burn through, releasing the <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> inside, which {{in the case of}} fuel gas usually ignites.|$|E
25|$|In South Africa, the {{national}} standard for handling and filling portable cylinders with <b>pressurised</b> <b>gases</b> (SANS 10019) {{requires that the}} cylinder be labelled with a sticker identifying the contents as nitrox, and specifying the oxygen fraction. Similar requirements may apply in other countries.|$|R
40|$|The p-V-T {{relationships}} of the molten alkali nitrates (Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) were determined using a gas-pressurised, externally-heated pressure vessel. The cells were the pyknometer type {{with a long}} capillary barrier between the <b>pressurising</b> <b>gas</b> and {{the bulk of the}} liquid. Data, over a range of temperature from 500 to 800 K and a range of pressure to 1400 bar, were plotted in the form of isochores and used to determine densities and compressibilities of the liquids...|$|R
50|$|However {{the final}} inquest of the HSE {{indicated}} that the explosion was due to an ignition of gas released by a leak in a <b>pressurised</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> pipe.|$|R

40|$|The {{appearance}} of new materials has revived {{interest in the}} modelling of rapid crack propagation (RCP) along fluid-pressurised plastic pipelines. The corre-lation of results from two International Standard RCP test methods — one full-scale and partially simulating installation and service conditions, the other lab-scale — remains imperfectly understood. There is no standard method for measuring the dynamic fracture toughness of the pipe material, and models re-lating toughness to pipe fracture pressure have not gained widespread use. This paper demonstrates an adaptable, extendable, analytically transparent model which accounts for all major influences including residual stress in the pipe wall, constraint from surrounding backfill and partial substitution of the <b>pressurising</b> <b>gas</b> by water...|$|R
5|$|The {{regulations}} cover {{transportation of}} gas cylinders {{in a vehicle}} in a commercial environment. Transportation of <b>pressurised</b> diving <b>gas</b> cylinders with a combined water capacity of less than 1000 litres on a vehicle for personal use is exempt from ADR.|$|R
5000|$|An axial {{compressor}} is a compressor that can continuously <b>pressurise</b> <b>gases.</b> It is a rotating, airfoil-based compressor {{in which the}} gas or working fluid principally flows parallel to the axis of rotation, or axially. This differs from other rotating compressors such as centrifugal compressors, axi-centrifugal compressors and mixed-flow compressors where the fluid flow will include a [...] "radial component" [...] through the compressor. The energy level of the fluid increases as it flows through the compressor due to {{the action of the}} rotor blades which exert a torque on the fluid. The stationary blades slow the fluid, converting the circumferential component of flow into pressure. Compressors are typically driven by an electric motor or a steam or a gas turbine.|$|R
50|$|Autogas {{is widely}} used in Russia. In its modern form {{it has been used}} since the 1970s. There are two types of autogas {{equipment}} and autogas stations as well. These are LPG (propane-butane mix) and <b>Pressurised</b> <b>Gas</b> (methane). The main consumer of LPG is commercial transport. <b>Pressurised</b> <b>Gas</b> is losing its positions to LPG and now can be rarely seen on public transport buses.. There are some community supported sources where people post gas station locations on the map. These sources may be used by some travelers going to Russia by car. First limited series of vehicles driven by multifuel including methane has appeared {{in the middle of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|An {{underwater}} firearm is {{a firearm}} {{designed for use}} underwater. They are in the arms inventories of many nations. A common feature of underwater firearms or needleguns is that they fire flechettes or spear-like bolts fired by <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas,</b> instead of standard bullets.|$|E
50|$|The {{group also}} owned TI Creda, a {{manufacturer}} of domestic cookers, and owned TI Chesterfield Cylinders, {{a manufacturer of}} <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> cylinders for companies such as BOC and Air Products: the business was sold and the factory moved from Chesterfield to Sheffield.|$|E
5000|$|The mine, located {{close to}} the border with Russia, {{is owned by the}} state-run Heilongjiang Longmay Mining Holding Group Co., Ltd., which has been open since 1917, and {{produces}} 12 million tons of coal per year, {{making it one of the}} largest and oldest coal mines in the country. The explosion itself, a preliminary investigation concluded, was caused by trapped, <b>pressurised</b> <b>gases</b> underground, caused by poor ventilation in the mine shaft. The blast was powerful enough that it was felt six miles away. Many nearby buildings were damaged, including one next to the mine whose roof was blown off. The director of Hegang General hospital, where the injured were being treated, told Chinese state media that [...] "most of the injured are suffering from compound injuries, such as respiratory injuries, broken bones and gas poisoning".|$|R
40|$|Designed by {{architect}} Philip Viljoen of Steyn and Viljoen, {{the building}} was constructed to provide accommodation to the Departments of Chemistry and Physics and a secure location for the University’s mainframe computer. The building was inaugurated in September 1987 by Dr Anton Rupert, himself a chemist and natural scientist. Great care was taken to ensure adequate electrical and water supply to the building, as well as specialised systems to convey <b>pressurised</b> <b>gasses</b> to laboratories. In 1992 the Camera Obscura was built {{on top of the}} building and has become a popular attraction amongst visitors to the campus. The projection of images of objects and happenings outside the chamber onto a surface in the chamber, and particularly the clarity of the projected image, never ceases to impress. 5 colour digital photos.

40|$|Distribution {{and storage}} of {{liquefied}} <b>pressurised</b> <b>gases</b> {{is a critical}} safety issue, often resulting in a very high individual and societal risk, at least in densely populated zones. Several risk assessments pointed {{out that this is}} mostly due to the possible occurrence of a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVE) of the tank that may be exposed to an intense fire as a consequence of release scenarios. In the present work, a modelling approach is presented for the calculation of fired BLEVE probability. Simplified models were obtained for the estimation of the vessel time to failure with respect to the radiation intensity on the vessel shell. The time to failure was compared to a reference time required for effective mitigation actions and thus related to the escalation probability. The analysis of the effect of protective measures, such thermal insulating coating and pressure relief devices, on the time to failure allowed the identification of the necessary requirements for effective BLEVE prevention...|$|R
50|$|A diving chamber is {{a vessel}} for human occupation, {{which may have}} an {{entrance}} that can be sealed to hold an internal pressure significantly higher than ambient pressure, a <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> system to control the internal pressure, and a supply of breathing gas for the occupants.|$|E
50|$|A long narrow opening {{runs the}} full length of the east elevation. This is covered with steel mesh and shaded by a sloping {{corrugated}} iron awning. An air receiver (a long cylinder for holding <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas)</b> is located beside the building next to this elevation. It is about 6m long.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> is {{injected}} tangentially into a swirl chamber and accelerated {{to a high}} rate of rotation. Due to the conical nozzle {{at the end of the}} tube, only the outer shell of the compressed gas is allowed to escape at that end. The remainder of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced diameter within the outer vortex.|$|E
500|$|The steam {{carriages}} {{were four}} wheeled, [...] long over the buffers. First, {{second and third}} class compartments were available. First class carriages had four compartments, the others five. Lighting was initially provided by burning coal gas held in bags on the roof, later by a <b>pressurised</b> oil <b>gas</b> system. At first they were fitted with a chain brake. This {{was replaced by the}} simple Westinghouse brake and then a fully automatic Westinghouse brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{heart of}} the system is the {{displacer}} units, which are pressurised spheres containing nitrogen gas. These replace the conventional steel springs of a regular suspension design. The means for <b>pressurising</b> the <b>gas</b> in the displacers is done by pre-pressurising a hydraulic fluid, and then connecting the displacer to its neighbour on the other axle. This is unlike the Citroën system, which uses hydraulic fluid continuously pressurised by an engine-driven pump and regulated by a central pressure vessel.|$|R

50|$|As U-Boot Beton® {{is made of}} polypropylene, it is not toxic even if burnt. Moreover,the slab {{will not}} explode due to the {{escaping}} of over <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas</b> from the feet (4 feet for each formwork) that act as safety valves. Tests run at the CSI laboratory have demonstrated that with a cement cover of 3 cm the structure created with U-Boot Beton® is class REI 180.|$|E
50|$|The Yilanè, {{having had}} {{millions}} of years of civilization, have a very advanced society primarily based on a mastery of the biological sciences, especially genetic engineering, so much so that almost every tool and artifact they use is a modified lifeform. Their boats were originally squids, their submarines are enhanced ichthyosaurs (here called uruketos), while their guns are modified monitor lizards which eject projectiles using <b>pressurised</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
50|$|The engine {{illustrated}} in the patent is a vertical single cylinder double acting engine which utilises two rubber gas pumps driven by the crankshaft. One provides the main gas that is mixed with air to power the engine, and the other smaller pump <b>pressurises</b> a <b>gas</b> reservoir {{that is used to}} supply gas to the pilot light. The use of flame ignition within the complex slide mechanism extinguishes the flame at every ignition, which is re-ignited by the pilot. This seemingly complex system was quite successful and was used on several early stationary engines.|$|R
50|$|The steam {{carriages}} were four-wheeled, 29 ft long {{over the}} buffers. First, {{second and third}} class compartments were available. First class carriages had four compartments, the others five. Lighting was initially provided by burning coal gas held in bags on the roof, later by a <b>pressurised</b> oil <b>gas</b> system. At first they were fitted with a chain brake. This {{was replaced by the}} simple Westinghouse brake and then a fully automatic Westinghouse brake. Initially trains were made up of eight carriages, but after 1879 nine became the standard. At the end of 1905 the District replaced 395 carriages with electric multiple units.|$|R
50|$|Many {{training}} {{agencies such}} as PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. If the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the value written on the cylinder by the gas blender, the scuba diver must either recalculate his or her bottom times with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. Under IANTD and ANDI rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by most dive resorts around the world, filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a gas blender log book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the cylinder number, the measured oxygen percent composition, the signature of the receiving diver (who should have personally measured the oxygen partial pressure before taking delivery), and finally a calculation of the maximum operating depth for that fill/cylinder. All of these steps minimize danger but increase complexity of operations (for example, personalized cylinders for each diver must generally be kept track of on dive boats with nitrox, {{which is not the}} case with generic compressed air cylinders).In South Africa, the national standard for handling and filling portable cylinders with <b>pressurised</b> <b>gases</b> (SANS 10019) requires that the cylinder be labelled with a sticker identifying the contents as nitrox, and specifying the oxygen fraction. Similar requirements may apply in other countries.|$|R
