5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc <b>plated)</b> <b>steel,</b> can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E

25|$|With {{their high}} copper content (97%), the {{intrinsic}} value of pre-1992 1p and 2p coins increased with {{the surge in}} metal prices of the mid-2000s, until by 2006 the coins would, if melted down, have been worth about 50% more than their face value. (To do this, however, would be illegal, {{and they would have}} had to be melted in huge quantities, using quite a bit of energy, to achieve significant gain.) In later years, the price of copper fell considerably. Copper <b>plated</b> <b>steel</b> coins were introduced to replace them.|$|E

25|$|The decimal halfpenny (½p), {{introduced}} in 1971, remained in circulation until 1984, {{by which time}} its value had been greatly reduced by inflation. It was not struck, except for collectors' sets, after 1983 (those dated 1984 were struck only as proofs or in Uncirculated Mint Sets) and was demonetised on 31 December 1984. The 50p piece was reduced in size in 1997, following the reduction in size of the 5p in 1990 and the 10p in 1992 (the large versions {{of each of the}} three are now demonetised). The 1p and 2p underwent a compositional change from bronze to <b>plated</b> <b>steel</b> in 1992.

25|$|On 11 November 2004 the Reserve Bank {{announced}} that it proposed to take the 5c coin out of circulation {{and to make the}} 50c, 20c and 10c coins smaller and use <b>plated</b> <b>steel</b> to make them lighter. After a three-month public submission period that ended on 4 February 2005, the Reserve Bank announced on 31 March that it would go ahead with the proposed changes. The changeover period started on 31 July 2006, with the old coins usable until 31 October 2006. The old 50c, 20c, 10c and 5c pieces are now no longer legal tender, but are still redeemable at the Reserve Bank. Prior to the change over these coins were similar, save for the legend and reverse artwork, to international (mainly Commonwealth) coins of the same British-derived sizes, which led to coins from other currencies, particularly older coins, being accepted by vending machines and many retailers.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} work {{vitreous}} enamel, a special class of ceramic-glass material, {{was used as}} a coating for thin <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> The impact behavior of rectangular <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> and coated <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> (enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plate)</b> was studied by means of both experimental tests and numerical analysis. Experimental tests revealed the onset and growth of plate instability in the case of impact both on <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and on enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> The instability was mainly located on the free edges and was particularly evident on the longer side of rectangular plates. The impactor initial energy that caused the instability onset in the case of enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> was about six times higher than the one that induced the instability in the <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> Numerical simulations were performed to better understand and study the experimentally observed instability phenomenon. Four numerical models were developed in order to study the influence of plate thickness and residual stresses acting on the enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> on plate instability. Results of numerical simulation revealed that residual stresses acting on enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plated</b> increased the value of force that caused the instability onset. Further numerical simulations showed that the increase of residual stresses acting on enameled <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> highlighted the values relative to the instability force increase according to a non linear trend...|$|R

2500|$|The German Army {{version of}} the 4.6×30mm {{cartridge}} (DM11 Penetrator) weighs 6.5g and uses a 2g copper <b>plated</b> <b>steel</b> bullet projectile at [...] muzzle velocity. The DM11 Penetrator cartridge is designed for the MP7. The Ultimate Combat can penetrate the NATO CRISAT target at more than 300 meters. This ammunition should combine energy transfer in soft targets and very good penetration. The muzzle velocity V0 and V100 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.141 to 0.150 (BC's are somewhat debatable) making the DM11 projectile aerodynamically more efficient compared to typical service handgun projectiles, but less efficient compared to typical assault rifle projectiles. At the stated effective range of 200m the DM11 projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.25 (425m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ρ=1.225kg/m3).|$|E

2500|$|Another {{especially}} celebrated {{aspect of}} the production was the set, designed by John Bury, who used the work of Karl von Appen and Caspar Neher as his primary visual inspiration. Bury constructed the set primarily from <b>plated</b> <b>steel,</b> even the walls and floors were covered in textured metal, giving the entire stage a cold, metallic appearance. At {{the back of the}} stage was a steel trellis and movable walls of triangular shape covered with riveted plates. T.C. Worlsey commented of the set that [...] "we seem to be claustrophobically caught between two swinging metal wings that crush us from one side then from the other." [...] According to Bury, [...] "this was a period of armour and a period of the sword; they were plays about warfare, about power, about danger [...] This was the image of the plays. We wanted an image rather than a naturalistic setting. We were trying to make a world, a dangerous world, a terrible world, in which all these happenings fit." [...] Bury employed the notion of [...] "selective realism"; using one or two realistic props to emphasise the social dimensions of the narrative. In this case, such realism was manifested by a massive oval shaped iron council table which took up {{a large portion of the}} stage - the constantly changing group of figures who sit at the table visually emphasising the turbulence and political instability of the period. Peter Hall himself wrote of the set, [...] "on the flagged floor of sheet steel tables are daggers, staircases are axe-heads, and doors the traps on scaffolds. Nothing yields: stone walls have lost their seduction and now loom dangerously - steel-clad - to enclose and to imprison. The countryside offers no escape, the danger is still there in the iron foliage of the cruel trees, and, surrounding all, the great steel cage of war." ...|$|E
60|$|You must figure these mighty forms, {{forty feet}} high {{the least of}} them was, {{reclining}} {{on a patch of}} turf that would have seemed a stubble of reeds to a common man. One sat up and chipped earth from his huge boots with an iron girder he grasped in his hand; the second rested on his elbow; the third whittled a pine tree into shape and made a smell of resin in the air. They were clothed not in cloth but in under-garments of woven rope and outer clothes of felted aluminium wire; they were shod with timber and iron, and the links and buttons and belts of their clothing were all of <b>plated</b> <b>steel.</b> The great single-storeyed house they lived in, Egyptian in its massiveness, half built of monstrous blocks of chalk and half excavated from the living rock of the hill, had a front a full hundred feet in height, and beyond, the chimneys and wheels, the cranes and covers of their work sheds rose marvellously against the sky. Through a circular window in the house there was visible a spout from which some white-hot metal dripped and dripped in measured drops into a receptacle out of sight. The place was enclosed and rudely fortified by monstrous banks of earth, backed with steel both over the crests of the Downs above and across the dip of the valley. It needed something of common size to mark the nature of the scale. The train that came rattling from Sevenoaks athwart their vision, and presently plunged into the tunnel out of their sight, looked by contrast with them like some small-sized automatic toy.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} quantitatively {{evaluate}} the shear-bearing capacity of shear connectors of square concrete filled steel tube (CFST), push-out tests on 14 square CFSTs with shear connectors {{have been carried}} out. Among the 14 CFSTs, there are 13 specimens with <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> connectors and one specimen with steel bar connectors. The following factors are investigated to figure out their influences {{on the performance of}} CFSTs, which are the width to thickness ratio of steel tube, thickness of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> length of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> strength of concrete, welding condition of <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> number of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> layer and interlayer spacing. The test results show that the ultimate bearing capacity and the elastic stiffness increase with decreasing width to thickness ratio of the steel tube, and increasing thickness and length of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> With increasing concrete strength, the ultimate bearing capacity also increases. However, the welding condition has no effect on the ultimate bearing capacity. The ultimate bearing capacity of the CFST with double-layer <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> is greater than that with single-layer <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> The ultimate bearing capacity of steel bar type shear connector is 87 % greater than that of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> type shear connector, and the steel bar specimen shows good ductility.
