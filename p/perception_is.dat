5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants. Whether this <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E
5|$|The {{blue and}} red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several {{competing}} theories have been put forth for the {{blue and red}} design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it {{was the idea of}} his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how {{households}} {{form their}} perceptions of consumer price inflation. Using data from the harmonized EU consumer survey, we find that inflation <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> inefficient and highly heterogeneous, yet contemporaneously related to the actual rate of inflation. Consequently, we estimate how often households update their beliefs employing Carroll's (2003) epidemiological model. Our results indicate that inflation <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> generally less responsive to new information than expectations. Unlike studies on expectations, we cannot confirm that a constant fraction of the population updates information every month. Also, the cross-sectional heterogeneity of <b>perceptions</b> <b>is</b> higher than implied by infrequent updating alone...|$|R
5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E

40|$|Several of {{the most}} widely cited measure of {{corruption}} are based, at least in part, upon perceptions of corruption. This has some advantages, not least because <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> potentially more sensitive to facts on the ground than measures such as the number of prosecutions for corruption. Nonetheless, such benefits can only <b>be</b> realised if <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> in fact responding to facts on the ground. If <b>perceptions</b> of corruption <b>are</b> instead based solely upon speculation and personal biases, {{they will not be able}} to provide a useful measure of corruption. This chapter investigates whether <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> able to be sufficiently responsive and nuanced in order to be helpful for the task of measuring corruption. It finds that while <b>perceptions</b> can <b>be</b> swayed by dominant narratives in public life, they are nonetheless able to make some sophisticated discriminations between different types of behaviour...|$|R

Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. Speech perception research has applications in building computer systems that can recognize speech, in improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners, and in foreign-language teaching.|$|E

Anatomical differences between the pathways for touch-position perception and pain-temperature sensation help explain why pain, especially chronic pain, is difficult to manage.|$|R

25|$|The Charvaka {{epistemology}} holds perception as {{the primary}} and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid. Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt. Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect – sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable {{means by which the}} efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.|$|E
40|$|Five {{experiments}} examined circular heading perception with optical flows that {{departed from}} the canonical form. Noncanonicity was achieved through nonrigidity of the environment (Experiments 1 and 2), oscillations of the point of observation (Experiment 3), and the bending of light (Experiments 4 and 5). In Experiments 1 and 2, <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> impaired more by nonrigidity of the ground plane than by nonrigidity of the medium. In Experiment 3, <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> unimpaired by noncanonical flows induced by the bounce and sway of observer locomotion. In Experiments 4 and 5, <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> not impaired when light paths were distorted by a spherical projection, but <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> impaired when they were distorted by a sine function. Results are discussed {{in relation to the}} hypothesis that the information for perceiving heading is the ordinal pattern of optical flow. It has been hypothesized that the visual guidance of locomotion is based on the ambient optic array available at a moving point of observation. When a point of observation displaces relative to the environment so as to sample successive ambient arrays, the optical structure at the poin...|$|R
