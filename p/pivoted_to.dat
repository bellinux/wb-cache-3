5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E

The heat dissipated to the tire {{and the surrounding}} structures, eventually causing a fire. During the attempted emergency landing at Mirabel Airport, the landing gear was extended on short final and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards, the fuselage <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> the left and struck the ground. All 11 occupants were fatally injured.|$|E

500|$|The {{intensity}} of the infantry battle varied considerably along the line. On the coast, the 60th Division made rapid progress advancing some [...] in {{two and a half}} hours, while the attached 5th Light Horse Brigade protecting their right flank, rode north–east towards Tulkarm. By the end of the day, the 60th Division had captured Tulkarm, after a march of [...] On the right the 75th Division fought its way towards the Tabsor defences and Et Tire which they captured, while the 7th (Meerut) Division, on the 75th Division's right, advanced further north of Et Tire, before turning to attack the western Tabsor defences. The 3rd (Lahore) Division, on the right of the 7th (Meerut) Division, advanced rapidly to capture the first line of defences between Bir Adas and the Hadrah road, before turning eastwards to make a flank attack on Jiljulieh and Kalkilieh defences. Meanwhile, the 54th (East Anglian) Division, on the right of the 3rd (Lahore) Division, with the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie on its left, <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> cover the right flank of the 60th, 75th, 7th and 3rd Divisions' advances, despite being strongly opposed.|$|E
500|$|Spurred by {{company-wide}} changes beginning {{late the}} next year and Square Enix's decision to designate a studio to focus on mobile games, Square Enix Montreal <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> mobile game development with an emphasis on the Hitman franchise and tablet computers in June 2013. Patrick Naud became its director. The studio quietly cancelled its work on the Hitman console game, and many employees left to work on AAA titles elsewhere. Those who stayed became vested in the ethos of a smaller studio, and left their siloed specialty areas to work as generalists across specialties, as necessitated by smaller teams. The company spent two weeks designing proposals for mobile Hitman series games, which led to Hitman Go (2014) and [...] (2015). The former began the Go series of highly manicured, turn-based, board game-style puzzle video games, while the latter more closely resembled a traditional mobile game in which players competitively shoot targets through a sniper rifle scope. Though Hitman Go and the subsequent Lara Croft Go (2015, based on the Tomb Raider series) received awards, critical acclaim, and modest sales, Hitman: Sniper became the studio's revenue generator.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of the [...] "basket" [...] of {{individual}} typebars that swung up {{to strike the}} ribbon and page in a traditional typewriter, the Selectric had a type element (frequently called a [...] "typeball", or more informally, a [...] "golf ball") that rotated and <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> the correct position before striking. The type element could be easily changed so as to print different fonts in the same document, resurrecting a capability that had been pioneered by the Blickensderfer typewriter almost 70 years before. The Selectric also replaced the traditional typewriter's moving carriage with a paper roller ("platen") that stayed in position while the typeball and ribbon mechanism moved from side to side.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{aircraft}} {{commonly used}} tailwheels, many aircraft (like {{a number of}} First World War Sopwith aircraft, such as the Camel fighter) were equipped with steerable tailskids, which operate similar to a tailwheel. When the pilot pressed the right rudder pedal — or the right footrest of a [...] "rudder bar" [...] in World War I — the skid <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> the right, creating more drag {{on that side of}} the plane and causing it to turn to the right. While less effective than a steerable wheel, it gave the pilot some control of the direction the craft was moving while taxiing or beginning the takeoff run, before there was enough airflow over the rudder for it to become effective.|$|E
2500|$|The army {{became part}} of the 3rd Belorussian Front for Operation Bagration in June 1944, and {{remained}} with the front until April 1945. On 23 June 1944, at the start of Operation Bagration, {{it was part of the}} army's 84th Rifle Corps. For the initial attack (part of the Vitebsk–Orsha Offensive), the division was to attack alongside the 5th Guards Rifle Corps, break through the German defenses on the line of Bondino and Mosino and capture Starinki. It was then to advance on Trubachi alongside the 5th Guards Rifle Corps, outflanking German troops around Vitebsk. In the initial attack, preceded by a 1-hour artillery barrage at 06:00, the tank-supported 262nd broke through the lines of the demoralized German 197th Infantry Division. By 13:00, the 262nd had pushed the 197th back to the Vitebsk–Orsha rail line south of Vitebsk. The 262nd Rifle Division, advancing on the right of the 84th Corps' 164th Rifle Division, <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> maintain contact with the 158th Rifle Division east of Vitebsk, while the 164th continued pushing the 197th Infantry Division northwest along the railway line.|$|E
2500|$|The P-38 {{is easily}} used. [...] First, the cutting point is <b>pivoted</b> <b>to</b> its 95-degree position, from its stowed, folded position. [...] Then, for a {{right-handed}} user, the P-38 {{is held in}} the right hand by the flat long section, with the cutting point pointing downward {{and away from the}} user, while also hooking the edge of the can through the circular notch located on the flat long section next to the cutting edge. [...] The can is held in the left hand, and the right hand is rotated slightly clockwise, causing the can lid to be punctured. [...] The can is then rotated counter clockwise in the left hand, while the right hand rotates alternatively slightly counterclockwise and slightly clockwise, until the can has been rotated nearly 360 degrees and the lid is nearly free. [...] The lid of the now opened can is lifted, most often with the P-38 cutting edge, and the P-38 is wiped clean, and the cutting point is rotated back to its stowed, folded position; then, the P-38 is returned to its stored location, whether that is dangling on a dog tag chain around one's neck, or in one's pocket if the P-38 is attached to a key ring. [...] Left-handed users simply hold the P-38 in their left hand, with the cutting point aimed towards themselves, while holding the can to be opened in their right hand, while also reversing the sense of the cutting hand movements just described. [...] By tradition, 38 cuts as just described were supposedly required to open a can of C-Rations.|$|E
