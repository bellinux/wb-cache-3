60|$|It was {{the last}} straw. With no fresh air and no food fit to eat, the young captain was desperate, and leaping forward he struck at the Russian captain's nose. His fist went true, and as Barusky {{staggered}} back against the <b>pen</b> <b>door</b> the blood spurted from his nasal organ.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965 the South Alabama Board of Trustees {{selected}} the Jaguar as the University's official mascot {{and during the}} late 1960s, USA housed a live Jaguar on the campus. However, the University later decided against housing a live animal on campus after Mischka, the jaguar, was accidentally set free on the campus after someone {{made the mistake of}} leaving her <b>pen</b> <b>door</b> unlocked.|$|E
5000|$|Bobby, Loor, Alder, and Press {{manage to}} stop the chief miner Rellin from setting the bomb off, and all the Bedoowan and the Novans {{evacuate}} to a field, where the battle between the Milago and the Bedoowan is to take place. Before this, though, Bobby and Loor {{are faced with the}} task of getting rid of the bomb. After waking up some of the quigs, which were in a pen {{off to the side of}} the stadium in which they were presenting the glaze ( [...] and tak), and having Loor open the <b>pen</b> <b>door,</b> the quigs rush out and slaughter some of the men there. Right before Relin set the bomb Uncle Press nails a spear into his arm. Rellin lies there struggling. Uncle Press picks up the bomb to disarm it and then he realizes that the quigs were getting the upper hand. He took desperate measures and threw the switch with some tak into the quig's mouth. It left the quig in little bits. Afterwards, Bobby and Loor use water to liquidate it and spread it across the field. The bomb is gone except for one small ball, which Bobby slips into his pocket. At this point, Figgis the merchant lures Bobby and Loor into the mines, where they find an immense supply of tak. They soon realize that Figgis is really Saint Dane. The real Figgis died when one of his own traps backfired. Disguised as Figgis, Saint Dane sold the tak to the Milago, urging them to rebel against the Bedoowan. At the same time, Saint Dane has disguised himself as Mallos, Queen Kagan's chief adviser, and had turned Bedoowan minds further against their neighbors. The traps that the real Figgis set trap Bobby and Loor with Saint Dane in the mine. Seeing it is the only way out, Bobby throws his small ball of tak at the large supply, which ignites the tak and will cause all of it to explode underground. Saint Dane escapes the impending destruction by using the flume in the mine to go to the territory of Cloral. By sending a high speed wave of water and a giant shark back through the flume, Bobby can't follow. To make matters worse for Bobby, the water knocked Loor against the wall of the cavern knocking her unconscious. Bobby just manages to escape the explosion by pushing a mine cart that held the unconscious Loor into the ocean through a ventilation shaft. When Bobby swims back to the shore and surveys the damage, they find that although there had been lots of destruction because of the explosion, most of the people are still alive, including Uncle Press and Alder. The castle, symbolic of Bedoowan rule over the Milago, falls into the ocean because of the force of the explosion, most of the Milago huts are destroyed, and the glaze mines are forever closed. Thus, the two tribes can use their best strengths to rebuild and improve each other's lives (Milago-farming and building and Bedoowan-engineering and chemistry).|$|E

50|$|Justina Morley {{claimed that}} she started smoking {{marijuana}} {{at the age}} of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists {{at the age of}} 10. Morley had been hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she had <b>penned,</b> on her <b>door.</b> Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley had also been expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.|$|R
6000|$|Upon the {{platform}} at Tunbridge, Pen fumed and fretted until {{the arrival of}} the evening train to London, a full half-hour,--six hours it seemed to him; but even this immense interval was passed, the train arrived, the train sped on, the London lights came in view--a gentleman who forgot his carpet-bag in the train rushed at a cab, and said to the man, [...] "Drive {{as hard as you can}} go to Jermyn Street." [...] The cabman, although a hansom-cabman, said Thank you for the gratuity which was put into his hand, and Pen ran up the stairs of the hotel to Lady Rockminster's apartments. Laura was alone in the drawing-room, reading, with a pale face, by the lamp. The pale face looked up when <b>Pen</b> opened the <b>door.</b> May we follow him? The great moments of life are but moments like the others. Your doom is spoken in a word or two. A single look from the eyes; a mere pressure of the hand may decide it; or of the lips, though they cannot speak.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-six Javanese thin-tail ewes {{in the end}} of late {{pregnancy}} phase {{were set}} out to study the energy and crude protein requirements during the first eight-week of lactation phase. The ewes were <b>penned</b> individually in <b>doors</b> and randomly assigned to a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement, consisting of three levels of energy (low, medium and high) and three levels of crude protein (low, medium and high) diets with four ewes per treatment. The diets were pelleted and offered four times daily in approximately equal amount. Feed intake, nutrient digestibility, body weight and milk production were recorded. Results showed that, total lamb birth weights was not affected, but protein content on the ration treatments significantly altered (P 0. 05), while crude protein content on the ration highly significantly affected (P< 0. 01). Based on data recorded, the energy and protein requirements for ewes during lactation phase are highly significantly depended on ewes’ live weight, milk production and the ratio of energy metabolism and crude protein of the ration. It was concluded that in order to fulfil the crude protein and energy needs of the ewes during lactation phase, the ration given should contain crude protein and energy as much as 16 % (based on dry matter) and 13. 4 MJ/kg dry matter respectively...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} Study, Fingerprints samples from only healthy {{individuals}} {{were collected from}} northern population of India (Punjab) to study the gender differences based on ridge density and minutiae or ridge characteristics. Persons having skin diseases, burnt and amputated fingers {{were excluded from the}} study. The plain as well as rolled fingerprint samples of index and middle finger of both the hands were taken out of which 200 fingerprints belonged to males and remaining 200 were of females. Fingerprints were collected with the help of plain glass plate of 15  cm * 15  cm. Block printer ink (Daler Rowney manufactured) ink was smeared on glass plate {{with the help of a}} roller. The subjects were asked to roll their finger from the radial side (thumb) to the ulnar side (little finger) on the smeared plate and then transferred their finger prints in the same manner onto the specified space on the bond paper (85 gsm). The age of the subject varied from 16 to 18  years. The criteria to choose only index and middle finger for the purpose of gender determination were based on the probability of their occurrence at the scene of crime (Reddy 1975). In most of the cases the index and middle fingerprints are mostly encountered on number of substrates like <b>pen,</b> mobile, screen/covers, <b>doors</b> and window/ window panes etc. and probability of index and middle fingerprints get transferred is much higher than rest of the fingers.|$|R
