40|$|The Function Impact Method (FIM) is a semi-quantitative {{eco-design}} methodology that {{is targeted}} specifically towards {{the early stages}} of the design process. The FIM allows a designer to predict the environmental impacts associated with a new functional embodiment by extrapolating knowledge from Life cycle assessment (LCA) of similar existing designs. LCA however, is associated with substantial sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, the FIM uses a subjective weighting scheme for representing function-structure affinities. In the authors ’ previous work, a Monte-Carlo variation analysis was used to estimate sensitivity of the input data and estimating the preferred redesign strategy. This paper proposes a method to formalize the input uncertainties in the FIM by modeling the uncertainties present in the results of the LCA’s and the involved function-structure affinities using Info-gap decision theory. The desirability of redesigning a particular function based on the magnitude of its function-connectivity and eco-impact is estimated, and a decision making methodology based on robust satisficing is discussed. This method is applied for making robust redesign decisions with regards to re-designing a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> for sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. In many occupations, {{exposure}} to hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) over {{a prolonged period}} causes various disorders involving the vascular, neural and musculoskeletal systems, collectively known as the hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). It is a complex and potentially disabling chronic disorder of the upper extremities, especially of the hands. Numbness, tingling, reduced tactile discrimination, and impaired manipulative dexterity are often reported by workers exposed to HTV. The precise pathophysiological mechanism responsible for vascular injuries in HAVS {{has not yet been}} fully clarified; it seems to be multifactorial and highly complex. Interaction of neural signals, hormones, mediators and changes in the blood vessel itself appear to {{contribute to the development of}} such vascular injuries. This study aims to assess the risk of the hand-transmitted vibration exposure during <b>pneumatic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> operation in a rock drill repair and maintenance workshop at a South African platinum mine. A total of 8 workers working on a day to day basis with impact wrenches were available for this study. For each of the workers a control (not exposed to vibration) was selected on the basis of gender, ethnic group, smoking habits, age and body mass index (BMI). Grip force, dexterity and hand-eye co-ordination were tested on the workers and control group before and after work. Finger systolic blood pressure (FSBP) was also measured after cold provocation of the worker and control groups. Results have shown astatistically significant difference between the two groups with respect coordination, dexterity and FSBP after cold provocation. Vibration measurements shows three workers had values above the suggested ELV of 5 m/s² for an eight hour A (8) workday. With regards to dexterity, workers were capable to manipulate small objects better with their dominant right (vibration exposed) hand after work than before work. In contrast, it seems that the number of pegs correctly inserted by the controls is not uniformly affected by their 8 hour workday. The worker group showed a greater grip force than that of the control group, both before and after work. There was a statistically significant difference between the control and worker group with respect to the number of mistakes during the mirror trace and the time to complete this test only for the right hand. The difference in FSBP after cold provocation between the control and worker group observed is of medium importance when compared with effect sizes, however, there was no statistical significant difference. In this study, it was very difficult to make valid conclusions due to the limitations of a small sample size. A longitudinal study should be conducted preferably using newly appointed workers with no prior {{exposure to}} vibration and a sufficient control group to eliminate the effect other confounding variables such as general working conditions.

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket <b>wrenches</b> include <b>pneumatic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>wrench</b> - An {{air powered}} socket wrench that {{delivers}} high torque output by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft. Nearly every auto body or mechanic shop {{will have an}} air compressor and <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> to loosen and tighten lug nuts on wheels. [...] Most major tool manufacturers carry an air <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> including DeWalt, Ingersoll, and Craftsman.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or electric <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> or <b>impact</b> driver {{to deliver the}} amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the socket attached to the <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the <b>impact</b> <b>wrench's</b> internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. <b>Impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet wrench tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench.</b> <b>Impact</b> sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> <b>impact</b> sockets can be used with hand socket wrenches and other hand drivers.|$|R

5000|$|Compressed air is {{the most}} common power source for <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> {{providing}} a low-cost design with the best power-to-weight ratio. A simple vane motor is almost always used, usually with four to seven vanes, and various lubrication systems, the most common of which uses oiled air, while others may include special oil passages routed to the parts that need it and a separate, sealed oil system for the hammer assembly. Most <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> drive the hammer directly from the motor, giving it fast action when the fastener requires only low torque. Other designs use a gear reduction system before the hammer mechanism, most often a single-stage planetary gearset usually with a heavier hammer, delivering a more constant speed and higher [...] "spin" [...] torque. Electric <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> are available, either mains powered, or for automotive use, 12-volt, 18-volt or 24-volt DC-powered. Recently, cordless electric <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> have become common, although typically their power outputs are significantly lower than corded electric or air-powered equivalents. Some industrial tools are hydraulically powered, using high-speed hydraulic motors, and are used in some heavy equipment repair shops, large construction sites, and other areas where a suitable hydraulic supply is available. Hydraulic <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> have the advantage of high power-to-weight ratio.|$|R

Sold for several years into industrial markets, CP torque <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> were introduced in the 1970s into the automotive market. In 1987, Chicago Pneumatic became part of the Swedish conglomerate Atlas Copco. During 1988, more new products were launched {{than at any time since}} the late '70s, such as screwdrivers, assembly tools and new ratchet wrenches. The following year, the current logo was designed and adopted.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of power}} wrench is {{designed}} more for speed and less for torque. If {{high levels of}} torque are desired an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> should be used.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered socket wrenches which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety.

50|$|Lug nuts may {{be removed}} using a lug, socket or <b>impact</b> <b>wrench.</b> If the wheel {{is to be}} removed then an {{automotive}} jack to raise the vehicle and some wheel chocks would be used as well. Wheels that have hubcaps or hub covers need these removed beforehand, typically with a screwdriver, flatbar, or prybar. Lug nuts {{can be difficult to}} remove, as they may become frozen to the wheel stud. In such cases a breaker bar or repeated blows from an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> can be used to free them. Alternating between tightening and loosening can free especially stubborn lug nuts.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the output}} of an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench.</b> Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|R
50|$|A {{power wrench}} is type of wrench that {{is powered by}} other means than human force. A typical power source is {{compressed}} air. There are two main types of power wrenches: <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> and air ratchet wrenches or pneumatic ratchet wrenches.|$|R
5000|$|Pneumatic {{torque wrench}} - Operates like the torque {{multiplier}} but is mated to a pneumatic air motor. It {{is essentially a}} mix of the compressed air powered <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> and the traditionally hand operated torque multiplier, delivering aspects of both tools.|$|R
50|$|Sockets and {{extensions}} for <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{are made}} of high tensile metal, as any spring effect will greatly reduce the torque available at the fastener. Even so, {{the use of multiple}} extensions, universal joints, and so forth will weaken the impacts, and the operator needs to minimize their use. Using non-impact sockets or accessories with an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> will often result in bending, fracturing, or otherwise damaging the accessory, as most are not capable of withstanding the sudden high torque of an impact tool, and can result in stripping the head on the fastener. Non-impact sockets and accessories {{are made of}} a harder more brittle metal. Safety glasses should always be worn when working with impact tools, as the strong impacts can generate high-speed shrapnel if a socket, accessory, or fastener fails.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> are {{available}} in all sizes and in several styles, depending on the application. ¼" [...] drive wrenches are commonly available in both inline (the user holds the tool like a screwdriver, with the output on the end) and pistol grip (the user holds a handle which is {{at right angles to}} the output) forms, and less commonly in an angle drive, which is similar to an inline tool but with a set of bevel gears to rotate the output 90°. ⅜" [...] impacts are most commonly available in pistol grip form and a special inline form known as a [...] "butterfly" [...] wrench, which has a large, flat throttle paddle {{on the side of the}} tool which may be tilted to one side or the other to control the direction of rotation, rather than using a separate reversing control, and shaped to allow access into tight areas. Regular inline and angle ⅜" [...] drive <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> are uncommon, but available. ½" [...] drive units are virtually only available in pistol grip form, with any inline type being virtually impossible to obtain, due to the increased torque transmitted back to the user and the greater weight of the tool requiring the larger handle. ¾" [...] drive <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> are again essentially only available in pistol grip form. 1" [...] drive tools {{are available}} in both pistol grip and [...] "D handle" [...] inline, where the back of the tool has an enclosed handle for the user to hold. Both forms often also incorporate a side handle, allowing both hands to hold the tool at once. 1¼" [...] and larger wrenches are usually available in [...] "T handle" [...] form, with two large handles on either side of the tool body, allowing for maximum torque to be applied to the user, and giving the best control of the tool. Very large <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> (up to several hundred thousand foot-pounds of torque) usually incorporate eyelets in their design, allowing them to be suspended from a crane, lift, or other device, since their weight is often more than a person can move. A recent design combines an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> and an air ratchet, often called a [...] "reactionless air ratchet" [...] by the manufacturers, incorporating an impact assembly before the ratchet assembly. Such a design allows very high output torques with minimal effort on the operator, and prevents the common injury of slamming one's knuckles into some part of the equipment when the fastener tightens down and the torque suddenly increases. Specialty designs are available for certain applications, such as removing crankshaft pulleys without removing the radiator in a vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{methods are}} used to attach the socket or {{accessory}} to the anvil, such as a spring-loaded pin that snaps into a matching hole in the socket, preventing the socket being removed until an object is used to depress the pin, a hog ring which holds the socket by friction or by snapping into indents machined into the socket, and a through-hole, where a pin is inserted completely through the socket and anvil, locking the socket on. Hog rings are used on most smaller tools, with though-hole used only on larger <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> typically ¾" [...] drive or greater. Pin retainers used to be more common, but seem to be being replaced by hog rings on most tools, {{despite the lack of}} a positive lock. ¼" [...] female hex drive is becoming increasingly popular for small <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> especially cordless electric versions, allowing them to fit standard screwdriver tips rather than sockets.|$|R
50|$|An <b>impact</b> socket <b>wrench</b> is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool with {{a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an <b>Impact</b> <b>wrench</b> or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection).

40|$|In the {{interest}} of providing more effective evaluations of <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> vibration exposures {{and the development of}} improved methods for measuring vibration emissions produced by these tools, this study focused on three variables: acceleration measured at the tool surface, vibration exposure duration per test trial, and the amount of torque required to unseat the nuts following a test trial. For this evaluation, six experienced male <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> operators used three samples each of five <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> models (four <b>pneumatic</b> models and one battery-powered model) in a simulated work task. The test setup and procedures were based on those provided by an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee overseeing the revision of ISO 8662 - 7. The work task involved the seating of 10 nuts onto 10 bolts mounted on steel plates. The results indicate that acceleration magnitudes vary not only by tool type but also by individual tools within a type. Thus, evaluators are cautioned against drawing conclusions based on small numbers of tools and/or tool operators. Appropriate sam-ple sizes are suggested. It was further noted that evaluators could draw different conclusions if tool assessments are based on ISO-weighted acceleration as opposed to unweighted accel-eration. As expected, vibration exposure durations varied by tool type and by test subject; duration means varied more for study participants than they did for tool types. For the 12 pneumatic tools evaluated in this study, torque varied directly with tool handle acceleration. Therefore, in order to reduce vibration exposure, tools should be selected and adjusted so that they produce no more than the needed torque for the task at hand...|$|R
