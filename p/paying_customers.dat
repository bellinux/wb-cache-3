5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked <b>paying</b> <b>customers</b> from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without <b>paying</b> <b>customers.</b> The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations would be based on their own resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by the CAA, who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E

25|$|XCOR Aerospace was {{developing}} a suborbital vehicle called Lynx until development was halted in May 2016. The Lynx will {{take off from}} a runway under rocket power. Unlike SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, Lynx will not require a mothership. Lynx is designed for rapid turnaround, which will enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx has fewer seats than SpaceShipTwo, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expect to roll out the first Lynx prototype and begin flight tests in 2015. It was hoped that Lynx would carry <b>paying</b> <b>customers</b> {{before the end of}} 2016.|$|E
25|$|Medicare is a {{publicly}} funded {{universal health care}} system in Australia.

Residents are entitled to subsidised treatment from medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a Medicare provider number, and can also obtain free treatment in public hospitals. The plan was introduced in 1975 by the Whitlam Government as Medibank, and was limited to <b>paying</b> <b>customers</b> only in 1976 by the Fraser Government.

Though the American League owners {{appeared}} to favor the Denver deal, it fell through when the city of Oakland and Alameda County refused to release the A's from their lease. At the time, the Oakland Raiders were threatening to move to Los Angeles, and city and county officials were not willing to lose Oakland's status as a big-league city in its own right.

25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, <b>paying</b> <b>customers</b> at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) {{was formed}} {{at a meeting}} on 25 January 1948 in Bordeaux. The 1947–48 Northern Rugby Football League season's Challenge Cup Final was the first rugby league match to be televised. All spectator sports in the United Kingdom experienced a surge in interest {{in the years following}} the end of World War II and rugby league boomed. Large crowds came to be expected as the norm for a period of around 20 years. The total crowds for the British season hit a record in 1949–50, when over 69.8million <b>paying</b> <b>customers</b> attended all matches. On Saturday 10 November 1951 the first televised international rugby league match was broadcast from Station Road, Swinton, where Great Britain met New Zealand in the second Test of that 1951 series.|$|E

As part of disclosure for its public offering, Porter disclosed that from its startup in 2006 until May 2010, Porter lost $44.5 million.

The restaurant becomes a huge success among handicapped customers, but Peter is disappointed that {{what was supposed to be}} a cool restaurant has become a [...] "cafeteria at the veterans hospital," [...] and did not want to take the profits for granted. Angered, Peter bans them from entering with a [...] "no shirt, no shoes, no legs, no service" [...] policy.

Stewie eventually takes matters into his own hands and defeats CrippleTron, which falls on Peter, breaking one of his legs. After being taken to the hospital, Peter needs to use a wheelchair for two weeks while his broken leg heals. Peter apologizes to Joe, who accepts his apology on the basis that he is glad to see Peter understand the difficulties of being disabled and that he does not want to continue holding a grudge against Peter. The two make amends, and things go back to the way they were and Peter closes down the restaurant.|$|E
