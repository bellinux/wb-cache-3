5000|$|In stage lighting, sealed <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are often}} used. A common size, {{also used in}} rock concerts, as well as outdoor {{architectural}} lighting, is the parabolic aluminized reflector 64 (PAR64). PAR64 sealed <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> are typically available with 250, 500 or 1000 watt power ratings. The fixtures that such sealed beam lights go into are called [...] "PAR cans". Beam spreads are designated as FL (flood), SP (spot), NSP (narrow spot), and VNSP (very narrow spot), as stamped {{on the back of}} the lamp's reflector.|$|R

50|$|The {{light source}} was two stacks of sealed <b>beam</b> <b>lamps,</b> {{installed}} on a revolving table. It had {{red and green}} sectors. While the light itself was fully automatic, the station was manned due to the signal station. Four houses were constructed outside the station to accommodate the staff.|$|R
5000|$|... : A small lamp {{located on}} his forehead, which mainly {{functions}} {{to launch the}} Emerium Ray. Unlike Ultraman and other Ultra Warriors succeeding him, Seven does not bounded to the three-minute rule, due to his Protector's function of constantly absorbing sunlights. The <b>Beam</b> <b>Lamp</b> only flashes when Seven is in critical danger or had his energy depleted, such as in episode 25 after a long exposure to cold temperature. When having his energy recharged by another Ultra Warrior, the donated energy {{would go to the}} <b>Beam</b> <b>Lamp</b> instead in place of his lack of Color Timer. The reason he lacked the Color Timer is due to his early job as an observer with no combat purpose, hence he was devoid from a specialized surgery to install said device.|$|R

Halogen sealed beam headlamps appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of sealed beam construction; eventually halogen sealed beams came to dominate the sealed <b>beam</b> <b>lamp</b> market.|$|R
