25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E
25|$|As {{illustrated}} {{in the use of}} the thermostat above, all of the power for the control system is provided by a thermopile which is a combination of many stacked thermocouples, heated by the <b>pilot</b> <b>light.</b> The thermopile produces sufficient electrical power to drive a low-power gas valve, which under control of one or more thermostat switches, in turn controls the input of fuel to the burner.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the 1944 gasser {{incidents}} occurred at a house on Grant Ave., Mattoon, on August 31, 1944. Urban Raef was awakened during {{the early hours of}} the morning by a strange odor. He felt nauseated and weak, and suffered from a fit of vomiting. Suspecting that he was suffering from domestic gas poisoning, Raef's wife tried to check the kitchen stove to see if there was a problem with the <b>pilot</b> <b>light,</b> but found that she was partially paralyzed and unable to leave her bed.|$|E

25|$|Some CFLs will flash {{every few}} seconds even when the room light switch is off. This caused by {{a small amount of}} current {{bypassing}} the switch either through a switch <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> or through the capacitance of the two conductor cable connected between the switch and the CFL or the capacitance between this cable and other mains wiring. A few tens of microamps of current is enough to charge the storage in the CFL power supply up to a voltage sufficient for the CFL to light briefly, discharging the storage and starting the process again.|$|E
25|$|Natural gas and propane supply pipes to {{structures}} often prove especially dangerous {{during and}} after earthquakes. Should a building move from its foundation or fall due to cripple wall collapse, the ductile iron pipes transporting the gas within the structure may be broken, typically {{at the location of}} threaded joints. The gas may then still be provided to the pressure regulator from higher pressure lines and so continue to flow in substantial quantities; it may then be ignited by a nearby source such as a lit <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> or arcing electrical connection.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrical}} contacts may control the power directly (as {{in a household}} iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a relay or the supply of natural gas or fuel oil through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a thermocouple that is heated by a <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas clothes dryers and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic ignitor, either a resistance heater or an electrically powered spark generating device.|$|E
50|$|The sudden {{swell of}} gas rushed into {{businesses}} and residences, increasing {{the size of}} <b>pilot</b> <b>lights</b> {{to as much as}} a foot high. A number of fires started as a result and the second floor of one building in the Central Square area exploded.|$|R
50|$|Common {{applications}} include household water heaters, {{central heating}} systems, fireplaces, flamethrowers, and hot air balloons.

50|$|In {{domestic}} heating systems with pilot lights {{it has been}} estimated that half of the total energy usage is from the <b>pilot</b> <b>light,</b> with each <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> on average using between 70 and 500 watts of gas power (between 8 and 16 gigajoules/year). The heat from a <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> in many appliances (furnaces, space heaters, water heaters) is generally released in the same chamber as the primary burner.The energy loss is much smaller for pilot lights in space heaters than other products, because space heaters heat a smaller enclosed space and contribute more significantly to heating the room. The appliance efficiency of a gas fired balanced flue local space heater in <b>pilot</b> <b>light</b> mode is almost equal with the appliance efficiency measured at the reduced power of the appliance, which efficiency is between 65 - 95% based on the low calorific value of the consumed gas, making part of the pilot lights energy consumption into a useful heat.|$|E
