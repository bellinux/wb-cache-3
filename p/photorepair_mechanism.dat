40|$|During {{the last}} 100 years, the neuston {{bacterium}} Nevskia ramosa {{has been described}} several times. This bacterium forms conspicuous rosette-like microcolonies at the air-water interface. In this study, pure cultures of Nevskia ramosa were obtained for the first time, from a bog lake (strain Soe 1, DSMZ 11499 T) and a freshwater ditch (strain OL 1, DSMZ 11500). The isolates showed special adaptations {{to life in the}} epineuston. They formed hydrophobic surface films with a dull appearance. N. ramosa is sensitive to UV radiation but revealed a very effective <b>photorepair</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Exposure to light at a wavelength of 350 nm after UV treatment raised the number of surviving cells by several orders of magnitude. The isolates grew with a broad range of organic substrates. Surface films were formed only in the absence of combined nitrogen; however, nitrogenase activity was not detected. It appears that during growth at the air-water interface the cells benefit from trapping ammonia from the air. The G+C content of the DNA was 67. 8 and 69. 0 mol% for strains Soe 1 and OL 1, respectively. The slight difference was confirmed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR. The 16 S rRNA sequences revealed 99. 2 % similarity. Thus, both isolates belong to the same species. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that Nevskia {{is a member of the}} gamma-subclass Proteobacteria that has no known close relatives...|$|E
40|$|Effects of ultraviolet-B {{radiation}} on the photosynthesis of seagrasses (Halophila engelmanni Aschers, Halodule wrightii Aschers, and Syringodium filiforme KÃ¼tz) were examined. The intrinsic {{tolerance of}} each seagrass to ultraviolet-B, {{the presence and}} effectiveness of <b>photorepair</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to ultraviolet-B-induced photosynthetic inhibition, {{and the role of}} epiphytic growth as a shield from ultraviolet-B were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Pyrimidine dimers are {{the major}} photoproducts {{produced}} in cellular DNA upon UV irradiation. In Escherichia coli there are dark and <b>photorepair</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that eliminate the dimers from DNA and prevent their lethal and mutagenic effects. To determine whether these repair mechanisms act cooperatively or competitively in repairing DNA, we investigated the effects upon one another of DNA photolyase, which mediates photorepair, and uvrABC excision nuclease, an enzyme complex of the uvrABC gene products, which catalyzes nucleotide excision repair. We found that photolyase stimulates the removal of pyrimidine dimers but not other DNA adducts by uvrABC excision nuclease. The two subunits of uvrABC excision nuclease, the uvrA and uvrB proteins which together bind to the dimer region of DNA, {{had no effect on}} the activity of photolyase. T 4 endonuclease V, which like photolyase is specific for pyrimidine dimers, was inhibited by photolyase, suggesting that these two proteins recognize the same or similar chemical structures in UV-irradiated DNA that are different from those recognized by uvrABC excision nuclease...|$|R
