There are 115 preset SmartArt graphics layout templates in categories such as list, <b>process,</b> <b>cycle,</b> and hierarchy. When an instance of a SmartArt is inserted, a Text Pane appears next to it to guide the user through entering text in the hierarchical levels. Each SmartArt graphic, based on its design, maps the text outline, automatically resized for best fit, onto the graphic. There are a number of [...] "quick styles" [...] for each graphic that apply largely different 3D effects to the graphic, and the graphic's shapes and text can be formatted through shape styles and WordArt styles. In addition, SmartArt graphics change their colors, fonts, and effects to match the document's theme.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{separation}} between wire guiding and rotation of the component to be wound, the configuration of product and wire guiding can be duplicated in the linear winding technology. Therefore, it is possible, e.g., to wind onto 20 spindles simultaneously. This makes the linear winding method a very efficient process since the cycle time for producing a component results from the quotient of the winding <b>process</b> <b>cycle</b> time {{and the number of}} used spindles. The linear winding technology is often applied efficiently where low-mass coil bodies have to be wound.|$|E

This thesis revealed there are various intelligence <b>cycle</b> <b>process</b> models used by the USIC and taught to the National Network. Given the numerous different training entities and varied intelligence <b>cycle</b> <b>process</b> models, challenges exist with providing a well-defined training program that ensures consistent and clear intelligence <b>cycle</b> <b>process</b> model employment. Finally, this thesis offers an overview pertinent to researchers and/or practitioners regarding the viability of employing the intelligence <b>cycle</b> <b>process</b> model as the principle guide for domestic intelligence activities. This thesis employed a qualitative research method that analyzed and interpreted publicly available academic and policy information gathered from government and nongovernment institutions regarding the conceptual and practical intelligence <b>cycle</b> <b>process</b> model narratives. A case study analysis was conducted of the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombing as a platform to discuss the active and effective employment of the intelligence <b>cycle</b> <b>process</b> model by the National Network. The principal conclusion offers while literature clearly agrees the intelligence <b>cycle</b> <b>process</b> model is a cyclical structure of actions, literature also finds there are common themes suggesting the intelligence cycle does not sufficiently describe how the intelligence process works at the operational stages of domestic intelligence activities within the National Network.

40|$|AbstractConsider <b>processes</b> {{split into}} <b>cycles</b> by a {{sequence}} of random times (called points). The standard Palm relationship between stationary <b>processes</b> with <b>cycles</b> and <b>processes</b> with stationary <b>cycles</b> is produced in two transparent steps: length-biasing and re-centring. It has the following standard intuitive interpretation: the <b>process</b> with stationary <b>cycles</b> behaves like the stationary one conditioned on a point at time zero. A less known modification of this relationship is produced by conditioning on the invariant σ-algebra before length-biasing. It has the following intuitive interpretation: the stationary process behaves like the cycle-stationary one centred at a time chosen at random on the line. The present approach leads to strong conditioning, limit and coupling results motivating these interpretations...|$|R
