The purpose is to develop the smelting process of high-tin bronzes in the scrap and in the wastes in the copper alloys {{for the production of}} shape castings with the high operation conditions for the alloy level in the primary metals. The charge compositions on the basis of scrap in the copper alloys for the smelting of high-tin bronzes have been worked out; the smelting process has been developed with regard to the metallurgical distinctions; the quantitative characteristics of isotropy of Br 010 C 10 and Br 010 F 1 casting bronzes have been obtained; the influence of calcium and of natrium in the content from 0. 005 to 0. 1 % on the melt quality and on the properties <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> bronzes has been explored. The range <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> <b>tin</b> bronzes has been broadened; the expenses of initial charge materials have been decreased: the criteria of quality assessment <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> bronzes according to the alloying element content and according to the impurity content have been determined.

Fruit processing, manufactory of compotes, manufactory of metal packaging products, corrosion of cans, chemical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in food, its potential toxicity, {{possibilities for the}} determination <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in food and characterization of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry are described in theoretical part. In experimental part, ICP-OES technique was firstly optimized and then 28 different compotes purchased at common stores were analysed. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> was determined only in fruit juice due to the easier sample preparation, even though quantity <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> in the solid part and in the juice can differ.

5000|$|There is {{no record}} <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> mining in Domesday Book, {{possibly}} because the rights were Crown property.

5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the use <b>of</b> <b>tin</b> oxide, it is mainly viewed as a slip layer between the glaze and ceramic body.
