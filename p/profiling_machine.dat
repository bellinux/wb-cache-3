Current {{methods for}} {{measuring}} Globoidal cam exist these problems: difficulty of measurement of <b>profile</b> <b>machining</b> error, heavy dependency on expensive measuring equipment and low measuring efficiency. In order to solve them, this paper established a high efficient virtual measuring method for globoidal cam machining errors. Based on virtual measuring theory and globoidal cam space engagement theory, and {{by taking the}} three-dimensional machining simulation models of the globoidal cam profile as the measured object, the virtual gauge head can do measurement along the planned measuring path. The machining error calculation method was determined according {{to the degree of}} geometric interference between virtual gauge head and the surface of machined models. And a virtual measuring system on UG platform for globoidal cam <b>profile</b> <b>machining</b> errors was built by use of Visual C++ 6. 0 and UG/Open API secondary development tools. Finally, a virtual measuring experiment was performed for the two kind of machining simulation models generated by generating method and one-side machining method. The experimental results show that the high efficient virtual measuring method for globoidal cam machining error is correct and the virtual measuring system is reliable. On the one hand, an effective method is provided to achieve an efficient, low-cost measurement for globoidal cam <b>profile</b> <b>machining</b> errors in this paper.

40|$|The use of {{computers}} to interpret psychological tests is a 2 ̆ 2 hot 2 ̆ 2 topic, both within psychology and without. It is hot {{in the sense of}} giving rise to an increasing number of books and articles (e. g., Butcher, 1985, 1987; Eyde, 1987; Krug, 1987). It is hot in the sense of giving rise to an ever-increasing number of business enterprises (compare any recent APA Monitor with an issue from 1981). It is hot in the sense of capturing the attention of the news media (e. g., Petterson, 1983). And it is hot in the sense of giving rise to increasing controversy within psychology itself. In a Science editorial Matarazzo (1983) expressed concern lest computer-based test interpretations (CBTIs) {{fall into the hands of}} unqualified users, his bottom line being: 2 ̆ 2 Until more research establishes that the validity of application of these computer products by a health practitioner is not dependent on the practitioner 2 ̆ 7 s experience and training in psychometric science, such automated consultations should be restricted to [...] . qualified user groups. 2 ̆ 2 Matarazzo (1985, 1986) has continued to write in that same vein, causing others to take up the cudgels to defend CBTI (Ben-Porath 2 ̆ 6 Butcher, 1986; Fowler 2 ̆ 6 Butcher, 1986; Murphy, 1987). Lanyon (1984) in his chapter on personality assessment in the Annual Review of Psychology, indicated that he was concerned by the proliferation of CBTI systems: 2 ̆ 2 There is a real danger that the few satisfactory services will be squeezed out by the many unsatisfactory ones, since the consumer professionals are generally unable to discriminate among them [...] 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 [...] . lack of demonstrated program validity has now become the norm 2 ̆ 2 (p. 690). Finally the Subcommittee on Tests and Assessment of the American Psychological Association (APA) Committee on Professional Standards and the APA Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment have developed standards for the area (American Psychological Association, 1986). I published an article describing attempts to establish the validity of CBTIs and made some suggestions regarding the shape future attempts might take (Moreland, 1985). The heat generated by the debate over CBTI seems not to have dissipated; however, some light seems to have been shed on the field since I was writing in 1984. In view of all this, a revision and expansion of my earlier efforts seems timely. SOME HISTORY The use of machines to process psychological test data is not a recent innovation (Fowler, 1985). A progression from hand scoring materials through a variety of mechanical and electronic 2 ̆ 2 scoring machines 2 ̆ 2 to the digital computer, has freed successive generations of beleaguered secretaries and graduate students from laborious hand scoring of objective tests. The first information concerning scoring machines for the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB) appeared in 1930 (Campbell, 1971). These initial machines were very cumbersome, involving the use of 1, 260 Hollerith cards to score each protocol. In 1946, Elmer Hankes, a Minneapolis engineer, built the analogue computer that was the first automatic scoring and <b>profiling</b> <b>machine</b> for the SVIB (Campbell, 1971). A year later, he adapted the same technology to the scoring of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) (Dahlstrom, Welsh, 2 ̆ 6 Dahlstrom, 1972). In the mid 1950 s, E. F. Lindquist 2 ̆ 7 s Measurement Research Center in Iowa City began to use optical (answer sheet) scanning devices instead of card-based scoring equipment. In 1962, National Computer Systems linked an optical scanner with a digital computer and began scoring both the SVIB and the MMPI (Campbell, 1971; Dahlstrom et aI., 1972). Most automated test scoring still employs optical scanning/ digital computer technology and the number and types of tests scored by this method have grown exponentially during the last three decades. Though automated scoring is most easily accomplished for objective tests with a limited number of response alternatives, sophisticated computer programs have also been developed to score the narrative responses elicited by projective techniques (e. g., Gorham, 1967). Prior to the advent of these programs, extensive training, if not professional expertise, was required to score projective tests. Similar programs have also been developed to evaluate other types of complex verbal productions (e. g., Tucker 2 ̆ 6 Rosenberg, 1980). In addition to keeping nerves from becoming frayed, automated scoring frees psychologists to spend more time in other functions, such as psychotherapy, where computer technology is not so advanced (see, however, Colby, 1980). It also enables more individuals to undergo psychological assessment. Finally, though not completely immune from the slings and arrows of human imperfections (e. g., Fowler 2 ̆ 6 Coyle, 1968; Grayson 2 ̆ 6 Backer, 1972; Weigel 2 ̆ 6 Phillips, 1967), computer scoring appears to be more reliable than that done solely by humans (Greene, 1980, pp. 25 - 26; Klett, Schaefer, 2 ̆ 6 Plemel, 1985). A computer, once correctly programmed, will apply scoring rules with slavish consistency, whereas fatigue and other human frailties may render the psychologist, graduate student, or secretary inconsistent in the application of even the most objective scoring rules (Kleinmuntz, 1969) ...|$|E

It is based on the measure of the material removal (MR) and on the assumptions that no plastic deformation and cutting of peak take place. In order to obtain these information, a morphological procedure has been developed based on the finding of a representative peak of the profile. By this way, it is possible to overcome the common problem of repositioning the instrument on a specific point of the surface, especially if an action takes place. The measurements taken on specimens machined in different conditions satisfied the assumptions and confirmed the capability of the model to predict roughness attainable. An interesting result has been the constant MR per working time. The analysis has been carried out by means of statistical approach demonstrating the reliability of the model.

Parts with high quality requirements are manufactured by broaching, which can be influenced by different factors. One of them is vibration caused by process-machine-interactions. Such vibrations can easily be investigated with external broaching, where these vibrations result in varying process forces and wavily <b>profiled</b> <b>machining</b> surfaces. This paper presents a 2 D FEM-simulation approach for the prediction of surface rough-ness generated by broaching. In the simulation model, the solid machine structure that consists {{of a large number}} of machine parts is realized by using elements representing the stiffness and the dynamic properties of the machine structure. Thus, it is possible to avoid high calculation times. The broach is implemented as an elastic body and the resulting process forces are realized by an analytical model that considers the process parameters cutting thickness, cutting velocity and rake angle. These process parameters are calculated for each increment, which allows determining the resulting process forces and applying them onto the teeth. Finally, the presented simulation approach for the prediction of the surface roughness generated by broaching is validated by means of experiments.

Within the paper, a real case study related to roundness profiles of mechanical components is used as reference. In particular, functional PCA is applied to the set of real profile data to derive the significant PCs and the corresponding eigenfunctions.
