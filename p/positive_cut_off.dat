40|$|Immunohistochemistry is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} assessment of markers for breast cancer prognosis. Semiquantitation is frequently desirable but, other than by the use of image analysis, the approaches currently in use are cumbersome. The most common method used is the H-score which takes into consideration the staining intensity in conjunction with the percentage of cells staining positively in breast carcinoma tissue. A "quickscore" has been developed which dispenses with the need to count individual cells. The quantitative biochemical Abbott enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the Dako immunohistochemical assay (IHA) incorporating a semiquantitative H-score, have been used as standards against which the IHA quickscore for the semiquantitation of oestrogen receptor expression was tested. A good correlation was found between the quickscore and the EIA, which was as good as that between the H-score and EIA. The quickscore is a valid approach and there is no advantage in using the more rigorous H-score. A <b>positive</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> quickscore of > or = 3 has been suggested...|$|E
40|$|Nandrolone, an {{anabolic}} steroid, is {{used for}} the treatment of several diseases and is available in various pharmaceutical formulations. The most widely used pharmaceutical formulation is Deca-Durabolin (R), but other products, such as Keratyl (R) eye drops solution, are also currently administered. Nandrolone {{is one of the most}} abused anabolic steroid in sports. Analyses for this anabolic steroid according to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) protocol are based on the identification of the nandrolone two main urinary metabolites which, in humans, are glucuronides of 19 -norandrosterone and 19 -noretiocholanolone. A <b>positive</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> limit of 2 ng/mL has been set by the anti-doping code for the first metabolite, 19 -norandrosterone. In this preliminary study, an eye drops solution (Keratyl (R)) containing a therapeutic dose of a nandrolone sodium sulphate was administered to several male volunteers during 3 days and urines were collected during 3 weeks. Surprisingly, contrary to all expectations, the urinary concentrations measured in urines reached 450 ng/mL and 70 ng/mL for norandrosterone and noretiocholanolone, respectively. Moreover, concentration levels near to 2 ng/mL were found, more than 2 weeks after the last administration, depending on individual metabolism. Inter-variability as well as intra-variability of nandrolone excretion kinetic, regarding this particular administration mode, were also evaluated. Quantification of nandrolone metabolites was performed by GC-MS. The method was previously validated in terms of specificity, precision, linearity, LOD, LOQ, robustness, accuracy and the expanded uncertainty was also evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{mortality}} and morbidity in the world, especially in developing countries. Tuberculosis can transmit from person to person through the air. Thus, household contacts are considered as the high risk group of being infected. To prevent and control tuberculosis, screening of high risk population is widely recommended. However, it is seldom practiced in developing countries because of lacking resources. In Vietnam, National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) focuses on detection and treatment of new tuberculosis cases aiming at exceeding the targets of World Health Organization (WHO) in controlling tuberculosis. Despite these efforts, Vietnam still ranks 13 th out of 22 countries with highest burden tuberculosis worldwide. And there is no evidence of decreasing in the number of new tuberculosis detected cases in any reports from NTP. Epidemiology of tuberculous infection among children has not been emphasized by Vietnam National Tuberculosis Program. Additionally, all strategies of NTP have focused on detection and treatment of new cases rather than identifying risk factors for tuberculous infection among contacts. Tuberculin skin test, the only method of diagnosing tuberculous infection in Vietnam still has many drawbacks because of cross-reaction with BCG vaccination as well as environmental mycobacterium. The whole blood interferon gamma assay has been shown to be more specific than tuberculin skin test and can be used in diagnosing tuberculous infection by numerous studies. Almost all studies have been conducted in low incidence countries and rarely in high burden countries. Better understanding the epidemiology of tuberculosis among children contacts as well as having the best method of diagnosing tuberculous infection could be a valuable distribution to the evaluation of undergoing TB transmission in the community. We, therefore, conducted a study in three provinces in northern Vietnam in order to identify risk factors for TB infection among children contacts. Objectives: The study is to compare the whole blood interferon gamma assay with tuberculin skin test in diagnosing TB infection and to identify risk factors for TB infection among children of smear positive tuberculosis cases. Method and materials: A cross sectional study was performed. 128 smear positive tuberculosis cases and 208 children contacts under fifteen of age between July 2007 and January 2009 were recruited into study. Clinical data of tuberculosis cases were collected based on hospital records. All children contacts underwent tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma assay from 2 to 15 weeks after detection. Face to face interviews based on the questionnaire were conducted with mothers on the day of admission. Results: A total of 128 tuberculosis cases and 208 children contacts in Ha Noi, Ha Tay and Thai Binh provinces were recruited into study. Children contacts were under 15 (of age), 38 % of which was under 5. The overall, agreement between TST <b>positive</b> (<b>cut</b> <b>off</b> point of 10 mm) and INF gamma assay positive was substantial (Kappa: 0. 62; 95 % CI: 0. 45 - 0. 75). In multivariate analysis, using generalized estimating equation model: Factors remained association with TST positive, namely have low income (OR= 3. 526; 95 % CI 1. 598 - 7. 779; p= 0. 002); have parent with tuberculosis (OR= 7. 913; 95 % CI 2. 886 - 21. 696; p< 0. 001); exposed to sputum smear grade of 3 + (OR= 3. 098; 95 % CI 1. 134 - 8. 461; p= 0. 027); exposed to female with tuberculosis (OR= 0. 309; 95 % CI 0. 126 - 0. 758; p= 0. 01). Factors remained association with INF gamma assay positive was: Duration of cough before treatment (OR= 6. 9; 95 % CI 1. 9 - 25. 07; p = 0. 003), have low income (OR= 6. 142; 95 % CI 2. 055 - 18. 358; p = 0. 001); have parent with tuberculosis (OR= 4. 458 95 % CI 1. 041 - 19. 093; p= 0. 044) and exposed to sputum smear grade of 3 + (OR= 11. 313; 95 %CI 1. 972 - 64. 903); p= 0. 006). Conclusion: In this study, we found that the proportion of TB infection among children contacts was similar with both two tests. The agreement between TST and INF gamma assay was substantial. The results from study suggested that the children contacts with AFB smear positive tuberculosis cases had high proportion of TB infection as determined by both two tests. Have low income; closed contacts with tuberculosis cases; having parents with tuberculosis; delay in tuberculosis diagnosis and the density of bacteria in sputum seem to contribute to the spread of M. tuberculosis infection. We recommend an awareness program to prevent TB infection among children contacts from tuberculosis cases in family. Contact investigation should be considered as part of National TB program.

40|$|Background: Xp 11. 2 or TFE 3 {{translocation}} renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) {{are characterized}} by chromosome translocations involving the Xp 11. 2 breakpoint resulting in transcription factor TFE 3 gene fusions. The most common translocations documented in TFE 3 RCCs are t(X; 1) (p 11. 2;q 21) and t(X; 17) (p 11. 2;q 25) which leads to fusion of TFE 3 gene on Xp 11. 2 with PRCC or ASPL respectively. TFE 3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been inconsistent over time due to background staining problems in part related to fixation issues. Karyotyping to detect TFE 3 gene rearrangement requires typically unavailable fresh tissue. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is generally very challenging due to degradation of RNA in archival material. The study objective was to develop and validate a TFE 3 break-apart {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) assay to confirm Xp 11 translocation RCCs and ASPS.

Among the dietary factors, the role of breast feeding and exposure to cow's milk proteins deserve special attention. Aim: To determine the anti-BSA-IgG levels in type 1 diabetic children and to analyse the possible association with breast feeding duration, exposure to cow's milk and ß pancreatic auto-antibodies. Patients and methods: Blood samples were collected from 161 diabetic children and 144 controls to measure anti-BSA-IgG level, GAD 65, IA- 2 and ICA autoantibodies. All children answered a questionnaire about dietary habits during infancy. Results: anti-BSA-IgG was <b>positive</b> (using a <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> point of 25. 6 ng/ml) in 98 % of diabetic children and 0 % of the control population. The length of breast feeding or early exposure to cow's milk did not influence the concentration of anti-BSA-IgG. Positive BSA titers did not increase the ß pancreatic reactivity (ICA+, GAD+, IA- 2 +). Conclusions: Our data confirm the high frequency of anti-BSA-IgG among diabetic children.

40|$|The {{clinical}} diagnosis of Lyme disease (LD) in horses is often established by detection of Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato (s. l.) antibodies {{in conjunction with}} clinical symptoms as specified in literature. Because of the lacking standardization of the tests {{it turned out that}} the detection of Borrelia in the specimens was very difficult. The aim of the study was to evaluate the common practice of serological testing for the establishment of the diagnosis LD in horses. 337 patients referred to the Clinic for Horses, Surgery and Radiology of the Freie Universität Berlin were examined clinically for a period of ten month and the collected samples were tested further in the laboratory of the BgVV Berlin. The probands were classified in group A (horses independent of clinical symptoms, n= 195) and group B (horses with clinical symptoms, n= 142) after a full clinical examination. In the study serum samples of horses (n= 337) were tested using two commercial ELISA testkits (A and B), an ELISA (C) and IFT homemade at the BgVV for B. burgdorferi s. l. antibodies (immunglobulin G). In addition, specimens of skin, liquor, synovial fluid and blood of horses with clinical symptoms were analysed by PCR and cultivation (n= 76). In order to determine the sensitivity of the serological assays, both positive controls of the commercial ELISA testkits (A and B), 5 highly positive sera of each ELISA (A, B and C) and 3 sera tested negative in all of them were examined with Western blot (ALOMED, n= 20). The positive control of the ELISA C consisted of a sample that was high positive in all serological tests. In a further study, 15 liquor samples were tested for B. burgdorferi s. l. antibodies (immunglobulin A, M and G) and the corresponding serum samples (n= 15) for immunglobulin M and G using another ELISA (LGL). In our investigations we examined Lyme disease in horses using direct methods for detection of B. burgdorferi s. l. : culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). For the culture of B. burgdorferi skin (n= 16), liquor (n= 15) and synovial fluid (n= 26) were inoculated into BSK- and MKP-medium native and with different inhibitoring substances. Cultures were incubated for 3 months at 33 °C, subcultivated and examinated weekly by dark-field microscopy. Skin (n= 16), liquor (n= 15), synovial fluid (n= 26) and blood (n= 19) were tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. specific DNA by OspA-specific nested PCR. In order to determine the specivity of the nested PCR the positive PCR-results were examined with Realtime PCR (ALOMED). The results of the serologic testing revealed a high discrepancy within the tested probands. Following proportions of positive antibody titers were found (n= 337) : ELISA A: 61, 1 %, B: 9, 8 %, C: 3, 3 %. In the IFT 33, 2 % of samples were <b>positive</b> (<b>cut</b> <b>off</b> 1 : 128). Compatibility of results of serological tests existed in 22, 0 % of samples (74 / 337), only 1, 8 % of samples were positive in all tests (6 / 337). There was no significant difference in serological results between horses with (group B) and without (group A) clinical symptoms of LD. A correlation between symptoms and seropositivity of serum samples could not be proved. In the Western blot, positive (n= 15) and negative in all ELISA (n= 3) sera except the positive controls of the commercial ELISA testkits (A and B) were confirmed. The LGL-ELISA detected incidences of seropositive samples (depending on dilution of serum) as follows: 53, 3 % (1 : 50), 26, 7 % (1 : 200) and 6, 7 % (1 : 400). These results are in correspondence with ELISA A. The cultivation of B. burgdorferi was negative in all cases (n= 57). In one of them we could find immobile spirochete-like forms. They are supposed to be giant whips, flagellae of the contaminant flora, which are not involved in the development of Lyme disease. In the OspA-specific nested PCR 3 skin (3 / 16), 2 liquor (2 / 15), 6 synovial fluid (6 / 26) and 1 blood (1 / 19) samples were positive for B. burgdorferi s. l. -DNA. In the Realtime PCR none of these 12 positive samples were positive for B. burgdorferi s. l. -DNA (0 / 12). A correlation between seropositivity of serum samples and the presence of specific DNA could not be proven. These contradictory results revealed the necessity for evaluation of current direct and serological laboratory testing for B. burgdorferi s. l. Without standardised methods (concerning antigencoating, serumdilution, positive control) for the serodiagnostical tests the demands regarding specifity and sensitivity are not met. Reliable laboratory tools are a prerequisite under which a characteristic titerdynamic in conjunction with clinical signs can leed to the presumptive diagnosis LD. Due to the lack of standardization of PCR and the complex demands on cultivation direct detection of B. burgdorferi s. l. is not a suitable method for routine diagnostic at the moment...|$|E

40|$|The "lost-volume" {{problem in}} {{contract}} law poses {{a problem of}} contract design. A seller with market power who faces buyers with private valuations for the subject of sale solves the problem {{with a combination of}} a required positive down payment and a later transaction price above cost. This combination maximizes the surplus the seller can capture from the buyers, but the contract is inefficient: the <b>positive</b> down payment <b>cuts</b> <b>off</b> contracting and a price above cost induces breach by buyers who value the product above its cost. The lost-volume question, then, is whether a court should enforce the inefficient contract the seller prefers or should instead impose one of two mandatory rules: permitting the seller to recover full lost-profit damages or no damages at all. These mandatory rules produce inefficiencies of their own. This paper's contribution is (a) to clarify the lost-volume problem; (b) to show that the three judicially implementable solutions cannot be Pareto-ranked abstractly: which outcome best turns on the distribution of buyer valuations in particular markets; (c) to show which value distributions likely would yield efficiency under each of the solutions; and (d) to argue, for second-order reasons, that courts should enforce the consensual contract rather than impose either mandatory rule.
