40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the implications that cookoff of plastic-bonded explosive- 9501 could have on safety assessments, we analyzed the available data from the large-scale annular cookoff (LSAC) assembly series of experiments. In addition, we examined recent data regarding hypotheses about pre-ignition that may be relevant to <b>post-ignition</b> behavior. Based on the <b>post-ignition</b> data from Shot 6, which had the most complete set of data, we developed an approximate equation of state (EOS) for the gaseous products of deflagration. Implementation of this EOS into the multimaterial hydrodynamics computer program PAGOSA yielded good agreement with the inner-liner collapse sequence for Shot 6 and with other data, such as velocity interferometer system for any reflector and resistance wires. A metric to establish the degree of symmetry based on the concept of time of arrival to pin locations was used to compare numerical simulations with experimental data. Several simulations were performed to elucidate the mode of ignition in the LSAC and to determine the possible compression levels that the metal assembly could have been subjected to during <b>post-ignition...</b>|$|E
40|$|Slow cook-off {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} measurements of temperature, pressure, and volume until the onset of ignition; time and position for onset of ignition; and reaction violence (case deformation and blast overpressure) following ignition. Confinement, gas sealing, and heating profile were varied in experiments on the RDX-based explosive PBXN- 109 and on the HMX-based explosive PBXN- 5. Pre- and <b>post-ignition</b> behavior for PBXN- 109 was modeled for the experimental arrangement based on available characterization measurements for the heated explosive. While reasonable predictions of time for ignition are attained, the <b>post-ignition</b> wall expansion was over-predicted. More characterization of the enhanced burning rate for thermally degraded explosives is required to predict reaction violence...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Efforts to {{quantify}} relationships between climate and wildfire in Alaska {{have not yet}} explored the role of higher-frequency meteorological conditions on individual wildfire ignition and growth. To address this gap, meteorologi-cal data for 665 large fires that burned across the Alaskan interior between 1980 and 2007 were assessed to determine the respective influence of higher-frequency weather and lower-frequency climate, {{in terms of both}} antecedent and <b>post-ignition</b> conditions on fire growth. Antecedent climate exhibited no discernable influence on eventual fire size. In contrast, fire size was sensitive to weather in the days to weeks following ignition, particularly the <b>post-ignition</b> timing of precipitation. Prolonged periods of warm and dry conditions coincident with blocking that persists for several weeks after ignition enabled growth of large wildfires, whereas the return of wetting precipitation generally within a week after ignition inhibited growth of smaller wildfires. These results suggest that daily weather data are a critical predictor of fire growth and large fire potential and encourage their use in fire management and modelling...|$|E
40|$|The process {{involved}} in chemical energy release by combustion in a supersonic, constant pressure, hydrogen-air laminar mixing layer was studied computationally, with a chemical kinetics model involving nineteen reactions and eight species. To {{try to find}} out the physical reason for the different trends of the pressure curves observed in an experimental supersonic combustor at two different initial air stream temperatures. Two initial air stream temperatures corresponding to the two experimental cases are chosen such that the higher temperature yielded a shorter ignition distance, and the lower temperature yielded a longer ignition distance. For both cases the stream wise rate of energy release rises rapidly to a peak after ignition then falls to a <b>post-ignition</b> value which decreases very slowly with distance. A single premixed flame occurs at ignition for both cases, but then develops into a triple flame structure in the high temperature case, and a flame with only two branches in the low temperature case. The flames move from the airside to hydrogen side consuming the oxygen as they go, until the <b>post-ignition</b> phase is reached. There the dominant energy release arises from the formation of a diffusion flame. In the high temperature case a narrow lean premixed flame accompanies this diffusion flame on the airside. The flame structure, but not the energy release, is effected by the initial temperature distribution across the mixing layer, which is found to be influenced by the velocity difference between the faster air stream and the slower hydrogen stream. Increasing the concentration of oxygen atoms in the oncoming air stream was found to cause substantial reduction in the ignition distance, but did not significantly effect the flame structure, or the rate of heat release in the <b>post-ignition</b> phase. Finally, the different trends of pressure curves observed in the experiment can be reconstructed when pressure variation was considered in this model. Thus we can conclude that the difference in the trends of the pressure curves is caused by the difference in the initial air stream temperature...|$|E
40|$|In {{iron ore}} sintering, the {{properties}} of the flame front are clearly critical as they determine the heat imparted to the particulate bed and, hence, the strength of the formed sinter. This study explores the factors that influence flame front temperature and also the speed at which it descends down a bed. These two properties are dependent on <b>post-ignition</b> airflow rate and {{the properties of}} the sinter mix. <b>Post-ignition</b> airflow rate is a strong function of the pre-ignition airflow rate and the flow resistance of the flame front. This study reiterates the strong dependence of flame front resistance on gas flow velocity, flame front temperature and applied suction. Dense ores produce higher bulk density and lower porosity beds and, as a consequence, they have the effect of slowing down and broadening the flame front. The influence of flame front speed on flame front properties for different ores was also established. For comparable flame front properties results show that sinter basicity has a large influence on sinter strength and yield. Studies of coke combustion efficiency show decreasing values with increasing flame front speed and values increased significantly when sintering YANDI ore. Many of the obtained quantitative dependences will be used to verify a sintering mathematical model that is under developmen...|$|E
40|$|Iron ore {{sintering}} blends in the Asia-Pacific contain significant {{levels of}} Australian ores which are lower in bulk density compared to Brazilian ores. This study explores {{the impact of}} further decreasing the bulk density of a fairly typical ore blend. This was done by introducing small amounts of a very porous ore into the blend. Measured decreases in bulk density were up to 3 %. All the sinter quality parameters could be maintained or improved without the need to increase coke rate. Changes in sinter density results were not significant, indicating that the changes in bed bulk density {{did not have a}} significant effect on sinter porosity. The study was then extended to include a comparable blend and two hematite blends of higher bulk density. Decreasing green bed bulk density, bed shrinkage and sinter density did not have a detrimental effect on sinter tumble strength. The associated increase in porosity with the measured changes in sinter density is estimated to be up to 10 %. Results showed that sinter density values obtained for the low bulk density mixes at increased coke addition were still lower than equivalent values for the hematite mixes. As expected flame front speed was dependent on <b>post-ignition</b> airflow rate and both these parameters influence sinter strength. Many blends studied have binders and results indicated that their inclusion into sinter mixes gave increased <b>post-ignition</b> airflow values...|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of cookoff modeling at Sandia National Laboratories is presented aimed at assessing {{the violence of}} reaction following cookoff of confined energetic materials. During cookoff, the response of energetic materials is known to involve coupled thermal/chemical/mechanical processes which induce thermal damage to the energetic material prior to the onset of ignition. These damaged states enhance shock sensitivity and lead to conditions favoring self-supported accelerated combustion. Thus, {{the level of violence}} depends on the competition between pressure buildup and stress release due to the loss of confinement. To model these complex processes, finite element-based analysis capabilities are being developed which can resolve coupled heat transfer with chemistry, quasi-static structural mechanics and dynamic response. Numerical simulations that assess the level of violence demonstrate the importance of determining material damage in pre- and <b>post-ignition</b> cookoff events...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>post-ignition</b> {{events in a}} variable confinement cookoff test (VCCT) geometry is presented aimed toward predicting {{the level of violence}} during cookoff of confined thermally-degraded energetic materials. This study focuses on the dynamic events following thermal initiation whereby accelerated combustion interacts with confinement. Numerical simulations, based on a model of reactive multiphase mixtures, indicate that the response of energetic material is highly dependent upon thermal/mechanical damage states prior to ignition. These damaged states affect the rate of pressurization, dynamic compaction behavior and subsequent growth to detonation. Variations of the specific surface area and porosity produced by decomposition of the energetic material causes different responses ranging from pressure burst to detonation. Calculated stress histories are used in estimating breakup of the VCCT confinement based on Grady-Kipp fragmentation theory...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of varied {{nanoparticles}} (silicate nanoclays and double-walled carbon nanotubes) and micro-sized flameretardants (FRs) on the post heat/fireflexuralperformance of glassfibre-reinforced (GFR) epoxy compositess. The fire reaction properties of GFR epoxycompositescontaining different combinations of nano- and micro-sized FRs were studied at varied incident heat fluxes (35 to 75 kW/m 2). The flexural stiffness and modulus values of radiant heat-damaged GFR composites decreased rapidly with increasing incident heat flux. On another hand, the post-fireflexural properties of these specimens exposed for 30 to 90 s <b>post-ignition</b> at 50 kW/m 2 retained only 20 % of their room temperature flexural properties. Despite significant improvements in the fire reaction properties, their post-fireflexuralperformance was least affected. This suggests that, while these flameretardants are effective in promoting char formation, the formed char networks are not consolidated enough to effectively constrain the fibre reinforcements...|$|E
40|$|The cookoff of {{energetic}} materials involves the combined effects of several {{physical and chemical}} processes. These processes include heat transfer, chemical decomposition, and mechanical response. The interaction and coupling between these processes influence both the time-to-event and the violence of reaction. The prediction {{of the behavior of}} explosives during cookoff, particularly with respect to reaction violence, is a challenging task. To this end, a joint DoD/DOE program has been initiated to develop models for cookoff, and to perform experiments to validate those models. In this paper, a series of cookoff analyses are presented and compared with data from a number of experiments for the aluminized, RDX-based, Navy explosive PBXN- 109. The traditional thermal-chemical analysis is used to calculate time-to-event and characterize the heat transfer and boundary conditions. A reaction mechanism based on Tarver and McGuire's work on RDX{sup 2 } was adjusted to match the spherical one-dimensional time-to-explosion data. The predicted time-to-event using this reaction mechanism compares favorably with the validation tests. Coupled thermal-chemical-mechanical analysis is used to calculate the mechanical response of the confinement and the energetic material state prior to ignition. The predicted state of the material includes the temperature, stress-field, porosity, and extent of reaction. There is little experimental data for comparison to these calculations. The hoop strain in the confining steel tube gives an estimation of the radial stress in the explosive. The inferred pressure from the measured hoop strain and calculated radial stress agree qualitatively. However, validation of the mechanical response model and the chemical reaction mechanism requires more data. A <b>post-ignition</b> burn dynamics model was applied to calculate the confinement dynamics. The burn dynamics calculations suffer from a lack of characterization of the confinement for the flaw-dominated failure mode experienced in the tests. High-pressure burning rates are needed for more detailed <b>post-ignition</b> studies. Sub-models for chemistry, mechanical response and burn dynamics need to be validated against data from less complex experiments. The sub-models can then be used in integrated analysis for comparison with experimental data taken during integrated tests...|$|E

These were then programmed for numerical computation, using two implicit finite-difference schemes, the Lax-Wendroff scheme for the gas phase, and the Crank-Nicolson scheme for the solid phase. Appropriate initial and boundary conditions were represented, including heat and mass conservation at the interface between gas and solid.

40|$|The breakup {{behavior}} and flammability of antimisting turbine fuels subjected to aerodynamic shear are investigated. Fuels tested were Jet A containing 0. 3 % FM- 9 polymer {{at various levels}} of degradation ranging from virgin AMK to neat Jet A. The misting behavior of the fuels was quantified by droplet size distribution measurements. A technique based on high resolution laser photography and digital image processing of photographic records for rapid determination of droplet size distribution was developed. The flammability of flowing droplet-air mixtures was quantified by direct measurements of temperature rise in a flame established {{in the wake of}} a continuous ignition source. The temperature rise measurements were correlated with droplet size measurements. The flame anchoring phenomenon associated with the breakup of a liquid fuel in the wake of bluff body was shown to be important in the context of a survivable crash scenario. A pass/fail criterion for flammability testing of antimisting fuels, based on this flame-anchoring phenomenon, was proposed.

40|$|A new {{numerical}} {{iron ore}} sintering model was developed recently. It {{takes into account}} most of the significant physico-chemical processes in sintering. In this study results from the model are compared with experimental results from twenty five sinter pot tests. Results indicate that the model can simulate the iron ore sintering process, as reasonable correlations between predicted and measured results were obtained in many areas. The good comparisons also indicate that the key sub-models, which have significant effects on results, viz., coke combustion, fluxes calcination, drying and condensation as well as heat and mass transfer, describe the sub-processes well. The phenomena of steady-state waste gas composition (SSWGC) and steady-state waste gas temperature (SSWGT) were simulated and analyzed by the model. A total of nine important input variables were identified and their influence on sintering time and three critical parameters which determine heat transfer during sintering were considered in the sensitivity studies. Results showed that bed bulk density, solid and gas thermal capacities, coke level and diameter and <b>post-ignition</b> airflow rate have the greatest influences on sintering time and the temperature profile parameters.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} at the GALCIT supersonic shear-layer facility to investigate aspects of reacting transverse jets in supersonic crossflow using chemiluminescence and schlieren image-correlation velocimetry. In particular, experiments were designed to examine mixing-delay length dependencies on jet-fluid molar mass, jet diameter, and jet inclination. The experimental results show that mixing-delay length depends on jet Reynolds number, when appropriately normalized, up to a jet Reynolds number of 500, 000. Jet inclination increases the mixing-delay length, but causes less disturbance to the crossflow when compared to normal jet injection. This can be explained, in part, {{in terms of a}} control-volume analysis that relates jet inclination to flow conditions downstream of injection. In the second part of this thesis, a combustion-modeling framework is proposed and developed that is tailored to large-eddy simulations of turbulent combustion in high-speed flows. Scaling arguments place supersonic hydrocarbon combustion in a regime of autoignition-dominated distributed reaction zones (DRZ). The proposed evolution-variable manifold (EVM) framework incorporates an ignition-delay data-driven induction model with a <b>post-ignition</b> manifold that uses a Lagrangian convected 'balloon' reactor model for chemistry tabulation.

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{two-dimensional}} Eulerian hydrocode to explore the utility of various micro-mechanical concepts {{for the development of}} an engineering model for shock initiation of plastic bonded explosives. Our goal was to develop a shock initiation model that would accurately describe the existing shock initiation data in terms of physically measurable or calculable quantities. We used a simple Arrhenius fit to experimental data to describe the decomposition of the explosive (PBX 9501) in hotspots and in the bulk explosive. We ignored any contribution from the binder reactions to the chemical kinetics. Experimentally measured micrographs of PBX 9501 were used to develop microstructures for use in the hydrocode. In the code, such structures were subjected to shock inputs of various strengths, and temperature distributions in binder, pure HMX, and hotspots were calculated. This allowed us to relate the various temperature distributions to the bulk temperature and calculate various reaction rates. A simplistic erosive burning mechanism was used in competition to bulk burning to describe the <b>post-ignition</b> reaction spread. The energy release rate resulting from the competition of these reactions was used as input to a method of characteristics code. This in turn was used to calculate particle velocity – time profiles at various simulated gauge locations. These calculated profiles were compared with experiment...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate appearance of surface ignition- postignition experienced inside the engine cylinder and correlate it with the nature of the spark ignition combustion prior to the onset of surface ignition. The test engine used to carry out all experiments was a Jaguar optical single-cylinder engine, operating in spark-ignition mode, although with negative valve overlap. The optical configuration of the engine allows characterizing and analyzing combustion process based on the processing of captured images in correlation with in-cylinder pressure and other parameters recorded with regard to instantaneous engine operating conditions. Results of the experiments covered in this publication focus on flame propagation and development as well as reveal occurrence of abnormal combustion processes. Experimental observations, especially the captured images show a relationship between the nature of normal combustion process initiated by spark discharge and the existence of abnormal combustion phenomena. All tests were performed under fixed engine conditions – constant speed and single component hydrocarbon fuel. Because the nature of fuel can shape the combustion process, a brief discussion and a proposed correlation of anti-knock, auto-ignition, and resistance to surface ignition qualities of a few single-and multi-component fuels is presented.

40|$|We present high-resolution, full-star {{simulations}} of the <b>post-ignition</b> phase of Type Ia supernovae using the compressible hydrodynamics code Castro. Initial conditions, including the turbulent velocity field and ignition site, are imported {{directly from a}} simulation {{of the last few}} hours of presupernova convection using a low Mach number code, Maestro. Adaptive mesh refinement allows the initial burning front to be modeled with an effective resolution of 36, 864 ^ 3 zones (~ 136 m/zone). The initial rise and expansion of the deflagration front are tracked until burning reaches the star's edge {{and the role of the}} background turbulence on the flame is investigated. The effect of artificially moving the ignition location closer to the star's center is explored. The degree to which turbulence affects the burning front decreases with increasing ignition radius since the buoyancy force is stronger at larger radii. Even central ignition [...] - in the presence of a background convective flow field [...] - is rapidly carried off-center as the flame is carried by the flow field. We compare our results to analytic models for burning thermals, and find that they reproduce the general trends of the bubble's size and mass, but underpredict the amount of buoyant acceleration due to simplifying assumptions of the bubble's properties. Overall, we find that the amount of mass that burns prior to flame break out is small, consistent with a "gravitationally confined detonation" occurring at a later epoch, but additional burning will occur following breakout that may modify this conclusion.

40|$|The {{autoignition}} of an axisymmetric nitrogen-diluted hydrogen plume in {{a turbulent}} coflowing stream of high-temperature air {{was investigated in}} a laboratory-scale set-up using three-dimensional numerical simulations with detailed chemistry and transport. The plume was formed by releasing the fuel from an injector with bulk velocity {{equal to that of}} the surrounding air coflow. In the ‘random spots' regime, autoignition appeared randomly in space and time in the form of scattered localized spots from which <b>post-ignition</b> flamelets propagated outwards in the presence of strong advection. Autoignition spots were found to occur at a favourable mixture fraction close to the most reactive mixture fraction calculated a priori from considerations of homogeneous mixtures based on inert mixing of the fuel and oxidizer streams. The value of the favourable mixture fraction evolved in the domain subject to the effect of the scalar dissipation rate. The hydroperoxyl radical appeared as a precursor to the build-up of the radical pool and the ensuing thermal runaway at the autoignition spots. Subsequently, flamelets propagated in all directions with complex dynamics, without anchoring or forming a continuous flame sheet. These observations, as well as the frequency of and scatter in appearance of the spots, are in good agreement with experiments in a similar set-up. In agreement with experimental observations, an increase in turbulence intensity resulted in a downstream shift of autoignition. An attempt is made to understand the key processes that control the mean axial and radial locations of the spots, and are responsible for the observed scatter. The advection of the most reactive mixture through the domain, and hence the history of evolution of the developing radical pools were considered to this effec...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} strategies provide significant {{efficiency and}} emissions benefits compared to conventional spark ignited (SI) combustion, but challenges related to combustion control and load limits have made these technologies difficult to implement in practical systems. Until now, low cost reduced order models necessary for large parametric and multi-cycle studies capable of accurately capturing {{the full range}} of combustion modes from homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) and spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI) to SI have not been available. This important computational gap for advanced combustion engine research was the primary motivation for this doctoral work. The outcomes of this study include powerful new tools to evaluate advanced combustion strategies as well as novel methods to incorporate important advanced combustion characteristics into reduced order models. A reduced order thermodynamic model of advanced SACI combustion was first proposed. The model was used with available experimental data and previous high fidelity simulation results to develop a new empirical auto-ignition burn rate model that captures the effects of ignition timing, composition, temperature, pressure, engine speed, stratification and flame propagation. A complete engine model was then developed and incorporated into the commercial simulation software GT-Power. The model included chemical kinetics for low temperature heat release and auto-ignition detection and the empirical burn rate model for <b>post-ignition</b> heat release, as well as a new flame propagation model with improved physical groundings. The calibrated engine model showed good agreement with experimental trends of HCCI, SACI and SI combustion modes. The engine model was then used to assess practical strategies for accessing the advanced combustion regime and improving engine efficiency. The results showed HCCI and SACI provide a pathway for significant efficiency benefits compared to throttled SI, with efficiency improvements between 15 - 25 % across a range of loads from 1 - 7 bar BMEP. Further efficiency gains appear possible beyond the experimentally observed SACI limit. As a further exercise, the load extension potential of boosted SACI combustion was conceptually investigated using a simple thermodynamic framework incorporating the empirical burn rate model and practical operating constraints. The results indicate boosted SACI can nearly double the maximum engine load compared to naturally aspirated operation...|$|E
40|$|Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation (STAR) is a novel, patent-pending {{process that}} uses {{smouldering}} combustion as a remediation technology for land contaminated with hazardous organic liquids. Compounds such as chlorinated solvents, coal tar and petroleum products, called Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs) for their low miscibility with water, {{have a long}} history of use in the industrialised world and are among the most ubiquitous of contaminants worldwide. These contaminants are toxic and many are suspected or known carcinogens. Existing remediation technologies are expensive and ineffective at reducing NAPL source zones sufficiently to restore affected water resources to appropriate quality levels. STAR introduces a self-sustaining smouldering reaction within the NAPL pool in the subsurface and allows that reaction to provide all of the <b>post-ignition</b> energy required by the reaction to completely remediate the NAPL source zone in the soil. Results from laboratory and field experiments have been very promising. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated STAR across a wide range of NAPL fuels and focused on coal tar to identify key parameters for successful remediation. Modelling has suggested that STAR efficiency will improve with scale as effects such as heat losses from boundaries become less significant. Observations from field experiments support the modelling theory - significantly lower relative air flow in a smouldering field experiment (330 L) led to faster smouldering front propagation than observed in laboratory experiments (1 L and 3 L). Preliminary emissions monitoring by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has suggested that STAR emissions might be low enough to meet regulatory requirements, but further study is necessary. As emissions are expected to vary with each contaminant, activated carbon filters are being developed and tested in case emissions filtration is necessary. Experiments at all scales have demonstrated that STAR is controllable and self-terminating. Pilot-scale (2500 L) field trials are underway to demonstrate STAR on excavated contaminated soil. The materials that will be studied in these trials are manufactured coal tar in coarse sand (which is the same material as used in the laboratory and field experiments) as well as two soils obtained from coal tar contaminated sites. This poster focuses on the scale-up to these field trials, including small scale characterisation, large scale performance, emissions monitoring and post-treatment soil analysis...|$|E
40|$|A complex {{chemistry}} {{model of}} reduced size (65 species and 268 reactions) derived {{on the basis}} of n-heptane auto-ignition kinetics, small hydrocarbon oxidation chemistry, polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and NOx formation kinetics together with a phenomenological soot model has been implemented in the KIVA code for multidimensional Diesel spray combustion simulations. An EDC (Eddy Dissipation Concept) based partially stirred reactor model is used to handle the turbulence-chemistry interaction. The results obtained from numerical simulations for direct-injection (DI) Diesel sprays, injected into a high-pressure combustion vessel at engine-like conditions or a real engine geometry, show that the approach is able to reproduce the transient Diesel auto-ignition and combustion processes as observed in optical imaging studies. The simulated results (for the cases tested) indicate that the auto-ignition of DI Diesel spray occurs at a site close to the mean stoichiometric surface. The ignition spot grows on the lean side, crosses over the mean stoichiometric surface, enters into the rich zone and develops further in a very short time. The prediction demonstrates that the <b>post-ignition,</b> fully developed combustion process occurs in a lifted diffusion flame stabilized at a large distance from nozzle exit. The spatial distributions of soot and NOx in the predicted lifted flame are similar to those described in Dec's conceptual Diesel combustion model. Further numerical investigations performed show that, the lower the ambient gas pressure and temperature, the longer the auto-ignition delay times of the sprays and vice versa. Increase in ambient gas pressure or temperature causes a reduction in the flame liftoff length. The results demonstrate also that the flame liftoff length is more sensitive to the change in the ambient temperature. The liftoff has a strong influence on the soot and NOx formation. The farther the flame is stabilized, the lower the emissions. Studies of air dilution effects were also performed to investigate the EGR effects on ignition delay, soot and NOx emissions of Diesel flames. The simulations suggest that Diesel auto-ignition delays are controlled by the oxygen concentrations not by the nature of diluents. The soot and NOx formation is suppressed by the dilution. Moreover, studies demonstrate that the initial temperature has a strong effect on soot formation whereas the pressure effect is much weaker. For the same amount of fuel injected, the longer the fuel injection duration time, the higher the maximum value of the averaged soot mass concentration produced. It is expected that the present numerical study combined with experimental studies may provide a better insight into Diesel spray combustion and pollutant formation in Diesel flames...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of the Stagnation-Point Reverse-Flow (SPRF) {{combustor}} geometry for burning low-grade solid fuels that are attractive for specific industrial applications because of their low cost and on-site availability. These fuels are in general, hard to burn, either because of high moisture and impurity-content, e. g. biomass, or their low-volatiles content, e. g., petroleum-coke. This results in various challenges to the combustor designer, for example reduced flame stability and poor combustion efficiency. Conventional solutions include preheating the incoming flow as well as co-firing with high-grade fuels. The SPRF combustor geometry has been chosen because it was demonstrated to operate stably on standard gaseous and liquid-fuels corresponding to ultra fuel-lean conditions and power densities at atmospheric-pressure around 20 - 25 MW/m 3. Previous studies on the SPRF combustor have proven that the unique, reverse flow-geometry allows entrainment of near-adiabatic products into the incoming reactants, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the mixture. Further, the presence of the stagnation-end created a region of low mean velocities and high levels of unsteadiness and mixing-rates that supported the reaction-zones. In this study, we examine the performance of the SPRF geometry on a specific low grade solid fuel, petroleum coke. There are three main goals of this thesis. The first goal is the design of a SPRF combustor to operate on solid-fuels based on a design-scaling methodology, as well as demonstration of successful operation corresponding to a baseline condition. The second goal involves understanding the mode of operation of the SPRF combustor on solid-fuels based on visualization studies. The third goal of this thesis is developing and using reduced-order models to better understand and predict the ignition and quasi-steady burning behavior of dispersed-phase particles in the SPRF combustor. The SPRF combustor has been demonstrated to operate stably on pure-oxygen and a slurry made from water and petroleum-coke, both at the baseline conditions (125 kW, 18 g/s, ~ 25 µm particles) and higher power-densities and powder sizes. For an overall combustor length less than a meter, combustion is not complete (global combustion efficiency less than 70 %). Luminance imaging results indicate the incoming reactant jet ignites and exhibits intense burning at the mid-combustor region, around 15 jet diameters downstream of the inlet, most likely due to enhanced mixing {{as a result of the}} highly unsteady velocity field. This roughly corresponds to the location of the reaction zones in the previous SPRF combustors operating on gas and liquid fuels. Planar laser visualization of the reacting flow-field using particle-scattering reveals that ignition of a significant amount of the reactants occurs only after the incoming jet has broken into reactant packets. <b>Post-ignition,</b> these burning packets burn out slowly as they reverse direction and exit the combustor on either side of the central injector. This is unlike the behavior in liquid and gas-fueled operation where the incoming reactants burned across a highly corrugated, thin-flame front. Based on these findings, as well as the results of previous SPRF studies, an idealized model of combustor operation based on a plug flow reactor has been developed. The predictions suggest that fuel-conversion efficiency is enhanced by the combustor operating pressure and lowered by the heat-losses. Overall, this effort has shown the SPRF geometry is a promising compact-combustor concept for self-sustained operation on low-grade solid-fuels for typical high-pressure applications such as direct steam-generation. Based on these findings, it is recommended that future designs for the specific application previously mentioned have a shorter base-combustor with lower heat-losses and a longer steam-generation section for injection of water.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here {{focuses on the}} ignition of single Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles in pure CO 2 and Ar atmospheres and Ti particles in O 2 /N 2 and O 2 /Ar environments. The importance of studying Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles is related to their potential use in propulsion and materials synthesis applications. Meanwhile, Ti combustion may be utilized to eliminate hazardous chemical and biological air pollutants. ^ Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles. The use of Ni- or Fe-coated Al particles (10 – 100 μm) as a fuel component in propellants is expected to improve the performance characteristics of solid rocket motors by reducing Al agglomeration. They {{can also be used}} for combustion synthesis of nickel and iron aluminides. The ignition mechanism of such particles, however, is not well understood. In this work, to provide sufficient spatial and time resolutions, single ∼ 2. 5 -mm Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles were laser-heated in argon and carbon dioxide atmospheres. The ignition process was investigated using a high-speed digital video camera, thermocouple measurements, and analysis of particles quenched at different pre-ignition stages. ^ It was shown that the Ni-coated Al particle ignition temperature is ∼ 1325 °C and does not depend on atmosphere (Ar or CO 2) or Ni content. The established ignition mechanism includes exothermic intermetallic reactions and phase transformations of different Ni-Al compounds. Specifically, the melting of NiAl 3 at 854 °C was determined to {{play a critical role in}} particle ignition. ^ Despite the lower exothermicity of Fe-Al reactions, iron-coated Al particles were investigated because, unlike Ni, Fe is not toxic. Further, a prior study showed that Fe coatings may exhibit a more favorable effect on Al agglomeration than Ni coatings. It was shown that significant differences exist between the ignition of the Fe-Al and Ni-Al particles. In contrast to Ni coatings, the ignition of Fe-coated Al particles is influenced by atmosphere (Ar or CO 2) and the <b>post-ignition</b> product phases are not well-mixed. Again, the ignition mechanism relied on exothermic intermetallic reactions and phase transformations. For Fe-coated Al particles, the intermetallic reactions contributed significantly to heating rate upon Al melting at 660 °C. ^ The above differences between the Ni- and Fe-coated Al particle systems may be related to the manner by which buoyancy influences phase formation in each system. Thus, microgravity (10 - 2 – 10 - 3 g) experiments were conducted to reduce convective mixing, allowing its effect on ignition to be examined. The results indicated that Nicoated Al particle ignition is not influenced by microgravity. Meanwhile, for Fe-coated Al particles, microgravity lowered ignition temperature by ∼ 100 °C, indicating a significant influence of buoyancy. In normal gravity, similar effects are expected to occur with decreasing the initial particle size from 2. 5 mm to 250 – 550 μm. ^ Ti particles. Combustion of Ti-rich pyrotechnic mixtures in air may potentially be used for the in-situ synthesis of nano-scale TiO 2 particles, which can photocatalytically degrade chemical and biological air pollutants. Knowledge of Ti particle reactions in O 2 -containing atmospheres is required to develop this method. In the present work, large (∼ 3 mm) single Ti particles were heated by a laser in O 2 /N 2 and O 2 /Ar environments. High-speed digital video recording, thermocouple measurements and quenching at different stages of the process were used for diagnostics. Analysis of the obtained temperature-time curves and quenched particles does not show a significant influence of nitrogen on oxidation of solid Ti. In all experiments, noticeable surface oxidation started at temperatures between ∼ 850 – 950 °C, leading to a sharp temperature rise at ∼ 1400 °C. During prolonged heating at the Ti melting point (1670 °C), a liquid TiO 2 bead formed and, after an induction period, ejected fragments. It was shown that this phenomenon may result from an excess of oxygen in the liquid bead. Fragment ejection was more intense in O 2 /N 2 atmospheres than in O 2 /Ar, indicating that N 2 accelerates the oxidation of liquid Ti. ...|$|E
