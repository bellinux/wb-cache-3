5000|$|... #Caption: Anti-binding {{motorcycle}} {{trailer hitch}} assembly (<b>pivot</b> <b>ball</b> hitch) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} tow a trailer behind a motorcycle, {{one of the}} {{following}} coupling combinations or mechanisms is needed: a ball and socket, swivel adapter, or <b>pivot</b> <b>ball</b> hitch and coupler.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pivot</b> <b>ball</b> hitch is an anti-binding {{motorcycle}} {{trailer hitch}} assembly {{composed of a}} base and a trailer ball. The base is secured to a standard ball mount on the motorcycle. The trailer {{is attached to a}} socket coupler. A space between the ball shank and the assembly mount allow the ball to move left and right in a vertical plane. Thus, the ball remains in a generally upright position when the motorcycle leans left or right into a turn because the base of the <b>pivot</b> <b>ball</b> hitch is able to move in the opposite direction of the motorcycle without causing the coupler to bind.|$|E
50|$|A {{ball valve}} {{is a form}} of quarter-turn valve which uses a hollow, {{perforated}} and <b>pivoting</b> <b>ball</b> to control flow through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90-degrees by the valve handle. The handle lies flat in alignment with the flow when open, and is perpendicular to it when closed, making for easy visual confirmation of the valve's status.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Traxxas {{introduced}} {{an updated version}} of the E-Maxx (model 3905). This model featured a new extended wheelbase chassis, a new transmission skid plate, new waterproof EVX-2 16.8 volt speed control, new sealed differentials, drive shafts, <b>pivot</b> <b>balls,</b> and ball bearings, new dual waterproof steering servos, water tight receiver box, new steering linkage, redesigned bulkheads, new hex hardware, new single speed strengthened, brushless ready transmission (a two-speed transmission is available as an accessory), Revo spec slipper clutch, new battery holders, 3.8 inch mirror chrome wheels and [...] "Chevron" [...] tires, and a new body with new paint and revised graphics. Both models have a claimed top speed of 30+ MPH.|$|R
30|$|Ball radius The most {{important}} parameter of BPA is ball radius (ρ). The algorithm is {{very sensitive to}} changes in ball radius. Using a very small radius makes the model susceptible to input noise. Using large ball radius results in loss of details in the model and holes are generated in the surface. The 3 D surface generated using a ball of radius ρ can’t handle a surface curvature larger than 1 /ρ. This is because, the <b>pivoting</b> <b>ball</b> can’t reach the region where the curvature is higher than 1 /ρ. In case of noisy data, slightly larger ball radius is encouraged, as it tends to cancel out the noise effect in the point cloud.|$|R
5000|$|The South Florida R/C Car Club in Miami {{held the}} first races from 1972 to 1975. At that {{time there were}} no nitro sedans, impacts, or 4WD <b>pivot</b> <b>ball</b> cars. It was all 2WD 1/8 scale pan cars (made by Delta, Associated, Marker Machine) powered by K&B or OPS [...]21 engines.|$|E
5000|$|As {{explained}} {{above in}} [...] "Ball and socket", {{the movement in}} the coupler and ball combination is limited to mostly horizontal movement and tilting slightly. Therefore, this type of coupling is best suited for three-wheeled motorcycles and four-wheeled vehicles. In contrast, as <b>pivot</b> <b>ball</b> hitches and swivel adapters do allow the appreciable lean necessary to keep all the trailer wheels on the ground while turning, these devices are the better option for towing trailers behind a two-wheeled motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known rudimentary {{steam engine}} and reaction steam turbine, the aeolipile, {{is described by}} a mathematician and engineer named Heron of Alexandria (Heron) in 1st century Roman Egypt, as recorded in his manuscript Spiritalia seu Pneumatica. Steam ejected tangentially from nozzles caused a <b>pivoted</b> <b>ball</b> to rotate. Its thermal efficiency was low. This suggests that the conversion of steam pressure into mechanical movement was known in Roman Egypt in the 1st century. Heron also devised a machine that used air heated in an altar fire to displace a quantity of water from a closed vessel. The weight of the water was made to pull a hidden rope to operate temple doors. Some historians have conflated the two inventions to assert, incorrectly, that the aeolipile was capable of useful work.|$|R
5000|$|The Revo was {{introduced}} in 2004 as a complete redesign of a one tenth scale monster truck chassis with a more advanced and reliable design than the T-Maxx. The Revo has become popular in racing, and is also well suited to [...] "bashing" [...] environments such as a backyard or a construction site. Notable characteristics include the inboard push-rod suspension system with new [...] "GTR" [...] shocks and springs, a complex [...] "monocoque"-type aluminum chassis which lowers the vehicle's center of gravity, a stronger transmission that features electronically controlled reverse, sealed limited slip differentials, rubber sealed <b>pivot</b> <b>balls,</b> drive shafts and ball bearings, 3.8 inch wheels and all-terrain style [...] "Talon" [...] tires, and {{an updated version of}} Traxxas' TRX 2.5 engine, the TRX 2.5R. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.|$|R
5000|$|The T-Maxx 2.5R {{featured}} Traxxas' TRX 2.5R nitro engine, a new driveline {{similar to}} the Revo's, with the Torque-Control slipper clutch on the spur gear. It also included new gray colored parts and redesigned bulkheads and differential housings. The T-Maxx 2.5R included the Optidrive reverse system (originally only on the Revo) instead of the purely mechanical reverse on the original. The 3.2 mm thick aluminum chassis on the T-Maxx 2.5 was replaced with a stronger 4 mm chassis. The driveshafts, <b>pivot</b> <b>balls,</b> and ball bearings were all sealed with blue rubber. The old 3.2 inch wheels were replaced with new, larger 3.8 inch satin finish wheels with lower profile [...] "chevron" [...] tires. A new body paint scheme was also included. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} variations, stockless anchors consist {{of a set of}} heavy flukes connected by a <b>pivot</b> or <b>ball</b> and socket joint to a shank. Cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms, projections that drag on the bottom, forcing the main flukes to dig in.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{the field}} of competition, all {{companies}} should supply their goods and services with high quality, in shortest period with lower prices than its competitors {{in order to survive}} the competitive environment. A ball valve is a form of quarter-turn valve which uses a hollow, perforated and <b>pivoting</b> <b>ball</b> (called a "floating ball") to control flow through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90 -degrees by the valve handle. Reduced flow and excessive pressure drop are some of the common problems in ball valve. Angle backlash in the ball position is one of the causes for reduced flow and excessive pressure drop. This paper discusses on creating various alternatives for eliminating the angle backlash in the ball position, evaluating them and choosing the best alternative followed by CFD analysis of the ball valve before and after adjusting the backlash is made in ANSYS FLUENT and the results are compared. Key words: CFD, ANSYS FLUENT I...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} for converting a point cloud to a 3D surface. Some approaches, like Delaunay triangulation, alpha shapes, and <b>ball</b> <b>pivoting,</b> build {{a network of}} triangles over the existing vertices of the point cloud, while other approaches convert the point cloud into a volumetric distance field and reconstruct the implicit surface so defined through a marching cubes algorithm.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangements}} for adjusting the toe angle are not changed by introducing ball joints in the suspension, although {{it should be}} noted that the steering linkage itself must use 4 or more <b>pivots,</b> also usually <b>ball</b> joints, and in almost every vehicle ever made, some of these have been adjustable by having a threaded end and locknut, to enable the toe to be set precisely.|$|R

"Your stance was right, {{and your}} grip was right, and you kept your head still, and didn't sway your body, and never took your eye off the ball, and slowed back, {{and let the}} arms come well through, and rolled the wrists, and let the club-head lead, and kept your balance, and <b>pivoted</b> on the <b>ball</b> of the left foot, and didn't duck the right knee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your stance was wrong, {{and your}} grip was wrong, and you moved your head, and swayed your body, and took your eye off the ball, and pressed, and forgot {{to use your}} wrists, and swung back too fast, and let the hands get ahead of the club, and lost your balance, and omitted to <b>pivot</b> on the <b>ball</b> of the left foot, and bent your right knee." ...|$|R
50|$|Pivoting is {{the act of}} {{rotating}} one's body {{while keeping}} the ball of one foot in place on the floor. Most of the player's balance {{should be on the}} pivot foot while slightly raising the heel in order to <b>pivot</b> on the <b>ball</b> of the foot. Pivoting can be done with or without the ball as it is an important tool to quickly change direction or orientation to the basket.|$|R
5000|$|Netball {{rules do}} not permit players to let their landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in {{possession}} of the ball, so players can take 1.5 steps while holding the <b>ball.</b> <b>Pivoting</b> does not count as a step. Players are entitled to balance {{on the other foot}} if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called traveling (or steps) as in basketball.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} surface {{reconstruction}} from {{a set of}} 3 D points given by their coordinates andoriented normals is a difficult problem, which has been tackled with many different approaches. In 1999, Bernardini and colleagues introduced a very elegant and efficient reconstruction methodthat uses a <b>ball</b> <b>pivoting</b> around triangle edges and adds new triangles if the ball is incidentto three points and contains no other points.

50|$|In {{the second}} half, after Albion {{had failed to}} take several chances, Birmingham equalised. Bradford {{controlled}} a long <b>ball,</b> <b>pivoted</b> and shot past Pearson from 25 yards. But the lead did not last. Straight from the restart, Carter, W. G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford took the ball directly down the field. George Liddell sliced his attempted clearance, which left the ball at Richardson's feet, and the forward had an easy task to beat Hibbs from close range.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} common, widely used front {{suspension}} system in cars today. It is a very simple and effective design that uses a strut-type spring and shock absorber that {{work as a team}} that will <b>pivot</b> on a <b>ball</b> joint on the single lower arm. This system was popularized in British Fords in the 1950's, then adopted by BMW (1962) and Porsche (1963). Later the space-efficient system became widespread with the growing popularity of front wheel drive.|$|R

50|$|In the {{fundamental}} technique, the picking hand is suspended above the strings and moves over the strings without <b>pivoting</b> on the <b>ball</b> {{of the hand}} or touching the strings or bridge. Holding the pick in this manner promotes relaxation from the fingers to the back, and it also facilitates the alternate picking of single strings and the cross picking among several strings. Fripp, {{who is known for}} his cross-picking, teaches the technique in Guitar Craft. Fripp's cross-picking has influenced many other guitarists, particularly in progressive rock. The fourth primary exercise introduces cross picking.|$|R
30|$|When {{the ball}} is traversed through the points, some holes are {{generated}} in the triangulated mesh, either {{due to the lack}} of points, or lack of oriented normals in the point cloud. These holes in the generated mesh are filled up by creating triangles joining the boundary edges of the holes. As BPA algorithm strongly follows the 3 D points in the point cloud, presence of noise has a significant impact on the reconstructed surface. Noise handling can be done by using adaptive ball radius during the <b>ball</b> <b>pivot</b> reconstruction. BPA algorithm is data-driven, and it usually takes a longer time to generate 3 D surface than Poisson reconstruction algorithm.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor’s {{thesis is}} dealing with the {{proposal}} and the choice of the proper method for quick check of weld seams of <b>ball</b> <b>pivot</b> of automobile stabilizers created by the resistance welding method. The first, theoretical part deals with the resistance welding. The second part deals with a description of the production process and testing of the particular component. The last part contains personal proposals and an assessment of the suitability of use of each construction solution of simple mechanical devices for quality checking of the weld seam. The recommended method to use is the Charpy impact test which served as the base for designing the special test device...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCreating an interpolating mesh from an unorganized set of {{oriented}} {{points is}} a difficult problem which is often overlooked. Most methods focus indeed on building a watertight smoothed mesh by defining some function whose zero level set is {{the surface of the}} object. However in some cases it is crucial to build a mesh that interpolates the points and does not fill the acquisition holes: either because the data are sparse and trying to fill the holes would create spurious artifacts or because the goal is to explore visually the data exactly as they were acquired without any smoothing process. In this paper we detail a parallel implementation of the Scale-Space Meshing algorithm, which builds on the scale-space framework for reconstructing a high precision mesh from an input oriented point set. This algorithm first smoothes the point set, producing a singularity free shape. It then uses a standard mesh reconstruction technique, the <b>Ball</b> <b>Pivoting</b> Algorithm, to build a mesh from the smoothed point set. The final step consists in back-projecting the mesh built on the smoothed positions onto the original point set. The result of this process is an interpolating, hole-preserving surface mesh reconstruction. Source Code The ANSI C++ source code permitting to reproduce results from the on-line demo is available at the IPOL web page of this article 1. The scale-space meshing algorithm uses the <b>Ball</b> <b>Pivoting</b> Algorithm which is linked to patent US 6968299 B 1. It is made available for the exclusive aim of serving as a scientific tool to verify the soundness and completeness of the algorithm description...|$|R
25|$|In coxless pairs, quadruple sculls and coxless fours, {{one of the}} rowers will be {{designated}} to steers. They will control the rudder using lines attached to the toe of one shoe, which <b>pivots</b> around the <b>ball</b> of the foot. The rower who steers is chosen according to experience {{and the nature of}} the course on which the boat is rowing: bow has a clear view ahead when looking over one's shoulder, whereas stroke may be able to steer well on a straight course by pointing the stern at a reference point. A rower steering in the middle of a four or quad is not uncommon, since bow and stroke have other duties already.|$|R
50|$|Single, double, and quad sculls {{are usually}} steered by the scullers pulling harder {{on one side}} or the other. In other boats, there is a rudder, {{controlled}} by the coxswain, if present, or by one of the crew. In the latter case, the rudder cable is attached to the toe of one of his shoes which can <b>pivot</b> about the <b>ball</b> of the foot, moving the cable left or right. The bowman may steer since he has the best vision when looking over his shoulder. On straighter courses, the strokesman may steer, since he can point the stern of the boat at some landmark {{at the start of the}} course. On international courses, landmarks for the steersmen, consisting of two aligned poles, may be provided.|$|R
5000|$|To {{train the}} student's {{subconscious}} for hip-shooting, McDaniel would first teach {{the student to}} [...] "hip-shoot" [...] the Daisy air rifle without sights at a row of targets {{lined up on the}} ground. Each time the student got ready to shoot at one of those targets, he would <b>pivot</b> on the <b>balls</b> of both feet to point his body squarely at that target, with his knees bent slightly and his feet spread apart about 18 inches, and his left foot positioned six inches ahead (if he was right-handed). Consequently, the student would never twist his neck, waist, knees or ankles, or swing his arm to the side, either to sight the target or to bring his gun to bear on it.|$|R
5000|$|The crew {{consists}} of four rowers, each having one oar. There are two rowers on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and two on the bow side (rower's lefthand side). There is no cox, but the rudder is controlled {{by one of the}} crew, normally with the rudder cable attached to the toe of one of their shoes which can <b>pivot</b> about the <b>ball</b> of the foot, moving the cable left or right. The steersman may row at bow, who has the best vision when looking over their shoulder, or on straighter courses stroke may steer, since they can point the stern of the boat at some landmark {{at the start of the}} course. The equivalent boat when it is steered by a cox is referred to as a [...] "coxed four".|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of mirror mount is the {{kinematic}} mount. This type of mount is designed according to the principles of kinematic determinacy. Typically, the movable frame that holds the mirror <b>pivots</b> on a <b>ball</b> bearing which is set into a hole in the fixed frame. Ideally this hole should be trihedral (pyramid-shaped). Often a conical hole is used due to easier manufacture. The frame is pivoted by means of two micrometers or fine-thread screws, tipped with steel ball bearings. One of these ball bearings rests in a V-groove, the other rests on a flat surface. On cheaper mounts, the flat surface may be simply the material of the mount. In more expensive mounts, the flat surface (and perhaps the hole and v-groove too) may be made out of a much harder material (often sapphire), set into the frame.|$|R
5000|$|The 1955-up Pontiac V8 was an {{overhead}} valve engine with wedge combustion chambers. It used cast iron cylinder heads and a cast-iron block. An innovative design feature was mounting the rocker arms on <b>ball</b> <b>pivots</b> on studs set into the cylinder-head, rather than using a separate rocker shaft; this allowed more consistent valve action with less weight than a conventional shaft. It was also cheaper to build than a rocker shaft; this Pontiac-patented technology was immediately handed to the Chevrolet division for their first postwar V-8, which appeared the same year. This handing over Pontiac's valve train invention ( [...] Engineer Clayton leach [...] ) violated GM's rule for a division having a one model year exclusivity, but alas Ed Cole at Chevrolet got his way. All (except the 303 Ram Air V engine and 265 and 301) used 6.625 in connecting rods.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{reconstruction}} {{from point}} clouds represents very modern and widespreadly used method for digitalization of real surfaces. The {{main focus of}} this work is on a comparison of several algorithms (Poisson surface reconstruction, <b>Ball</b> <b>Pivoting</b> Algorithm, Fourier surface reconstruction, Wavelet surface reconstruction and Multi-level Partition of Unity implicits) that reconstruct original surface in a form of triangle mesh from an oriented point cloud. Every algorithm was used {{in a series of}} tests on both real and synthetic datasets which were also modified to suit more complicated experiments. The following evaluation is done in various  categories. The results are evaluated both visualy and with calculated measures (such as Hausdorff distance). Together these experiments depict a detailed analysis of the state of surface reconstruction algorithms. Our experimets show that the selection of optimal algorithm depends on a  concrete task. Overall Possion surface reconstruction and Fourier surface reconstruction provide the best results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Recent studies {{emphasize}} the importance of pivot stiffness in the analysis of tilting pad bearings (TPBs). The present paper develops a finite element model of the pad pivot and compares the predicted pivot stiffness to the results of Hertzian contact model calculations. Specifically, a finite element analysis generates tetrahedral mesh models with ~ 40, 000 nodes for a ball-socket pivot and ~ 50, 000 nodes for a rocker-back pivot. These models assume a frictionless boundary condition in the contact area. Increasing the applied loads on the pad in conjunction with increasing time steps ensures rapid convergence during the nonlinear numerical analysis. Predictions are performed using the developed finite element model for increasing the differential diameters between the pad <b>pivot</b> (or <b>ball)</b> and the bearing housing (or socket). The predictions show that the pivot contact area increases with decreasing dif-ferential diameters and increasing applied loads. Further, the maximum deformation occurring at the pivot center increases with increasing differential diameters and increasing applied loads. The pivot stiffness increases non-linearly with decreasing differential diameters and increasing applied loads. Comparisons of results of the developed finite element model to those of Hertzian contact model calculations assuming a small contact area show that the latter model underestimates the pivot stiffnesses predicted by the finite element models of the ball-socket and rocker-back pivots, particularly for small differential diameters. This result implies the need for cautionduring the desig...|$|R
40|$|Consider an {{algorithm}} {{for generating}} a triangle mesh interpolating a fixed set of 3 D point samples, where the generated triangle set {{varies depending on}} some underlying parameters. In this paper we treat such an algorithm {{as a means of}} sampling the space of possible interpolant meshes, and then define a more robust algorithm based on drawing multiple such samples from this process and averaging them. As mesh connectivity graphs cannot be trivially averaged, we compute triangle statistics and then attempt to find a set of compatible triangles which maximize agreement between the sample meshes while also forming a manifold mesh. Essentially, each sample mesh “votes ” for triangles, and hence we call our result a consensus mesh. Finding the optimal consensus mesh is combinatorially intractable, so we present an efficient greedy algorithm. We apply this strategy to two mesh generation processes- <b>ball</b> <b>pivoting</b> and localized tangent-space Delaunay triangulations. We then demonstrate that consensus meshing enables a generic decomposition of the meshing problem which supports trivial parallelization. 1...|$|R
