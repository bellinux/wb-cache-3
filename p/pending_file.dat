50|$|Other {{components}} {{that are involved}} in the snapshot creation process are writers. The aim of Shadow Copy is to create consistent reliable snapshots. But sometimes, this cannot simply be achieved by completing all <b>pending</b> <b>file</b> change operations. Sometimes, it is necessary to complete a series of inter-related changes to several related files. For example, when a database application transfers a piece of data from one file to another, it needs to delete it from the source file and create it in the destination file. Hence, a snapshot must not be between the first deletion and the subsequent creation, or else it is worthless; it must either be before the deletion or after the creation. Enforcing this semantic consistency is the duty of writers. Each writer is application-specific and has 60 seconds to establish a backup-safe state before providers start snapshot creation. If the Volume Shadow Copy service does not receive acknowledgement of success from the corresponding writers with this time-frame, it fails the operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—MapReduce is a {{key-value}} based programming {{model and}} an associated implementation for processing large data sets. It {{has been adopted}} in various scenarios and seems promising. However, when spatial computation is expressed straightforward by this key-value based model, difficulties arise due to unfit features and performance degradation. In this paper, we present methods as follows: 1) a splitting method for balancing workload, 2) <b>pending</b> <b>file</b> structure and redundant data partition dealing with relation between spatial objects, 3) a strip-based two-direction plane sweep-ing algorithm for computation accelerating. Based on these methods, ANN(All nearest neighbors) query and astronomical cross-certification are developed.
