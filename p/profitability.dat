5|$|The UERL's {{ownership}} of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the <b>profitability</b> of the LGOC and had {{a negative impact on}} the <b>profitability</b> of the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds {{depends upon the}} needs of a specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, accrual basis accounting would be appropriate to show the fund's <b>profitability.</b> Accrual basis is also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the <b>profitability</b> of those investments would be important.|$|E
5|$|Despite closer {{co-operation}} {{and improvements}} {{made to the}} Bakerloo stations and {{to other parts of}} the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenue, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the <b>profitability</b> of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the <b>profitability</b> of the whole UERL group.|$|E

5|$|On 26 October 2010, UBS {{announced}} that its private bank recorded net new funds of CHF 900million {{during the third}} quarter, compared to an outflow of CHF 5.5billion in second quarter. UBS's third quarter net profit of US$1.65billion beat analyst estimates, continuing a string of <b>profitability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carmarthenshire {{is mainly}} an {{agricultural}} county, {{apart from the}} southeastern part which at one time was heavily industrialised with coal mining, steel-making and tin-plating. In {{the north of the}} county the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century. Nowadays the economy of the county depends on agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. With the decline in its industrial base and the low <b>profitability</b> of the livestock sector, Carmarthenshire is economically one of the worst-performing regions in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} <b>profitability</b> to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its <b>profitability.</b> Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Changing {{technologies}} {{have affected the}} recording, distribution, and varying <b>profitability</b> of the underground industry. The copyrights for the song {{and the right to}} authorise recordings often reside with the artist, according to several international copyright treaties. The recording, trading and sale of bootlegs continues to thrive, however, even as artists and record companies attempt to provide officially-released alternatives to satisfy the demand.|$|E
5|$|EVA Air carried 6.2 million {{passengers}} in 2007, and employed 4,800 staff members as of April 2008. The carrier returned to <b>profitability</b> {{in the first}} quarter of 2009, with a US$5.9 million net gain. In August 2010, EVA Air was named one of the top 10 international airlines in Travel+Leisures World's Best Awards.|$|E
5|$|Fund {{accounting}} is {{an accounting}} system for recording resources whose use {{has been limited}} by the donor, grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. It emphasizes accountability rather than <b>profitability,</b> and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Governmental funds, {{which are}} not {{concerned}} about <b>profitability,</b> usually rely on a modified accrual basis. This involves recognizing revenue when it becomes both available and measurable, rather than when it is earned. Expenditures, a term preferred over expenses for modified accrual accounting, are recognized when the related liability is incurred.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{competition}} from small unregulated bus operators reduced the <b>profitability</b> {{of the road}} transport operations, leading the UERL's directors to seek government regulation. This led {{to the establishment of}} the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, which absorbed the UERL and all of the independent and municipally operated railway, bus and tram services in the London area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Profitability</b> was maintained, {{with the}} result then {{when most of the}} Shropshire Union network of canals were {{abandoned}} in 1944, the sections which had originally been the Chester Canal, the Ellesmere Canal, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Middlewich Branch were all retained. The only other section which was not abandoned was the Llangollen branch; this was kept because of its function as a water supply channel, rather than for navigation.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana {{cultivated}} political {{relationships to}} facilitate the continued growth of Tiko in spite of an economic climate non-conducive to free enterprise under the Socialist administration of Ratsiraka. Early support in the 1980s came from the Supreme Counselor of the Revolution Manandafy Rakotonirina, then-Minister of Finance Rakotovao Razakaboana, and another minister, Justin Rarivoson. By the mid-1980s, the <b>profitability</b> of his Tiko enterprise enabled Ravalomanana to purchase a costly villa formerly owned by French colonial governor Leon Reallon in the central Faravohitra neighborhood of Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|Tests done by audiophile publications, news {{reporters and}} {{academics}} reached conflicting conclusions on whether more expensive audio or video cables like those from Monster {{make a difference}} in audio or video quality when compared to generic cables. Instead of advertising, Monster offers incentives to retailers and their salespeople to sell the cables. Retailers bundle high profit-margin cables with larger purchases that have smaller margins in order to improve <b>profitability.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Grantham Canal is a canal {{that runs}} for 33 miles (53km) from Grantham, falling through 18 locks to West Bridgford where it joins the River Trent. It was built {{primarily}} {{to allow for}} the transportation of coal to Grantham. It opened in 1797, and its <b>profitability</b> steadily increased until 1841. It was then sold to a railway company, after which it declined, and was finally closed in 1936.|$|E
5|$|The Halloween {{franchise}} {{has also}} seen <b>profitability</b> through various merchandise like toys, dolls, statues, model kits, bobbleheads, snow globes, movie posters, masks, T-shirts, hats, and more. Michael Myers has made {{appearances in the}} form of dolls and toys from McFarlane Toys, Sideshow Collectibles and NECA. Even Dr. Loomis has been immortalized in plastic alongside Michael Myers in a two-figure set produced by NECA.|$|E
5|$|The {{major change}} in {{agriculture}} in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. <b>Profitability</b> of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E
5|$|The post-millennium {{period has}} seen {{changes to the}} way the club is run as a {{business}}. When a new business management team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business saddled with debt. The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational <b>profitability</b> based on the disposal of non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to be repaid within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Opel {{had also}} {{been the source of}} many Holden models. To {{increase}} <b>profitability,</b> Holden looked to the South Korean Daewoo brand for replacements after acquiring a 44.6percent stake—worth US$251million—in the company in 2002 as a representative of GM. This was increased to 50.9percent in 2005, but when GM further increased its stake to 70.1percent around the time of its 2009 Chapter 11 reorganisation, Holden's interest was relinquished and transferred to another (undisclosed) part of GM.|$|E
5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{to make the}} river suitable for coasters began in 1856, when Edward Leader Williams was appointed as engineer. He oversaw the complete reconstruction of the navigation between 1870 and 1900, a programme {{which was designed to}} ensure that the river remained attractive to carriers, and which ensured its <b>profitability.</b> The 12 locks of the 1830s were replaced by five much larger locks, and most of the bridges were replaced by swing bridges, which enabled coasters of up to 1000 tons to use the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale price}} was {{estimated}} at over $600million. Unlike the pre-Gillett era, the team is now privately owned by the Molson family and not by the Molson brewery, which is now a division of Molson Coors. The reputed sale price reflected a return to <b>profitability,</b> due both to a new collective bargaining agreement after the 2004–05 lockout that fixed player costs to revenues and to {{a rise in the}} value of the Canadian dollar back to at or near parity with the U.S. dollar.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Kmart closed 22 underperforming stores due to poor {{sales and}} {{a large amount of}} loss in <b>profitability.</b> During the first quarter of 2011, Kmart closed 35 more stores due to low <b>profitability</b> and poor sales.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi {{reported}} {{its first}} profitable quarter {{in four years}} {{in the third quarter of}} 2006, and returned to <b>profitability</b> by the end of the 2006 financial year, and sustained <b>profitability</b> and global sales of 1,524,000 through 2007 and later.|$|E
25|$|The (short term) {{goals of}} working capital are {{therefore}} not approached {{on the same}} basis as (long term) <b>profitability,</b> and working capital management applies different criteria in allocating resources: the main considerations are (1) cash flow / liquidity and (2) <b>profitability</b> / return on capital (of which cash flow {{is probably the most}} important).|$|E
25|$|IBT Media {{returned}} the publication to <b>profitability</b> on October 8, 2014.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of non-Marxist {{empirical}} studies of the long-term trends in business <b>profitability.</b> Particularly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were concerns among non-Marxist economists that the profit rate could be really falling. From time to time, the research units of banks and government departments produce studies of <b>profitability</b> in various sectors of industry. The National Statistics Office of Britain now releases company <b>profitability</b> statistics every quarter, showing increasing profits. The American-Jewish magazine Tablet claims that “ essential idea, influenced by Ricardo, was that capitalism would become less and less profitable and that its downward spiral toward the abyss of deflation—lower prices, lower profits—would be followed by worldwide revolution. Instead, capitalism has become vastly more profitable.” The McKinsey Global Institute claims that the thirty years from 1985 to 2014 were the golden years for profits from stocks and bonds, but forecasts that average <b>profitability</b> will be lower in future.|$|E
