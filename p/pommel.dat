5|$|Four Egyptian gymnasts, three {{artistic and}} one rhythmic, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Mohamed El-Saharty, the lone male, was invited to London as the highest-ranked African in the individual all-around at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. He was individual all-around Arab Champion in 2011 and 2012, African Champion in 2010 and 2012, and Pan Arab Champion in 2011. At the latter tournament, he had also taken gold in the horizontal bar, the <b>pommel</b> horse, the vault, and the team event. In London his best event was the vault, where he finished 12th. He was 52nd in the horizontal bar, 56th in the floor, 57th in the <b>pommel</b> horse, 61st in the rings, and 65th in the parallel bars. His final rank in the individual all-around was 37th.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 198 events in 23 {{different}} sports were contested at the Montreal Games. In boxing and judo, two bronze medals were awarded for each weight class. In gymnastics, two bronze medals were awarded for third–place ties in the men's <b>pommel</b> horse and men's horizontal bar events, and a second–place tie in the women's vault resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medal awarded for that event.|$|E
5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way tie in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded. In athletics, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's high jump event. In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way tie in the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the <b>pommel</b> horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the horizontal bar, <b>pommel</b> horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the parallel bars meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
50|$|The {{contents}} {{include many}} finely worked {{silver and gold}} sword decorations removed from weaponry, including 66 gold sword hilt collars and many gold hilt plates, some with inlays of cloisonné garnet in zoomorphic designs (see lead picture). The 86 sword <b>pommels</b> found, constitute the largest ever discovery of <b>pommels</b> in a single context, with many different types (some previously unknown) supporting {{the idea that the}} <b>pommels</b> were manufactured over a wide range of time.|$|R
5000|$|Messers do not {{necessarily}} have <b>pommels.</b> Sometimes they may have end caps instead. However, messers with <b>pommels</b> generally are of the type that were 'drawn out' or curved {{to one side of}} the hilt (edge side), a feature known as a [...] "hat-shaped pommel".|$|R

5|$|In the {{gymnastics}} events {{there were}} three athletes placed first for the men's <b>pommel</b> horse, with Paavo Aaltonen, Veikko Huhtanen and Heikki Savolainen all receiving gold medals for Finland in the same event, while no silver or bronze medals were handed out. Meanwhile, in the men's vault, three athletes finished in joint third place and so were awarded a bronze medal each, resulting in five medals being handed out for that one event.|$|E
5|$|Team GB entered nine gymnasts {{into the}} artistic and {{trampoline}} events. Louis Smith, {{in winning the}} bronze medal in the men's <b>pommel</b> horse, became the first ever British gymnast to win an individual apparatus medal in gymnastics, and the first Briton to win any individual gymnastics medal since Walter Tysall won men's all-around medal in 1908. Laura Jones was originally chosen for the artistic gymnastics but, due to a slipped disc in her back, she {{was replaced by the}} reserve Imogen Cairns.|$|E
5|$|Use-wear {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the plates on the <b>pommel</b> and the crossguard {{were made by the}} same artist, while the plates on the grip were added later. The latter – obverse and reverse – were probably decorated in the same workshop and using the same tools, but by two different craftsmen. Moreover, a side plate with a rhombic pattern was added in the 19th century to replace one of the lost inscripted side plates.|$|E

5|$|At finals, {{which took}} place on August 13, Rivera competed in all the events {{in which he had}} {{previously}} participated. He earned 15.250 points on the floor; 16.025 points on the horse vault; 14.375 points on the parallel bars; 14.275 points on the horizontal bar; 15.225 points on the still rings; and 15.025 points on the <b>pommel</b> horse. Overall, he earned 90.175 points and finished in 14th place. Rivera placed ahead of Canadian athlete Adam Wong (98.800 points) and behind German gymnast Philipp David Boy (90.675 points) in a heat led by China's gold medalist Wei Yang (94.575 points) and tailed by China's Chen Yibing (74.225 points).|$|E
5|$|Early {{examples}} of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional {{items such as}} the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, {{thought to have been}} produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at Dalmeny Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with filigree and garnet, similar to sword harness mounts found at Sutton Hoo. There is also a bun-shaped loom from Yetholm, Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian runic inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword <b>pommel</b> from Culbin Sands, Moray and the Burghead drinking horn mount. After Christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland {{to become part of the}} common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} flank, Pickett's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg road and wheeled {{partially}} to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, {{led by the}} brigades of Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper {{on the right and}} Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett on the left; Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead's brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the <b>pommel</b> of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.|$|E

5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the <b>pommel</b> on the pope's chair.|$|E
5|$|William left England {{towards the}} end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the {{continent}} he married his daughter Constance to Alan Fergant, the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king Philip I, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the <b>pommel</b> of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the De Obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, {{has been shown to be}} a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{historically}} notable {{replica of}} Szczerbiec was produced probably in Dresden, Saxony, {{at the time}} when the original was in Prussian hands. It is modest and inexact; the handle is carved in bovine bone and the niello is imitated with black paint. Designs on the handle are patterned on those of the genuine Szczerbiec, except that the crosses and letters on the <b>pommel</b> were replaced with the coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The blade was initially shorter than that of the original, actually typical for a stiletto. It was purchased in Dresden by art historian Edward Rastawiecki, who in 1869 donated it to the archeological collection of the Jagiellonian University of Kraków. The university lost it during the German occupation in World War II. After the war, the replica found itself in the hands of Tadeusz Janowski who smuggled it to the United States in 1947. At around that time, the short stiletto blade was replaced with a long blade of a 16th-century German sword. To imitate Szczerbiec, a slit was cut in the blade and small heraldic shields were attached to it on both sides. During the communist rule in Poland, the Polish American community of Chicago treated the replica as a symbol of Poland's independence. In 1968, it was demonstrated to U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy while he was meeting with Polish Americans during his presidential campaign. Janowski returned the sword to the Jagiellonian University in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Luis Rivera {{represented}} Puerto Rico in artistic gymnastics, and was {{the only}} Puerto Rican gymnast to appear at the Beijing Olympics. Born in Humacao, a city on Puerto Rico's southeastern coast, Rivera has been affiliated with the Federación Puertorriqueña de Gimnasia (English: Puerto Rican Federation of Gymnastics) and participated in Beijing at age 21. He had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the preliminary round, which took place on August 9, Rivera competed against 97 other athletes. During the floor exercise, Rivera scored 15.125 points, placing 24th of the 98 athletes in this event. During the horse vault, Rivera ranked 13th after scoring 16.225 (this was on his first jump; his second jump scored 15.200). Next, during the parallel bars event, Luis Rivera ranked 61st after earning 14.575 points, and later earned 14.675 points in the horizontal bar. Rivera ranked 22nd in the still rings event after earning 15.250 points and placing 22nd, and finished out the qualification round on the <b>pommel</b> horse by ranking 20th with a score of 14.750. Overall, the Puerto Rican gymnast ranked 13th of the 27 advancing athletes, ending with a total score of 90.600 points. He placed ahead of Russia's Maxim Devyatovskiy (90.350 points) and behind Belarus' Dmitry Savitski (90.650 points). He advanced to the final round.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the <b>pommel</b> horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
