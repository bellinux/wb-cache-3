Policy impact is that coming from the application of the SAPARD <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instrument</b> for the period 2000 - 06 in three rural regions. Towards this aim, 8 alternative methods are applied to derive 8 corresponding I-O matrices for every region considered, from which impacts are calculated. The main results from this analysis are the following ones. First, results in terms of impact are influenced by the method employed, although variability among methods is contained. Second, methods would not seem to be affected by territorial dimension, since structure of differences among methods is generally the same in all the regions considered and for any kind of impact es-timated.

40|$|Summary: In 1992 Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary {{signed the}} Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). In time, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, while Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Macedonia joined CEFTA. However, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia left CEFTA on {{entering}} the European Union, which Bulgaria and Romania also joined later. The latter two, however, signed, along with 8 other parties (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and UNMIK Kosovo), the Agreement on Amendment of and Accession to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA 2006) on 19 December 2006. This new CEFTA will replace over thirty bilateral free trade agreements concluded among them. After a short introduction, this paper {{argues that the}} purpose of CEFTA is to enable its members to enter the EU more easily, and thus serves as an instrument of EU accession. Reference is made to the most important benefit of the old CEFTA, which was the common preparation for integration to the EU’s market. By analysing the impact of the old CEFTA as a <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instrument,</b> an analogy is made with the new CEFTA, where emphasis is placed on its role as a regional cooperation instrument. The paper aims to compare the provisions of CEFTA 2006, the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, mainly from the perspective of Croatia. Particular provisions of the Consolidated Version of CEFTA 2006 are discussed separately in the fourth part of this paper...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve and {{promotes}} coherent {{economic and social development}} European Union throughout the last three decades have been engaged, firstly, to promote economic and financial cohesion among the EU Member States, and secondly, as part of its responsibility for global development to support the economic and social development of non-EU members states, both those in the process of becoming EU members. In this context, the EU allocates part of its budget to support the economic and social development objectives of third countries. This assistance is channeled into these countries through a large number of instruments designed according to the specific circumstances and needs of individual groups of countries. The main objective of the cohesion policy is to help reduce economic and social disparities within the EU Member States, and to help prepare the EU-accession countries for effective and efficient implementation of this policy once they become full EU Member States. By promoting cohesion, the EU contributes to a harmonious and sustainable development of the economic activities in the Member States, and also offers structural help to the EU-accession states within the framework of programmers of pre-accession support. Pre-accession programmes – PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD – which de-facto play the role of “external” instruments of economic and social cohesion, finance various programmes in the fields of infrastructure, industry, environment, services, agriculture, rural development and small business. In the next medium-term financial period of the EU, starting in 2007, these three instruments are integrated into a single <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instrument</b> - IPA (Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance).

40|$|Present {{times are}} {{sometimes}} referred to as "the golden era of regulation", as more and more areas of social life are regulated. But regulation is not only increasing; it is also changing. New regulators are emerging, and they are issuing new kinds of rules. These new kinds of regulation are frequently not legally binding, and are therefore labelled soft regulation as opposed to hard law. It is not compulsory to follow soft rules but many actors - including sovereign states - still do, and the thesis asks the question why this is so. Why do even states, which are powerful regulators themselves, abide by soft regulation, and wherein lies the regulative power of soft rules? Through an in-depth study of the European Union's <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instrument</b> Twinning an {{answer to the question of}} the power of soft regulation has been arrived at. Treating Twinning as a critical case of soft regulation, and using theories of imitation to grasp the meaning and evolution of Twinning projects, makes it possible to define three regulative elements involved in soft regulation. These are the combinative, co-productive and constitutive elements of soft regulation, from which the thesis suggests that it derives its power. First of all, soft regulation combines different kinds of rules, the regulation of identity and the regulation of activity, and a variety of sources of legitimacy. Second, it depends on regulators and regulatees interacting to co-produce regulation. And third, as its main result, it constitutes the rule-followers as formal, rational, and modern organisations. Accordingly, soft regulation has rather impressive regulative capabilities, builds on complex, dynamic, and social interactions, and embodies as well as promotes some of Western society's most strongly institutionalised ideas. The thesis argues that it is through these characteristics that actors, including states, are compelled to follow soft rules...|$|E
40|$|The Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) was a <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instrument,</b> {{created and}} {{implemented}} by the European Union since 1999 and aimed at providing logistical support to applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe. The programme had two main components: providing non-refundable financial assistance, by stimulating regional economic growth and development and, at the same time, it was directed at implementing certain management systems that matched the development policies of the EU. The effects triggered by {{the implementation of the}} SAPARD Programme in Romanian tourism were assessed in the past years from various quantitative perspectives (number of projects, value of the granted funding), but the regional economic impact generated strictly by this programme hasn’t yet been explicitly and unequivocally pointed out. From this standpoint, the previous research has been mainly focused on pre/post implementation comparisons of the GDP and of the unemployment rate. On a national level, the Suceava county stands out in terms of the large number of SAPARD projects funded through the Measure 3. 4 – The development and diversification of economic activities to generate multiple activities and alternative income, thus leading to an increasing number of boarding houses in rural areas and, at the same time, fostering the qualitative development of the tourism supply in the area. From our point of view, an analytical approach of the multiplying effect generated by the SAPARD Programme would start from the thorough measurement of the economic changes that have occurred locally, in relation to the weight of the absorbed grants. The preliminary results arrived at in less than 5 years since the suspension of this funding source pinpoint a rather insignificant contribution of these funds to the local economy. The lack of experience of the parties involved in the system, bureaucracy and the migration of the non-refundable money are the most probable causes of the selection and implementation of projects that were rather unsustainable and inadequate in terms of quality...|$|E

40|$|Starting with 1998, {{when the}} process of Romania’s {{accession}} to the EU was officially launched, the legal and institutional framework for regional development policy has been created, followed by the elaboration of the National Development Plan. As the programming document that builds up Romania’s access to the structural-type funds in the pre-accession period and to the structural and cohesion ones after accession to the EU, the NDP responds to both ‘internal necessities’ and ‘external requirements’, revealing {{the philosophy of the}} EU support via <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instruments,</b> which has a twofold significance: on the one hand the financial aid is viewed as a way of reducing economic and social disparities between the candidate and the EU member countries; on the other hand, working with <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instruments,</b> creating the institutional framework for measures implementation, action monitoring and impact evaluation allow the candidate countries’ authorities to get used to European Commission’s procedures and, thus, to be prepared for the administration of the much higher amounted financial funds after accession to the EU. Though, in the case of Romania the institutional framework for regional development policy has suffered a lot of changes since 1998, with negative consequences on the absorption capacity of EU funds, serving as a good example for explaining why so many times Romania has been severely criticised by EU for institutional instability and delays in institutional reform. This paper proposes an analysis of Romania’s regional development policy in the perspective of accession to the European Union, with a particular emphasis on the institutional transformations and future challenges, especially those referring to the post-accession period.

40|$|During the {{programming}} period 2007 - 2013 the Cohesion Policy of EU has adopted and implemented {{the policy of}} territorial co-operation between EU Member States but also between EU and third countries. In this framework, the EU co-finances (through the European Regional Development Fund, the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instrument</b> and the instrument of European neighbourhood policy) a series of cross-border, interregional and transnational co-operation programmes in the Mediterranean Basin. These are programs with economic, political, social and environmental objectives. Specifically, in this area bilateral cross-border co-operation programmes among all EU Mediterranean countries, multinational interregional co-operation programmes (IPA Adriatic, MED ENPI CBC) and transnational co-operation on territorial cohesion of Macro-regions (Programme Med) are implemented. All EU Mediterranean countries {{and most of the}} countries of North Africa and Eastern Mediterranean Sea are eligible to the mentioned programmes. The aim {{of this study is to}} conduct an interim evaluation of these programs and make suggestions for the new programming period for Cohesion Policy 2014 - 2020. After the presentation of the theoretical foundation of territorial cooperation we describe the framework and objectives of EU policy of territorial cooperation in the Mediterranean Macro-region as well as the multilateral and transnational cross border cooperation programmes. In a further step we summarize the main achievements and failures of the territorial cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean. We conclude that there are important differences in the path of implementation of the programmes due to many factors like the experience of the partner countries in planning methods and cooperation schemes, the existence (or not) of cooperation structures and clusters, the source of funds (e. g. ERDF, IPA, ENPI, national co-financing), bureaucracy, the culture of cooperation and in some cases political disputes. The evaluation of other aspects like the organization and management of the programmes, the eligibility of expenditure and the approval process of the projects, the monitoring and implementation procedures, the thematic and geographical allocation of the approved projects, highlight many problems that should be solved in the next programming period 2014 - 2020, in order to improve the effectiveness of the European Territorial cooperation in the Mediterranean Basin and promote economic, social, spatial and environmental cohesion of this macro-region...|$|E

This phase comprises of five interim periods, {{the first and}} second of which occurred in 2010 and the third and fourth occurring in 2011. The main focus was to be on improving chemical and ionising radiation metrology in Turkey through the means of long term and short term training of Turkish scientists. To facilitate this, an administrative arrangement was set up between the contracting authority, the EU Delegation (EUD) in Ankara and the consultant, JRC-IRMM. The enhancement of institutional and measurement capacity (in chemical and ionising radiation metrology) for the main beneficiaries, TÜBİTAK UME and TAEK is an important pillar of the project. Furthermore, the short term training events were to be used to reach as many stakeholders (national laboratories, university laboratories, industrial laboratories) as possible, with TÜBİTAK UME and TAEK facilitating this process. The final aim is to ensure that Turkish laboratories are able to produce traceable and comparable measurement results, leading to improvements in quality of life, and facilitating the adoption of the acquis communautaire related to the free movement of goods. During the course of 2010 and 2011, IRMM hosted 17 long term trainees (total 18) from the beneficiary institutes for a 12 month traineeship, all of whom are intended to transfer the newly gained knowledge to their home institutes and to their networks. The TÜBİTAK UME and TAEK scientists have been trained in metrological aspects of reference material production, primary methods of measurement and ionising radiation metrology. The short term training needs were jointly elaborated by JRC-IRMM, TÜBİTAK UME and TAEK. Thereafter scientists from the four (IRMM) expert groups (i. reference materials, ii. primary methods of measurement, iii. ionising radiation and iv. quality, metrology education and training) arranged and/or provided short term training of Turkish scientists. Senior scientists (from TÜBİTAK UME and TAEK), other external scientists and returning long term trainees also participate in facilitating and lecturing at training workshops. To date, 27 scientific workshops, 10 seminar lectures, 15 study / technical advice visits, 2 conference sessions and 2 conference participations have taken place with a total of 1734 people trained. A further 9 workshops, 6 seminar lectures, 4 study / technical advice visits, 2 conference sessions and 8 conference participations are planned for the remaining ten months.

40|$|The European {{integration}} {{process has been}} characterized by a growing interest for the territorial dimension of community policies. During the last 20 years, the EU elaborated several attempts to correct the growing territorial disequilibria caused by its achievements {{in terms of economic}} integration. The discourse underlying EU territorial interventions and the set of tools and actions explicitly or implicitly focusing on territorial goals is usually referred at as European spatial planning. At the same time, the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 produced a radical change in the perspective of future European integration. The European Council held in Copenhagen in 1993 officially opened a process that in some ten years would have granted the EU membership to ten post-socialist Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia Bulgaria e Romania). Whereas the simultaneous accession of such an heterogeneous group of nations represents a new chance in terms of widening and deepening of European integration, it also represent the hardest challenge faced by the EU throughout its history. The territorial impact of the enlargement appears particularly relevant, with 92 % {{of the population of the}} new member states leaving in regions with a GDP per capita lower than the 75 % of EU average. The described emergencies represented as many potential threat for the process of European integration, leading the European Commission to produce a set of document analyzing the territorial impact of the future enlargement, and to introduce specific tools to support candidate countries' road towards EU membership. For similar reasons, also the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP), by the most defined the proudest achievement of European spatial planning, highlighted the importance to consider CEECs' peculiar reality within the future cohesion policy. The same is true for EU's latest document of territorial guidance, the Territorial Agenda. While at the supranational level the described confrontation was going on, the candidate countries were busy with the complex transition from central economic planning to market economy, having at the same time to deal with the completion of accession requirements and the transposition of the acquis communautaire. Within such a highly fluid institutional environment, new spatial planning systems had to be built, in order to deal with the challenges of the new market-friendly reality. This PhD thesis elaborates on the above considerations, building on the assumptions that the process of European integration under way has led to the development of peculiar institutions and functioning mechanism that involve the different territorial layers within a complex framework of multi-level governance, generating processes of reciprocal contamination and adaptation going under the label Europeanization. Said that, the work explores the characteristic of European territorial governance in the eastward enlargement of the EU. The scientific community is still looking for a shared definition of European territorial governance, mainly due to the different impact of the European dimension on member states' spatial planning systems. In this light, the present dissertation contributes to the debate analyzing, on the one hand, the role of the EU in the evolution of spatial planning systems in the four candidate country of the Visegrad group, on the other hand, the influence of the new challenges of the enlarged European Union on the redefinition of European spatial planning. Looking at European territorial governance from the eastwards enlargement led to interesting findings on the mechanism that stands behind Europeanization. It suggests how the process of reciprocal contamination between European and domestic context were shaped, on the one hand, by CEECs' specific starting conditions, on the other hand, by the highly asymmetric power relations between the different actors attending the accession negotiations. As the candidate countries undertook a radical process of internal restructuring in order to satisfy accession requirements, at the same time the EU had to face its future enlarged configuration and the important territorial challenges coming along with it. The different dimensions of European spatial planning were challenged by the enlargement perspective, and revisited through a process of combined economic rationality and political decision-making. The findings of the research shows how the enlargement influenced the evolution of European territorial policy, leading to the introduction of specific <b>pre-accession</b> <b>instruments</b> directly tackling territorial challenges in candidate countries and to the extension of existing structural programming to Central and eastern Europe. The evolution of European spatial planning tools notwithstanding, several studies shows how, whereas EU interventions produced economic convergence between the different member states, at the same time they led to a widening of internal disparities, especially within the new member states, that may eventually lead to the consolidation of a two-speeds European scenario. This may be explained if one considers that present European spatial policy is still underpinned by approached and metaphors developed during the 1980 s and 1990 s by a north-western rooted epistemic community, that have become outdated and require to be revised taking account the new European reality. Within the scarcely institutionalized scenario of European spatial planning, an important role in developing new spatial ideas and planning approaches is played by the European spatial planning epistemic community. In this concern, EU eastward enlargement constitute an un-precedent opportunity towards the integration of western- and eastern-European actors, whose successful seizing is a crucial step in the perspective of integrating both old and new member states' challenges and priorities within a coherent framework for future action. The above considerations suggest how European territorial governance has been strongly embedded in the characteristics of the enlargement. This outstanding political event opened several windows of opportunity, leading to the evolution of several policy fields at both EU and domestic levels as a result of the interaction between member states, candidate countries and European institutions. Whereas this appears immediate for those policy fields where the EU detains legitimate competences, the present thesis shows that also spatial planning hasn't been immune to the described Europeanization process. Hence, one can say that the enlargement process led to specific mechanism of Europeanization of spatial planning, on the one hand, laying down the pace of the reforms through a tight sequence of deadline and, on the other hand, embedding the interaction of the different actors in a complex network of power relations. Within the described framework, European territorial governance in the eastwards enlargement appears as a highly asymmetric field, reflecting the roles and power of member states, candidate countries and European institutions in the accession negotiation. The EU could count on candidates' will to obtain EU membership and to benefit from financial incentives in order to apply a "systematic pressure" on domestic reforms, promoting the adoption of specific rules and priorities through conditionality mechanisms. On the other hand the candidate countries exercised almost no influence on European spatial planning, the evolution of the latter being the result of a process occurred within decision-making arenas where they had few or no contractual power vis-à-vis existing member state...|$|R
