5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great phenotypic <b>plasticity</b> (changing its developmental rate {{in response}} {{to changes in the}} environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this <b>plasticity</b> is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{evolutionary}} {{developmental biology}} (eco-evo-devo) integrates research from developmental biology and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with evolutionary theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as developmental <b>plasticity,</b> epigenetic inheritance, genetic assimilation, niche construction and symbiosis.|$|E
5|$|LTP is persistent, lasting {{from several}} minutes to many months, {{and it is}} this {{persistence}} that separates LTP from other forms of synaptic <b>plasticity.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is one {{of several}} {{phenomena}} underlying synaptic <b>plasticity,</b> the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength. As memories are thought to be encoded by modification of synaptic strength, LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|Normally brain {{electrical}} activity is non-synchronous. Its activity is regulated by various factors {{both within the}} neuron and the cellular environment. Factors within the neuron include the type, number and distribution of ion channels, changes to receptors and changes of gene expression. Factors around the neuron include ion concentrations, synaptic <b>plasticity</b> and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced <b>Plasticity</b> (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced <b>Plasticity</b> (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural <b>plasticity</b> known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E
5|$|The role of LTP in {{disease is}} less clear than its role in basic {{mechanisms}} of synaptic <b>plasticity.</b> However, alterations in LTP may contribute {{to a number of}} neurological diseases, including depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain. Impaired LTP may also have a role in Alzheimer's disease and drug addiction.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{synaptic}} <b>plasticity</b> acts on a timescale {{of tens of}} milliseconds to a {{few minutes}} unlike long-term <b>plasticity,</b> which lasts from minutes to hours. Short term <b>plasticity</b> can either strengthen or weaken a synapse.|$|E
25|$|Changes in excitability from {{learning}} {{that act as}} part of the memory trace do so as primers to initiate further changes in the neurons or by a short-term storage mechanism for short-term memory. Nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> can emerge during learning as a result of cellular processes, although the timing, persistence, and the relationship between nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> and synaptic output are all poorly understood. Studies have shown that nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> plays an indirect but important role in the formation of memories. Learning-induced nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> is associated with soma depolarization.|$|E
25|$|In {{this new}} {{biological}} psychiatry viewpoint, neuronal <b>plasticity</b> {{is a key}} element. Increasing evidence points to various mental health disorders as a neurophysiological problem which inhibits neuronal <b>plasticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the single}} cell level, {{synaptic}} <b>plasticity</b> refers {{to changes in}} the connections between neurons, whereas non-synaptic <b>plasticity</b> refers {{to changes in the}}ir intrinsic excitability.|$|E
25|$|In {{predictive}} coding, optimising model parameters {{through a}} gradient ascent {{on the time}} integral of free energy (free action) reduces to associative or Hebbian <b>plasticity</b> and is associated with synaptic <b>plasticity</b> in the brain.|$|E
25|$|In eyeblink {{conditioning}} in rabbits, nonsynaptic changes occurred {{throughout the}} dorsal hippocampus. This indicates that although excitability changes alone {{are not enough}} to explain memory storage processes, nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> might be a storage mechanism for phases of memory limited by time. Nonsynaptic changes influence other types of <b>plasticity</b> involved with memory. For example, a nonsynaptic change such as depolarization of the resting membrane potential resulting from conditional learning could cause synaptic <b>plasticity</b> in future learning.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Karl Lashley {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} rhesus monkeys that demonstrated changes in neuronal pathways, which he concluded were evidence of <b>plasticity.</b> Despite this, and other research that suggested <b>plasticity</b> took place, neuroscientists did not widely {{accept the idea}} of neuroplasticity.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} learn rules is {{dependent}} on nonsynaptic <b>plasticity.</b> One study sought to teach rats to discriminate between various odors, and it took several days {{to teach them to}} distinguish between a first pair of smells. However, after learning this, the rat was able to learn to distinguish between different odors much faster. Changes in excitability of the pyramidal neurons in these rats were observed for three days after training. These changes faded eventually, suggesting that the neurons were involved in learning the rules, not in storing memory. Daoudal and Debanne attempted to determine if the same learning rules and induction mechanisms defined for synaptic <b>plasticity</b> also applied to nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> affecting ion channels. They determined that nonsynaptic and synaptic <b>plasticity</b> share common learning rules and induction pathways, e.g., NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). They also showed that nonsynaptic and synaptic <b>plasticity</b> synergistically form a coherent engram to store memory traces.|$|E
25|$|Every kind of {{synaptic}} <b>plasticity</b> {{has different}} computational uses.|$|E
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their <b>plasticity.</b> Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower <b>plasticity.</b> In soil mechanics, <b>plasticity</b> is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower <b>plasticity</b> and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, a whole {{genome study}} of the DNA {{differences}} between wolves and dogs found that dogs did not show a reduced fear response but did show greater synaptic <b>plasticity.</b> Synaptic <b>plasticity</b> is widely {{believed to be the}} cellular correlate of learning and memory, and this change may have altered the learning and memory abilities of dogs in comparison to wolves.|$|E
25|$|NMDA induces a calcium flux {{that allows}} for {{synaptic}} <b>plasticity</b> which is crucial for AHN.|$|E
25|$|Plastic change {{often results}} from the {{alteration}} {{of the number of}} neurotransmitter receptors located on a synapse. There are several underlying mechanisms that cooperate to achieve synaptic <b>plasticity,</b> including changes in the quantity of neurotransmitters released into a synapse and changes in how effectively cells respond to those neurotransmitters. Synaptic <b>plasticity</b> in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses {{has been found to be}} dependent upon postsynaptic calcium release.|$|E

25|$|Patterns {{of sensory}} input {{provided}} during locomotor training {{are critical for}} driving the <b>plasticity</b> that mediates locomotor recovery.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{facilitation}} {{has been}} demonstrated to serve as both working memory and mapping input for readout, short-term depression for removing auto-correlation. Long-term potentiation is used for spatial memory storage while long-term depression for both encoding space features, selective weakening of synapses and clearing old memory traces respectively. Forward spike-timing-dependent <b>plasticity</b> is used for long range temporal correlation, temporal coding and spatiotemporal coding. The reversed spike-timing-dependent <b>plasticity</b> acts as sensory filtering.|$|E
25|$|Trk receptors are {{a family}} of {{tyrosine}} kinases that regulates synaptic strength and <b>plasticity</b> in the mammalian nervous system.|$|E
25|$|In neuroscience, {{synaptic}} <b>plasticity</b> is {{the ability}} of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increases or decreases in their activity.|$|E
25|$|The storage {{capacity}} of synaptic-based memory storage systems is very large, {{making it an}} attractive mechanism to study. There are approximately 104 synapses per neuron and 1011 neurons in the human brain. Nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> is often overlooked simply because its {{storage capacity}} is not as high. Regulating the density of ion channels in the axon and soma of a neuron would change the throughput and affect all of the synapses. Therefore, its storage capacity would be significantly {{less than that of}} synaptic <b>plasticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{the ability}} of a {{particular}} part or region of a neuron to change in strength over time. There are two largely recognized categories of plasticity: synaptic and nonsynaptic. Synaptic <b>plasticity</b> deals directly with the strength of the connection between two neurons, including amount of neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic neuron, and the response generated in the postsynaptic neuron. Nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> involves modification of neuronal excitability in the axon, dendrites, and soma of an individual neuron, remote from the synapse.|$|E
25|$|Marian Diamond of the University of California, Berkeley, {{produced}} the first scientific evidence of anatomical brain <b>plasticity,</b> publishing her research in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{indicated}} that animals suffering from spinal cord injuries showed significant improvement in motor capabilities even with a long delay in treatment after the injury when exposed to environmental enrichment. Social interactions, exercise, and novelty all play major roles in aiding the recovery of an injured subject. This has led to some suggestions that the spinal cord has a continued <b>plasticity</b> and all efforts must be made for enriched environments to stimulate this <b>plasticity</b> in order to aid recovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} {{understanding of}} brain <b>plasticity</b> (neuroplasticity) raises questions of whether some brain differences {{may be caused}} by mental illnesses, rather than pre-existing and causing them.|$|E
25|$|A greater {{density of}} grey {{matter in the}} {{inferior}} parietal cortex is present in multilingual individuals. It {{has been found that}} multilingualism affects the structure, and essentially, the cytoarchitecture of the brain. Learning multiple languages re-structures the brain and some researchers argue that it increases the brain's capacity for <b>plasticity.</b> Most of these differences in brain structures in multilinguals may be genetic at the core. Consensus is still muddled; it may be a mixture of both—experiential (acquiring languages during life) and genetic (predisposition to brain <b>plasticity).</b>|$|E
25|$|Early {{acquisition}} of relative pitch allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with brain <b>plasticity,</b> these processes {{become more and}} more stable. However, this process expresses a degree of circular logic in that the more learning that takes place, the greater the stability of the processes, ultimately decreasing overall brain <b>plasticity.</b> This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults have to put into mastering new tasks.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{following}} the initial formative period, the SC {{does not appear}} to display any neural <b>plasticity.</b> Despite this, habituation and sensititisation over the long term is known to exist in orientation behaviors. This apparent <b>plasticity</b> in function has been attributed to the adaptability of the AES. That is, although neurons in the SC have a fixed magnitude of output per unit input, and essentially operate an all or nothing response, the level of neural firing can be more finely tuned by variations in input by the AES.|$|E
25|$|The {{modification}} of synaptic strength {{is referred to}} as functional <b>plasticity.</b> Changes in synaptic strength involve distinct mechanisms of particular types of glial cells, the most researched type being astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|Organisms face a {{succession}} of environmental challenges as they grow, and show adaptive <b>plasticity</b> as traits develop {{in response to the}} imposed conditions. This gives them resilience to varying environments.|$|E
