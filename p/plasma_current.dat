In the stabilised pinch machines, most of the magnetic field in the plasma was generated by the current induced in it. The strength of the external stabilisation fields was much lower and only penetrated into the outer layers of the plasma mass. The tokamak reversed this; the external magnets were much more powerful and the <b>plasma</b> <b>current</b> greatly reduced in comparison. Artsimovitch put it this way: ...|$|E
