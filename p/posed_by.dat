5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission {{a study to}} look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E

5|$|During late 1999 No.75 Squadron {{was placed}} on alert to provide close air support and air defence to protect the {{international}} forces which had deployed to East Timor as part of INTERFET.

5|$|During {{the weekend}} of June 13–14, 2015, a large swarm of mayflies caused several {{vehicular}} accidents on the Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge, carrying Pennsylvania Route 462 across the Susquehanna River between Columbia and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. The bridge had to be closed to traffic twice during that period due to impaired visibility and obstructions <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> piles of dead insects.|$|E
5|$|Hazards <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> {{titanium}} tetrachloride generally {{arise from the}} release of hydrogen chloride (HCl). TiCl4 is a strong Lewis acid, exothermically forming adducts with even weak bases such as THF and explosively with water, releasing HCl.|$|E

5|$|Lanfranc {{remained}} {{concerned about}} the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Odo, and authorised William to improve the defences at Eynsford. The work was probably carried out between 1085 and 1087, and enclosed the former burh with a stone curtain wall to form a castle.|$|E
5|$|The 1969 fire raised public {{awareness}} of potential hazards <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the plant and led to years of increasing citizen protests and demands for plant closure. Releases from previous years had not been reported publicly prior to the fire; airborne-become-groundborne radioactive contamination extending well beyond the Rocky Flats plant was not publicly reported until the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Sanskrit text of this Upanishad has six chapters. Sage Yajnavalkya answers {{questions}} in the first five, wherein the questions are <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Brihaspati, Atri, students of Brahman-Atman, King Janaka and by Atri again. The last chapter lists the names of famous sages who were model sannyasis (renunciates).|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, {{to combat the}} threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Soviet Navy and other fleets of the Warsaw Pact. It ceased to exist in 1969 when it was subsumed into the newly formed Strike Command, which had also absorbed the former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later also absorbed Air Support Command, the former Transport Command.|$|E
5|$|Amongst the line's 27 {{substantial}} structures, {{the greatest}} engineering challenge was <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> {{the point where}} the track met the Edinburgh City Bypass. At that point, a tunnel had to be constructed under the A720 road while it had been temporarily diverted; in total, the project incorporated five new associated road schemes. Major challenges were also <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> abandoned mine shafts {{to the north of the}} route, some of which dated to the 16th century and had not been mapped. More than 200 bridges were involved in the scheme, as the route crosses the Gala Water and River Tweed nineteen times. One of the most vital bridges on the line carries the track over Hardengreen roundabout on the A7, and required extensive works throughout 2013. Other works included digging out an infilled cutting on the outskirts of Galashiels and reconstructing a nearby bridge to allow the line to pass under power lines.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was first}} {{published}} in the UK on 13 October 2010 by Palgrave Macmillan in paperback, hardback and eBook formats. It was the first book to appear as part of the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series, a partnership between Palgrave Macmillan and the Ferrata Mora Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics. The series's general editors are Andrew Linzey and Priscilla N. Cohn. Interdisciplinary in focus, the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series aims to explore the practical and conceptual challenges <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> animal ethics.|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, {{even trying to}} take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was {{reported}} that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
