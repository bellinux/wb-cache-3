Uni-path Routing Protocol {{wireless}} mobile nodes making a network with dynamically changing topology without using To identify the routes and maintain the any <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> as a base station. To create connectivity among nodes more than path {{till the end of}} communication from single hop is needed due to low transmission source and destination. In MANET, there are range. Increasing of mobile nodes enhances this overhead. Many standards have been developed two main kinds of the routing protocol: on-for transmission and to find effective routes from demand protocols (also called reactive a source to some destination. In this paper, we have analyzed the main protocols and issues of protocols) and table-based protocols (also routing in MANETs. called proactive protocols) [1] ~ [5]. In reactiv...|$|E

MethodsSelected characteristics were abstracted from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS) Wave 2. Logistic regression was used to estimate the independent contribution of specific characteristics in predicting whether the initial <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> placed was an arteriovenous (AV) fistula compared with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, and in predicting whether <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> (fistula or graft) was in place at the initiation of dialysis. ResultsSixty-seven percent of the patients had an AV graft placed as their first <b>permanent</b> <b>access.</b> Characteristics important in predicting if a fistula was initially placed included age (per decade; aOR = 0. 84, P < 0. 001), female gender (aOR = 0. 52, P < 0. 001), body mass index (per standard deviation; aOR = 0. 70, P = 0. 09), avoiding blood draws (aOR = 1. 96, P < 0. 001), ability to ambulate (aOR = 2. 24, P = 0. 008), underlying renal disease (glomerular compared with diabetes, aOR = 2. 19, P = 0. 009), college education (aOR = 1. 72, P = 0. 002), and sharing in decision making (aOR = 1. 50, P = 0. 02). Thirty-four percent of patients (34. 4 %) had functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of HD. Characteristics important in predicting which patients had functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> included serum albumin (per 1 mg/dL increase, aOR = 1. 55, P = 0. 003), erythropoietin prior to starting HD (aOR = 1. 79, P = 0. 002), fewer predialysis nephrologist visits (aOR = 0. 21, P < 0. 001), and when the patient was told they had renal disease (aOR = 0. 33, P = 0. 002). ConclusionsPTFE grafts were the most common initial <b>permanent</b> <b>access.</b> The majority of patients did not have <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of dialysis. Factors that are thought to compromise identification of adequate veins were important predictors of PTFE graft placement. <b>Permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of HD was largely a function of early patient education and early referral to a nephrologist...|$|R

Presentation mode (planned vs. unplanned), and access type (central venous catheters [CVC] vs. <b>permanent</b> <b>access)</b> at initiation of HD were evaluated, {{and the influence of}} predialysis care on determining the mode of HD and access type was also assessed. Most patients started unplanned HD (81. 9 %) and the most common initial access type was CVC (86. 3 %). The main reason for unplanned HD and high rate of CVC use was patient-related factors such as refusal of <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> creation and failure to attend scheduled clinic appointments. Predialysis care was performed in 57. 9 % of patients and only 24. 1 % of these patients started planned HD and 18. 9 % used <b>permanent</b> <b>accesses</b> initially.

For each age group, we examined the percentage of patients that had and had not received a <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> by 1 year after cohort entry, and the percentage {{in each of these}} groups that died, started dialysis, or survived without dialysis. We also modeled the number of unnecessary procedures that would have occurred in theoretical scenarios based on existing vascular access guidelines. The mean eGFR was 17. 7 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 at cohort entry. Twenty-five percent (n= 2870) of patients initiated dialysis within a year of cohort entry. Among these, only 39 % (n= 1104) had undergone surgery to place a <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> beforehand. As compared with younger patients, older patients were less likely to undergo <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> surgery, but also less likely to start dialysis. In all theoretical scenarios examined, older patients would have been more likely than younger patients to receive unnecessary procedures. If all patients had been referred for <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> surgery at cohort entry, the ratio of unnecessary to necessary procedures after 2 years of follow-up would have been 5 : 1 for patients aged 85 – 100 years but only 0. 5 : 1 for those aged 18 – 44 years.
