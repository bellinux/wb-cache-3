5|$|In 2003, {{the company}} managed {{to cover it}} costs, and the company stated that it hoped to have a revenue of NOK 30 million the {{following}} year, through an ambitious expansion plan. A <b>private</b> <b>offering</b> for NOK 8 million was issued to allow this expansion. Among the purchasers was the Municipality of Narvik and Narvik Port Authority. In March, Chair Rune Arnøy was forced to withdraw after accusations of conflict of interest, since he was both chair of Ofotbanen and harbormaster at the Port of Narvik. CargoNet, a freight competitor of Ofotbanen, had {{felt that they were}} being unfairly treated by the port after the municipality had bought shares in Ofotbanen and appointed Arnøy as chair. The legality of the port's purchase of the shares was considered by the Norwegian Coastal Administration; though deemed legal, the port authority was required to sell the shares within three years. In April, Ofotbanen received a permit to operate in Sweden, and started offering charter trains between Narvik and Kiruna in Sweden, primarily for cruise ship passengers. It also announced {{that it was going to}} bid for the public service obligations for subsidized passenger railway transport that the government was planning to conduct in 2006. In June, Ofotbanen received permission to operate freight trains throughout the entire railway network in Norway. This was the first time such permission was granted to a different company than NSB or its subsidiaries.|$|E

40|$|Investment in <b>private</b> <b>offerings</b> of securities, {{those that}} take place off of public exchanges and that are exempt from federal {{disclosure}} rules applicable to public offerings, is primarily available to investors {{on the basis of}} wealth. The wealthy are presumed sophisticated enough to make informed decisions about what to buy without mandatory disclosures applicable to public offerings. Yet the financial crisis of 2008 made clear that wealthy and ostensibly sophisticated investors can make tremendous mistakes and suffer enormous losses. Those losses are a problem when the investor serves a public goal, such as providing income to public sector employees.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the seventy year {{history of the}} general solicitation prohibition during <b>private</b> <b>offerings</b> and then analyzes its continuing relevance as applied to Section 3 (c) (7) offerings. The S. E. C. Staff recently issued a report questioning the continuing value of prohibiting general solicitation during <b>private</b> <b>offerings</b> made pursuant to Section 3 (c) (7) of the Investment Company Act. If the S. E. C. were to follow the recommendation in the S. E. C. Staff Report, this would have tremendous implications for {{a growing number of}} hedge funds, and other investment companies utilizing the Section 3 (c) (7) exemption. By allowing general solicitation, the S. E. C. would be reversing a policy with over seventy years of history in order to increase issuers’ access to capital. These potential efficiency gains could come at a cost, however, since many fear that repealing the prohibition against general solicitation will eliminate one more protection for individual investors from risky investment opportunities...|$|R
