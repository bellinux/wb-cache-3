5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> manganese grinders.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
25|$|The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding amitriptyline in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to {{the risk}} {{for a lack of}} efficacy and side effects, respectively.

If use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.|$|R

To this end the authors conducted a qualitative inquiry among health professionals (n = 53) and older <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> frail (n = 16). Participants formulated core competencies and educational needs for SDM with older <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> frail, which were further explored in the literature.

The authors' teaching framework for SDM with older <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> frail may be useful for clinicians, educators, and researchers who aim to promote SDM with older <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> frail...|$|R
5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
