2500|$|Anna Esther Svidersky (April 26, 1988 [...] April 20, 2006) was a {{teenager}} {{who lived in the}} U.S. city of Vancouver, Washington, and was murdered while working in a McDonald's restaurant, by David Barton Sullivan, a schizophrenic twice-convicted sex offender. News of her death quickly spread worldwide, initially through the Internet friends site MySpace, where she had a <b>personal</b> <b>page,</b> and then through other similar sites. The widespread expression of grief over Anna's death by strangers around the world was compared by The Guardian newspaper in Britain to that seen after Diana, Princess of Wales' death.|$|E
2500|$|Axelrod is {{credited}} with implementing a strategy that encourages the participation of people, a lesson drawn partly from Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign {{as well as a}} personal goal of Barack Obama. Axelrod explained to Rolling Stone, [...] "When we started this race, Barack told us that he wanted the campaign to be a vehicle for involving people and giving them a stake in the kind of organizing he believed in. [...] According to Axelrod getting volunteers involved became the legacy of the campaign [...] " [...] This includes drawing on [...] "Web 2.0" [...] technology and viral media to support a grassroots strategy. Obama's web platform allows supporters to blog, create their own <b>personal</b> <b>page,</b> and even phonebank from home. Axelrod's elaborate use of the Internet helped Obama to organize under-30 voters and build over 475,000 donors in 2007, most of whom were Internet donors contributing less than $100 each. The Obama strategy stood in contrast to Hillary Clinton's campaign, which benefited from high name recognition, large donors and strong support among established Democratic leaders.|$|E

In particular, I reflect on two broad categories: 1) the usefulness of wiki features (wiki authoring, wiki mark-up, and interaction / collaboration) to authoring personal home pages; 2) the other features (structure, designing looks, and access control) needed to make a wiki approach to <b>personal</b> home <b>pages</b> viable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—There is a {{real threat}} on the VIPs <b>personal</b> <b>pages</b> on the Social Network Sites (SNS). The real threats to these pages is {{violation}} of privacy and theft of identity through creating fake pages that exploit their names and pictures to attract the victims and spread of lies. In this paper, we propose a new secure architecture that improves the trusting and finds an effective solution to reduce fake pages and possibility of recognizing VIP pages on SNS. The proposed architecture works as a third party that is added to Facebook to provide the trust service to <b>personal</b> <b>pages</b> for VIPs. Through this mechanism, it works to ensure the real identity of the applicant through the electronic authentication of personal information by storing this information within content of their website. As a result, {{the significance of the}} proposed architecture is that it secures and provides trust to the VIPs <b>personal</b> <b>pages.</b> Furthermore, it can help to discover fake page, protect the privacy, reduce crimes of personality-theft, and increase the sense of trust and satisfaction by friends and admirers in interacting with SNS...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of influent profiles on Twitter {{and how their}} credibility is forged are similar to newsmaking and to agenda-setting. Since {{some of the most}} popular users on that social network are not directly related to traditional mass media, it would be pertinent the adoption of the journalistic discourse on what is supposed to be published or not on their <b>personal</b> <b>pages.</b> From taking a part in one discourse, and the exposed timeline coherence of a profile, those social actors would become influent since their published content shows credibility, establishing, consequently, a reliable relationship and extended reach to their tweets. That is because of establishment of periodicity and connection through facts posted on their <b>personal</b> <b>pages...</b>|$|R
