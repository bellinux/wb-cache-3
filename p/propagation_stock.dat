40|$|Efficient {{control of}} Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae, the causal agent of anthurium {{bacterial}} blight, requires a sensitive and reliable diagnostic tool. A nested PCR test was developed from a sequence-characterized amplified region marker identified by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR {{for the detection}} of X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae. Serological and pathogenicity tests were performed concurrently with the nested PCR test with a large collection of X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae strains that were isolated worldwide and are pathogenic to anthurium and/or other aroids. The internal primer pair directed amplification of the expected product (785 bp) for all 70 X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae strains pathogenic to anthurium tested and for isolates originating from syngonium and not pathogenic to anthurium. This finding is consistent with previous studies which indicated that there is a high level of relatedness between strains from anthurium and strains from syngonium. Strains originating from the two host genera can be distinguished by restriction analysis of the amplification product. No amplification product was obtained with 98 strains of unrelated phytopathogenic bacteria or saprophytic bacteria from the anthurium phyllosphere, except for a weak signal obtained for one X. axonopodis pv. allii strain. Nevertheless, restriction enzyme analysis permitted the two pathovars to be distinguished. The detection threshold obtained with pure cultures or plant extracts (103 CFU ml− 1) allowed detection of the pathogen from symptomless contaminated plants. This test could be a useful diagnostic tool for screening <b>propagation</b> <b>stock</b> plant material and for monitoring international movement of X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae...|$|E
40|$|Verticillium wilt, {{caused by}} the fungus Verticillium dahliae, is {{currently}} the most important disease affecting olive in the Mediterranean basin. There are no effective treatments for controlling this disease. The use of infected nursery stocks has largely contributed {{to the spread of}} the pathogen, and therefore the development of treatments to preventively sanitize the <b>propagation</b> <b>stock</b> is critical in the nursery industry. This study describes novel techniques to achieve this aim. The effects of several temperature–exposure time combinations were evaluated: (i) the survival of pathogen on culture medium (PDA); (ii) the pathogen viability on infected shoots and plants; (iii) the vegetative growth of plants of several cultivars; and (iv) the rooting ability of cuttings. The colonies of the pathogen growing in PDA were killed after 8 h and 60 min of exposure at 40 and 47 °C, respectively. Temperatures ≥ 42 °C for at least 2 h were lethal for the pathogen infecting the shoots. Likewise, moist hot air treatments at 42 – 44 °C for 6 – 12 h eradicated the pathogen, without compromising the viability of the plants. Five olive cultivars were also evaluated and classified according to their thermotolerance as follows: sensitive (Chiquitita), moderately sensitive (Koroneiki, Frantoio and Picual) and heat tolerant (Arbequina). However, the optimized sanitation methods were applicable to all of the cultivars. Finally, heat treatments were applied to unrooted cuttings, which severely affected their rooting ability. Thus, this study developed a hot air treatment to produce V. dahliae-free olive nursery plants.

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of the dynamics of structural parameters of fish fauna of the Kanev reservoir, we determined the major measures for artificial fish <b>propagation</b> (<b>stocking),</b> which would allow increasing their commercial stocks and maintain biological diversity. It was found that main biological factors, which defined the conditions of existence of fish at different stages of their life cycle in the Kanev reservoir was as a whole favorable for providing sufficient efficiency of measures for stocking it with juveniles of commercially and environmentally valuable fishes. With current state of fish fauna and possibilities of fish hatcheries, the priority in the part of artificial maintenance of fish populations should be given to pike-perch, wels, and tench. An increase of amounts of commercial catches should be based first of all on full-scale stocking with silver and bighead carps, the created stock of which will be available for effective exploitation at a regime, which is protective for native fish fauna.

The analysis showed that microsatellite clustering does not fully match the six DTUs, but it is relevant for the within DTUs analyses. Population genetics analysis was conducted on 11 relevant subsamples of stocks from Bolivia and Peru, belonging to TcI (6) and TcV (5), defined by four criterions: DTU, vector species, geographic origin, and date of isolation. Most TcV strains presented the same multilocus genotype over all subsamples with the puzzling characteristic that five loci were heterozygous and the other five homozygous. In TcI, four clusters were defined according to the vector species. Most of them appeared in agreement with clonal <b>propagation</b> (<b>stocks</b> isolated from Triatoma infestans and Triatoma sordida), while a few highly homozygous stocks (e. g. those isolated from Rhodnius stali) suggested that scarce sex events can occur.

40|$|Native {{plant species}} are {{routinely}} planted or sown in ecological restoration projects, but successful establishment and survival depend on {{where and how}} seeds are collected. Research {{suggests that it is}} important to use locally adapted seeds. Local populations often show a home-site advantage and non-local genotypes may be maladapted to local environmental conditions. Furthermore, intraspecific hybridisation of local and non-local genotypes may have a negative impact on the genetic structure of local populations via mechanisms such as outbreeding depression. Many species show a strong small-scale genetic differentiation between different habitats so that matching habitats of the restoration and donor site can be more important than minimizing geographical separation. It is a challenge to identify appropriate seed sources because strong small-scale population differentiation makes it difficult to delineate geographically defined seed zones to which seed exchange should be limited. Moreover, it is important to consider the genetic diversity of introduced material because it may be crucial to avoid genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding depression and poor establishment of plant populations. Repeated <b>propagation</b> in <b>stock,</b> which is often required to obtain a sufficient amount of seeds, can further reduce genetic diversity and may select for particular genotypes. Negative impacts of improper seed choice for nursery planting stock may become detectable only after many years, especially in long-lived and slow growing plants. Although scientific information on many species remains limited, the increasing demand for translocation of seed means that mandatory regulations are necessary. Guidelines should prescribe a specification of seed provenance, a record of genetic diversity of wild collections and rules for subsequent processing such as direct transfer and <b>propagation</b> of <b>stock</b> or seed orchards.

40|$|To {{construct}} recombinant adenoviruses expressing biologically active proteins may be impossible, or {{result in}} {{a significant reduction in}} virus yield, if the protein expressed has an inhibitory effect on virus replication or cellular growth. To overcome this problem, we previously designed adenovirus vectors expressing foreign proteins from inducible promoters. However, during our work with a replication-deficient virus expressing the ASF/SF 2 splicing factor from a progesterone antagonist-inducible gene cassette, we discovered that ASF/SF 2 was expressed at a significant level in the 293 producer cell line, {{even in the absence of}} inducer. 293 cells code for adenovirus E 1 A and E 1 B proteins and thus support the growth of E 1 -deficient adenoviruses.

We used a commercial line divergently selected for either low or high carrier-state resistance both in young chicks and in adult hens. In divergent chick lines, one QTL on chromosome 1 and one in the SLC 11 A 1 region were significantly associated with carrier-state resistance variations; in divergent adult lines, one QTL located in the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 16 and one in the SLC 11 A 1 region were involved in these variations.

Blends incorporating 100 % GWC were found to have limited success in short term bedding plant applications, producing plants of lesser height, width and overall fresh and dry weight when compared to the Control. Blends that incorporated 50 % GWC: 50 % Coir were illustrated to perform as well as the Control substrate in short term applications. In longer term applications, such as perennial bedding and hardy nursery stock production, a change in the performance of the 100 % GWC was noted to improve over time.

50|$|The yellowfin madtom is federally {{listed as}} a {{threatened}} species and as endangered in both Tennessee and Virginia. Agricultural practices around the shallow creeks and streams where N. flavipinnis resides have decreased the population and {{made it difficult for}} them to recover. Efforts to increase their population began in 1986 at the University of Tennessee and later moved to Conservation Fisheries, Inc. (CFI) in Knoxville. Since the population was too low to take individuals away from Citico Creek, eggs were taken from nests and reared in aquatic laboratories at CFI. CFI was also allowed to maintain a captive adult population to breed inside their aquatic laboratories. From 1986 until 2003, two to three yellowfin madtom clutches were taken from Citico Creek for captive <b>propagation</b> to be <b>stocked</b> into Abrams Creek. Finally, the captured fish were released into both Abrams Creek and Citico Creek irregularly to try to restore a population and save a population, respectively. The yellowfin madtom has had a 53% survival rate among its captured egg clutches, and new fish have been found in Abrams Creek almost every year since 1994. In 2003, though only 9 yellowfin madtom were found in Abrams Creek, they were believed to be wild-spawned, since tagged fish had not been released since 2001, marking what looks to have been a successful project in restoring them in Abrams Creek. To help the restoration project in Abrams Creek, the National Park Service, US Forest Service, University of Tennessee, and Tennessee Valley Authority have taken up the duty to improve the water and habitat of Abrams Creek. The groups helped to remove cattle and restore riparian vegetation around Abrams Creek and its tributaries. The hope is that the restoration of the Abrams Creek habitat decreases its silt content which has been proven to be the yellowfin madtom’s worst enemy. Since 1986, populations of the yellowfin madtom from Citico Creek have been captured and bred in laboratory to be reintroduced into Abrams Creek in Blount County, Tennessee, which in 1957 had half of its 64 species extirpated by ichthyocides with the intention to increase trout fishery. From 1986 until 2003, the population of the yellowfin madtom in Abrams Creek has increased to 1574. Currently, they are no longer stocked and released into Abrams Creek.|$|R

Jefferson, also, alludes to the subject in some of his letters, apparently, in answer to a philosophical inquiry from one of his friends. He estimates the whole number of persons transported to the American colonies, under sentence from the courts, at about two thousand; and, taking into consideration their habits, he was of opinion, half a century ago, that their descendants did not probably exceed the original stock. I do not know where Mr. Jefferson obtained his data for this estimate, but he did not show his ordinary acuteness in ascribing the reason why the convicts left few or no issue.

40|$|The Philippines is {{endowed with}} the rich natural {{resources}} inherent in many tropical countries. The plant species are so diverse that many plant forms have become integral components {{in the way of}} life of many Filipinos. Aside from the woody trees that are the major and dominant components of forest ecosystems, rattans are considered as highly important non-wood forest resources. Over time the rattans became very important sources of livelihood and the mainstays of the global cane industry common to most ASEAN countries. In a recent report, the Philippines was regarded as the centre of the rattan furniture industry and highly acclaimed with the best and most elegant designs known in the world. Rattan poles and finished products have been the top exports. Like any forest product derived from the wild in high demand, rattans in natural stands suffered from heavy extraction. Such pressure was felt in the 1970 s, prompting the government to impose a ban on the export of raw materials. This situation was however, partly addressed by replenishing the raw materials by artificial means through plantation establishment. Interest was sustained in rattan nursery improvement because of the governments’ policy of using rattans as reforestation species to rehabilitate watershed areas with added productive value, along with other commercial species. The integration of rattans in forest plantation development opened avenues for livelihood development options for upland dwellers on one hand and for future augmentation of supply of resources on the other. Government projects and tenurial agreements that include rattan are the Upland Development Projects (UDP), Community Forestry Projects (CFP), the Community Based Forest Management (CBFM), the Socialized Integrated Forest Management Agreement (SIFMA) and the Integrated Forest Management Agreement (IFMA). In the private sector the National Development Corporation in collaboration with the Paper Industries Corporation and what was then Provident Farms, Inc. engaged in massive plantation development on a commercial scale. This developed opportunities to explore practical methods of rattan nursery protocols, including seed germination. One step towards the establishment of a plantation is the <b>propagation</b> of planting <b>stock</b> in the nursery.

40|$|The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty {{requires}} {{the ability to}} detect low-yield (less than 150 kton) nuclear events. This kind of monitoring can only be done seismically on a regional scale (within 2000 km). At this level, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between low-yield nuclear events and non-nuclear events of similar magnitude. In order to confidently identify a nuclear event, a more detailed understanding of nuclear seismic sources is needed. In particular, {{it is important to know}} the effects of local geology on the seismic signal. This study focuses on P-wave velocity in heterogeneous granitoid. The Source Physics Experiment (SPE) is currently performing low-yield tests with chemical explosives at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). The exact test site was chosen to be in the Climax Stock, a cretaceous granodiorite and quartz-monzonite pluton located in Area 15 of the NNSS. It has been used in the past for the Hard Hat and Pile Driver nuclear tests, which provided legacy data that can be used to simulate wave <b>propagation.</b> The Climax <b>Stock</b> was originally chosen as the site of the SPE partly because of its assumed homogeneity. It has since been discovered that the area of the stock where the SPE tests are being performed contains a perched water table. In addition, the stock is known to contain an extensive network of faults, joints, and fractures, but the exact effect of these structural features on seismic wave velocity is not fully understood. The SPE tests are designed to seismically capture the explosion phenomena from the near- to the far-field transition of the seismic waveform. In the first SPE experiment, 100 kg of chemical explosives were set off at a depth of 55 m. The blast was recorded with an array of sensors and diagnostics, including accelerometers, geophones, rotational sensors, short-period and broadband seismic sensors, Continuous Reflectometry for Radius vs. Time Experiment, Time of Arrival, Velocity of Detonation, and infrasound sensors. The focus of this study is two-fold: (1) the geophone array that was focused over the SPE shot and (2) a high-resolution seismic profile that was recently acquired at the field site. The geophone array was placed radially around the SPE shot in five directions with 100 m spacing and out to a distance of 2 km. The high-resolution profile was about 475 m in length with station and shot spacing of 5 m using a 7000 lb mini-vibe as a source. In both data sets, the first arrivals will be used to develop velocity models. For the geophone array, 1 -D P-wave velocity models will be developed to determine an average apparent velocity of the Climax Stock. The high-resolution data will be used to develop a 2 -D P-wave velocity model along the seismic profile. This is in an effort to elucidate the water table in more detail and provide additional information on the near-surface structure. These results will be used in the overall modeling effort to fully characterize the test bed and develop a physics-based model to simulate seismic energy from the SPE events...|$|R
