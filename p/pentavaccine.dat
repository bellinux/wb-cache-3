40|$|Combined {{vaccines}} containing non-cellular pertussis component {{and having}} low reactogenicity, increase vaccination coverage against controllable infections. However, {{the safety of}} vaccination in children dealing with health issues, {{as well as those}} having a history of premature infancy, requires additional research. The article presents reactogenicity analysis for the DTP-IPV/HIB <b>pentavaccine</b> during primary vaccination and revaccination of premature infants (n = 85), as well as vaccination of mature newborns (n = 1433) inoculated in accordance with the national Vaccination Calendar behind the schedule. The occurrence of post-vaccinal reactions in the premature infant group was the same as in the mature infant group and amounted to 41. 2 % and 45. 0 %; the occurrence of common reactions was 18. 8 % and 22. 4 %; local effects measured 25. 8 % and 27. 9 % respectively. Post-vaccinal reactions were either weak or moderate, not requiring treatment, and they would completely disappear {{by the end of the}} third post-vaccinal day. Simultaneous injection of <b>pentavaccine</b> and Hepatitis B vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children with a history of premature infancy, showed no influence during the post-vaccinal period. The reactogenicity of <b>pentavaccine</b> increased along with the vaccination ratio during the primary series of vaccinations. Â  </div...|$|E
