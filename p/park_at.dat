5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National <b>Park</b> <b>at</b> night in South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating {{is a problem}} there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the <b>park</b> <b>at</b> night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E

50|$|A small {{drop-off}} lane {{was built}} {{on the south side of}} the tracks off Maple Street, next to the new inbound platform. However, daily parking capacity was not immediately increased. Additional service and <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> Littleton/Route 495, additional <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> Ayer, and the opening of Wachusett should help to mitigate the demand for <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> South Acton.|$|R
50|$|There is no <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> the Roundtop Trailhead, {{and very}} limited <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> the Little Greenbrier Trailhead, {{which is a}} block away {{on the other side}} of Lyon Springs Road.

There is substantial <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> the Townsend Y, although the Y is a popular swimming area, and this parking lot fills up quickly in summer months.|$|R

50|$|This {{station was}} called Oakland West until 1982; {{it opened in}} September 1974 with the {{commencement}} of service through the Transbay Tube. Since early 2014, <b>parking</b> commuters <b>at</b> this station pay $6 per day on the weekdays. This was implemented to raise revenue, to bring <b>parking</b> costs <b>at</b> the station in line with <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> other local garages, {{and to ensure that}} <b>parking</b> <b>at</b> the stations was going to be used for BART patrons only, parking spaces would have had to be 'validated' inside the BART paid area.|$|R
5|$|At present, {{the city}} of Lawton is {{undertaking}} the Downtown Revitalization Project. Its goal is to redesign the areas between Elmer Thomas <b>Park</b> <b>at</b> the north through Central Mall to the south to be more visually appealing and pedestrian friendly to encourage business growth in the area.|$|E

5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I figured I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement <b>park,</b> <b>at</b> a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
