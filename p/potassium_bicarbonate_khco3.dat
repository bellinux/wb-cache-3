40|$|Powdery mildew attacks several {{important}} crops in greenhouses (e. g. tomatoes, cucumbers). Compared to other airborne pathogens, such as downy mildews (e. g.

However, an effective control of powdery mildew with organic fungicides gives the possibility to optimize climate conditions to also prevent downy mildews and gray mold. Sulphur, a well established fungicide, is rated as slightly to very harmful to beneficial organisms (Koppert Biological Systems, 2010) and may have a phytotoxic effect on some crops (e. g. melon).

40|$|Abstract: Late blight disease {{caused by}} P. infestans of potato plants was {{controlled}} {{under field conditions}} using <b>potassium</b> or sodium <b>bicarbonates</b> alone or in combination with Citral. In laboratory experiments, results indicated that complete inhibition in linear growth of P. infestans was obtained with <b>potassium</b> or sodium <b>bicarbonates</b> at 2 % and Citral at 0. 5 %. Moreover, in field experiments, {{results indicated that the}} most effective treatment was <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> at 2. 0 % plus Citral at 0. 5 % which reduced the disease severity by 84. 4 and 82. 4 % during two growing seasons. The highest reduction was obtained with <b>potassium</b> or sodium <b>bicarbonate</b> at 1. 0 or 2. 0 respectively plus citral at 0. 5 % and Redomil which reduced the early blight incidence more than 61. 8 % as compared with untreated plants. As for potato yield the highest increased was obtained with <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> at 2. 0 % plus Citral at 0. 5 % which increased tuber yield by 76. 0 and 67. 9 % during two growing seasons. All treatments significantly increased the chitinase and β- 1, 3 – glucanase activities. The great increased was obtained with <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> at 2. 0 or 1. 0 % plus Citral which increased the chitinase and β- 1, 3 – glucanase activities more than 120. 0 and 220. 1 % respectively.

This growing method allows to reduce grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) incidence but creates conditions for powdery mildew (Podosphaera aphanis) development. Starting from 2013, experimental trials {{with the aim}} to reduce chemical treatments on strawberry have been carried out. Some fungicides authorized in organic production have been recently registered on strawberry in Italy: among them there are commercial products based on <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> with specific activity against powdery mildew and very short pre-harvest intervals, moreover they are exempt from MRL. Semi-field and field trials were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> against powdery mildew on strawberry. In the semi-field trials, potted plants were kept in a glasshouse and inoculated by shaking infected leaves over the plants. Treatments were: <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> sulphur, bupirimate and untreated control. Four and five weekly applications were applied {{in the first and}} second trial, respectively. In the field trial (tunnel and soilless cultivation) a conventional spray program was compared with bicarbonate applications and the untreated control. Incidence and severity on leaves and fruits were assessed in these trials. In the glasshouse trials, the spray applications with <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> significantly reduced the incidence and severity of powdery mildew compared with untreated control. Efficacy of bicarbonate was similar to sulphur but was lower compared with the chemical reference. In the field trial, the untreated plots showed a high incidence of the disease while a very low incidence was observed both in conventional and bicarbonate treatments. In conclusion, our results showed that repeated applications of <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> were effective against powdery mildew and no phytotoxic effects were observed. Therefore this active ingredient can be included in IPM programs of strawberry, allowing a reduction of pesticide residue...|$|R

40|$|Powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca mors-uvae) {{severely}} infects young shoots, {{stems and}} fruits of gooseberry (Ribes uva-crispa). Environmental friendly and biological control measures are being sought throughout the world.

In organic currant growing the number of adequate control methods is very limited. Sulphur as a fungicide against powdery mildew in e. g., gooseberry or table grape growing is not recommendable due to possible bleaching of berries and scorching of tender shoots. Various bicarbonate salts are suggested as a good option to control powdery mildew.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study is presented {{of the hydrogen}} solubility in aqueous salt solutions containing sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> from 293 to 333 K. For this purpose, gas consumption measurements have been performed by determining the ultimate pressure decrease in an intensively stirred, high pressure autoclave. Experiments were carried out at salt concentrations up to 1. 0 mol kg- 1. At higher salt molalities, the hydrogen solubility was too low to be measured reliably. It was demonstrated that the hydrogen solubility followed the well-known Sechenov salt concentration dependence. At 298 K, the Sechenov or salting-out parameters were equal to 0. 41 and 0. 32 kg mol- 1 for sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> respectively. Fairly good agreement was obtained with the salting-out parameters predicted by a recently developed empirical estimation method.
