40|$|When {{people began}} {{thinking}} about making systems more secure, they naturally speculated about specific <b>penetration</b> <b>techniques.</b> At first, {{the approach to}} securing operating systems was directed toward closing the holes inadvertently left by designers. These holes typically allowed a penetrator {{to gain control of}} the operating system, or at least to bypass some particular access control mechanism. Some <b>penetration</b> <b>techniques</b> identified by “tiger teams ” searching for holes were incredibly complex, as were the countermeasures. The Trojan horse route to penetration, however, was not formally identified until surprisingly late in the history of computing. 1 This route was far easier to exploit than many of the highly sophisticated penetrations people were trying to thwart. Worse, this simple type of penetration was fundamentally impossible to prevent on nearly all systems. Only a complete change in the philosophy of protection and a complete restructuring of the system could come close to addressing the problem. The most insidious aspect of the Trojan horse attack is that it requires no discovery and exploitation of loopholes in the operating system. A successful Trojan horse attack can be mounted through the use of only the most well-documented and obviously desirable features of a flawless, bug-free system...|$|R

Clearfil SE Bond and Single Bond (self-etching and etch-and-rinse systems, respectively) were applied, each to half of the prepared cavities, which were restored with composite resin. Half of the specimens in each group underwent 10, 000 cycles of thermocycling. Microleakage was evaluated using two dimensional (2 D) and three dimensional (3 D) dye <b>penetration</b> <b>techniques</b> separately for each half of each specimen. Data were analyzed with SPSS 11. 5 (SPSS Inc.), using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (α = 0. 05). Results The difference between the 2 D and 3 D microleakage evaluation techniques was significant at the occlusal margins of Single bond groups (p = 0. 002). The differences between 2 D and 3 D microleakage evaluation techniques were significant at both the occlusal and cervical margins of Clearfil SE Bond groups (p = 0. 017 and p = 0. 002, respectively). The difference between the 2 D and 3 D techniques was significant at the occlusal margins of non-aged groups (p = 0. 003). The {{difference between these two}} techniques was significant at the occlusal margins of the aged groups (p = 0. 001).

Each root was apically resected. Nail polish was applied to the root surfaces of the first 3 groups. Apical cavity preparations were performed on all teeth. The retropreparations were filled either with MTA (group I, n= 10 teeth), Ormocer (group II, n= 10 teeth), or only covered with nail polish (group III, n= 4 teeth). In group IV (positive control, n= 4 teeth) no retro-filling and no nail polish was applied. The specimens were suspended in methylene blue dye for 7 days.

Preliminary work on AA 1100 -O foils of {{different}} thicknesses indicated that the pit growth rate increased with increasing applied potential, suggesting that pit growth was not under transport control. Foil penetration experiments were also carried out on AA 2024 -T 3 foils of a given thickness, at open circuit as well as anodic potentials.

Cracks were induced into the solder joints of chip resistors on FR 4 substrates, and studied using metallographic micro-sectioning, dye penetration, mechanical test and thermal conductivity techniques. The work has shown that those techniques traditionally used to study lead-based solder joints can readily be used for assessing lead-free solder joints The traditional micro-sectioning method is suitable for locating and imaging the solder joint crack, especially when the section is examined in a SEM.
