50|$|The <b>poplar</b> <b>admiral</b> (Limenitis populi) is a {{butterfly}} in the heliconiine subfamily of the Nymphalidae family.|$|E
50|$|The now rare <b>poplar</b> <b>admiral</b> is a {{protected}} species. The species is endangered {{primarily due to}} the clearing of forests containing the trees that they must feed on to survive, and replacement with more economically valuable conifer forests.|$|E
50|$|<b>Poplar</b> <b>admiral</b> {{habitat is}} {{widespread}} in continental Europe and many areas in Asia. The large, seldom-seen <b>poplar</b> <b>admiral</b> {{is one of}} the biggest butterflies in Europe. It is found in deciduous forests, where aspen (Populus tremula) or black poplar (Populus nigra) trees grow. This is because the caterpillar only eats the leaves of these species. At altitude, for instance in the Alps, where there are not large Populus forests, they accommodate with a grove, in the southeast of France they can be seen flying in large open spaces, for instance in the department of Alpes-Maritimes, as noted by Jacques Rigout. The males are easier to find. The females are rarer, because they tend to stay in the tops of the trees and seldom venture to the ground.|$|E

50|$|However, much {{evidence}} supports {{that a single}} event colonization is the best explanation. One theory of Nearctic colonization states {{that the reason for}} the colonization was a larvae host plant shift. The position of the <b>poplar</b> <b>admiral</b> (L. populi), a Palearctic species, in a phylogenetic tree confirms that the poplar is the closest existing relative of the Nearctic taxa and is consistent with the theory that the host plant had a large effect on the evolution of North American admirals. Just like the wing-pattern of the Palearctic butterflies has little evidence of divergence, the host plant use of these species also shows no sign of divergence. These species only feed on different species of honeysuckle (Lonicera ssp.) The exception is the poplar that feeds exclusively on aspen (Populus tremulus of the willow family). All North American Limenitis feed on members of the willow family as well, suggesting that an (ancestral host plant shift) expansion of a novel host plant across the Bering land bridge could have driven the colonization of the Nearctic. Species level phylogenies based on the mitochondrial gene COI and the gene EFI-Î± of Nearctic and Palearctic species also indicate a single colonization of the Nearctic species. The phylogenies produced indicate that a white-banded ancestor similar to the species L. arthemis. established itself in North America and resulted in several major lineages, three of which involved mimicry independently of each other. Given the present monophyly of the Nearctic species, it is likely that a single migration and subsequent expansion of the population was the foundation of the Nearctic butterflies.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of wing pattern diversity in butterXies {{has emerged as}} a model system for understanding the origins and maintenance of adaptive phenotypic novelty. Admiral butterXies (genus Limenitis) are an attractive system for studying wing pattern diversity because mimicry is common among the North American species and hybrid zones occur wherever mimetic and non-mimetic wing pattern races meet. However, the utility of this system has been limited because the evolutionary relationships among these butterXies remain unclear. Here I present a robust species-level phylogeny of Limenitis based on 1911 bp of two mitochondrial genes (COI and COII) and 904 bp of EF 1 - for all Wve of the Nearctic species/wing pattern races, the majority of the Palearctic species, and three outgroup genera; Athyma, Moduza (Limenitidini), and Neptis (Limenitidinae: Neptini). Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses indicate that the North Ameri-can species are a well-supported, monophyletic lineage that is most closely related to the widespread, Palearctic, <b>Poplar</b> <b>admiral</b> (L. populi). Within North America, the Viceroy (L. archippus) is the basal lineage while the relationships among the remaining species are not well resolved. A combined maximum-likelihood analysis, however, indicates that the two western North America species (L. lorquini and L. weidemeyerii) are sister taxa and closely related to the wing pattern subspecies of the polytypic Limenitis arthemis species complex. These results are consistent with (1) an ancestral host-shift to Salicaceae by the common ancestor of the <b>Poplar</b> <b>admiral</b> and the Nearctic admiral lineage, (2) a single colonization of the Nearctic, and (3) a subsequent radiation of the North American forms leading to at least three independent origins of mimicry...|$|E
