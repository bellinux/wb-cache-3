This <b>network</b> consists of 42 points: 6 absolute gravity points (0. Order <b>Gravity</b> <b>Network)</b> and 36 relative gravity points (I. Order <b>Gravity</b> <b>Network).</b> Further densification of FGN {{will be carried}} out by the lower order <b>networks</b> (II. Order <b>Gravity</b> <b>Network).</b> Fundamental <b>gravity</b> points should be homogeneously spaced over the whole state. In some large countries the distance between gravity points can be more than few hundred kilometres. Levelling connection of the absolute and first order gravity points at the national levelling network benchmarks was not performed. Also, the position of gravity points in respect to existing geodetic network stayed unknown. Quality positional and height definition of gravity points is necessary for calculating different corrections, which are needed for processing gravimetric measurements. By implementation of the FGN Finalization Project, along with already finalized projects, the modern gravity {{foundation for}} the Republic of Croatia will be established. ...|$|R

With the aim of {{improving the quality of}} data from the Mount Etna <b>gravity</b> <b>network,</b> we used both absolute and relative gravimeters in a hybrid method. In this report, some of the techniques for gravity surveys are reviewed, and the results related to each method are compared. We show how the total uncertainty estimated for the gravity measurements performed with this combined use of absolute and relative gravimeters is roughly comparable to that calculated when the measurements are acquired using only relative gravimeters (the traditional method). However, the data highlight how the hybrid approach improves the measurement capabilities for surveying the Mount Etna volcanic area. This approach enhances the accuracy of the data, and then of the four-dimensional surveying, which minimizes ambiguities inherent in the gravity measurements.

40|$|A typical {{collection}} system may include many gravity mains connected by pump stations pushing flow into a complex network of pressurized conduits or forcemains (ASCE, 1982). The EPA standard SWMM 5 engine solves this complex case, {{but it can}} be very expensive and time consuming. In most forcemain networks, the solution time improves significantly by separating or “decoupling ” the <b>gravity</b> <b>network</b> from the force main network. Decoupling can improve computational speed three to five times. Larger networks have much larger increases in solution time speed for the decoupled network, up to twenty times faster. Results for the decoupled model may differ from the original model. In particular, wet-well levels in the <b>gravity</b> <b>network</b> influence the pump operations for the forcemain network. Ignoring the storage available in gravity conduits can lead to oversized pump designs, because the overall storage volume is much larger than the volume available in the wet-well alone. This chapter develops a rigorous dynamic conduit storage synthesizer approach that estimates the conduit volume available for storage and applies it to the wet-well depth-area curve to reduce the impact of decoupling the model on pumping simulations.

40|$|Repeatable high-precision gravity surveys {{provide a}} method of {{monitoring}} temporal variations in the gravity field. Fluctuations in the gravity field may indicate water table changes, crustal deformation, or precursors to volcanism and earthquakes. This report describes a high-precision gravity loop which has been established across Yucca Mountain, Nevada {{in support of the}} Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations (NNWSI) program. The purpose of this gravity loop is to monitor temporal variations in gravity across Yucca Mountain in an effort to interpret and predict the stability of the tectonic framework and changes in the subsurface density field. Studies of the tectonic framework which include volcanic hazard seismicity, and faulting studies are in progress. Repeat high-precision gravity surveys are less expensive and can be made more rapidly than a corresponding leveling survey. High-precision gravity surveys are capable of detecting elevation changes of 3 to 5 cm, and thus can be employed as an efficient tool for monitoring vertical crustal movements while supplementing or partially replacing leveling data.

The results are as follows: (1) Prior to both earthquakes, gravity variation exhibited similar characteristics as those observed before both the Tangshan and Wenchuan earthquakes, in which typical precursor anomalies were positive gravity variation near the epicenter and the occurrence of a high-gravity-gradient zone across the epicenter prior to the earthquake.
