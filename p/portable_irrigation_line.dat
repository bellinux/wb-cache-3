At low wind speed (0. 44 m/s, 1. 4 ft/s), application rates decreased linearly from 50 mm/hr (2 in/hr) for positions closest to the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line</b> to zero at 4 m (12 ft) from the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line.</b> Application rates at positions farthest from the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line</b> were affected by wind speeds as low as 1 m/s (3. 3 ft/s).

40|$|AbstractOlive growing {{counts as}} one of the most {{significant}} agricultural activities in Greece, from a financial, social and ecological point of view. Modern olive culture often includes exhaustive use of the available water resources having as a result adverse effects for production cost and the environment. This paper evaluates seasonal soil moisture content at three different soil depths (10, 30, 40 cm), in relation with rainfall and irrigation in an olive cultivar “Kalamon” orchard. Our results indicate strong variation of soil moisture as affected by season and irrigation. In addition, the role of drip-irrigation on soil moisture content appears to be more significant at soil depths up to 30 cm compared to lower soil zones.

[...] Efficiency is also achieved through the standardization of the size of growing spaces - the farm consists of 10 plots containing 16 beds, each bed is 30 inches wide and 100 feet long.

In {{an effort to}} contain what little soil is left and rebuild the native chaparral, the Cloud Forest Restoration Project is testing erosion control structures such as wattles, leaf litter fences and silt dams. This summer a drip irrigation system was installed along with fog capturing fences to supply water to native plants transplanted near the erosion control structures. As the project has grown, more irrigation {{has been added to}} increase the area available for transplanting. This irrigation system varies in elevation, slope, and diameter and lengths of <b>irrigation</b> <b>lines.</b> Because this project is experimentally monitored, it is important that all the transplants obtain the same amount of water. To check the efficiency of this system, the flow rates of 1. 9 L/hr rated pressure-compensating emitters along ¾” diameter polyethylene irrigation tubing were checked. Flow rates were relatively consistent at 1. 53 L/hr, 1. 60 L/hr and 1. 59 L/hr for 1 / 3, 2 / 3 and the whole system turned on, respectively. Although one might expect the addition of more <b>irrigation</b> <b>line</b> and emitters to decrease water pressure and thus the flow rate of individual emitters, the flow rates of emitters were found to be unaffected, indicating the effectiveness of the pressure-compensation. However, the flow rates of emitters were consistently lower than their 1. 9 L/hr rating. In conclusion, the irrigation system is currently providing equal water to each of the transplants, but at a rate lower than expected...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissipation}} of pendimethalin {{was investigated}} in soils of cotton fields in Thessaly, central Greece, {{for a period of}} two years. The fields were irrigated either with sprinkler or with sprinkler for the first two irrigations plus drip {{for the rest of the}} experimental period. Pendimethalin was applied at rates of 1. 1, 1. 32, and 0. 96 kg a. i. /ha in a clay loam soil at Rizomylos, a clay soil at Kypseli, and a sandy clay loam soil at Karditsa, respectively. Residues were determined with capillary GC-NPD after ethyl acetate extraction. Recovery of pendimethalin from spiked soils was 82 - 101 % with a repeatability of 2 - 7 %, and the limit of quantification was near 0. 04 mg/kg. At 150 days after application (DAA) pendimethalin residues found in the soils were 10 - 18 % of the initial measured concentrations. For the drip-irrigated fields, dissipation of pendimethalin varied within the field between the non-irrigated and the irrigated soil regions, indicating a more rapid loss in the irrigated part of the soil. Residues in the wet region (along the drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>line)</b> at 150 DAA were about 75 and 60 % of those measured in the dry region (off the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line)</b> of the soil at the Kypseli field for the 1996 and 1997 season, respectively.

Daytime ambient air temperatures within the shelters increased {{by an average of}} 1. 9 °C similar to predicted future increases in air temperatures for this region. To simulate six precipitation regimes which cover the maximum range to be expected under climate change, a <b>portable</b> <b>irrigation</b> system was designed to modify the frequency of monthly rainfall events with a constant delivery rate of water, while maintaining contemporary average precipitation volumes. Controls consisted of blocks irrigated with frequencies and total monthly precipitation consistent with the 25 year average rainfall for this location.

Even with monthly rainfall averages that are similar to contemporary monthly precipitation averages, decreasing the number of monthly rainfall events reduced soil surface CO 2 efflux and plant growth through soil moisture deficits.

The results of this study on plain and emitter polyethylene laterals confirmed that the Hazen-Williams coefficient is not constant and varies with pipe diameter and flow regime. The results have also demonstrated that the presence of emitters in pipes affects lateral pressure drop and the friction faction factor in Darcy-Weisbach equation. To estimate pressure drop in hoses with connected emitters, some formulas were developed based on Darcy-Weisbach and Hazen-Williams equations.

Estimates of storage based on a one-dimensional analysis, that only considers depth variations, were compared with two-dimensional estimates.

50|$|The use {{of plastic}} mulch {{requires}} a unique application process to ensure proper {{placement of the}} plastic film. This application process begins with preparing the field the same way one would for a flat seed bed. The bed must be free of large soil clods and organic residue.

These beds can be a flat bed which simply means {{the surface of the}} plastic mulch is level with the inter-row soil surface. Machines that form raised beds create a plastic surface higher than the inter-row soil surface.
