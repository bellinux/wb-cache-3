25|$|In the Netherlands all train {{stations}} offer free bicycle parking, {{or a more}} secure <b>parking</b> <b>place</b> for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In Trondheim in Norway, the Trampe bicycle lift has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many cities have bicycle carriers mounted on the front.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be a}} {{time limit}} on the period of stay and a minimum time before {{returning}} to a particular <b>parking</b> <b>place.</b> Where a plate does not indicate {{the days of the}} week, the restrictions apply at the same times on every day, including Sunday. Where the time of day is not shown, the controls apply for 24 hours.

25|$|The {{park and}} ride {{facility}} at Gjønnes was popular and became congested. A contributing cause was that Gjønnes is located within fare zone 1, but close to the border of zone 2. Thus people living across from the border could save 500kroner each month by driving to Gjønnes. This spurred Akershus County Municipality to question whether free {{park and ride}} was a good solution. Each <b>parking</b> <b>place</b> costs on average 250,000 kroner and many people drove short distances to reach the station. In addition it receives {{a fair amount of}} traffic from Rykkinn and Lommedalen. The pressure on the park and ride was significantly reduced after the line was extended to Haslum and Avløs on 15 December 2013, where a combined 200 new parking places were built.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the C-130 landed, the F-16 had hit Green Ramp heading west. The {{aircraft}} struck the ground in an empty <b>parking</b> <b>place</b> between two Air Force C-130s with crews on board preparing the aircraft for departure. When the F-16 hit the ground, its momentum carried the wreckage westward through {{the right wing of}} a C-141B Starlifter (AF Ser. No. 66-0173 of the 438th Airlift Wing, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey) parked on the ramp. The C-141B crew was preparing the aircraft for joint Army-Air Force operations, however, no Army troops besides the jumpmaster team had yet boarded it. The wreckage of the F-16 punctured the fuel tanks in the C-141's right wing, causing a large fireball, which combined with the F-16 wreckage and continued on a path taking it between Building 900 and the pax shed, directly into the area where the mass of Army paratroopers were sitting and standing. Twenty-three men died and more than eighty were injured; one severely burned paratrooper died more than nine months later, on 3 January 1995.|$|E

2500|$|The bombing {{had been}} carried out by a North Belfast unit of the Provisional IRA's Third Battalion Belfast Brigade. The OC of the Brigade {{at that time was}} the {{volatile}} Seamus Twomey, who had ordered and directed the attack. On 23 March, the IRA admitted responsibility for the bomb with one Belfast Brigade officer later telling a journalist [...] "I feel very bad when the innocent die". The IRA, however, tempered the admission by claiming that the caller had given Donegall Street as the correct location for the bomb in all the telephone calls and that the security forces had deliberately [...] evacuated the crowds from Church Street to maximise the casualties. The IRA's official statement claiming responsibility for the blast was released through the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau. It read as follows:"Proper and adequate warnings have been given before all our operations. This practice will continue. Several warnings have been changed by the British security forces in order to cause maximum civilian casualties. 'This was the principal factor for the tragic loss of life and heavy civilian casualties in Donegall Street on Monday last'". Tim Pat Coogan suggested that the IRA had overestimated the security forces' capacity to deal with multiple bomb scares, adding that in all probability, the caller had been young, nervous, and inexperienced. It was also alleged that the bombers had intended to leave the carbomb in Church Street but were unable to find a <b>parking</b> <b>place</b> and instead left it in Donegall Street.|$|E
