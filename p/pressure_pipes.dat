30|$|To sum up, {{numerous}} studies on pipe and shell have been published. However, those studies {{based on the}} engineering background of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> of the centrifugal compressor are relatively fewer. So for the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> of the centrifugal compressor, free and forced vibration problems should be further discussed. This paper presented the study on the natural characteristics of <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> with SS-SS boundary condition using cylindrical shell model. Based on Sanders’ shell theory, the vibration differential equation was obtained by using the energy method. The displacement shape functions were assumed by beam functions in the axial direction and the trigonometric functions in the circumferential direction. The influences of length to radius ratio, thickness to radius ratio, circumferential wave number and pressure on natural characteristics were analyzed. In the end, the steady responses of the forced vibration for a specific pipe model were obtained and the modal shapes were illustrated to understand the break of the pipe.

The NW-dam runs across the Kaldakvísl River and the SE-dam was constructed over the tail water from the Hrauneyjafoss Power Station. Both dams are around 25m high and have a total length of 1300m (170m and 1100m). The drill and blast headrace tunnel, which is 4 km long, 11,3m wide and 14,7m high, provides the turbines and the power plant with water from the new created intake Sporðalda reservoir.

50|$|The {{barrier is}} a {{straight}} gravity dam, which holds the water back by its sheer weight. It {{was built in}} several sections and finished in 1959. It is 106 m high and 415 m long. In recent years (before 2002) {{the crest of the}} dam was renewed. The roadway and the concrete had weathered and could no longer handle the weight of traffic. The lake behind the dam acts primarily as a reserve drinking water reservoir for the towns east of the Harz. The <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> go to Aschersleben, Halberstadt, Bernburg (Saale), Halle (Saale) and even Leipzig. Its water quality is particularly good; water hardness averages 3° on the German hardness scale. So the water is ideal for use for steam generation and washing. The reservoir also contributes to generation of hydro-electric power to a small extent.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic form}} of a {{wallpaper}} steamer is a semi-sealed container, usually made of plastic, that contains a heating element. A quantity of water {{is added to the}} container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is sealed, the steam pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe.</b> At the end of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> is a flat plate about 30 cm square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, saturating it and rehydrating the wallpaper paste. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall.|$|R
