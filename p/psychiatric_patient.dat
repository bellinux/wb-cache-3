5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patient</b> could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E

A specially designed questionnaire including socio-demographic data, medical history, family history and dermatological examination was applied. The data were statistically analyzed. ResultsThere was a significant statistical increase in the prevalence of skin diseases in general and infectious skin diseases in particular in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> compared with non-psychiatric patients (71. 5 % versus 22 %, P< 0. 001) and (48 % versus 11 %, P< 0. 001), respectively. Parasitic infestations (42. 7 %) were the most common infectious skin diseases in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> (P< 0. 001). Infectious skin diseases in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> were seen most in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (83. 6 %) and least in obsessive compulsive disorders (30 %) (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: The {{emergency}} medical evaluation of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> presenting to United States emergency departments (ED), usually termed “medical clearance,” often varies between EDs. A {{task force of}} the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry (AAEP), consisting of physicians from emergency medicine, physicians from psychiatry and a psychologist, was convened to form consensus recommendations for the medical evaluation of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> presenting to U. S. EDs. Methods: The task force reviewed existing literature {{on the topic of}} medical evaluation of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> in the ED and then combined this with expert consensus. Consensus was achieved by group discussion as well as iterative revisions of the written document. The document was reviewed and approved by the AAEP Board of Directors. Results: Eight recommendations were formulated. These recommendations cover various topics in {{emergency medical}} examination of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients,</b> including goals of medical screening in the ED, the identification of patients at low risk for co-existing medical disease, key elements in the ED evaluation of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> including those with cognitive disorders, specific language replacing the term “medical clearance,” and the need for better science in this area.

40|$|In this article, {{the quality}} of life (QoL) of mentally disordered {{offenders}} was investigated. The data of 44 forensic psychiatric inpatients were analyzed using the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP), Rehabilitation Evaluation Hall and Baker (REHAB), and the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Outcome on the LQoLP was compared with data of hospitalized male <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients.</b> Results show that the QoL of forensic psychiatric inpatients was particularly low as to their living conditions and their health. However, compared to general <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> they encountered fewer problems with envisioning their life as having some meaningful perspective. On six of the ten domains, nonpsychotic forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> reported a lower, though nonsignificant, QoL as compared to the psychotic forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients.</b> Between psychopathic and nonpsychopathic forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> no significant differences were found. A trend was found for the domain finances for which nonpsychopaths reported a lower quality of life. Our hypothesis that patients with a lower level of functioning will report a lower QoL was not confirmed in this study. However, a significant correlation between general behavior and global well-being was found. Future studies should further investigate the relation between quality of life of forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>patients</b> and recidivism, to gain more insight in whether (certain aspects of) QoL are associated with lower recidivism risks in the long run...|$|R
