Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the <b>programme</b> <b>structure,</b> delivery approaches and assessments.

This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} differences in decision-making processes between UK and non-UK managers in the defence manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach – A pilot study was conducted with a small number of firms in Yorkshire, UK. A large-scale survey was conducted of 250 firms in the UK. The response rate was 60 per cent. Findings – Decision making is kept team-orientated in larger firms with decision making autonomy in place for each team. The research demonstrates that leading firms drive best practice and best practice research disseminates globally through industry-academic collaboration. Practical implications – Alliances with leading firms will lead to the evolution of team-based, <b>programme</b> <b>structured</b> decision making in UK-non-UK strategic alliances. Originality/value – Global managers learn from the experiences of team-based <b>programme</b> <b>structured</b> decision makers...|$|R

5000|$|These {{clusters}} {{are based}} on multiple genetic markers that are often shared between different human populations even over large geographic ranges. The notion of a genetic cluster is that people within the cluster share on average similar allele frequencies to each other than to those in other clusters. (A. W. F. Edwards, 2003 but see also infobox [...] "Multi Locus Allele Clusters") In a test of idealised populations, the computer <b>programme</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b> was found to consistently underestimate the numbers of populations in the data set when high migration rates between populations and slow mutation rates (such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms) were considered. In 2004, Lynn Jorde and Steven Wooding argued that [...] "Analysis of many loci now yields reasonably accurate estimates of genetic similarity among individuals, rather than populations. Clustering of individuals is correlated with geographic origin or ancestry." ...|$|E

The aim of the MAG teams were to address the outstanding problems of landmine and UXO contamination apparent following the ceasefire (Memorandum of Understanding) between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Through deploying Mine Risk Education (MRE), survey and demarcation assets in Northern Sri Lanka, MAG teams sought to protect those most affected by the conflict which had plagued the region since 1983.

5000|$|The Programme in Rural Management (PRM) was {{designed}} as a 12-month course to be followed by a year’s apprenticeship in a rural producers’ organisation, funded by Operation Flood. The programme evolved into the present two-year postgraduate diploma. Dr. Leela Dube, a sociologist, pioneered a course for the first batch in 1980, termed then [...] "Rural Environment"; a foundation course which attempted to push a [...] "business management techniques programme design" [...] towards asking questions about village society. It was also designed as a preparatory course to the [...] "village field work segment"; which followed after the first semester. This pedagogy was an innovation for business schools in India. This pedagogy structure was only available to MSW (Master of Social Work) programs in India which gained its perspective from immersionism, where the student gets involved as a sort of a field researcher, in the events and people in a village. The integration of a [...] "fieldwork" [...] segment, into a postgraduate business management curriculum, had never been attempted in any conventional management schools. The IIMs (Indian Institute of Management), and other university sponsored MBA (Master of Business Administration) never adopted the practicality of practicing theory in respective fields of management and testing its evidence within Indian organisational realities. This structure is followed by IRMA with successfulness; the course has been developed further and split, for example the 2012 <b>programme</b> <b>structure,</b> offered three half credit courses in the first semester: termed [...] "Rural Society and Polity","Rural Livelihood Systems", and [...] "Rural Research Methods"; and is structured as a preparation to the village field work segment that follows. The present structure of the field work segment, which follows after the first term, is a six-week exposure to [...] "rural reality".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines <b>programme</b> <b>structure</b> as {{a dimension}} of programme strategy {{within the context of}} large-scale-multi-site (LSMS) information system (IS) based change programmes. While a centralized <b>programme</b> <b>structure</b> is often assumed both in literature and in practice, we argue that <b>programme</b> <b>structure</b> should be a strategic decision contingent upon programme environment. Following the structural contingency theory, we characterise programme environment by two dimensions of the programme environment as programme authority over the participating organizations and homogeneity of the business processes among the participating organizations. Based on these two dimensions, we develop an authority-homogeneity matrix. Given a programme of low authority and low homogeneity, the programme should adopt a matching decentralized structure supported by standard process and data interfaces. By comparing two programme cases, we demonstrate how a decentralized approach can work for a LSMS IS-based change programme while a centralized <b>programme</b> <b>structure</b> fails...|$|E
