25|$|Pakistan {{has been}} run by {{military}} dictatorships for large periods of time, alternating with limited democracy. These rapid changes in governments led to rapid policy changes and reversals and {{the reduction of}} transparency and accountability in government. The onset of military regimes have contributed to non-transparency in resource allocation.Those who do not constitute the political elite are unable to make political leaders and the Government responsive to their needs or accountable to promises. Development <b>priorities</b> <b>are</b> determined not by potential beneficiaries but by the bureaucracy and a political elite {{which may or may}} not be in touch with the needs of the citizens. Political instability and macroeconomic imbalances have been reflected in poor creditworthiness ratings, even compared to other countries of similar income levels, with resulting capital flight and lower foreign direct investment inflows.

50|$|In Operating systems, aging (US English) or ageing is a {{scheduling}} {{technique used}} to avoid starvation. Fixed <b>priority</b> scheduling <b>is</b> a scheduling discipline, in which tasks queued for utilizing a system resource <b>are</b> assigned a <b>priority</b> each. A task {{with a high}} <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> allowed to access a specific system resource before a task with a lower <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> allowed to do the same. A disadvantage {{of this approach is}} that tasks assigned with a lower <b>priority</b> may <b>be</b> starved when a large number of high <b>priority</b> tasks <b>are</b> queued. Aging is used to gradually increase the priority of a task, based on its waiting time in the ready queue.|$|R
25|$|Water {{investment}} planning for rural areas is {{done at the}} district level by the respective water departments. In 2009 the NGO WaterAid studied the local government planning process for water investments {{in four of the}} country's 99 rural districts, namely in Mpwapwa, Kongwa, Iramba and Nzega. Planning begins with long wish-lists based on demands from the village level. Since real <b>priorities</b> <b>are</b> difficult to identify, one selection criterion used is the balance of money held in the village water fund. This is seen as a sign of community ownership and can be easily explained to councillors and villagers. Other purported criteria are health statistics and data collected from a waterpoint mapping exercise, but they are not given high priority in practice. Selection is done {{in such a way that}} water projects are equally divided between the constituencies of the district’s Members of Parliament. Furthermore, councilors steer projects to villages in their wards, with more dynamic councillors exerting greater influence. Another de facto criterion is the previous track record in caring for infrastructure: In some areas handpumps have been stolen, making it hard to justify new investments. Communities close to town, located on main roads or with existing social services have an advantage in the decision-making process, since officials visit them more often and the cost of providing infrastructure is lower. The WaterAid report suggests that if there was better availability of data on rural water supply infrastructure this could help the representatives of underserved communities to lobby on behalf of their constituents.|$|E
25|$|The State Defense Order for 2009 was {{expected}} to amount to a record of RUB 1.2trillion, showing an increase of RUB 70billion from the previous year. The order {{was expected}} to be raised by a further RUB 40billion for 2010, and by RUB 60billion for 2011. In total, the state plans to spend $128billion in military procurement in the 2009–2011 period. Military-Industrial Commission of Russia is responsible for supervising the distribution and implementation of the State Defense Order. In 2005, Putin initiated an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). The aim was optimize production lines and minimise losses. The program was divided in three parts: reorganization and crisis management (2007–2010), evolution of existing projects (2010–2015) and further progress within the newly created structure (2015–2025). The State Duma Defense Committee has announced that the nation's defense spending, including research and development R spending, will total $16.3 billion (RUB487 billion) in 2010, $19.2 billion (RUB574 billion) in 2011, $24.3 billion (RUB726 billion) in 2012, and $38.8 billion (RUB1.16 trillion) in 2013. While total defense spending will increase, the amount allocated for R will drop from the current 2010 level of 22 percent to 16 percent by 2013. The modernization of weaponry will instead receive a significant portion of total spending, with 13 percent designated for the 2010 fiscal year, 15 percent for 2011 and 2012, and 14 percent for 2013. The top procurement <b>priorities</b> <b>are</b> the following: RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles, Su-24 fighters, Su-35 long-range fighters, submarines, corvettes, frigates, and battlefield command-and-control systems. The plan for 2010-2013 only represents a small portion (16%) of that amount, just over RUB2.9 trillion ($98.6 billion). The government intends to spend RUB19 trillion ($613 billion) over the next decade to modernize the armed forces.|$|E

500|$|A {{priority}} queue is a data structure for maintaining {{a collection of}} items with numerical priorities, having operations for finding and removing the item with the minimum priority value. Comparison-based {{priority queue}}s such as the binary heap take logarithmic time per update, but other structures such as the van Emde Boas tree or bucket queue may be faster for inputs whose <b>priorities</b> <b>are</b> small integers. These data structures {{can be used in}} the selection sort algorithm, which sorts a collection of elements by repeatedly finding and removing the smallest element from the collection, and returning the elements in the order they were found. A priority queue can be used to maintain the collection of elements in this algorithm, and the time for this algorithm on a collection of [...] elements can be bounded by the time to initialize the priority queue and then to perform [...] find and remove operations. For instance, using a binary heap as a priority queue in selection sort leads to the heap sort algorithm, a comparison sorting algorithm that takes [...] time. Instead, using selection sort with a bucket queue gives a form of pigeonhole sort, and using van Emde Boas trees or other integer priority queues leads to other fast integer sorting algorithms.|$|E

[...] She is [...] "the grotesquely willing mother who has lost any sense of individual purpose" [...] other than {{to do anything for}} her children. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V.

Helford writes that the entry predicts [...] "Scully's fate as the mother of 'immaculately' (technologically) conceived and monstrous progeny". In the fifth season, Scully indeed learns that she is a mother, albeit accidentally, after her ova was harvested following her abduction in second season, and an alien/human hybrid named Emily is the result.
