5|$|On May 18, 2007, WWE {{reported}} that Helms had broken two vertebrae in his neck, {{one of which}} was <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> his spinal cord. He underwent surgery with Dr. Lloyd Youngblood to repair them approximately a week later. Following the surgery, Helms was announced to be out {{for a year and a}} half due to the injury.|$|E
5|$|When tumors compress, invade or inflame {{parts of}} the nervous system (such as the brain, spinal cord, nerves, ganglia or plexa), they can cause pain and other symptoms. Though brain tissue {{contains}} no pain sensors, brain tumors can cause pain by <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the meninges), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.|$|E
5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> people in their sleep.|$|E

5|$|Loire and Sémillante {{had escaped}} from the battle into Black Sod Bay, where they hoped to hide until they had a clear passage back to France. However, late on 15 October, a British frigate {{squadron}} under James Newman-Newman rounded the southern headland of the bay, forcing the French ships to flee to the north. <b>Pressing</b> <b>on</b> sail in pursuit, Newman ordered HMS Révolutionaire to focus on Sémillante whilst he pursued Loire in HMS Mermaid, accompanied by the brig HMS Kangaroo under Commander Edward Brace. Loire and Sémillante separated to divide their pursuers; Mermaid and Kangaroo lost track of Loire in the early evening, and Sémillante evaded Révolutionaire after dark.|$|E
5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
5|$|During the passage, Nelson {{captured}} the Spanish frigate Santa Sabina and placed Lieutenants Jonathan Culverhouse and Thomas Hardy {{in charge of}} the captured vessel, taking the Spanish captain on board Minerve. Santa Sabina {{was part of a larger}} Spanish force, and the following morning two Spanish ships-of-the-line and a frigate were sighted closing fast. Unable to outrun them, Nelson initially determined to fight but Culverhouse and Hardy raised the British colours and sailed northeast, drawing the Spanish ships after them until being captured, giving Nelson the opportunity to escape. Nelson went on to rendezvous with the British fleet at Elba, where he spent Christmas. He sailed for Gibraltar in late January, and after learning that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cartagena, stopped just long enough to collect Hardy, Culverhouse, and the rest of the prize crew captured with Santa Sabina, before <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> through the straits to join Sir John Jervis off Cadiz.|$|E

5|$|North Korean forces, meanwhile, flanked the American {{positions}} {{under cover}} of fog. The Koreans passed around the Americans' right flank and attacked the mortar positions in the rear. T-34 tanks also joined in the fight, and also passed around the American flanks while obscured by the fog. Around 0900 the North Korean forces in Chonui initiated a frontal assault on the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry's positions. An observer with the unit called in artillery and pushed back the North Korean infantry inflicting heavy casualties on the assaulting force. By 1100, the North Korean infantry, supported by several T-34s, was <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> A Company's position, which was undermanned. At 1125 the requested airstrike came in; American aircraft rocketed the T-34s to no effect while strafing the Korean forces attacking A Company. The aircraft were able to push back the attack for several minutes before running out of ammunition and being forced to leave. The North Korean troops immediately resumed their assault.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 2000, {{in a live}} radio {{interview}} on KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band's decision to break {{up at the end}} of that year following additional touring and recording. The group's final album before the break-up, Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music, was released in September 2000 in a limited <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> vinyl with permission and instructions for free redistribution on the Internet by fans. Only twenty-five copies were cut, each of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves. The album, released under the Constantinople Records label created by Corgan, consisted of one double LP and three ten-inch EPs. Originally, the band asked Virgin to offer Machina II as a free download to anyone who bought Machina. When the record label declined, Corgan opted to release the material independently.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shots were}} fired at 12:30 by Persanne close to the island of Pelagosa (Palagruža), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when Alceste and Pomone {{exchanged}} shots from their stern and bow guns. By 13:40, Alceste was firing her broadside into Pomone and simultaneously <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> all sail {{in an effort to}} reach Pauline, but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from Pomone brought down Alcestes main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing Pauline to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, Active had arrived in action and was also firing into Pomone, forcing Montfort to bring Pauline round to protect her outgunned colleague. By 14:20 the conflicts between Active and Pomone and Alceste and Pauline had separated into different duels, Pomone particularly suffering severely but Active also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder carronade shot severing Captain Gordon's leg {{at the height of the}} engagement.|$|E

5|$|At 08:50, {{the lead}} U.S. attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. <b>Pressing</b> <b>on,</b> the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers {{and prepared to}} attack. Three Zeros from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing {{them away from the}} bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to impress}} Martin and his colleagues, Rhys {{purchases}} a barbecue and invites them over for dinner. He is granted {{an interview with the}} surgical board to join their training program at the hospital. Following a night out with Dane Canning (Luke Pegler), Rhys gets a hangover and is horrified to learn his interview has been moved to an earlier time. Rhys struggles to answer the panel's questions and he is not invited to join the program. He later visits his mother, Elaine, at her hospice, where he tells her he has joined the program. Rhys treats Chris Pappas (James Mason) after he is attacked, but fails to get him to stay for his X-rays. Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) spots that Chris has a broken rib, which is <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> his lung and Rhys finds him collapsed on the floor of Fitzgerald Motors. Rhys performs an emergency decompression on his lung and saves his life. Rhys asks senior surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) to reconsider letting him join the surgical program, but she declines. Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O'Brien to quit the program and he turns his attentions to Erin Salisbury. He pretends to be romantically interested in her and tries to distract her from her studies.|$|E
