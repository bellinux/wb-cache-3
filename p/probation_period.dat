Young driver risk differs between countries, and has improved in the last decade, probably as a result of general improvements in road safety levels. Young male drivers' relative risk is rising, indicating that current policies are less effective for males than for females. Further research is needed to understand the causes of this development. In Europe, most countries are moving toward multiphase licensing systems, including elements like accompanied driving, protective measures, and <b>probation</b> <b>periods.</b> European evaluation studies show mixed results regarding these elements, pointing to a need for more research into the effective components.

40|$|Tenure {{policies}} for {{elementary and secondary}} school teachers is a controversial issue in many states, but there is virtually no empirical evidence on how tenure affects teacher labor markets. This paper begins to fill this research void by using cross-state variation in tenure policies to identify the effects, if any, of the length of the probationary period on entry-level teacher salaries. Using data from the Schools and Staffing Survey, the authors investigate whether districts in states with longer probationary periods offer higher wages to teachers as a way to compensate for the extended evaluative period. Results suggest that they do, although effects are concentrated in districts that {{are most likely to be}} competing for teachers with districts in neighboring states with shorter <b>probation</b> <b>periods.</b> The authors also find that the relationship between probation length and wages is stronger for experienced teachers and in districts that engage in collective bargaining...|$|R
50|$|Under {{a law of}} August 1985 {{governing}} {{leave for}} training, retraining and reemployment, employers undertake to offer such leave to a specific number of wage-earners whose redundancy would have been authorised; during this period the workers concerned {{will be able to}} benefit from a number of activities organised to help them find new jobs. A law of January 1985 widened the scope of certain social provisions, including the encouragement of training work experience schemes for young people by setting up introductory apprenticeships and extending the fifth week of annual paid holiday to nursery school assistants. A law of July 1985, while increasing the number of cases in which a firm could use temporary workers and relaxing conditions regarding the duration of certain types of contracts, also introduced changes in the rules relating to the duration of <b>probation</b> <b>periods</b> and made it harder to re-employ temporary workers in the same job before a waiting period has expired, etc.|$|R

500|$|Former acting Acting Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Ivaschenko {{was arrested}} on 25 August 2010 for {{illegally}} making a decision to sell Government property. In 2013 Ivashchenko claimed he was prosecuted because he refused to testify against Tymoshenko and Oleksandr Turchynov and that the accusations against him where fabricated by his former deputy minister of defence, Ihor Montrezor, who he had fired because he was “fixing dirty corrupt deals in the upper echelons of power”. Ivaschenko was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for abuse of power on 12 April 2012. The United States Embassy in Kiev named Ivaschenko's verdict an [...] "latest example of selective justice in Ukraine" [...] and it called for his release.

[...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a <b>probation</b> <b>period</b> of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

The commotion was witnessed by Pavel Opočenský, a former anti-communist dissident, émigré and famous sculptor, who immediately rushed to help the victims. During the fight, Opočenský used his hunting knife and killed a 17-year-old metal-bar-wielding skinhead. Opočenský was first charged with murder and spent 2 months in a remand prison.

3000|$|Ideally, EPL {{should provide}} {{a balance between the}} much needed {{flexibility}} to increase the dynamism of the labor market while offering sufficient protection to workers to have a proper safety net that facilitates labor market transitions. In Ukraine, this balance is not provided, enforcement of the old Labor Code adopted in 1971 is very weak, and employers tend to abuse their power, as confirmed by focus groups discussions for the Ukraine case study on jobs (Kupets et al. [2012]). If provisions of EPL that regulate the terms of labor contracts, including the length of contract, payment of wages, working conditions, notice periods for layoffs, and severance pay, are enforced, they ensure a necessary level of security and certainty that increases the expected payoff from labor market decisions, including labor migration 7. If workers do not have this security because of informal employment or abuse of power by their employers, they are deterred from moving to take up such insecure jobs. The uncertainty of payment of wages and fake <b>probation</b> <b>periods</b> are the most widespread problems mentioned during focus group discussions that adversely affect migration decisions: [...]...|$|R
500|$|In 1997, coach Steve Fisher {{was fired}} for his {{involvement}} in violations relating to the scandal. Subsequently, the NCAA investigation did not find him culpable of significant wrongdoing related to the scandal. [...] By the fall of 2002, {{it was obvious that}} the four players were in fact guilty of taking money from Martin, and had thus compromised their amateur status. In response, Michigan placed the basketball program on two years' probation. It also withdrew from postseason consideration for the 200203 season, vacated all or part of five past seasons and removed the players' names and achievements from its record book. A few months later, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the <b>probation</b> <b>period</b> and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered Michigan to disassociate from the three living guilty players until 2012 (Webber's ban extended through 2013, and a fourth player included in this sanction, Traylor, has since died). The punishment cost the 20022003 team its post-season eligibility, cost past teams the 1997 National Invitation Tournament and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament championships as well as appearances in the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Final Fours. It cost Chris Webber his All-American 1993 honors, Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in free throws and the Big Ten's all-time leader in 3-point field goals (surpassed in 2011).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} environmental policy instrument choice for achieving deep emissions reductions in the industrial sector. Specifically, it provides: (a) a theoretical review of {{the conditions under which}} performance standards can provide efficient incentives for environmental compliance and innovation; and (b) an analysis of the design and the outcomes of the standards-based regulation of industrial pollutants in Sweden during the period 1970 - 1990. The empirical findings suggest that the Swedish regulatory approach comprised many key elements of an efficient policy-induced transition towards radically lower emissions in the metal smelting and pulp and paper industries. The regulation relied heavily on performance standards, thus granting flexibility to firms in terms of selecting the appropriate compliance measures, and the standards were implemented in combination with extended <b>probation</b> <b>periods.</b> R&D projects and the new knowledge that was advanced incrementally in interaction between the company, the environmental authorities and the research institutions provided a direct catalyst to the regulatory process. As such the Swedish regulatory approach provided scope for creative solutions, environmental innovation, and permitted the affected firms to coordinate pollution prevention measures with productive investments.

50|$|Catholic monasteries are officially {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the papacy, yet Pius IX on 21 June 1847, addressed them and asked for reforms. He wrote, that monasteries form an indispensable bridge between the secular and religious world and fulfill therefore an important function for the Church as a whole.

Specifics included reform of the monastic habits, music and the theological preparation in the monasteries. most but not all of them accepted the reforms of the Pope. Pius did not hesitate to impose reform-minded superiors in several congregations. A special relation existed between him and the Jesuit order, which had educated him as a young boy.

30|$|Theoretical {{considerations}} about wage {{effects of}} FTCs across the wage distribution should also {{take into account}} workers’ differences in labor market opportunities. If workers at the upper tail of the wage distribution have good labor market opportunities (e.g., labor supply shortage of highly qualified experts or successful managers), they might work voluntarily with FTCs and change firms more frequently to increase their wages during bargaining processes. Consequently, the wage differentials between workers with temporary and permanent contracts {{are likely to be}} small or even in favor of FTCs at the upper tail of the wage distribution. On the other hand, workers with bad labor market opportunities at the lower tail of the wage distribution (excess labor supply) are likely to suffer more from segregation. If their temporary employment does not allow them to enter internal labor markets, the wage penalties for FTCs at the lower tail of the wage distribution should be larger. Due to excess labor supply and larger quality uncertainty of workers with bad labor market opportunities, extended <b>probation</b> <b>periods</b> in form of FTCs are likely to be used more frequently, which should also lead to larger wage penalties for FTCs at the lower tail of the wage distribution.|$|R
