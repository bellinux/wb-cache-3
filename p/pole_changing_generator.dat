We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14 %) than those for taking only local context into account. ...|$|R

The resulting maps are analyzed for correlations of its maxima with directions from the cluster centre to 1.) the derived `physical' cluster poles, 2.) the Local Supercluster centre, 3.) the Virgo A centre and 4.) the Earth, i. e. along the line of sight (LOS). The strong maxima - with one exception - exist only for non-spiral (NS) sub-samples, with the maximum well correlated with the LOS direction. For clusters with a clearly defined weak maximum the conclusion generally does not change. For the spiral (S) sub-samples the maps are usually at the random noise level. In these cases a weaker, but still existent correlation with the LOS is observed and no other evident correlations are noted. We conclude that the strong systematic effect, generated by the process of galactic axis de-projection from its optical image, is present in the catalogue data. With the use of a simple model for the systematic effect we are able to reproduce the main characteristic features of the maps for NS galaxies.

40|$|Induction motors are {{the most}} widely used {{electrical}} motors due to their reliability, low cost and robustness. However, induction motors do not inherently have the capability of variable speed operation. Due to this reason, earlier dc motors were applied in most of the electrical drives. But the recent developments in speed control methods of the induction motor have led to their large scale use in almost all electrical drives. Out of the several methods of speed control of an induction such as <b>pole</b> <b>changing,</b> frequency variation, variable rotor resistance, variable stator voltage, constant V/f control, slip recovery method etc., the closed loop constant V/f speed control method is most widely used. In this method, the V/f ratio is kept constant which in turn maintains the magnetizing flux constant so that the maximum torque remains unchanged. Thus, the motor is completely utilized in this method. During starting of an induction motor, the stator resistance and the motor inductance (both rotor and stator) must be kept low to reduce the steady state time and also to reduce the jerks during starting. On the other hand, higher value of rotor resistance leads to lesser jerks while having no effect on the steady state time. The vector control analysis of an induction motor allows the decoupled analysis where the torque and the flux components can be independently controlled (just as in dc motor). This makes the analysis easier than the per phase equivalent circuit. ...|$|R

Out of the a number of methods of speed control of an induction such as <b>pole</b> <b>changing,</b> frequency variation, variable rotor resistance, variable stator voltage, constant V/f control, slip recovery method etc., the constant V/f speed control method is the majority generally used. In this method, the V/f ratio is kept constant which in turn maintains the magnetizing flux constant so that the maximum torque remains unchanged. Thus, the motor is totally utilized in this method. This paper include with simulation of V/F speed control of three-phase induction motor using PWM inverter strategy. The simulation work proves the idea of V/F control using PWM inverter and the software used for simulation is PSIM (Powersim). The performance of the volt per hertz strategy were evaluated through simulation shown in results. In constant V/F control, by use PWM inverter, we can vary the supply voltage {{as well as the}} supply frequency such that the V/F ratio remains constant so that the flux remains constant too. So, we can get different operating zone for various speeds and torques and also we can get different synchronous speed with almost same maximum torque. Thus the motor is fully utilized and also we have a good variety of speed control. It is effortless, cost-effective to easier to design in open loop. But the drawbacks of open loop is it doesn’t correct the change in output also it doesn’t reach the steady state quickly. Index term — Induction motor, Speed control, V/F method, PWM Inverte...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the mathematical analysis of the speed control of the Hoist Motor installed in the Transtainer, Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Transtainer is a crane used for the handling of containers and the Hoist Motor installed in the transtainer is used for the lifting and lowering of the containers from the container vessel to the container yard or vice versa. This analysis has been done for the hoist operation of the transtainer. The hoisting speed is started from the zero speed and reached to a steady speed after the acceleration is finished and finally, it is reached to the zero speed again. This complete cycle is known as the hoist operation. A separately excited DC motor is used for the Hoist Motor to lift a container load. The operator of the transtainer uses the joystick controller having five notch positions to control the speed of the hoist motor and when the operator uses the joystick controller from zero to fourth notch, the speed varies from zero up to the base speed and when the joystick controller is put from fourth notch position to fifth notch position, the speed of the motor is varied from the base speed to the final steady state speed which is higher than the base speed. This final speed depends on the container load which is lifted by thehoist motor. The Hoist Motor speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current. The armature voltage of the hoist motor is controlled by <b>changing</b> the DC <b>generator</b> out put voltage which is directly supplied to the hoist motorThe Hoist Motor speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current.
