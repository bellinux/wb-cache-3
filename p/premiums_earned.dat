40|$|This paper uses {{a variety}} of data sources to study the effect of {{deregulation}} {{on the structure of}} wages in the airline industry. Microdata from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses show a 10 percent decline in the relative earnings of airline workers after deregulation, with roughly similar declines for industry-specific occupations (pilots and flight attendants) and general occupations (managers and secretaries). Union contract data for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics at the major firms show similar trends in the levels of earnings along with a rise in inter-firm wage inequality [...] especially for pilots. Finally, data from the displaced worker surveys reveal that airline workers experienced similar wage losses to job-losers from other industries over the 1980 s. Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that the rent <b>premiums</b> <b>earned</b> by airline workers in the regulatory era were relatively modest, and comparable to the wage <b>premiums</b> <b>earned</b> in many other sectors. ...|$|E

Married workers tend to be located in higher paying job grades; there are very small pay differentials within grades.

The paper is devoted mainly to a careful specification of the income tax rules, and to deriving the connection between predictions about simple forms of insurance policy and industry data on <b>premiums</b> <b>earned.</b> Although the predicted impact of the changes in the tax rules enacted in 1986 translates into a tax on premiums (net of the cost of acquisition) of up to 13 percent (on medical malpractice, the longest-tail line of insurance, in 1987), it is small relative to the variability of the actual loss experience. ...|$|E

40|$|If {{labor markets}} {{operated}} entirely frictionless, productivity premiums associated with different worker characteristics would equal the wage <b>premiums</b> <b>earned</b> by workers possessing those characteristics. Using matched employer-employee {{data from the}} manufacturing sector of three sub-Saharan countries, we evaluate {{to what extent the}} two premiums differ for four characteristics that are clearly related to human capital: schooling, training, experience, and tenure. Equality holds strongly and even surprisingly well for firms in Zimbabwe (the most developed country in the sample), but not at all in Tanzania (the least developed country), while results in Kenya are intermediate. Where equality fails, the pattern is for general human capital characteristics (schooling, experience) to receive a wage return that exceeds the productivity return, while the reverse applies to more firm-specific human capital characteristics (training, tenure). Schooling tends to be over-rewarded, even though large productivity gains are consistently associated with formal employee training programs. Wages tend to rise with experience, while productivity gains are mostly associated with tenure. We demonstrate the remarkable robustness of the findings controlling, among other things, for sampling errors, nonlinear effects, and non-wage benefits. Localized labor markets and imperfect substitutability of different worker-types provide a partial explanations for the estimated gap between the wage and productivity premiums. nrpages: 41 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|S {{part of the}} {{comprehensive}} revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) that {{is scheduled to be}} released on December 10, 2003, a change in the definition of property and casualty in-surance services will be introduced. This definitional change will recognize the implicit services that are funded by investment income, will adopt a treatment of insured losses that is more consistent with the eco-nomic behavior of the insurer, and will change the treatment of reinsurance. This change is briefly de-scribed in the June 2003 issue of the SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS, and some of the associated changes in the ta-bles are described in the August 2003 issue. 1 The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) currently measures services of the property-casualty insurance industry as its net <b>premiums</b> <b>earned</b> minus net losses incurred and dividend to policyholders, where net pre-miums and losses refer to premiums and losses net of reinsurance. However, the insurance output measured using the current definition does not include all the services provided by the property-casualty insurance companies. Property-casualty insurance companies provide three types of services: Risk-pooling, financial services relating to insured losses, and intermediation. Insur-ance provides a mechanism for consumers, businesses, and government that are exposed to property-casualty losses to engage in risk reduction through pooling. The insurer provides a variety of real services for policy-holders, such as loss settlements, risk surveys, and loss prevention plans. The insurer collects premiums in ad-vance of the loss payments and holds the funds in re-serves until the claims are paid. The insurer also provides intermediation services through the invest...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of day laborer worker centers on the hourly wages earned by day laborers. Methods: Using data from the National Day Labor Survey, a two-step method was estimated to measure the wage impacts of day labor worker centers, and to control for endogeneity and selection bias. Estimated wages were compared across hiring sites to determine whether or not a wage <b>premium</b> was <b>earned</b> by workers who participate in day labor worker centers. Results: We find a modest, but statistically significant, wage <b>premium</b> <b>earned</b> by workers who participate in day labor worker centers, as well as evidence suggestive of the capacity of worker centers to mitigate market advantages associated with informal hiring sites. Conclusions: We argue that while worker centers remain the most effective means through which day labor markets can be regulated and workers' wages improved, increasing the regulatory capacity of these labor market intermediaries will require a significant "scaling up," so that they can more fully influence the larger political, economic, and social contexts in which the day labor economy is embedded. © 2013 by the Southwestern Social Science Association...|$|R
