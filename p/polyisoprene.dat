5|$|Due {{to their}} natural <b>polyisoprene</b> content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The {{chemical}} structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the <b>polyisoprene</b> begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the terminal relaxation in high molec-ular weight <b>polyisoprenes</b> by dynamic mechanical measurements (C. A. Bero and C. M. Roland, Macromolecules, 29, 1562 (1996)) has found the terminal relaxation times {{to be more sensitive}} to changes in temperature for three-arm stars than for the linear <b>polyisoprenes.</b> Moreover, these measurements, carried out with signi®cantly higher molecular weight samples than heretofore, show that the molecular weight dependence of the terminal relaxation times for three-arm star <b>polyisoprenes</b> is much weaker than the exponential dependence previously proposed (L. J. Fetters, et al., Macromolecules, 26, 647 (1993)). Tracer diffusion of labeled linear and three-arm star polyethylene-like diffusant molecules in a highly entangled linear polyethylene matrix exhibit tem-perature and molecular weight dependencies similar to those observed spectroscopically from bulk polymers. Both the temperature and molecular weight dependencies for the star-branched polymers are at variance with the predictions of the reptation model.

40|$|Quaternization of the end-groups of α,ω-(dimethylamino) <b>polyisoprenes</b> with monofunctional, difunctional and trifunctional halides (iodides and bromides) {{has been}} {{undertaken}} on polymers of different molecular weights (Mn = 6000 and 38000 gmol-l). The thermal {{stability of the}} ammonium end-groups is somewhat better when iodide counteranions are present. Quaternization increases the T~ of the material. This effect is more pronounced for low molecular weight chains, especially when a short alkyl group quaternizing agent is used. However, {{the size of the}} alkyl or aryl radical has a minor effect on polymer Tj when difunctional quaternizing agents are used. Nevertheless, the modulus of the rubber-like plateau of materials with difunctional agents is higher than with monofunctional quaternizing agents, owing to coupling reactions between the chain-ends. Rheological measurements indicate that the quaternized low molecular weight <b>polyisoprenes</b> exhibit an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence characterized by activation energies which vary between 121 and 146 kJmol- 1 and suggest that the relaxations attributed to dipole-dipole interactions dominate over long chain entanglements.

40|$|International audienceDegradation {{study of}} trans- 1, 4 -polyisoprene (trans- 1, 4 -PI), {{that can be}} {{produced}} by the nature, was performed using first and second generation Grubbs and Hoveyda Grubbs catalysts with olefins (ethylene or 1 -octene) as transfer agents in toluene at 60 C. While first generation Grubbs catalyst afforded low degradation, highlighting the presence of catalyst decomposition and/or inter-chain cross-metathesis reactions, an almost complete metathetic degradation could be reached using the second generation Grubbs catalyst in few minutes. Nevertheless, the synthesis of well-defined <b>polyisoprenes</b> with a targeted molar mass revealed to be difficult with Grubbs catalysts.
