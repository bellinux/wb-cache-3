500|$|The {{persistence}} of such attitudes {{was fueled by}} resentment {{over the fact that}} Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black <b>peers.</b> <b>Into</b> the 21st century, the notion that Presley had [...] "stolen" [...] black music still found adherents. Notable among African American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, [...] "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis." [...] And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his debt. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [...]" [...] Nine years earlier, he had said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for NME in 1980 Chis Salewicz {{described}} the album as [...] "being {{probably the best}} album this year by a British band". In his review of the album for Smash Hits, Ian Cranna said that the album was [...] "proof positive that there's just no substitute for a good song delivered with power and emotion". Cranna added, [...] " [...] deliver attractive melodies with dark and moody (but not obscure) personal lyrics, all turned into compulsive listening by a driving beat, ringing guitars and a hauntingly emotional voice." [...] Reviewing the album in 1981 for Rolling Stone magazine, David Fricke awarded it {{four out of five}} stars and said when describing McCulloch's vocals, [...] " [...] specializes in a sort of apocalyptic brooding, combining Jim Morrison-style psychosexual yells, a flair for David Bowie-like vocal inflections and the nihilistic bark of his punk <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> a disturbing portrait of the singer as a young neurotic". He went on to say, [...] "Behind him, gripping music swells into Doors-style dirges ('Pictures on My Wall'), PiL-like guitar dynamics ('Monkeys'), spookily evocative pop ('Rescue') and Yardbirds-cum-Elevators ravers jacked up in the New Wave manner ('Do It Clean,' 'Crocodiles')". Reviewing the 2003 remastered version for American music magazine Blenders website, reviewer Andrew Harrison also gave the album four out of five stars and said, [...] " [...] the Bunnymen were a pure nihilistic thrill, with Will Sergeant's desperate, mantra-like guitar summoning up a primal night of blinking hallucinations." ...|$|E

[...] In the first, one of the characters walks to Market Square, where he witnesses a street preacher [...] "screaming incoherently and brandishing a tattered Bible," [...] before traversing the market house and eventually buying traps at a hardware store. [...] In Suttree, the title character sells his fish to a Market Square fish vendor, passing along the way [...] "derelict trucks," [...] "pariahs," [...] "blind singers," [...] "organists," [...] "psalmists," [...] "beggars," [...] and [...] "wild street preachers."

All night as well as all day the Spirit of Fear searches out the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. It will not let them sleep. It will not let them eat in peace. It drives them to seek new hiding-places and then drives them out of those. It keeps them ever ready to fly or run at the slightest sound.|$|E

The villagers stone him when he <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> the daylight, {{although}} he is a priest, and he runs back again as a strayed wolf turns into tall crops. He is a one-eyed man and carries, burnt between his brows, the impress of two copper coins. Some say that he was tortured by a native prince in the old days; for he is so old that he must have been capable of mischief in the days of Runjit Singh.

60|$|He {{came to the}} English throne {{with great}} ease.

He took a month to come from Edinburgh to London; and, by way of exercising his new power, hanged a pickpocket on the journey without any trial, and knighted everybody he could lay hold of. He made two hundred knights before he got to his palace in London, and seven hundred before he had been in it three months. He also shovelled sixty-two new <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> the House of Lords--and there was a pretty large sprinkling of Scotchmen among them, you may believe.|$|E

He sate {{in the middle of his}} table with the duchess dowager on his right hand, and Berengaria, who was taken out by the green riband, on the other. As he knew the green riband would be soon exhausted, he devoted himself to Lady Montfort, and left the duchess to her own resources, which were considerable, and she was soon laying down her opinions on men and things to her other neighbours with much effect. The manufacturers talked shop to each other in whispers, that is to say, mixed House of Commons tattle about bills and committees with news from Manchester and Liverpool, and the West Riding. The metropolitan members, then a more cosmopolitan body and highly miscellaneous in their character and pursuits, were louder, and perhaps more easy, even ventured to talk across the table when near its end, and enticed the <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> discussions on foreign politics.|$|E
6000|$|In fast-failing daylight, FALDER, in his stockings, is seen [...] {{standing}} motionless, {{with his}} head inclined towards the door, [...] listening.

He is trying [...] harder and harder to hear something, any little thing that is [...] going on outside. He springs suddenly upright--as if at a [...] sound-and remains perfectly motionless. Then, with a heavy [...] sigh, he moves to his work, and stands looking at it, with his [...] head doom; he does a stitch or two, having the air of a man so [...] lost in sadness that each stitch is, as it were, a coming to [...] life. Then turning abruptly, he begins pacing the cell, moving [...] his head, like an animal pacing its cage. He stops again at the [...] door, listens, and, placing the palms of hip hands against it [...] with his fingers spread out, leans his forehead against the [...] iron. Turning from it, presently, he moves slowly back towards [...] the window, tracing his way with his finger along the top line [...] of the distemper that runs round the wall. He stops under the [...] window, and, picking up the lid of one of the tins, <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> [...] it. It has grown very nearly dark. Suddenly the lid falls out [...] of his hand with a clatter--the only sound that has broken the [...] silence--and he stands staring intently at the wall where the [...] stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness--he [...] seems to be seeing somebody or something there.

6000|$|So I must own that, {{without much}} repining, on the {{contrary}} with something akin to gratitude, Amelia took the crumbs that her father-in-law let drop now and then, and with them fed her own parent. Directly she understood it to be her duty, it was this young woman's nature (ladies, she is but thirty still, and we choose to call her a young woman even at that age) it was, I say, her nature to sacrifice herself and to fling all that she had {{at the feet of}} the beloved object. During what long thankless nights had she worked out her fingers for little Georgy whilst at home with her; what buffets, scorns, privations, poverties had she endured for father and mother! And in the midst of all these solitary resignations and unseen sacrifices, she did not respect herself any more than the world respected her, but I believe thought in her heart that she was a poor-spirited, despicable little creature, whose luck in life was only too good for her merits. O you poor women! O you poor secret martyrs and victims, whose life is a torture, who are stretched on racks in your bedrooms, and who lay your heads down on the block daily at the drawing-room table; every man who watches your pains, or <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> those dark places where the torture is administered to you, must pity you--and--and thank God that he has a beard. I recollect seeing, years ago, at the prisons for idiots and madmen at Bicetre, near Paris, a poor wretch bent down under the bondage of his imprisonment and his personal infirmity, to whom one of our party gave a halfpenny worth of snuff in a cornet or [...] "screw" [...] of paper. The kindness was too much for the poor epileptic creature. He cried in an anguish of delight and gratitude: if anybody gave you and me a thousand a year, or saved our lives, we could not be so affected. And so, if you properly tyrannize over a woman, you will find a h'p'orth of kindness act upon her and bring tears into her eyes, as though you were an angel benefiting her.|$|E
