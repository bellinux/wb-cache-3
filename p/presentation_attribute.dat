40|$|Readability is {{a crucial}} <b>presentation</b> <b>attribute</b> that web {{summarization}} algorithms consider while generating a querybaised web summary. Readability quality also forms an important component in real-time monitoring of commercial search-engine results since readability of web summaries impacts clickthrough behavior, as shown in recent studies, and thus impacts user satisfaction and advertising revenue. The standard approach to computing the readability is to first collect a corpus of random queries and their corresponding search result summaries, and then each summary is then judged by a human for its readabilty quality. An average readability score is then reported. This process is time consuming and expensive. Besides, the manual evaluation process {{can not be used}} in the real-time summary generation process. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach to the problem. We use the corpus as described above and extract summary features that we think may characterize readability. We then estimate a model (gradient boosted decision tree) that predicts human judgments given the features. This model can then be used in real time to estimate the readability of new (unseen) web search summaries and also be used in the summary generation process. We present results on approximately 5000 editorial judgments collected {{over the course of a}} year and show examples where the model predicts the quality well and where it disagrees with human judgments. We compare the results of the model to previous models of readability, most notably Collins-Thompson-Callan, Fog and Flesch-Kincaid, and see that our model shows substantially better correlation with editorial judgments as measured by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The learning algorithm also provides us with the relative importance of the features used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{multimedia}} {{framework is}} employed, {{to embrace the}} interactive and visual presentation {{of a series of}} case-studies with large conventional (static), and multi-mode (dynamic) data sets. This reveals multifaceted presentation requirements. Graphs are utilised to enable rigorous MMS design, effortless updates and unproblematic future expansion. Multimedia environments (MME) facilitate rapid prototyping and a data-oriented approach is advocated. As a result, the customised <b>presentation</b> <b>attributes</b> vary widely from case-study to case-study, touching upon aspects such as interfaces, interaction, data content organisation and presentation styles. At the user-level, a number of novel features are introduced, beyond those frequently observed in propriety software. Interaction through multi-menus engenders direct interfacing with the underlying graph, enabling effortless transition, and direct data-access, notwithstanding remote data content. Combinations of novel interaction techniques are realised, being combined under a single interface. The presentation content, originates from simulation and experimental scientific fields of study. The MMSs advanced have been actively used to cover presentation requirements, in addressing both industrial and academic audiences. ...|$|R

If the electronic form of the document is only used for compact storage or if the way the document looks to the human eye is all there is, then it suffices to archive the document as an image. If additional functionality is needed, such as text searching, storing only the image is not enough. In this case the text {{also needs to be}} archived along with the image of the document. By restoring the original appearance of a file as an image a future user can see what the original file looks like in page layout, style, font etc. The text itself needs to be exported i.e. in ASCII format and can be saved as a sequence of homogeneous elements (all <b>presentation</b> <b>attributes</b> like font, size, etc. are the same for all characters) because the page image shows the exact look of the page. In this case the UVC program of the data has two parts, one to decode the text and one to decode the image.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to examine whether a reject-the-worst strategy is more efficient than an accept-the-best strategy for women in response to serial information and to identify the point at which a woman will terminate her assessment of a prospective mate’s attributes. A pilot survey was conducted to determine the chronological order in which attribute information typically becomes available during the early stages of a relationship. Using this order of <b>presentation,</b> <b>attributes</b> were presented to participants one at a time. After participants specified their minimum acceptable percentile level for each attribute, they were given numerical feedback about the extent to which the prospect exceeded or failed to meet their standard. Participants were randomly assigned to either the accept-the-best condition (accept a date or request more information) or the reject-the-worst condition (reject a date or request more information). Participants in the reject-the-worst condition requested more trait information before making a decision than those in the accept-the-best condition. This suggests that the costs of a false-negative error exceed those of a false-positive error and that in actively accepting a mate, women satisfice rather than optimize...|$|R

Also, the {{food and beverage}} sector has become intensely competitive with a proliferation of Western themed restaurants and concepts. The purpose of the study is to compare Chinese customers??? expectation and satisfaction with Chinese and Western restaurants. 251 Chinese restaurant diners participated in the experimental study. The respondents were asked to rate the importance and performance scores of 30 restaurant attributes. The results of the study showed that Chinese customers considered five restaurant factors when they selected restaurants: (1) food attributes, (2) service <b>attributes,</b> (3) <b>presentation</b> <b>attributes,</b> (4) value attributes, and (5) supplementary attributes. For both Chinese and Western themed restaurants, findings indicate that Chinese diners rate food as the most important criterion. However, service quality was a relatively more important criterion for Western themed restaurants when compared with Chinese restaurants. Lastly, value was relatively of greater importance when it came to Chinese restaurants as opposed to western restaurants. Findings help to distinguish differentiating criteria that Chinese customers apply and can be used to build on the knowledge of the food and beverage sector as foreign entrants seek to expand in China.

These are atomic text units generalising the concepts of character and glyph by merging them in a common data structure, together with an arbitrary number of user-defined properties. In the first part, we give a survey of the notions of character and glyph and their relation with Natural Language Processing models, some visual text representation issues and strategies adopted by file formats (SVG, PDF, DVI) and software (Uniscribe, Pango). In the second part we show applications of textemes in various text processing issues: ligatures, variant glyphs and other OpenType-related properties, hyphenation, color and other <b>presentation</b> <b>attributes,</b> Arabic form and morphology, CJK spacing, metadata, etc. Finally we describe how the Omega typesetting system implements texteme processing {{as an example of a}} generalised approach to input character stream parsing, internal representation of text, and modular typographic transformations.

40|$|In {{the human}} visual system, {{different}} attributes of an object, such as shape and color, are separately processed in different modules and then integrated to elicit a specific response. In this process, different attributes {{are thought to}} be temporarily “bound” together by focusing attention on the object; however, how such binding contributes to stimulus-response mapping remains unclear. Here we report that learning and performance of stimulus-response tasks was more difficult when three attributes of the stimulus determined the correct response than when two attributes did. We also found that spatially separated <b>presentations</b> of <b>attributes</b> considerably complicated the task, although they did not markedly affect target detection. These results are consistent with a paired-attribute model in which bound feature pairs, rather than object representations, are associated with responses by learning. This suggests that attention does not bind three or more attributes into a unitary object representation, and long-term learning is required for their integration...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{make use of}} a {{particular}} technique of data analysis to empirically study the effect of joint <b>attributes</b> <b>presentation</b> in a multi-step process of choice, in which consumers first use a simple method for shortlisting, then proceed with a closer inspection of a restrict number of alternatives. Shortlisting {{is based on an}} incomplete description of the attributes of an alternative. We focus, in particular, on the <b>presentation</b> couples of <b>attributes.</b> The mathematical framework we used is the generalized spectral analysis. We tested this method on data collected through an ad hoc survey. Thanks to this powerful machinery we were able to identify the attraction single attributes have, from the effect of their combination. The use of generalized spectral analysis to decompose data on preferences is totally new. The decomposition allows us to underline two effects: the first and second order effect. The first order effect measures the average attraction that a single feature has when it is coupled with a second one. The second order effect detects the positive (or negative) power of combination of two coupled attributes. We present here a particular case, the choice of a car, among the ones we studied, to show how the method can be used, and its power. A particular emphasis will be given to gender differences in the evaluation of car attributes in the choice process. ...|$|R

During the Renaissance however, rhetoric developed into the study of how to write official and private letters as well as records. The revised Ars Dictaminis took its guidelines from one of Cicero's works, the de inventione and pseudo-Ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium.
