5|$|The {{games were}} {{the first in the}} series that did not contain all of the Pokémon from <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> Sugimori stated that the team tried to include all the new Pokémon as well as some from <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> When asked about any {{features}} that could not be included due to technical restrictions, Masuda noted that he wanted each individual Pokémon to make up to three different cries depending on its mood.|$|E
5|$|Ruby and Sapphire {{received}} mostly positive reviews, though {{critics were}} divided in their {{assessment of the}} games, especially on the gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused {{on the fact that}} the gameplay had not changed much since <b>previous</b> <b>generations,</b> and the connectivity issues revolving around the past generations. With the popularity of Pokémon waning at the time, the games sold less than <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> However, they were still critical and commercial successes; with around 16 million copies sold according to IGN, they are the best-selling games for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{comic book}} {{readers of the}} Silver Age were more scientifically-inclined than <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> Thus, comic books of the Silver Age {{explained}} superhero phenomena and origins through science, inspired by contemporary science fiction, {{as opposed to the}} Golden Age, which commonly relied on magic or mysticism.|$|E
50|$|Released in June 1999. This model also {{adopted the}} SK {{platform}} {{which is based}} on <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> SS/SE model. Like the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> the Bongo Brawny was larger in all key dimensions. Available both normal (middle) 2400mm wheel base and long 2600mm. The Brawny retained many of the parts of the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> such as the sliding side doors, and looks rather similar to the <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> model. The E-series label continued to be used in export markets, although they were now fewer than before. The Bongo Brawny was discontinued in August 2010.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} uses the running gear of the <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> car {{and has a}} different design than the third generation Clio. The name Clio was dropped in favor to just Symbol, or Thalia in those markets where this name was used on the <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|R

5|$|Christmas in the United States {{during the}} post-war years (19461964) {{reflected}} {{a period of}} peace, productivity, and prosperity. Americans staged sumptuous Christmases and enjoyed a variety of holiday foods unknown to <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> Several films, foods, toys, and television programs of the era have become American Christmas traditions.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|As in <b>previous</b> <b>generations,</b> Nintendo {{provided}} {{strong support}} for its new console with popular first-party franchises like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokémon, among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games, consisting of Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, and Wii Music, where players {{make use of the}} motion-sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities. With the exception of Wii Music, the games and their sequels have all been highly successful.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes in the landscape. <b>Previous</b> <b>generations</b> created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent of the devastation caused by the emerald ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E
5|$|Like Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Ruby and Sapphire {{keep track}} of real-life time; this {{influences}} events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, Ruby and Sapphire do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to {{the differences in the}} technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, Ruby and Sapphire cannot be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> of painters.|$|E
50|$|MacTCP and the <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> AppleTalk library {{were slow}} on PowerPC-based Macintoshes {{because they were}} written for <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> 680x0-based Macintoshes and {{therefore}} ran under emulation on PowerPC-based machines. MacTCP was also lacking in features, however, and a major upgrade was clearly needed if Apple was to keep its hand in the Internet market.|$|R
50|$|This {{generation}} of Civic used lightweight materials {{to create a}} fuel efficient economy car. Compared to the <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> the cowl was raised, which allowed for more suspension travel. Along with that change the ride became softer {{than that of the}} <b>previous</b> <b>generation,</b> which provided a more compliant ride at expense of crisper handling.|$|R

5|$|The third laird, {{also named}} James, {{inherited}} the estate in 1777; he was usually {{referred to as}} the Member to differentiate him from <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> Like his forebears, he was an advocate but also became a Member of Parliament. He too continued to expand and improve the estate; he constructed a lake and a canal, and built the new mansion. He also expanded and altered Longside {{at the start of the}} 1800s, founded Mintlaw in 1813, assisted in the extension of New Deer and extended Buchanhaven.|$|E
5|$|Both models {{include an}} Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary {{difference}} between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, {{in comparison to the}} 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2010, Masuda {{announced}} on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to evoke {{a feeling of}} it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pokémon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b> For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green, and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White {{from the start of}} the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.|$|E
50|$|The Virtex-7 {{family is}} based on a 28 nm design and is {{reported}} to deliver a two-fold system performance improvement at 50 percent lower power compared to <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Virtex-6 devices. In addition, Virtex-7 doubles the memory bandwidth compared to <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Virtex FPGAs with 1866 Mbit/s memory interfacing performance and over two million logic cells.|$|R

50|$|The sixth-generation iPod touch {{maintains}} an identical exterior design to the <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> iPod touch, {{with the exception}} of the iPod touch Loop button. It is available in silver, gold, space gray, pink, blue, and a Product Red version which is only available at Apple Stores and the Apple Online Store, although each color's shade is slightly different than the <b>previous</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|R
5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. Yet while historians often dismissed it {{as the last of}} the archaic mode of Ancien Régime warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in <b>previous</b> <b>generations.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the <b>previous</b> <b>generations,</b> searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System formed 4.568 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by <b>previous</b> <b>generations</b> of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.|$|E
50|$|Xilinx's most {{recently}} announced Virtex, the Virtex 7 family, {{is based on}} a 28 nm design and is reported to deliver a two-fold system performance improvement at 50 percent lower power compared to <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Virtex-6 devices. In addition, Virtex-7 doubles the memory bandwidth compared to <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> Virtex FPGAs with 1866 Mbit/s memory interfacing performance and over two million logic cells.|$|R
50|$|The AM4 socket has {{different}} dimensions than previous AMD sockets, making some <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> coolers incompatible. However, some cooler manufacturers {{are reported to}} be offering brackets allowing previously manufactured coolers to work with AM4, while other coolers will be redesigned. Alternatively, some motherboard makers are including both AM3 and AM4 cooler mounting holes, allowing <b>previous</b> <b>generation</b> coolers to be used.|$|R
