5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> fell incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter Alabama {{completed}} a 10-play, 58-yard drive by scoring on a two-yard run by backup tailback Trent Richardson. The key plays were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama good starting position at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> left the game tied 14–14 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were leading 17–0 at halftime when head coach Mike Holmgren benched {{starting}} quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half. On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> was deflected by Buccaneers player Ray Seals and caught by Favre.

5|$|Sentries did detect boats {{moving along}} the river that morning, but they were expecting a French supply convoy to <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> night—a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified. When the boats, loaded with the first wave lof British troops, were {{challenge}}d, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers forced four {{turnovers}} {{and held}} Bears running back Walter Payton to 24yards on 15 carries, but the offense, who also committed four turnovers, was ineffective. One of Payton's runs was a 1-yard touchdown that broke Jim Brown's all-time record of 106 touchdowns. Payton also caught a 9-yard touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> clinched {{the game with}} 3:20 remaining. The Buccaneers had only a field goal to show for four possessions inside the Bears' 30-yard line. Vinny Testaverde made his NFL debut after Steve DeBerg left {{the game in the}} fourth quarter with a sprained medial collateral ligament.|$|E

5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence <b>Pass</b> <b>that</b> soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round.

5|$|Virginia Tech responded on the {{possession}} that ensued with their only touchdown {{of the game}} on a 77-yard Trey Edmunds touchdown run that cut the lead to 14–7. Early in the second quarter, Vinnie Sunseri intercepted a Logan Thomas pass and returned it 38-yards for a touchdown and a 21–7 lead. The teams then again traded punts before Kyle Fuller intercepted an AJ McCarron <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> set up an eventual 29-yard Cody Journell field goal. On the kickoff that ensued, Jones scored his second non-offensive touchdown of the game on a 94-yard return that made the halftime score 28–10.|$|E

5|$|While {{the battle}} was {{underway}} at Yudam-ni, the PVA 59th Division blocked the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri by attacking the defending Charlie and Fox Companies of the 7th Marines. The successful assault forced Charlie Company to retreat into Yudam-ni which left Fox Company trapped in Toktong Pass, a vital <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> controlled the road. On 29 November, several efforts by the 7th Marines failed to rescue Fox Company despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. Aided by artillery from Hagaru-ri and Marine Corsair fighters, Fox Company managed to hold out for five days while enduring constant attacks by the PVA 59th Division.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the opening kickoff, Ball State's first drive stalled, and it ultimately went three-and-out. Their punter, Kyle Schmidt, managed only 24 {{yards on the}} punt, and gave Arkansas State the ball at Ball State's 36-yard line. Arkansas State failed {{to capitalize on the}} good field position, however, missing a 34-yard field goal attempt. Subsequently, the teams exchanged punts. After being pinned at their own 11-yard line, the Cardinals embarked on a 14-play, 89-yard drive that featured six rushes by Jahwan Edwards for a total of 44 yards, including one 22-yard rush. Also on the drive, Keith Wenning completed four of five passes, three of which were to Willie Snead, including a 9-yard touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> was the first score of the game. At the end of the quarter, the Red Wolves had just concluded a drive, that had crossed into Ball State's territory before a punt that was downed inside the 5-yard line. On that drive, Fredi Knighten replaced Adam Kennedy at quarterback.|$|E
5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly. After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave the Hurricanes a first down. Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing the Hurricanes back into {{their side of the}} field. On the second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> gave Miami a first down. The Hurricanes were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three plays to score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E
