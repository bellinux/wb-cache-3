In 1902, Trask tried to interest the well-known French Race car driver Henri Fournier, winner of the 1901 Paris-Bordeaux and Paris-Berlin races for Mors, in the Searchmont company. Although he finally failed — he even renamed the company as the Fournier-Searchmont Motor Company — there is some French influence evident in the Searchmont. This is shown in a certain resemblance with the contemporary Mors, and the use of a <b>pressure</b> <b>feed</b> <b>lubrication</b> system — the first in a U.S. production car. This is the reason that the cars of the company were sometimes also referred to as Fournier-Searchmonts.|$|E

Parameters such as {{operating}} <b>pressure,</b> <b>feed</b> concentration, stirring rate and membrane cut-off size were varied and their effects on lignin retention and permeate flux were investigated. The operating <b>pressure,</b> <b>feed</b> concentration and stirring rate were varied in the ranges 150 - 350 kPa, 3 - 9 % and 200 - 400 rpm, respectively. The membranes used had cut-off sizes of 5 kDa, 10 kDa and 20 kDa. A one-factor-at-a-time experimental design approach was applied in this study. Retention of lignin increased with increases in operating <b>pressure,</b> <b>feed</b> concentration and stirring rate, but decreased with an increase in molecular cut-off size of the membrane. Permeate flux on the other hand increased with increases in pressure, stirring rate and molecular cut-off size of the membrane but decreased with an increase in feed concentration. The extraction of lignin from black liquor was successfully carried out and extraction efficiencies as high as 86 % could be achieved depending on the experimental conditions.

There he {{developed}} and constructed a motor car, which he named Marlborough after the province, between 1912 and 1920. It was a touring car, had a four-cylinder engine with a four-inch bore and seven-inch stroke, five main bearings, and full force <b>feed</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Valves were two-and-a-half inches across the face, cam lift was half an inch.

40|$|Mixed matrix {{membranes}} (MMMs) {{with low}} particle loadings {{have been shown}} to improve the properties of pure polymers for many gas separations. Comparatively few reports have been made for high particle loading (≥ 50 vol. %) MMMs. In this work, CO 2 -CH 4 feeds were used to study the potential of 50 vol. % zeolite 4 A-poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) MMMs for natural gas separations. A low CO 2 partial <b>pressure</b> mixed <b>feed</b> probed MMM performance below the plasticization pressure of PVAc and a high CO 2 partial <b>pressure</b> mixed <b>feed</b> probed MMM performance at industrially relevant conditions above the plasticization pressure. Under both mixed feed conditions at 35 °C, substantial improvements in overall separation performance were observed. At low CO 2 partial pressures, CO 2 permeability roughly doubled with a nearly 50 % increase in selectivity versus pure PVAc under the same conditions. For the high CO 2 partial <b>pressure</b> <b>feed,</b> CO 2 permeability remained effectively unchanged with a 63 % increase in selectivity versus pure PVAc. Surprisingly, the performance of these PVAc based MMMs approached the properties of current " upper bound" polymers. Overall, this work shows that significantly improved performance MMMs can be made with traditional techniques from a low cost, low performance polymer without costly adhesion promoters. © 2010...|$|R
