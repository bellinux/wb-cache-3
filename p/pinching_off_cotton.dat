40|$|International audienceThe <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> of {{heterogeneous}} ferrofluid drops at {{a nozzle}} in air was experimentally investigated with {{a magnetic field}} (downward or upward) and without a magnetic field. Compared to homogeneous drops, the self-similarity and universal scaling law were verified through modifying the initial conditions, such as the nozzle diameter, flow rate, and magnitude {{and direction of the}} magnetic fields. Two pinch-off points were observed, and the two consecutive pinch-off dynamics were characterized through scaling laws. Here our scaling exponent remains within the scope of (0. 70 - 0. 80) for the primary whereas it remains within the scope of (0. 60 - 0. 70) for the secondary <b>pinch</b> <b>off,</b> respectively, comparable to the classic range from 2 / 3 to 1 for homogeneous drops. The gravity-compensating and gravity-superimposing magnetic fields display a negligible effect on the exponent but determine the sequence of double <b>pinch</b> <b>offs.</b> The universal character of the self-similar <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> is extended to a heterogeneous fluid...|$|R

In this paper we show that the hypothesis that at the <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> the translational velocity of the ring equals the jet flow velocity near the ring {{is equivalent to the}} recently proposed idea based on a variational principle by Kelvin and Benjamin that the <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> occurs when the apparatus is no longer able to deliver energy at a rate required for steady vortex ring existence.

40|$|The {{recent work}} of Gharib, Rambod, and Shariff [J. Fluid Mech. 360, 121 (1998) ] studied vortex rings formed by {{starting}} jets generated using a piston-cylinder mechanism. Their {{results showed that}} vortex rings generated from starting jets stop forming and <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> from the generating jet for sufficiently large values of the piston stroke to diameter ratio (L/D), suggesting a maximization principle may exist for propulsion utilizing starting jets. The importance of vortex ring formation and <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> to propulsion, however, rests on the relative contribution of the leading vortex ring and the trailing jet (which appears after <b>pinch</b> <b>off)</b> to the impulse supplied to the flow. To resolve {{the relative importance of}} the vortex ring and trailing jet for propulsion, a piston-cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance is used to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by starting jets for L/D ratios in the range 2 – 8. Two different velocity programs are used, providing two different L/D values beyond which <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> is observed, {{in order to determine the}} effect of vortex ring <b>pinch</b> <b>off.</b> Measurements of the impulse associated with vortex ring formation show it to be much larger than that expected from the jet velocity alone and proportionally larger than that associated with a trailing jet for L/D large enough to observe <b>pinch</b> <b>off.</b> The latter result leads to a local maximum in the average thrust during a pulse near L/D values associated with vortex rings whose circulation has been maximized. These results are shown to be related to the nozzle exit over-pressure generated during vortex ring formation. The over-pressure is in turn shown to be associated with the acceleration of ambient fluid by vortex ring formation in the form of added and entrained mass...|$|R

30|$|In Figure 6 a, we can {{recognize}} {{the effect of}} the gate on channel in a DG structure which is more effective than SG due to the asymmetry of SG. In the DG structure the <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> effect was achieved in VG[*]=[*]+ 2, while this value cannot provide the same current value in SG. This required higher voltage to approach <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> effect in SG structure which was in VG[*]=[*]+ 3 [*]V (Figure 5). Figure 6 b shows the drain conductance for SG and DG structures under the different gate voltage. By increasing the gate voltage, the drain conductance for both structures will be decreased. For comparing DG structure to SG device, we have a more effective gate voltage in the channel approaching the <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> effect (off state) with lowest drain conductance, which is consistent to the output characteristics and our expectation about the DG structure. The trend for drain conductance is the same with MOSFETs [41] and JLTs [42], yet the slope is smaller here which can be explained by low doping concentration and current value.|$|R
