5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute <b>presentation</b> called the rules <b>presentation</b> in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules <b>presentation</b> was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules <b>presentation</b> a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules <b>presentation</b> to help explain how to play the game.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{research}} on the patterns of self-harm around public holidays is lacking. This study used national data to examine the patterns of hospital-treated self-harm during public holidays, and to examine associated factors. METHODS: Data on self-harm <b>presentations</b> to all emergency departments {{were obtained from the}} National Self-Harm Registry Ireland. The association between self-harm <b>presentations</b> and public holidays was examined using univariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 104, 371 <b>presentations</b> of self-harm were recorded between 2007 and 2015. The mean number of self-harm <b>presentations</b> was 32 on public holidays. St. Patrick's Day had the highest number of <b>presentations</b> compared to all other public holidays, with a daily mean of 44 <b>presentations.</b> Across all years, self-harm <b>presentations</b> during public holidays had a 24...|$|R

40|$|Most {{multimedia}} servers {{reported in}} the literature are designed to serve multiple and independent video/audio streams.

In this paper, we examine <b>presentations</b> in three different domains (heavyweight, middleweight, and lightweight) and provide buffer management and admission control algorithms for the three domains. We propose two improvements (flattening and dynamic-adjustments) on the schedules created for the heavyweight <b>presentations.</b> Results from a simulation environment are presented.

40|$|AIM: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{estimate}} the proportion of emergency department <b>presentations</b> attributable to children with cerebral palsy (CP), investigate the frequency of emergency department <b>presentations</b> in a CP cohort, and compare emergency department <b>presentations</b> among children with CP with those of other children. METHOD: This was a retrospective cohort study. The Victorian Cerebral Palsy Register was linked to the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset. Data on emergency department <b>presentations</b> for the CP cohort occurring between 2007 and 2014 and population control data were obtained. RESULTS: The CP cohort (n= 1748) had 7015 emergency department <b>presentations</b> during the 7 -year period, accounting for 0. 4 % of the 1. 69 million age-specific <b>presentations</b> during that time. The number of annual <b>presentations</b> per 1000 children rose with increasing CP severity. Compared with <b>presentations</b> among the general population, higher proportions of <b>presentations</b> among the CP cohort were preceded by ambulance arrivals (27 % vs 8 %), triaged as urgent (66 % vs 32 %), and required hospital admission (38 % vs 12 %). INTERPRETATION: The marked differences in <b>presentations</b> between the CP cohort and the general population in the proportions that were urgent and required ambulance arrivals and hospital admissions was an important finding. Strategies to ensure appropriate use of services, including encouragement to seek earlier assistance from primary care providers, may prevent problems escalating to the need for urgent care. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Children with cerebral palsy (CP) account for 0. 4 % of childhood emergency department <b>presentations.</b> More emergency department <b>presentations</b> among children with CP require ambulance arrival. More CP emergency department <b>presentations</b> are urgent and require hospital admission. Traditional emergency department triage scales seem less accurate for this group.
