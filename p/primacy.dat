5|$|Relations with {{bishops in}} England {{remained}} good, with little {{activity in the}} long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the <b>primacy</b> of Britain. Theobald obtained a vague confirmation of his see's <b>primacy</b> from Celestine II in 1143–1144, but at the Council of Reims in 1148 Eugene clarified that this <b>primacy</b> {{did not affect the}} claims of York to be independent of Canterbury. Because of the unsettled election disputes during the 1140s over the see of York, when it was contested between William of York and Henry Murdac, Theobald faced little challenge from either William or Murdac as to the traditional dispute between Canterbury and York. When William of York died in 1154, Theobald secured York for his protégé, Roger de Pont L'Evêque. Further peace between the two sees was ensured when Theobald consecrated Roger without requiring a profession of obedience, which had previously been a major bone of contention between the two.|$|E
5|$|With his {{domestic}} position considerably strengthened, Nasser {{was able to}} secure <b>primacy</b> over his RCC colleagues and gained relatively unchallenged decision-making authority, particularly over foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Khrimian {{clarified}} {{the relations}} between the patriarch of Constantinople and emphasized the <b>primacy</b> of the see of Echmiadzin. In September of that year he sent a letter to Nicholas II in which he called upon the Russian government to prevent the violence then facing the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population.|$|E
5|$|Main reforms {{concerning}} the Roman Catholic Church were initiated {{and carried out}} under Maria Theresa, while the reforms under her son concerned their non-Catholic subjects. The ecclesiastical policies of Maria Theresa, like those of her devout predecessors, were based not on anti-religious principles, but on ensuring <b>primacy</b> of State control in Church-State relations.|$|E
5|$|He {{also carried}} out studies on {{education}} and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the <b>primacy</b> of science and was relatively critical {{of the influence of}} religion. These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E
5|$|In fear of {{a crusade}} by Emeric, Ban Kulin of Bosnia held a synod of the Church of Bosnia at Bilino Polje on 6 April 1203. The synod {{acknowledged}} papal <b>primacy</b> and ordered the reform of the rites. Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's suzerainty. In a letter written in 1203, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in Bulgaria, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.|$|E
5|$|Seen as a restorer of democracy, Endara {{was later}} noted for having defended {{freedom of speech}} and {{democratic}} institutions. He also oversaw a reform of the Panamanian Defense Forces, purging Noriega loyalists, asserting the <b>primacy</b> of the civilian government, and returning the group from military to a national police force. In October 1994, the National Assembly passed an amendment abolishing the military at Endara's urging, becoming the second Latin American country to do so.|$|E
5|$|The <b>primacy</b> of {{imagination}} and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco's style. El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion. He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace {{only if he}} manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease.|$|E
5|$|Urban responded favourably, perhaps {{hoping to}} heal the Great Schism of forty years earlier, and to reunite the Church under papal <b>primacy</b> by helping the Eastern churches in their time of need. Alexios and Urban had {{previously}} been in close contact in 1089 and after, and had discussed openly {{the prospect of the}} (re)union of the Christian church. There were signs of considerable co-operation between Rome and Constantinople in the years immediately before the crusade.|$|E
5|$|After King William I's death Thomas {{served his}} successor, WilliamII, {{and helped to}} put down a {{rebellion}} led by Thomas' old mentor Odo of Bayeux. Thomas also attended the trial for rebellion of the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, Thomas' sole suffragan, or bishop subordinate to York. During William II's reign Thomas once more {{became involved in the}} dispute with Canterbury over the <b>primacy</b> when he refused to consecrate the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm, if Anselm was named the Primate of England in the consecration service. After William II's sudden death in 1100, Thomas arrived too late to crown King HenryI, and died soon after the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Although he feuded with York {{over the}} <b>primacy,</b> it appears clear that Ralph {{considered}} the Investiture Crisis settled in England for, in 1117 while visiting Rome, {{he took a}} neutral position as regards the issues between the Pope and the Emperor. In 1115, however, he refused to consecrate Bernard as Bishop of St David's in the royal chapel, although Robert of Meulan, the king's chief counsellor, advocated that the consecration must {{take place in the}} royal chapel according to ancient custom. The king did not insist and Ralph won the confrontation. He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs in Normanday, as he attended the provincial synod, or Council of Rouen, held in 1118.|$|E
5|$|Chris Metzen {{teamed with}} author Flint Dille and artist Livio Ramondelli {{to create the}} 12-part, {{bi-weekly}} digital comic series Transformers: Autocracy. Autocracy was published by IDW Publishing in 2012. The series focused on the days just before the Great War. It is set after Megatron Origin, and presents the Decepticons as an established force, sowing dissent across Cybertron primarily through terrorist actions. The series focuses on Orion Pax, an Autobot commander charged with rooting out these cells. Transformers: Autocracy was released as a collected Trade Paperback in July 2012 with a bonus forward authored by Metzen. Autocracy was followed by Transformers: Monstrosity in 2013 and Transformers: <b>Primacy</b> in 2014.|$|E
5|$|During Jerry Claiborne's tenure, from 1972 to 1981, {{the team}} {{captured}} three consecutive ACC championships and made seven bowl game appearances, {{the most of}} any Maryland coach to date. In Bobby Ross's five years at Maryland, from 1982 to 1986, he led the team to three consecutive ACC championships and four bowl appearances. In 1984, quarterback Frank Reich led the team to victory from a 31–0 halftime deficit against Miami in what was then the greatest comeback in NCAA football history. This period was marked by bitter competition for ACC <b>primacy</b> with 1981 national champions Clemson, and between 1974 and 1988, each team won six conference championships.|$|E
5|$|Gerard {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} {{on the matter of}} obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's <b>primacy,</b> but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1115 Henry sent Warelwast back to Rome to {{negotiate}} with Paschal, who was angry that the king was prohibiting papal legates in England, not allowing clerics {{to appeal to the}} papal court, and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or the translation of bishops. Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent sanctions against the king. Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the Canterbury–York disputes over the <b>primacy</b> in the English Church, with visits in 1119, 1120, and possibly also in 1116.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Tokyo, Japan. In September {{of that year}} he began service as the rector of the United Nations University, {{replacing}} James M. Hester; he remained in that position until 1987. In Japan he published two further books, The <b>Primacy</b> of Freedom in Development and Development and Freedom. He received the Asia Society Award in 1985, and the Universities Field Staff International Award for Distinguished Service to the Advancement of International Understanding the following year. Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest on 21 December 1989 when he was lecturing at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta.|$|E
5|$|In late 1164 Roger led a {{deputation}} from Henry II that {{visited the}} papal court, or curia, {{to try to}} persuade Alexander III that any decision on the deposition of Becket should take place in England under a papal legate, rather than in Rome. While Becket was in exile, Roger also managed to secure papal permission for archbishops of York to carry their cross in front of them anywhere in England, a right that had long been a bone of contention between Canterbury and York. Later, the pope rescinded the permission, but consistently refused to give <b>primacy</b> to either Canterbury or York in their struggles.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After {{the arrival of the}} first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the <b>primacy</b> of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the <b>primacy</b> he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} from the lectures, the Canadian Corps staff {{officers}} produced a tactical analysis of the Verdun battles and delivered a series of corps and divisional-level lectures to promote the <b>primacy</b> of artillery and {{stress the importance of}} harassing fire and company and platoon flexibility. The report of 1st Canadian Division commander Arthur Currie highlighted the lessons he believed the Canadian Corps could learn from the experiences of the French. The final plan for the assault on Vimy Ridge drew heavily on the experience and tactical analysis of the officers who attended the Verdun lectures. British First Army commander General Henry Horne approved the plan on 5 March 1917.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting on {{the twentieth}} anniversary of its release in a {{retrospective}} article on Salon.com, film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that Batman {{has had on}} the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film's debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; the <b>primacy</b> of the MPAA PG-13 as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Henry's {{coronation}} Gerard {{was appointed}} to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had <b>primacy</b> over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the {{successor}}s of Christ's apostles, and that the Pope is the successor to Saint Peter to whom <b>primacy</b> was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders and enclosed monastic orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{break with}} Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation. That {{was to come}} from the {{dissemination}} of ideas. The views of the German reformer Martin Luther and his school were widely known and disputed in England. A major manifestation of theological radicalism in England was Lollardy, a movement deriving from the writings of John Wycliffe, the 14th century Bible translator, which stressed the <b>primacy</b> of Scripture. But after the execution of Sir John Oldcastle, leader of the Lollard rebellion of 1415, they never again had access to the levers of power, and by the 15th century were much reduced in numbers and influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the <b>primacy</b> of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E
5|$|The {{reforms of}} the {{execution}} movement had clearly established the Sejm as the central and dominant organ of state power. But this situation in reality had not lasted very long, as various destructive decentralizing tendencies, steps taken by the szlachta and the kings, were progressively undermining and eroding the functionality and <b>primacy</b> of the central legislative organ. The resulting void was being filled during the late 16th and 17th centuries by the increasingly active and assertive territorial sejmiks, which provided a more accessible and direct forum for szlachta activists to promote their narrowly conceived local interests. Sejmiks established effective controls, in practice limiting the Sejm's authority; themselves they were taking on an ever-broader range of state matters and local issues.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{composed}} the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror's tomb in St. Etienne in Caen, but the chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition. Thomas did not concern {{himself with the}} church–state issues surrounding the Investiture Crisis, but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert <b>primacy</b> over the whole of England. Later authors, including William of Malmesbury and Hugh the Chantor, praised Thomas for his generosity, chastity, elegance, and charm.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any {{specific set of}} rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for the <b>primacy</b> of the material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, {{at least in the}} big picture.|$|E
5|$|When Prince John rebelled in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset {{put aside}} their feud to quash the uprising. Geoffrey {{strengthened}} Doncaster's defences {{and went to}} the aid of Puiset, who was besieging Tickhill Castle. In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of Sheriff of Yorkshire for himself. Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the <b>primacy</b> of England, which Canterbury claimed and York disputed. Walter's decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to <b>primacy</b> over York and all of England. Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month. King Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation, and {{even went so far as}} to restore some of his confiscated estates. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey's actions, which led to Geoffrey's estates being confiscated once again. Geoffrey appealed to the king, who was then in Maine; Richard over-ruled Walter, restored Geoffrey's estates, and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow.|$|E
5|$|A long-running {{dispute between}} the Archbishops of Canterbury and York flared up under Anselm's successor, Ralph d'Escures. Canterbury, {{traditionally}} the senior of the two establishments, had long argued that the Archbishop of York should formally promise to obey their Archbishop, but York argued that the two episcopates were independent within the English Church and that no such promise was necessary. Henry supported the <b>primacy</b> of Canterbury, to ensure that England remained under a single ecclesiastical administration, but the Pope preferred the case of York. The matter was complicated by Henry's personal friendship with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, and the King's desire that the case should not {{end up in a}} papal court, beyond royal control. Henry badly needed the support of the Papacy in his struggle with Louis of France, however, and therefore allowed Thurstan to attend the Council of Rheims in 1119, where Thurstan was then consecrated by the Pope with no mention of any duty towards Canterbury. Henry believed that this went against assurances Thurstan had previously made and exiled him from England until the King and Archbishop came to a negotiated solution the following year.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} social, cultural, ethnic, and {{linguistic}} factors {{contributed to the}} sparking of unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine {{in the aftermath of}} the early 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Following Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, resurfacing historical and cultural divisions and a weak state structure hampered the development of a unified Ukrainian national identity. In eastern and southern Ukraine, Russification and ethnic Russian settlement during centuries of Russian rule caused the Russian language to attain <b>primacy,</b> even amongst ethnic Ukrainians. In Crimea, ethnic Russians have comprised the majority of the population since the deportation of the indigenous Crimean Tatars by Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin following the Second World War. This contrasts with western and central Ukraine, which were historically ruled by a variety of powers, such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austrian Empire. In these areas, the Ukrainian ethnic, national, and linguistic identity remained intact.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's <b>primacy,</b> but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three years of the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty fought a battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the <b>primacy</b> of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research E. J. Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Following the Polish campaign, Hitler {{approved}} {{the expansion of}} the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned invasion of France and the Low Countries, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting <b>primacy</b> of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the SS-Verfügungs-Division (later given the name Reich and then Das Reich) commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser; the SS-Division-Totenkopf commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, SS-Gruppenführer Theodor Eicke; and the Polizei-Division, commanded by SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch. This rapid transformation was theoretical to a significant extent, as Eicke and the SS-TV continued to resist exchanges of personnel with the SS-VT.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the <b>primacy</b> of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E
5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after the Prayer Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his <b>primacy</b> with a great historical act, he had {{failed to live up to}} his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E
