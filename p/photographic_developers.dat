5000|$|... #Caption: Key {{stages in}} {{production}} of Ag-based photographs. Two silver halide particles, {{one of which}} is impinged with light (hν) resulting in the formation of a latent image (step 1). The latent image is amplified using <b>photographic</b> <b>developers,</b> converting the silver halide crystal to an opaque particle of silver metal (step 2). Finally, the remaining silver halide is removed by fixing (step 3).|$|E
5000|$|Chemical detectors, such as {{photographic}} plates, {{in which}} a silver halide molecule is split into an atom of metallic silver and a halogen atom. The <b>photographic</b> <b>developer</b> causes adjacent molecules to split similarly.|$|R
5000|$|Metol is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula HOC6H4NH2(CH3)HSO4. It is the hydrogen sulfate (HSO4−) salt of the protonated derivative of N-methylaminophenol. This colourless salt {{is a popular}} <b>photographic</b> <b>developer</b> used in black & white photography.|$|R

50|$|Digital {{images are}} exposed onto true, light {{sensitive}} photographic paper with lasers and processed in <b>photographic</b> <b>developers</b> and fixers. These prints are true photographs and have continuous tone {{in the image}} detail. The archival quality of the print {{is as high as}} the manufacturer's rating for any given photo paper used. In large format prints, the greatest advantage is that, since no lens is used, there is no vignetting or detail distortion in the corners of the image.|$|E
5000|$|As X-ray photon impinges on this {{amorphous}} coat of selenium, charges diffuse out, {{in proportion}} to energy content of the X-ray. This {{occurs as a result}} of [...] The resulting imprint, in the form of charge distribution on the plate, attracts toner particles, which is then transferred to reusable paper plates. In contrast to conventional X-rays, <b>photographic</b> <b>developers</b> are not needed. Hence the term xeroradiography; 'xero' meaning dry in Greek.It requires more radiation exposure. Historically used in mammography prior to the advent of digital mammography.|$|E

50|$|Wet etchants {{are usually}} isotropic, {{which leads to}} large bias when etching thick films. They also require the {{disposal}} of large amounts of toxic waste. For these reasons, they are seldom used in state-of-the-art processes. However, the <b>photographic</b> <b>developer</b> used for photoresist resembles wet etching.|$|R
50|$|PPD {{sensitivity}} is lifelong. A {{person who}} has become sensitized through black henna tattoos may have future allergic reactions to perfumes, printer ink, chemical hair dyes, textile dye, <b>photographic</b> <b>developer,</b> sunscreen and some medications. A {{person who has}} had a black henna tattoo should consult their physician about health consequences of para-phenylenediamine sensitization.|$|R
50|$|The {{paper that}} has been exposed is processed, first by {{immersion}} in a <b>photographic</b> <b>developer,</b> halting development with a stop bath, and fixing in a photographic fixer. The print is then washed to remove the processing chemicals and dried. There {{are a variety of}} other, additional steps a photographer may take, such as toning.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a series of <b>photographic</b> <b>{{developers}}</b> on the final silver-staining picture has been investigated. Ten common developers were used, but of these only hydro-quinone, chloroquinol, pyrogallol, and ̂-aminophenol, were found to be of general use. The other developers were either so weak in their action that the final staining was light and incomplete, or so powerful that a differentiated nerve staining was not produced. For silver staining to be effected nuclei of reduced silver should be present in the section. These nuclei act as centres for the deposition of additional silver reduced by the developer; the additional silver may either be derived from that combined with the sections during impregnation or from the developing solution itself. Whether or not the additional silver is deposited {{in such a way as}} to produce differentiated nerve staining depends on the properties of the developer and on the composition of the developing solution. The redox- and 'bromide'-potentials, the sulphite and hydrogen ion concentrations in the developing solution, and the protective action of the tissue components of the section all play a part in determining the final staining picture...|$|E
5000|$|After prebaking, the {{photoresist}} {{is exposed}} to a pattern of intense light. The exposure to light causes a chemical change that allows some of the photoresist to be removed by a special solution, called [...] "developer" [...] by analogy with <b>photographic</b> <b>developer.</b> Positive photoresist, the most common type, becomes soluble in the developer when exposed; with negative photoresist, unexposed regions are soluble in the developer.|$|R
40|$|Benzotriazole in a <b>photographic</b> <b>developer</b> {{has been}} {{determined}} to increase covering power. This {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in photographic speed proportional to the increase in covering power. Benzotriazole decreases the rate of development when measured by mass of silver developed, but may increase the rate of development when measured by density at D-max exposures because of the increase in covering power. The effect of benzotriazole on image color has also been determined. Possible explanations for effects are given...|$|R
50|$|In more {{physical}} terms, a latent {{image is a}} small cluster of metallic silver atoms formed in or on a silver halide crystal due to reduction of interstitial silver ions by photoelectrons (a photolytic silver cluster). If intense exposure continues, such photolytic silver clusters grow to visible sizes. This is called printing out the image. On the other hand, {{the formation of a}} visible image by the action of <b>photographic</b> <b>developer</b> is called developing out the image.|$|R
5000|$|A {{latent image}} is an {{invisible}} image {{produced by the}} exposure to light of a photosensitive material such as photographic film. When photographic film is developed, the area that was exposed darkens and forms a visible image. In {{the early days of}} photography, the nature of the invisible change in the silver halide crystals of the film's emulsion coating was unknown, so the image was said to be [...] "latent" [...] until the film was treated with <b>photographic</b> <b>developer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Amidol is a colorless {{crystalline}} compound {{with the}} molecular structure C6H3(NH2)2OH. It is a dihydrogen chloride salt {{and is used}} as a <b>photographic</b> <b>developer.</b> It was introduced as a developing agent for photographic papers in 1892. It is unusual amongst developing agents as it works most effectively in slightly acid conditions rather than the strongly alkaline conditions required for most other developers. As amidol ages it changes color to a dark red-brown. Developing dishes and equipment used to prepare amidol solutions are also frequently stained brown, a stain that is very persistent.|$|R
