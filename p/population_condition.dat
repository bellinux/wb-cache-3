40|$|As {{described}} in the text, the study consisted of two conditions – a homophilous <b>population</b> <b>condition</b> and an unstructured <b>population</b> <b>condition</b> – between which subjects were randomly assigned. The schema for this design is shown in Figure S 1. After all the subjects were assigned to conditions, each individual was randomly assigned to a single node in one network. In the unstructured <b>population</b> <b>condition,</b> subjects remained in their randomly assigned positions {{for the duration of}} the study. In the homophilous <b>population</b> <b>condition,</b> once all subjects had been assigned to networks, their positions within their networks were subsequently rearranged to optimize similarity among neighbors within the social network (as discussed below). The architecture of every network in the study was identical: every network had the same degree, Z (each node had the same number of neighbors as every other node), the same topology (hexagonal lattice), and the same overall size (each network had the same total number of nodes, N). The only difference between conditions was the distribution of individual characteristics within the networks. Consequently, any difference in the dynamics of diffusion between conditions was due to the effects of homophily on the spread of behavior. In each condition, five independent realizations of the experiment were run, resulting in five “pairs ” of networks across conditions. Each pair constitutes a single trial of the study.

40|$|As {{structures}} deteriorate {{with age}} and use, {{it is necessary to}} devise a maintenance plan to control their states in a cost effective way. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} alternative maintenance strategies their success must be measured by their ability to control the structure condition. The condition can be expressed for either the entire structure or for the components which make up the structure. A problem is how to express this condition. This is a particular problem for bridges where there can be several deterioration mechanisms taking place and there is no clear way of measuring the current state of either the structure or its elements. One approach to defining the condition of bridges is to use condition scores or condition indices, for the infrastructure owners, as it is desirable that they understand how their population of assets is changing over time. For bridges this has involved providing a condition rating for each structure based on observation and by tracking the changes in the distribution of structure condition for population over time. The current maintenance strategy can then be shown to be inadequate (leading to deteriorating <b>population</b> <b>condition),</b> adequate (producing a stable <b>population</b> <b>condition)</b> or effective and resulting in an improving <b>population</b> <b>condition.</b> There have been a variety of bridge condition scoring systems that have been devised by different infrastructure owners in both the highway and railway sectors. Whilst these scores are not devised to be used in detailed maintenance modelling, due to the lack of alternative data they have frequently been used in this manner. This paper addresses the problems of using this data for bridge degradation modelling and proposes an alternative method to model the degradation of bridge elements using historical work done data. The deterioration process is modelled by a Weibull distribution that governs the time a component deteriorates to a degraded condition state following a repair. The method is demonstrated on real historical maintenance data where the analyses of the deterioration processes of several main bridge components are presented...|$|E

A research project about air quality bioindicator using epiphytic macrolichens in Bogor City was conducted from March 2012 until July 2013.

In each plot, macrolichens were observed in 8 canary trees using 2 mini quadrats (32 × 20 cm 2). The population conditions of epiphytic macrolichens were analyzed and to be used as bioindicator of air quality. Seven genera of macrolichens were found: Coccocarpia, Leptogium, Canoparmelia, Parmotrema, Dirinaria, Physcia, and Pyxine. Plot 1 was having Coccocarpia and Leptogium that were not found in other plots and therefore they can be used as sensitive bioindicators, none of Canoparmelia and Pyxine, a few and infrequent Dirinaria but with larger average coverage (AC = 6. 15 cm 2), and Physcia was found abundantly (sensitive bioindicator). Conversely, plot 2 and 3 were having none of Coccocarpia and Leptogium, few or many Canoparmelia and Pyxine and therefore appeared to be tolerant, many and frequent Dirinaria but with smaller AC (plot 2 = 2. 85 cm 2, plot 3 = 1. 16 cm 2), and few or none of Physcia was found.

40|$|A common {{application}} of {{multiple linear regression}} {{is to build a}} model that contains only those predictors that are significantly related to the response. In so doing, tests regarding the unique contribution of individual predictors to the model are often performed. It is not uncommon for practitioners to conduct each of these tests at the nominal α = 0. 05 level, without regard to the effect that this practice may have on the overall Type I error rate. This research investigated the utility of making a Bonferroni adjustment when conducting these tests of the partial regression coefficients. Simulated multivariate normal populations with various correlational structures, different numbers of predictors in the model, and differing numbers of “significant ” predictors in the model were generated. Ten thousand samples, 5000 each of sizes 50 and 300, were drawn from each <b>population</b> <b>condition</b> and a multiple regression analysis was performed on each sample.

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} and degradation seriously threaten native animal communities. We studied {{the response of}} a small marsupial, the agile antechinus Antechinus agilis, to several environmental variables in anthropogenically fragmented Eucalyptus forest in south-east Australia. Agile antechinus were captured more in microhabitats dominated by woody debris than in other microhabitats. Relative abundances of both sexes were positively correlated with fragment core area. Male and female mass-size residuals were smaller in larger fragments. A health status indicator, haemoglobin-haematocrit residuals (HHR), did not vary {{as a function of}} any environmental variable in females, but male HHR indicated better health where sites' microhabitats were dominated by shrubs, woody debris and trees other than Eucalyptus. Females were trapped less often in edge than interior fragment habitat and their physiological stress level, indicated by the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood, was higher where fragments had a greater proportion of edge habitat. The latter trend was potentially due to lymphopoenia resulting from stress hormone-mediated leukocyte trafficking. Using multiple indicators of <b>population</b> <b>condition</b> and health status facilitates a comprehensive examination of the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat {{fragmentation and}} degradation, on native vertebrates. Male agile antechinus' health responded negatively to habitat degradation, whilst females responded negatively to the proportion of edge habitat.
