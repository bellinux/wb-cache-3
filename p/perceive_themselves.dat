500|$|However, this {{attitude}} {{is more common}} in England than in Scotland or Wales; [...] "white English people <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as English first and as British second, and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as British, but none identified as English, a label they associated exclusively with white people". Contrawise, in Scotland and Wales, White British and ethnic minority people both identified more strongly with Scotland and Wales than with Britain.|$|R

25|$|Another {{influence}} on the perception of student sexuality is school culture, as illustrated by Louisa Allen’s study “Denying the Sexual Subject: Schools' Regulation of Student Sexuality.” This study outlines how school culture can lead students to <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> as having varying levels of sexual agency based on gender while also creating a normalized sexuality {{similar to that in}} the Bay-Cheng study. Regardless of the material included in the curricula of school based sex education, the general attitude surrounding sex within individual schools can influence the ways students think about their own sexuality and sexual experiences.|$|E
25|$|Those {{experiencing}} OBEs sometimes report (among {{other types}} of immediate and spontaneous experience) a preceding and initiating lucid-dream state. In many cases, people who claim to have had an OBE report being {{on the verge of}} sleep, or being already asleep shortly before the experience. A large percentage of these cases refer to situations where the sleep was not particularly deep (due to illness, noises in other rooms, emotional stress, exhaustion from overworking, frequent re-awakening, etc.). In most of these cases subjects <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> as being awake; about half of them note a feeling of sleep paralysis.|$|E

25|$|Findings {{have shown}} in {{specific}} cases that paranormal belief {{acts as a}} psychodynamic coping function {{and serves as a}} mechanism for coping with stress. Survivors from childhood sexual abuse, violent and unsettled home environments have reported to have higher levels of paranormal belief. A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> as having little control over their lives may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced sense of control.|$|E
25|$|The {{prospect}} of memory erasure or alteration raises ethical issues. Some of these concern identity, as memory seems {{to play a}} role in how people <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves.</b> For example, if a traumatic memory were erased, a person might still remember related events in their lives, such as their emotional reactions to later experiences. Without the original memory to give them context, these remembered events might prompt the subjects to see themselves as emotional or irrational people. In the United States, the President's Council on Bioethics devoted a chapter in its October 2003 report Beyond Therapy to the issue. The report discourages the use of drugs that blunt the effect of traumatic memories, warning against treating human emotional reactions to life events as a medical issue.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans {{learned from}} their {{previous}} experience {{and worked on}} the disempowerment of local lords in the highland regions. They even attempted to secularize the Yemeni society, while Yemenite Jews came to <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> in Yemeni nationalist terms. The Ottomans appeased the tribes by forgiving their rebellious chiefs and appointing them to administrative posts. They introduced a series of reforms to enhance the country's economic welfare. However, corruption was widespread in the Ottoman administration in Yemen. This was because only {{the worst of the}} officials were appointed because those who could avoid serving in Yemen did so. The Ottomans had reasserted control over the highlands for temporary duration. The so-called Tanzimat reforms were considered heretic by the Zaydi tribes. In 1876, the Hashid and Bakil tribes rebelled against the Ottomans; the Turks had to appease them with gifts to end the uprising.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of integrating doctoral students into scholarly communities and practices {{at the very beginning of}} their studies. Although the importance of student participation in a scholarly community has been recognized empirical evidence concerning the quality of participation that promotes such engagement is scarce. This study focuses on exploring doctoral students’ sense of relational agency in terms of their scholarly communities and how this is related to study persistence and experienced socio-psychological well-being. Altogether 669 doctoral candidates from three faculties (humanities, medicine, and behavioural sciences) from a large research-intensive Finnish University completed a doctoral student survey. The results showed that a minority of the students <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as active relational agents in terms of their scholarly communities. However, students who <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as active relational agents experienced less lack of interest in their studies, less negative emotions, and less often considered abandoning their studies than students who <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as passive objects in their communities.         </p...|$|R
25|$|Men's {{body image}} is a topic of {{increasing}} interest in both academic articles and in the popular press. Current research indicates many men wish to become more muscular than they currently <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> to be, often desiring up to 26 pounds of additional muscle mass. According to the study, western men desire muscle mass over that of Asian men {{by as much as}} 30 pounds. The desire for additional muscle has been linked to many men's concepts about masculinity. A variety of research has indicated a relationship between men's endorsement of traditionally masculine ideas and characteristics, and their desire for additional muscle. Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of human physiology. The connection between masculinity and muscle is however a cultural trend traced {{as far back as the}} Classical antiquity and linked to the war performance and its peaceful substitutes, the athletic events. In addition, men with lower, more feminine, Waist–hip ratio (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.|$|E
25|$|The ethnic {{relationship}} of Prešov Region {{is complex and}} volatile. A long-term cultural and everyday cohabition of Rusyns, Slovaks and Hungarians, under the prepodence of the non-Rusyn element led to the linguistic Slovakization of Rusyns, while in some parts (in cities and ethnic islands in the south) they were Magyarized. Still, in both cases they preserved their religion (Greek Catholicism). Until the 1920s, the Slovak-speaking Greek-Catholics composed a transitional group that was connected with the Rusyns through religion and traditions, with Slovak as their language. Their number was gradually increasing with the transition of the parts of Rusyn population to the Slovak language. Slovakization of the Rusyn population increased in the times of the Czechoslovakian authorities (since 1920). The Greek Catholics and Orthodox started to <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves</b> as Slovaks. It is difficult to estimate {{the distribution of the}} Orthodox and the Greek Catholics by the language as well as to determine the number of Rusyns because both the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian censuses provided the incorrect number of Rusyns, but it contains roughly 50-100 000 people. According to censuses the decrease of the number of Rusyns was influenced not only by Slovakization but also by emigration of a significant number of Rusyns from Prešov, mainly to the Czech lands.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{discipline}} of anthropology, the term culture represents the customs, values, morals, laws and rituals which a particular group or society shares. In the public imagination, Wall Street represents economics and finance. However, although Wall Street employees may exhibit greedy and self-interested behaviours to the public, these behaviours are justified through their own value system and social practices. Various anthropologists have conducted research on Wall Street and it is their research which can confirm the negative views of Wall Street while providing the public with information that can contribute {{to a better understanding}} of how Wall Street workers <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves.</b> Anthropologist Karen Ho, who has conducted ethnographic research on Wall Street, states in Situating Global Capitalisms that the markets are beginning to self-regulate themselves in terms of neoliberalism. Through the perception of the public, financial investors take on a role that has already been established for them. It is both appropriate and fitting to call Wall Street a culture because of the system of values and practices it holds onto. Moreover, anthropological insight can help improve the general public's understanding of Wall Street and in turn allow the public to appreciate the culture of Wall Street which is both logical and sensible to the workers themselves.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to (1) {{determine}} competencies judged to be important by various educational professionals for the successful implementation of the Special Education Policy in the province of Newfoundland and, in turn, (2) to determine how competent those professionals <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> to be on those important competencies. [...] A questionnaire consisting of 118 items, pertaining to 8 different categories of competencies deemed to be important through expert judgement, was developed by the researcher and administered to the fifteen pilot schools selected by the Department of Education in Newfoundland. These pilot schools were those designated as schools which would receive in-service support over a three year period as they implemented the new Special Education Policy. They were to also serve as exemplary sites for their respective school districts as well. [...] Respondents were asked to rate each item on two Likert-type scales. The first scale asked the respondent to indicate the level of item importance for professionals in the same role as that of the respondent. The second scale required the respondent to rate how competent they <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> to be on that item. [...] Mean scores were computed for each questionnaire item and, in turn, each category, according to a respondent's professional title and year in policy implementation. Comparisons were then made between respondents on the basis of: type of professional responding; pilot school's year in policy implementation; and grade level taught by respondents. [...] Results of the study revealed the following: [...] (a) Those competencies which the various respondents felt important for policy implementation and competent in delivering. [...] (b) Competencies respondents felt important for implementation but <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as being less competent in carrying out were also identified. [...] (c) All of the eight professional competency categories were deemed to be important for successful implementation, and all respondents <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> to be competent on the two categories which they felt to be most important for successful implementation, namely, the ability to develop a positive, accepting classroom and school atmosphere which, in turn, fosters constructive interaction between all students and possessing the individual personal characteristics thought to be important traits for any teacher to possess, but specifically for those with special need children in their class. [...] (d) Compared to regular classroom teachers and school administrators, special education teachers <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> to be the most competent on items they felt important for successful implementation. [...] (e) As compared to special educators and school administrators, regular classroom teachers <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> to be the least competent on items they felt to be important. [...] (f) Respondents <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> to be competent on the majority of items they felt to be important for successful implementation of Newfoundland's Special Education Policy. [...] (g) As professionals progressed through the three years of policy implementation, their perceived level of competency increased. [...] (h) Regular classroom teachers, special education teachers, and school administrators at all levels of policy implementation <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as less than competent on competencies dealing with professional knowledge of the characteristics of special needs children and adaptations necessary to effectively teach them. [...] (i) Special education teachers and professionals in their third year of policy implementation <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as more competent on assessment competencies than did professionals at earlier stages of policy implementation. [...] (j) Regular classroom teachers and school administrators <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> to be less than competent in the areas of communication with parents, colleagues and administrators, and goal setting competencies.

500|$|Goffman does {{break from}} his {{connection}} with George Herbert Mead and Herbert Blumer in {{that while he}} does not reject {{the way in which}} individuals <b>perceive</b> <b>themselves,</b> he was more interested in the actual physical proximity or the “interaction order” that molds the self (481). In other words, Goffman believed that impression management can only be achieved if the audience is in sync with the individual’s perception of self. If the audience is in disagreement with the image an individual is presenting then the individual’s presentation of self is interrupted. Individuals present images of themselves based on how society thinks they should act in a particular situation. This decision on how to act is decided based on the concept of definition of the situation. The definition are all predetermined and individuals choose how they will act by choosing the proper behavior for the social situation they are in. Goffman draws from William Thomas for this concept as well. Thomas believed that people are born into a particular social class and so the definitions of the situations that they [...] will encounter have been previously defined for them (480). For instance when an individual from a high class background goes to a black tie affair the predefined definition of situation would be that they must mind their manners and act according to their class.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship among body image perceptions, a desire for thinness, and dieting behavior in young females in Japan. The subjects were 302 Japanese fe-male university students (age 19. 9 ± 1. 4 years). An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted between July and August 2011. The questionnaire clarified the subjects’ physical status, perception about personal body shape, desired body shape, the time frame when they first thought about body shape dieting, exercise habits, and eating behaviors. The results re-vealed that many of the underweight or normal weight subjects <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as obese, and often the reasons for the perception of obesity were comparisons with others or with them-selves in the past. The scores of EAT- 26 in those who <b>perceived</b> <b>themselves</b> as obese were higher than the scores in those who did not.
