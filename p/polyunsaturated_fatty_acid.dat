5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (<b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

25|$|Each native LDL {{particle}} enables emulsification, i.e. surrounding/packaging all {{fatty acids}} being carried, enabling these fats {{to move around}} the body within the water outside cells. Each particle contains a single apolipoprotein B-100 molecule (Apo B-100, a protein that has 4536 amino acid residues and a mass of 514 kDa), along with 80 to 100 additional ancillary proteins. Each LDL has a highly hydrophobic core consisting of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> known as linoleate and hundreds to thousands (about 1500 commonly cited as an average) esterified and unesterified cholesterol molecules. This core also carries varying numbers of triglycerides and other fats and {{is surrounded by a}} shell of phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol, as well as the single copy of Apo B-100. LDL particles are approximately 22nm (0.00000087in.) to 27.5nm in diameter and have a mass of about 3 million daltons. Since LDL particles contain a variable and changing number of fatty acid molecules, there is a distribution of LDL particle mass and size. Determining the structure of LDL has been a tough task because of its heterogeneous structure. The structure of LDL at human body temperature in native condition, with a resolution of about 16 Angstroms using cryo-electron microscopy, has been recently described.|$|E

Aim: To explore <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> balance and its interplay with platelet oxidative stress in liver cirrhosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 51 cirrhotic patients and sex- and age-matched controls was performed. Serum <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and oxidative stress markers (urinary isoprostanes and serum soluble NADPH-oxidase- 2 -derived peptide) were measured. The effect on platelet oxidative stress of n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> ratio in vitro and in vivo (1 -week supplementation with 3 g/daily n- 3 -polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> was tested. Results: Compared to controls, cirrhotic patients had significantly higher n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> ratio. n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> ratio correlated significantly with disease severity and oxidative stress markers. In vitro experiments showed that in Child-Pugh C patients' platelets incubation with low n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> ratio resulted in dose-dependent decrease of radical oxigen species (- 39 %), isoprostanes (- 25 %) and NADPH-oxidase- 2 regulation (- 51 %). n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> supplemented patients showed significant oxidative stress indexes reduction. Conclusions: In cirrhosis, n- 6 /n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> imbalance up-regulates platelet NADPH-oxidase- 2 with ensuing oxidative stress. Further study to evaluate if n- 3 supplementation may reduce disease progression is warranted. © 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S. r. l...|$|R

The risk of atrial fibrillation may depend on the interaction between n- 3 and n- 6 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> as both types of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are involved in the regulation of systemic inflammation. We investigated the association between dietary intake of long chain <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (individually and in combination) and the risk of atrial fibrillation with focus on potential interaction between the two types of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The risk of atrial fibrillation in the Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort was analyzed using the pseudo-observation method to explore cumulative risks on an additive scale providing risk differences.

40|$|After {{more than}} 25 years of {{published}} investigation, including randomized controlled trials, {{the role of}} omega- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{in the treatment of}} kidney disease remains unclear. In vitro and in vivo experimental studies support the efficacy of omega- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on inflammatory pathways involved with the progression of kidney disease. Clinical investigations have focused predominantly on immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. More recently, lupus nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and other glomerular diseases have been investigated. Clinical trials have shown conflicting results for the efficacy of omega- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in IgA nephropathy, which may relate to varying doses, proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, duration of therapy, and sample size of the study populations.

OBJECTIVE To examine recent studies, clinical trials, and reviews on the therapeutic effect of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in multiple sclerosis. METHODS We conducted a search in MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane Library with the terms "fatty acids", "omega- 3 " and "omega- 6 " in combination with "multiple sclerosis". Articles were selected according to their relevance on the topic. RESULTS Epidemiologic studies have shown benefits of dietary supplementation with <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> -especially omega- 3 - in relation to inflammatory, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast, the studies do not show a beneficial effect of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in multiple sclerosis. However, there are limitations related to design and sample issues in these studies CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence of a protective effect of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on the risk of multiple sclerosis. Despite this, to date controlled trials have not produced definite results on the benefits of supplementation with <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in patients with multiple sclerosis.
