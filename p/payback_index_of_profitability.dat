It is therefore useful to keep risk {{within a certain}} level in relation to capital, considering that financial institutions must control their risk appropriately to maintain the safety and soundness of their operation. In 1988, the Basle Capital Accord—International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards—introduced a uniform framework {{for the implementation of}} risk-based capital rules. However, this framework applies the same “risk weight ” (a ratio applied to assets for calculation of aggregated risk assets) to loans to all the private corporations, regardless of their creditworthiness. Such an approach might encourage banks to eliminate loans that can be terminated easily while maintaining loans with higher risk. As shareholder-owned companies, banks are expected to maximize return on equity during this competitive era, while performing sound and safe banking functions as financial institutions with public missions.

This self-reinforcing relationship between input producers and users can be views as a basic agglomeration force to enable the modeling of agglomeration economies based on a standard monopolistic competition model without making strong a priori assumptions. First, we develop a continuous one-dimensional, general equilibrium spatial model consisting of an agricultural, manufacturing and vertically linked differentiated producer services sectors and we will demonstrate that manufacturing and producer service firms agglomerate if producer service output transportation costs are too high. On the other hand, given a small population size, only producer service firms agglomerate if producer service output transport costs are relatively lower. If the cost of transporting the agricultural good is very high, an agglomeration will not be developed. Subsequently, we introduce economies of scope in manufacturing sector through {{the presence of a}} sharable fixed input in order to discuss tradeoffs between concentration of production, to take advantage of scale economies, and dispersion of production, to take advantage of differing productivities across locations. We show that, given imperfect competition across differentiated goods, multiplant operations exist if scope economies are present and if input cost ratios across locations are neither too low or too high. Finally, we develop a simulation model to measure the investment diversion effect of tariff changes. It is analytically derived that, given imperfect competition market structure, <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing at each location reflects labor cost advantage, access to output markets and inputs producers, as well as intensity of competition, then an location <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> was constructed reflecting these elements.

40|$|This article uses Tobin's q, {{the ratio}} of the market value of a firm to the {{replacement}} value of its physical assets, to measure monopoly power and {{to examine the relationship between}} market structure and profitability. Tobin's q is a better measure of monopoly profits than <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> single-period <b>profitability</b> because it measures long-run monopoly power. In addition, it is subject to less measurement error and it contains an adjustment for risk. The relationship between q and long-run monopoly power is established. Provided that all inputs are supplied competitively, q should be highly sensitive to even small amounts of monopoly power. Since the level of q is generally not high in the American economy, the result suggests either that monopoly power is absent or that unions manage to capture monopoly rents. Empirical tests of the relationship between Tobin's q and measures of market structure and unionization provide evidence that unions do capture most monopoly rents. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to these tests, correlations between the different levels can be analyzed as well, {{to answer the question}} of whether a one-dimensional or a multi-dimensional model provides a better fit. In a one-dimensional model, the scores of the latent variable on each level are expected to correlate clearly. Students who have mastered Level 2 b and are able to make reasonable decisions at this level should also have high scores on the latent variable at the lower levels. Students who can hardly identify value streams in a company at Level 1, that is, those who are barely able to identify financial information, should have low scores at the higher cognitive process levels as well. Thus, a high correlation between the subjects’ scores on the latent variable would indicate {{that there is only one}} latent variable with different levels of difficulty. In the model, the latent correlations were 0.83 between Levels 1 and 2 a; 0.76 between Levels 1 and 2 b; and 0.81 between Levels 2 a and 2 b. Both the criteria for the model comparison and the correlations between the levels indicated a model with one single latent scale with different levels, which also was in line with the theoretical considerations as to how the content difficulty increased. In summary, the increasing difficulty in financial decision-making in a company must be regarded as one content dimension of a construct with different levels rather than separate content subdimensions. This supports the theoretical assumptions. Accordingly, first, financial information must be identified in terms of value streams. Only when this has been accomplished to a sufficient degree can this information be analyzed further for evaluating financial challenges, and only after that, can decisions in complex situations be made in a well-conceived way based on FK. In the context of a company, this means that the value streams are identified, then condensed into financial <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability,</b> cost <b>of</b> capital, or cash flow, and then analyzed to provide a basis for decision-making. In {{addition to}} this, decision-makers must be able to apply different methods to make reasonable investment decisions under uncertainty and in view of numerous alternatives.|$|R

In a first step, we estimate input-output matrices, at constant prices, that are used to calculate: i) the evolution of sectorial production costs; ii) an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> imported intermediate goods share in the productive process; and iii) an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> exporters' <b>profitability.</b> We assessed the evolution <b>of</b> these <b>indices.</b> In a second step, we use a panel SYS-GMM to perform econometric tests based on data disaggregated by sectors of manufacturing. The panel regression results show that the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> imported intermediate goods and the share of manufacturing in value added are negatively correlated, in a statistically significant way. This result {{can be explained by the}} hypothesis that entrepreneurs adopt a strategy to reduce costs so as to preserve profitability, by increasing the share of imported intermediate goods in intermediate consumption when they become cheaper. For the exporters, this is a strategy to remain competitive in the manufacturing sector when the exchange rate appreciates. As a result of this process, and due to the results obtained in the tests, it is possible to state that a process similar to the maquilla may be occurring in the country. In the long run, growth and persistence of this fact may contribute to significant reductions in the share of manufacturing in value added of the Brazilian economy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Profitability</b> <b>of</b> an {{economic}} unit is expressed through {{a system of}} indicators, because "no index or economic category can reflect the total, perfect, complex reality of economic phenomena or processes. Each expresses a side of concrete, essential details (indexes), but a full one (economic category). This system <b>of</b> <b>indexes</b> for <b>profitability</b> {{is characterized by a}} higher degree of consolidation, of reflection of the economic-financial results. They must be correlated to the other <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> economic efficiency from the various subsystems that constitute the factors which determine the actual amount of profit and the rate of return. Each indicator has a certain form of expression according to the phenomena to which it refers. Thus, they can be expressed in relative sizes as medium sizes or indexes. They can also be expressed in physical, conventional or value units. The ability to develop monetary results can not be judged independently to the employed means for achieving them. Therefore, the profitability analysis is not limited to investigating its absolute indexes but also the relative ones, obtained by comparing the results to the means employed or consumed for developing the specific activit...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} efficiency of dairy farms {{is the main}} goal of farmers. The objective of this work was to use routinely available information at the dairy farm level to develop an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> to rank dairy farms and to assist the decision-making process of farmers to increase the {{economic efficiency}} of the entire system. A stochastic modeling approach was used to study the relationships between inputs and profitability (i. e., income over feed cost; IOFC) of dairy cattle farms. The IOFC was calculated as: milk revenue + value of male calves + culling revenue – herd feed costs. Two databases were created. The first one was a development database, which was created from technical and economic variables collected in 135 dairy farms. The second one was a synthetic database (sDB) created from 5, 000 synthetic dairy farms using the Monte Carlo technique {{and based on the}} characteristics of the development database data. The sDB was used to develop a ranking index as follows: (1) principal component analysis (PCA), excluding IOFC, was used to identify principal components (sPC); and (2) coefficient estimates of a multiple regression of the IOFC on the sPC were obtained. Then, the eigenvectors of the sPC were used to compute the principal component values for the original 135 dairy farms that were used with the multiple regression coefficient estimates to predict IOFC (dRI; ranking index from development database). The dRI was used to rank the original 135 dairy farms. The PCA explained 77. 6 % of the sDB variability and 4 sPC were selected. The sPC were associated with herd profile, milk quality and payment, poor management, and reproduction based on the significant variables of the sPC. The mean IOFC in the sDB was 0. 1377 ± 0. 0162 euros per liter of milk (€/L). The dRI explained 81 % of the variability of the IOFC calculated for the 135 original farms. When the number of farms below and above 1 standard deviation (SD) of the dRI were calculated, we found that 21 farms had dRI + 1 SD. The top 10 % of the farms had a dRI greater than 0. 170 €/L, whereas the bottom 10 % farms had a dRI lower than 0. 116 €/L. This stochastic approach allowed us to understand the relationships among the inputs of the studied dairy farms and to develop a ranking index for comparison purposes. The developed methodology may be improved by using more inputs at the dairy farm level and considering the actual cost to measure profitability...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} for three years to investigate forage production in sorghum/alfalfa intercropping starting spring 2002 in Karaj region, Iran. In this experiment 3 mixing ratios of alfalfa with sorghum (including 75 / 25, 50 / 50 and 25 / 75 %) were compared with sorghum and alfalfa sole cropping in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The {{results showed that the}} highest amount of forage was produced in 2 nd year. Intercropping alfalfa/sorghum with 3 : 1 row ratio offered the highest mean forage production in 3 years of experimental period. In 2 nd year of experiment, alfalfa sole cropping produced more forage than other treatments, followed by 3 : 1 alfalfa/sorghum treatment. Sorghum monoculture had the lowest total forage yield in 3 years. According to evaluating <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> intercropping <b>profitability,</b> LER in the first year was less than one due to the antagonistic effects of species on each other. Definite <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> intercropping appeared in 3 rd year, in such a manner that alfalfa/sorghum with 3 : 1 row ratio had LER = 1. 22 and the minimum competition index (CI = 0. 21). Aggressivity index indicated that alfalfa and sorghum in first year were the suppressed and dominant species, respectively. In 3 rd year of experiment sorghum dominance decreased as its proportion increased in intercropping system. Overall, intercropping alfalfa/sorghum with 3 : 1 row ratio could be suggested as the superior treatment because of its higher total and available forage production system...|$|R
