40|$|Despite the {{numerous}} advantages that sandwich composites offer in transport structures over traditional metallic structures, they remain highly susceptible to low-energy impact damage, {{resulting in a}} significant reduction in compressive strength. To this end, an experimental and computational study of damage tolerance following quasi-static indentation (QSI) at the barely-visible indentation threshold was performed. Sandwich composite panels consisted of 16 -ply carbon-epoxy facesheets bonded to an aluminum honeycomb core. A parametric study was undertaken to study the effect of facesheet layup, and core geometry. This was correlated with the indentation damage and compression strength and failure mode following indentation. Two spherical indenters were used to study the effect of indenter geometry. Experimental compressionafter-impact (CAI) strength was compared to the undamaged strength obtained from edgewise-compression tests of specimens with the same geometry type. Three distinct failure modes were observed in the CAI experiments: compressive fiber failure, delamination buckling and global instability. Post-indentation compressive strength was independent of indenter size and there was no clear propensity for a particular failure mode dependent on a given specimen geometry. Specimens with a high core density and facesheets with a <b>primary</b> <b>ply</b> angle change of 90 ? were found to be the most damage resistant. Specimens with facesheets having the outer 0 ? plies closest {{to the center of the}} laminate were found to be the most damage tolerant. A computational model using finite element software (ABAQUS) was developed to simulate damage resistance and damage tolerance of sandwich composites subjected to low-energy impact. The model simulated both the indentation damage event and the subsequent CAI test in a single simulation. The facesheet fiber/matrix damage and core crushing were captured by the model. The model was applied to the facesheet and core parameters tested in the experimental study, and additionally the facesheet thickness was studied by simulating 8 -ply specimens. The numerical results were then compared with the experimental results for the same specimen type. For the indentation damage results, the 8 -ply numerical results compared better than did the 16 -ply results. The CAI strength was greatly over-predicted for all specimen types which shows the need to incorporate all damage mechanisms within the model. It is likely that inclusion of the delamination damage mechanism would lead to a better prediction in CAI strength. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E
5000|$|Assigned to the Experimental Mine Warfare School at Key West in 1957, {{the coastal}} {{minesweeper}} operated off {{the east coast}} and in the Caribbean until 7 February 1958, when she departed Key West and steamed via the Panama Canal and Manzanillo, Mexico, to the California coast, arriving at San Diego on 28 February. Assigned for a time to Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Thrasher surveyed ocean currents off Monterey in March. That summer, she cooperated with Warner Brothers during the shooting of the film [...] "Up Periscope", {{and then returned to}} her <b>primary</b> duty <b>plying</b> California's coastal waters as a minesweeper with the San Diego Harbor Defense Command. In the fall, she trained sailors of the Turkish Navy and later, when the Turkish Navy received a minesweeper from the United States under the Mutual Aid for Defense Program, continued to lend assistance during shakedown.|$|R
40|$|Embryos of the clearnose skate, Raja eglanteria, {{develop in}} sea water at 20 - 22 degrees C, {{hatching}} after 82 +/- 4 days (Luer and Gilbert, Environ. Biol. Fishes, 13 : 161 - 171, 1985). Eyes develop as steadily enlarging spheres whose corneas {{have the same}} radius of curvature as the sclera. The cornea begins development as a 2 -cell thick epithelium beneath which by Day 12 {{there is only a}} basal lamina and a wispy matrix separating it from the underlying lens. This matrix, modified by Day 16, is displaced on Day 22 by a few orthogonal <b>plies</b> of fibrillar <b>primary</b> stroma. <b>Ply</b> number increases to at least 13 by Day 30, reaching the final number of 20 +/- 2 by Day 42. Stromal fibroblasts (keratocytes) appear at the corneal periphery by Day 22, and in increased numbers by Day 30, a time at which no keratocytes are seen in the central stroma. However, by Day 40, many fibroblasts are present at the corneal periphery, invading the <b>primary</b> stroma between <b>plies,</b> occasionally reaching even the central cornea. By Day 53, keratocytes are present between all plies, from corneal periphery to center. Thickness of each ply in this secondary stroma increases, but the number of plies remains the same as in the primary stroma. Bowman's layer, non-invaded matrix beneath the epithelial basal lamina, is not evident until Day 53. Sutural fibers, first seen on Day 22, originate in the corneal epithelial basal lamina, traversing perpendicularly the <b>plies</b> of the <b>primary</b> stroma. Sutural fibers persist throughout development of the secondary stroma and into adulthood. In contrast to chicks, skate corneas remain transparent throughout development, and never form an endothelium...|$|R
40|$|An {{equation}} {{was derived}} for the strain energy release rate, G, associated with local delamination growth from a matrix ply crack. The critical GC for edge delamination onset in 25 / 902 s graphite epoxy laminates was measured {{and used in}} this equation to predict local delamination onset strains in 25 / 90 ns, n = 4, 6, 8 laminates. A simple technique for predicting strain concentrations in the <b>primary</b> load bearing <b>plies</b> near local delaminations was developed. These strain concentrations were responsible for reduced laminate nominal failure strains in laminates containing local delaminations. The influence of edge delamination and matrix crack tip delamination on laminate stiffness and strength was compared...|$|R
40|$|The tensile {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} 15 center-notched hybrid laminates was studied. Three basic laminate groups were tested: (1) a baseline group with graphite/epoxy plies, (2) {{a group with}} the same stacking sequence but where the zero-deg plies were one or two plies of S-glass or Kevlar, and (3) a group with graphite plies but where the zero-deg plies were sandwiched between layers of perforated Mylar. Specimens were loaded linearly with time; load, far field strain, and crack opening displacement (COD) were monitored. The loading was stopped periodically and the notched region was radiographed to reveal the extent and type of damage (failure progression). Results of the tests showed that the hybrid laminates had higher fracture toughnesses than comparable all-graphite laminates. The higher fracture toughness was due primarily to the larger damage region {{at the ends of}} the slit; delamination and splitting lowered the stress concentration in the <b>primary</b> load-carrying <b>plies.</b> A linear elastic fracture analysis, which ignored delamination and splitting, underestimated the fracture toughness. For almost all of the laminates, the tests showed that the fracture toughness increased with crack length. The size of the damage region at the ends of the slit and COD measurements also increased with crack length...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the failure load of T-joint structures has been undertaken, {{with a focus on}} the influence of process induced defects within the deltoid area. Static pull-off tension tests have been conducted for a comparative assessment. An extensive literature review on the subject to place is also presented. The role of the deltoid area in stabilizing the <b>primary</b> load bearing <b>plies</b> and minimising the volume fraction reduction in the off-axis plies is critical to maximise the failure load and minimise the performance variability of the T-joint structures. A deltoid area reduction of 25 %, with no change in the external geometry, yielded a similar mechanical performance to the nominal baseline specimen but with increased variability. However, a reduction of 50 % in the deltoid area yielded a strength reduction of 33 %. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the reduction in the deltoid area can be tolerated within certain limits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} {{failure mechanisms}} occurring in fibres reinforced polymer matrix composites usually {{interact with each}} other, making the overall failure of a composite structure a complex process, difficult to predict. The interaction between delamination and matrix cracks in laminated composites has been investigated here, using {{the case of a}} Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test on multidirectional laminates. A Cohesive Zone based approach was employed in the finite element analyses [1] and validating experiments were carried out. Delamination and matrix cracks cause a redistribution of stresses inside the plies, eventually leading to fibres breakage in the <b>primary</b> load-carrying <b>plies</b> and, therefore, to the final failure of a structure. The interaction between delamination and matrix cracks causes delamination migration through the thickness of laminates. Delamination finds its way to the weakest interface in a laminate, through matrix cracks, finally causing the complete failure of a structure [2]. The process is well known in industrial practice as an important cause of failure in laminated composite structures. Nevertheless, it is usually neglected in finite element analyses, because of the difficulty in modelling the interaction between the different damage mechanisms when using the currently available finite element tools [3, 4]. In this work delamination migration through the thickness at ±θ interfaces was modelled using a full scale three-dimensional DCB test model on an aerospace grade carbon/epoxy composite. Hexahedral continuum elements were employed to represent a 40 ply laminate. Cohesive interface elements were employed to represent both matrix cracks and delamination in four groups of ±θ plies in the centre of the lay-up. Matrix cracks were modelled by bands of cohesive elements, parallel to the fibres orientation and equally spaced along the ply length. This allowed for the matrix cracks to initiate in any of the possible locations, according to the initiation criteria defined. Delamination was accounted for by 9 inter-ply layers of cohesive elements tied to the surrounding elements The models consisted of 540898 nodes, with 124668 cohesive elements. Numerical analyses were performed using the Abaqus/Explicit solver, requiring a solution time of 46 hours using 8 CPUs. The fracture surfaces obtained from experimental DCB tests showed the typical “crack jump” behaviour. The main features of the damage mechanisms observed were captured by the proposed model. Crack jumps initiated at the free edges of the sample and damage propagated to different interfaces through cracks within the plies. The model can predict onset and propagation of both delamination and matrix cracks. Above all, the interaction between intersecting cracks on different planes was correctly managed, also for a number of different crack initiation locations. Although a complete agreement with the experimental results has not yet been achieved, this approach represents a step forward in the prediction of delamination migration in full scale composite structures, since it is able to manage the simultaneous presence and interaction of multiple cracks and delaminations...|$|R
