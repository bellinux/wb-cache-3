40|$|Aim: Short-time models (STM) {{to study}} the cardiotoxicity (acute or chronic) of {{doxorubicin}} in rats are of interest to assess protective interventions and pathways. STM promotes more ethical animal treatment with less stress, and {{at a lower cost}} compared to established longtime models (LTM). We wanted to investigate if a STM of 9 days yields the same information regarding cardiotoxicity as a LTM of 9 weeks. Methods: Male Wistar rats received identical drug administration protocols in STM and LTM. The two intervention groups (n = 6) received intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections of 2 mg/kg doxorubicin every day on 5 consecutive days, with a total cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg. The two control groups (n = 6), received an equivalent volume of saline injected every day on 5 consecutive days. Hearts from STM and LTM were excised and Langendorff-perfused after 9 days or 9 weeks, respectively, after the first drug injection. Cardiotoxicity was assessed in paced Langendorff hearts by release of hydrogenperoxide (H 2 O 2) and troponin T (TnT) in effluent, by myocardial accumulation of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol, and by physiological parameters recorded during <b>pressure,</b> or volume <b>regulated</b> perfusion. Results: In STM, hearts exposed to doxorubicin demonstrated a 15 % reduction in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) irrespective of flow mode, and a 13 % increase in aortic pressure (AoP), during volume regulated perfusion, an index of coronary resistance, compared to controls. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was increased 72 % during <b>pressure</b> <b>regulated</b> perfusion and 100 % during volume regulated perfusion in STM. In LTM, hearts exposed to doxorubicin demonstrated a 40 % reduction in LVDP during <b>pressure</b> <b>regulated</b> perfusion and a 20 % reduction during volume regulated perfusion. LVEDP was 70 % higher in doxorubicin treated hearts during <b>pressure</b> <b>regulated</b> perfusion and 80 % higher during volume regulated perfusion. In addition, aortic pressure was increased 30 % during volume regulated perfusion. In both STM and LTM, hearts exposed to doxorubicin demonstrated a higher H 2 O 2 and TnT release, compared to respective controls. The difference was most pronounced in STM. Myocardial content of doxorubicin was detectable in both STM and LTM. However, doxorubicinol was only detectable in STM. Conclusion: STM is comparable to LTM to study relevant indices of cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin in rat hearts. Biochemical differences are more pronounced in STM, while contractile differences are more pronounced in LTM. STM could be a preferred model for preliminary studies of protective interventions. </p...|$|R
50|$|As part {{of their}} plan, Freudenberg took {{a job in a}} public utility also {{supplying}} natural gas, and the two took an apartment in the East Berlin neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. In January and February 1989, they began assembling a 13 metre tall by 11 metre diameter balloon envelope out of polythene, which they cut into strips, taped together, and engirded with a string net. There was no basket, only a narrow wooden beam. On the evening of 7 March they decided that the wind conditions were favourable for their escape. They drove to a <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> station in Blankenburg neighborhood to which Freudenberg had the keys and at midnight began to fill their balloon with gas. From some time after 1:00 am the balloon was visible from a distance. A waiter {{on his way home from}} work which had ended at 1:30 am noticed the balloon, and called the Volkspolizei. When the couple heard a patrol car arriving shortly after 2:00 am the balloon was not yet completely filled. Because they feared it would not lift both of them they quickly decided for Freudenberg to escape alone, his wife always having been doubtful. He occupied the beam and cut the tethers. With only one person aboard the balloon had a very high buoyancy and rose fast. Ballast bags hanging down on lines severed a power line shortly after launching and caused it to short-cut and spark. Although East German security had often shot and killed citizens attempting to escape, they decided against shooting because of the possibility of triggering an explosion of the natural gas now leaking. Also, they believed Freudenberg to have been killed by the current which was not the case. Freudenberg's 23 year old wife was able to get back home, where the Stasi were already waiting for her.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of available instruments vent their specimen chamber to the ambient pressure (100 kPa) with every specimen transfer. A {{large volume of}} gas has to be pumped out and replaced with the gas of interest, usually water vapor supplied from a water reservoir connected to the chamber via some <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> (e.g. needle) valve. In many applications this presents no problem, but with those ones requiring uninterrupted 100% relative humidity, {{it has been found}} that the removal of ambient gas is accompanied by lowering the relative humidity below the 100% level during specimen transfer. This clearly defeats the very purpose of ESEM for this class of applications. However, such a problem does not arise with the original prototype ESEM using an intermediate specimen transfer chamber, so that the main chamber is always maintained at 100% relative humidity without interruption during a study. The specimen transfer chamber (tr-ch) shown in the diagram of ESEM gas pressure stages contains a small water reservoir so that the initial ambient air can be quickly pumped out and practically instantaneously replaced with water vapor without going through a limited conductance tube and valve. The main specimen chamber can be maintained at 100% relative humidity, if the only leak of vapor is through the small PLA1, but not during violent pumping with every specimen change. Once the wet specimen is in equilibrium with 100% relative humidity in the transfer chamber, within seconds, a gate valve opens and the specimen is transferred in the main specimen chamber maintained at the same pressure. An alternative approach involving controlled pumping of the main chamber may not solve the problem entirely either because the 100% relative humidity cannot be approached monotonically without any drying, or the process is very slow; inclusion of a water reservoir inside the main chamber means that one cannot lower the relative humidity until after all of the water is pumped out (i.e. a defective control of the relative humidity).|$|E

40|$|Radiation {{pressure}} from the absorption and scattering of starlight by dust grains {{may be an important}} feedback mechanism in regulating star-forming galaxies. We compile data from the literature on star clusters, star-forming subregions, normal star-forming galaxies, and starbursts to assess the importance of radiation pressure on dust as a feedback mechanism, by comparing the luminosity and flux of these systems to their dust Eddington limit. This exercise motivates a novel interpretation of the Schmidt Law, the LIR-L'CO correlation, and the LIR-L'HCN correlation. In particular, the linear LIR-L'HCN correlation is a natural prediction of radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>regulated</b> star formation. Overall, we find that the Eddington limit sets a hard upper bound to the luminosity of any star-forming region. Importantly, however, many normal star-forming galaxies have luminosities significantly below the Eddington limit. We explore several explanations for this discrepancy, especially the role of "intermittency" in normal spirals - the tendency for {{only a small number of}} subregions within a galaxy to be actively forming stars at any moment because of the time-dependence of the feedback process and the luminosity evolution of the stellar population. If radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>regulates</b> star formation in dense gas, then the gas depletion timescale is 6 Myr, in good agreement with observations of the densest starbursts. Finally, we highlight the importance of observational uncertainties - namely, the dust-to-gas ratio and the CO-H 2 and HCN-H 2 conversion factors - that must be understood before a definitive assessment of radiation pressure as a feedback mechanism in star-forming galaxies.
