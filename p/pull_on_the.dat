5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope {{was attached to}} ballast, {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and outward. The area had a strong <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E
5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E

5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E
5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E
5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E

25|$|Active {{management}} of the third stage is a method of shortening the stage between when the baby is born and when the placenta is delivered. This stage is when the mother is {{at risk of having}} a PPH. Active management involves giving a drug which helps the uterus contract before delivering the placenta by a gentle but sustained <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> umbilical cord whilst exerting upward pressure on the lower abdomen to support the uterus.|$|E
25|$|When the rode is slack, the {{catenary}} curve presents a lower angle of <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anchor or mooring device {{than would be}} the case if it were nearly straight. This enhances the performance of the anchor and raises the level of force it will resist before dragging. To maintain the catenary shape in the presence of wind, a heavy chain is needed, so that only larger ships in deeper water can rely on this effect. Smaller boats also rely on catenary to maintain maximum holding power.|$|E
25|$|While {{this seemed}} fine in theory, in {{practice}} it had multiple problems. The most prominent {{of all was}} that the arming method did not work as intended. In many cases pulling the loop was too difficult for one man to do and it required two men. For a lone soldier, the best method was to hold the grenade between the knees and <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loop with both hands. However, this often resulted in cutting the fingers in addition to igniting the fuse.|$|E

25|$|A {{flexible}} flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled {{with thin}} metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing {{the possibility to}} descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen. U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs {{when there is a}} backward <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{research}} on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann's study. He found that when he asked {{a group of men}} to pull on a rope, that they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this {{was the result of the}} individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rope.|$|E

50|$|Reins {{consist of}} leather straps or rope {{attached}} to the outer ends of a bit and extend to the rider's or driver's hands. Reins are {{the means by which}} a horse rider or driver communicates directional commands to <b>the</b> horse's head. <b>Pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reins can be used to steer or stop the horse. The sides of a horse's mouth are sensitive, so <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reins <b>pulls</b> the bit, which then pulls the horse's head from side to side, which is how the horse is controlled.|$|R

25|$|A {{last stand}} is a {{military}} situation in which a body of troops holds a defensive position {{in the face of}} overwhelming odds. The defensive force usually takes very heavy casualties or is completely destroyed, as happened at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC. Troops may make a last stand due to a perceived duty; because they are defending a tactically crucial point; to buy time to enable a trapped army to escape, due to fear of execution if captured; or to protect their ruler or leader. Last stands loom large in history, as the heroism and sacrifice of the defenders exerts a large <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public's imagination. Some last stands have become a celebrated part of a fighting force's or a country's history.|$|E
25|$|The Earth is not {{a perfect}} sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an {{equatorial}} diameter about 43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, {{during most of the}} year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off-center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off-center on the opposite side. The gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder {{on one side of the}} Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.|$|E
25|$|Wing warping {{consists}} of the twisting motion of the wings of an aircraft to produce lateral control. The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to Wilbur Wright who in 1899, {{came up with the}} idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their 1899 glider that used ropes to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wings. Later on, the young French engineer Robert Esnault-Pelterie replaced wing warping in 1904 with the aileron on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was Henry Farman, a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.|$|E
