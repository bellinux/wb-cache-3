40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>devices.</b> The most critical characteristics of a pressure relief device are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a pressure relief device is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the pressure relief device must not exceed the {{maximum allowable working pressure}} of the equipment or system being protected. Because of testing facility limitations, size or pressure, pressure relief valves intended for elevated temperature service are often set using ambient temperature air.

A comparison has been carried out with numerical simulations carried out by the multiphase flow simulation tool OLGA by SPT. The Henry-Fauske model has been used as orifice choke model and the orifice discharge flow coefficient, required as input by OLGA, has been calculated by Chisholm's model. Comparison between OLGA's results and experimental data shows that Henry-Fauske model markedly underestimates the mass flow rate through the orifice, if Chisholm's model is used to calculate discharge coefficient. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of orifice discharge coefficient (Cd).

More than 24 Bcf of total methane losses from gas plants are fugitive emissions from leaking compressors {{and other equipment}} components such as valves, connectors, seals, and openended lines. Implementing a directed inspection and maintenance (DI&M) program is a proven, cost-effective way to detect, measure, prioritize, and repair equipment leaks to reduce methane emissions. A DI&M program begins with a baseline survey to identify and quantify leaks. Repairs are then made to only the leaking components that are cost-effective to fix, based on criteria such as repair cost, expected life of the repair, and payback period. Subsequent surveys are designed {{based on data from}} previous surveys, allowing operators to concentrate on the components that are most likely to leak and are profitable to repair.

40|$|High-pressure gas is {{produced}} during the oil production process at offshore plants, and <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>devices,</b> such as valves, {{are widely used}} to protect related systems from it. The high-pressure gas in the pipes connected to the flare head is burned at the flare stack, or, if it is nontoxic, is vented to the atmosphere. During this process, excessive noise is generated by the pressure relief valves {{that are used to}} quickly discharge the high-pressure gas to the atmosphere. This noise sometimes causes severe acoustic-induced vibration in the pipe wall. This study estimated the internal aerodynamic noise due to valve flow in a simple constriction-expansion pipe, by combining the large eddy simulation technique with a wavenumber-frequency analysis, which made it possible to decompose the fluctuating pressure into the incompressible hydrodynamic pressure and compressible acoustic pressure. First, the steady-state flow was numerically simulated, and the result was compared with a quasi-one-dimensional theoretical solution, which confirmed the validity of the current numerical method. Then, an unsteady simulation analysis was performed to predict the fluctuating pressure inside a pipe. Finally, the acoustic pressure modes in a pipe were extracted by applying the wavenumber-frequency transform to the total pressure field. The results showed that the acoustic pressure fluctuations in a pipe could be separated from the incompressible ones. This made it possible to obtain accurate information about the acoustic power, which could be used to assess the likelihood of a piping system failure due to acoustic-induced vibration, along with information about the acoustic power spectrum of each acoustic mode, which could be used to facilitate the systematic mitigation of the potential acoustic-induced vibration in piping systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{inadvertent}} {{opening of}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve results in a reactor coolant inventory decrease {{and a decrease in}} reactor coolant system <b>pressure.</b> A <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve, as defined in ANSI B 95. 1 - 1972 (Ref. 1), is a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>device</b> which is designed to reclose and prevent further fluid flow after normal condi-tions have been restored.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{offloading}} the foot {{has been established}} as a treatment strategy after various surgical and non-operative procedures {{in the context of}} trauma, illnesses and disabilities of the foot and ankle (Bus et al., 2016; Bus & Valk, 2008; Baur et al., 2018). It is frequently observed that overloading the foot accompanied by elevated pressure pattern are thought to have important roles for the development of impairments of wound and softtissue healing or can cause delays in fracture healing (Claes & Heigele, 1999; Reike et al., 1997; Genc et al., 2016). Hindfoot relief devices have commonly been used in the post-surgical rehabilitation process, following various procedures such as the repair of calcaneal fractures, ligament reconstructions, corrective osteotomies, and trauma surgery of the hindfoot (Carl et al., 2006; Hodge et al., 1999; Schepers et al., 2008; Bohl et al., 2017; Groot et al., 2013; Cavanagh & Bus, 2011; Kraus et al., 2014; Bus et al., 2009). In cases of tarsal bone marrow oedema, stress reactions or stress fractures, hindfoot relief devices allow a mobilization under limited weight-bearing conditions that are encouraged to promote healing without overloading the tissue (Pauser et al., 2011). Additionally, hindfoot relief devices are used to improve the healing process for plantar ulcers and wound healing disorders due to trauma, peripheral arterial disease, neuropathic disabilities and rheumatoid arthritis (Pauser et al., 2011; Götz et al., 2016; da Conceição et al., 2015). Offloading the hindfoot is mostly carried out by hindfoot relief shoes (HRSs) and hindfoot relief orthoses (HROs) (Hunt et al., 1987; Hahn et al., 2014). Nevertheless, commonly available devices display fundamentally different designs and concepts. Despite the common use of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>devices,</b> there is a paucity of data comparing their offloading effects related to biomechanical aspects.|$|E

Precautions {{has to be taken}} when designing a {{pressure release}} system for CO 2 to avoid formation of solid CO 2 and blockage of the safety valve and downstream pipe. A downstream pipe simulation model was developed in order evaluate the pressure development through a downstream pipe of a pressure release system. With emphasis on supermarket refrigeration a downstream pipe geometry based on a system used in the industry was implemented in the model. The simulation model is based on the Martinelli-Nelson two-phase pressure drop equation. The calculation method was validated by comparing with former experimental study with same mass flux and geometry. Heat transfer from the ambient was also considered in the model. The results from the simulation was compared with the standard NS-EN 13136, "Refrigerating systems and heat pumps - <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>devices</b> and their associated piping - Methods for calculation". The simulation results showed that the low temperature at atmospheric pressure and the formation of dry ice when reaching the triple point was as expected according to theoretical calculations. For mass fluxes of 100 - 200 kg/sm 2 the triple point was reached in {{the last part of the}} downstream pipe. For mass fluxes lower than 45 kg/sm 2 the triple point was reached in the safety valve. There was a significant increase in the velocity towards the end of the downstream pipe due to a decrease in density. For heat loads above 36 kW (G= 200 kg/sm 2) and downstream diameter of 40 mm the outlet velocity became sonic (Ma> 0. 3). The pressure loss in a downstream pipe increases with increasing mass flux. The outlet flow velocity also increases with increasing mass flux.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} the potential effects of releases from compressed gaseous hydrogen systems on commercial vehicles in urban and tunnel environments using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Comparative releases from compressed natural gas systems are also included in the analysis. This study is restricted to typical non-articulated single deck city buses. Hydrogen releases are considered from storage systems with nominal working pressures of 20, 35 and 70 MPa, and a comparative natural gas release (20 MPa). The cases investigated are based on the assumptions that either fire causes a release via a thermally activated <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>device(s)</b> (PRD) and that the released gas vents without immediately igniting, or that a PRD fails. Various release strategies were taken into account. For each configuration some worstcase scenarios are considered. By far the most critical case investigated in the urban environment, is a rapid release of the entire hydrogen or natural gas storage system such as the simultaneous opening of all PRDs. If ignition occurs, the effects could be expected to be similar to the 1983 Stockholm hydrogen accident [Venetsanos, A. G., Huld, T., Adams, P., & Bartzis, J. G. (2003). Source, dispersion and combustion modelling of an accidental release of hydrogen in an urban environment. Journal of Hazardous Materials, A 105, 1 ¿ 25]. In the cases where the hydrogen release is restricted, for example, by venting through a single PRD, the effects are relatively minor and localised close to the area of the flammable cloud. With increasing hydrogen storage pressure, the maximum energy available in a flammable cloud after a release increases, as do the predicted overpressures resulting from combustion. Even in the relatively confined environment considered, the effects on the combustion regime are closer to what would be expected in a more open environment, i. e. a slow deflagration should be expected. Among the cases studied the most severe one was a rapid release of the entire hydrogen (40 kg) or natural gas (168 kg) storage system within the confines of a tunnel. In this case there was minimal difference between a release from a 20 MPa natural gas system or a 20 MPa hydrogen system, however, a similar release from a 35 MPa hydrogen system was significantly more severe and particularly in terms of predicted overpressures. The present study has also highlighted that the ignition point significantly affects the combustion regime in confined environments. The results have indicated that critical cases in tunnels may tend towards a fast deflagration, or where there are turbulence generating features, e. g. multiple obstacles, there is the possibility that the combustion regime could progress to a detonation.
