40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for shear strength evaluation of <b>fibrous</b> concrete <b>beams</b> reinforced with stirrups is proposed. The formulation {{is founded on}} the theory of plasticity and the stress field concepts, generalizing a known plastic model for calculating the bearing capacity of reinforced concrete beams, {{to the case of}} fibrous concrete. The beneficial effect of steel fibres is estimated taking into account the residual tensile strength of fibrous concrete, by modifying an analytical constitutive law which presents a plastic plateau as a post-peak branch. Around fifty results of experimental tests carried out on steel <b>fibrous</b> concrete <b>beams</b> available in the literature were collected, and a comparison of shear strength estimation provided by other semi-empirical models is performed, proving that the numerical values obtained with the proposed model are in very good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA <b>fibrous</b> {{composite}} <b>beam</b> with an {{edge crack}} is submitted to a cyclic bending moment and the crack bridging actions due to the fibers. Assuming a general elastic-linearly hardening crack bridging model for the fibers and a linear-elastic law for the matrix, the statically indeterminate bridging actions are obtained from compatibility conditions. The elastic and plastic shake-down phenomena are examined in terms of generalised cross-sectional quantities and, by employing a fatigue crack growth law, the mechanical behaviour up to failure is captured. Within {{the framework of the}} proposed fracture mechanics-based model, the cyclic crack bridging due to debonding at fiber–matrix interface of short fibers is analysed in depth. By means of some simplifying assumptions, such a phenomenon can be described by a linear isotropic tensile softening/compressive hardening law. Finally, numerical examples are presented for <b>fibrous</b> composite <b>beams</b> with randomly distributed short fibers...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that steel fibres significantly increase the shear capacity and ductility in reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Utilization of this structural capacity in RC beams has however, been limited by lack of design guidelines. Conventional methods applied in normal design are not applicable in this case. Furthermore there exists no unified expression for the complete characterization of shear strength and ductility in beams. Fundamentally, steel fibres contribution should be considered based on stress transfer mechanism, augmented by concrete and dowel action of the main reinforcements in a unified manner. This paper proposes a unified analytical model in which the complete behavior of steel fibre reinforced concrete beams is characterized. Verification of the model was found to be in agreement with the experimental results tested by the authors. Non linear behavior as well as increase in strength observed in the <b>fibrous</b> <b>beams</b> was predicted well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{optimizing}} design idea {{is produced}} for {{the structure of}} top beam of electrostatic precipitator casing. The thermos cabinet and the original box shaped top <b>beam</b> of <b>casing</b> compose a truss beam system whose overall section height is increased greatly, resultantly, the bend bearing capacity of truss beam increases significantly {{than that of the}} original top <b>beam</b> of <b>casing.</b> Consequently, the wall thickness of box section of the original top beam can be reduced so that the steel consumption can be saved. Based on a practical project, the load effects on truss beam were investigated, respectively, including the air pressure difference and the temperature difference among external layer, thermos cabinet and interior of casing. Besides, the evaluation method of internal force in truss beam was investigated and the selective preference of truss beam configuration was conducted. The unfavorable load cases of air pressure difference and temperature difference are proposed for truss beam design. Besides, the accurate evaluation method of internal force and the design method for economical configuration of truss are proposed. In consideration of load bearing effect of thermos cabinet layer, the optimized design of truss beam originating from box sectioned top beam can ensure the truss works safely and reduce the steel consumption significantly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an experimental and analytical {{study on the}} behavior of post-tensioned concrete beams with variable discontinuous fibers’ content. Eleven half scale T-shaped post-tensioned simple beams were cast and tested in four points bending under the effect of a repeated load using a displacement control system up to failure. The test parameters were the fibers’ type (steel and polypropylene) and content, as well as the prestressing ratio (partially or fully). Key test results showed considerable enhancement in the crack distribution, crack width and spacing, concrete tensile strength and flexural stiffness in all <b>beams</b> with steel <b>fibrous</b> concrete. The latter aspects were directly proportional to the steel fibers’ contents. On the other hand, beams containing polypropylene fibers demonstrated a slight decrease in the flexural strength and a slight increase in flexural stiffness. In addition, the tensile steel strains decreased in all <b>fibrous</b> concrete <b>beams,</b> with lowest values in steel fibrous concrete specimens when compared to those of the polypropylene fibers. Furthermore, <b>fibrous</b> concrete <b>beams</b> also demonstrated enhanced ductility and energy absorption, which reached the highest values for steel fibrous concrete specimens. Generally, it can be concluded that steel fibers proved to have higher structural efficiency than polypropylene fibers, when used in the tested specimens...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{results on the}} International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Central Solenoid Model Coil and Insert Coil {{have shown that the}} critical characteristics measured on a single strand are significantly different from those of a cabled conductor. This performance degradation seems to be due mostly to the bending effects on the strands subjected to the electromagnetic forces: a strand inside the cable behaves like a beam supported by the neighbouring strands and loaded by the transversal Lorentz force. Recently at the University of Twente (The Netherlands) and at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) some experimental tests have been performed to study this effect. In this study we analyze the strand strain field resulting from the cool down and the successive bending loads. Due to the material non linearity {{it is not possible to}} calculate the two effects separately. To analyze the strain field in a strand experiencing an electromagnetic load at 4. 2 K, it is hence necessary to follow the evolution of the deformation from the strand reaction temperature to its working conditions. One single strand is taken into consideration, and it is studied with three different approaches: assuming Kirchhoff hypothesis, applying Timoshenko beam theory and using a composite, <b>fibrous</b> <b>beam</b> model. The resulting strain field is used as input data for the THELMA code to compare the results with the experiment performed at JAERI. This work is detailed in a companion paper...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} semi-empirical {{analytical}} expression that {{is capable of}} determining the shear strength of reinforced concrete beams with longitudinal bars, in the presence of reinforcing fibers and transverse stirrups. The expression is based on an evaluation of the strength contribution of beam and arch actions and it makes it possible to take their interaction with the fibers into account. For the strength contribution of stirrups, the effective stress reached at beam failure was considered by introducing an effectiveness function. This function shows the share of beam action strength contribution on the global strength of the beam calculated including the effect of fibers. The expression is calibrated on the basis of experimental data available in literature referring to <b>fibrous</b> reinforced concrete <b>beams</b> with steel fibers and recently obtained by the authors. It can also include the following variables in the strength previsions: - geometrical ratio of longitudinal bars in tension; - shear span to depth ratio; - strength of materials and fiber characteristics; - size effects. Finally, some of the more recent analytical expressions that are capable of predicting the shear strength of <b>fibrous</b> concrete <b>beams,</b> also in the presence of stirrups, are mentioned and a comparison is made with experimental data and with the results obtained by the authors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the work carried out to study the influence of curing environment and steel fiber volume fraction on the flexural strength, flexural rigidity, flexural toughness, and ductility of fibrous reinforced concrete (RC) beams. A total of twenty simply supported beams were tested. Ten of the twenty beams were cured under controlled laboratory conditions and the other ten were cured under severe hot dry climate (SHDC) characterized by their intense heat, Iow relative humidity, direct solar radiation, and large diurnal variations of daily temperatures. Tests were carried out 28 and 90 days after casting. Test results show that for non <b>fibrous</b> RC concrete <b>beams</b> the adverse effects of SHDC have more influence in reducing the flexural toughness than the flexural strength. On the other hand, test results indicate that under any of the two curing environment considered in this study, the flexural strength, flexural rigidity, flexural toughness and ductility of the <b>fibrous</b> RC <b>beams</b> are in direct proportion with the fiber content. Moreover, the results reveal that the enhancements in these engineering properties due to the steel fiber addition are not affected by the above described severe field conditions. Furthermore, inclusion of steel fibers in concrete helps, to some extent, in reducing the adverse effects of SHDC on the properties of concrete...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of steel fibres in shear reinforced concrete beams subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading is experimentally investigated. Seven steel-fibre-reinforced concrete beams and conventionally reinforced beams without steel fibres, used as control specimens, were constructed {{for the purposes}} of this study. Hook-ended steel fibres with two different volume fractions (0. 5 % and 0. 75 %) have been used in the <b>fibrous</b> concrete <b>beams</b> of the test program as shear reinforcement. Two beams were tested in monotonically increasing four-pointed loading up to total failure of the specimen, and five beams were tested under cyclic deformations. The dimensions and the flexural reinforcement of all the beams examined were the same. Hook-ended steel fibres with an aspect ratio equal to 75 were used. The loading was imposed consistently in low rate, and the values of the load and the corresponding crack widths and deformation at the mid-span of the beams were reported. The conclusions drawn from the experimental results of the tested beams imply that the steel-fibre-reinforced beams exhibited improved shear performance with high shear capacities, enhanced energy dissipation capabilities and ameliorated crack patterns...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{concrete}} beams were tested {{to study the}} influence of adding steel fibers (SF) to concrete mix on the ductility of concrete beams reinforced with fiber reinforced plastics bars (FRP beams). The main variables {{in the study were}} the type and volume fraction of the steel fiber. The study also investigated the accuracy of an available model, developed originally to predict the flexural strength of concrete beams reinforced with SF and steel bars (SF-steel beams), after modification in estimating the flexural capacity of the <b>fibrous</b> FRP <b>beams</b> (SF-FRP beams). The results indicate that the ductility of FRP beams is less than 50 % of that of the respective steel beams. The results also reveal that the ductility of SF-FRP beams {{is directly related to the}} fiber content. In addition, the test results show that inclusion of 1 % of hooked SF can improve the ductility of FRP beams to be the same as that of the steel beams. Furthermore, comparison between the predicted and measured flexural capacity of SF-FRP beams shows that the modified model can predict the measured results within a reasonable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper an {{analytical}} model is proposed that is able to determine the shear resistance of lightweight reinforced concrete beams with longitudinal bars, {{in the presence of}} reinforcing steel fibers. The model is based on the evaluation of the resistance contribution resulting from beam and arch actions. For the resistance contribution of main bars in tension, the residual bond adherence of steel bars and the crack spacing of reinforced concrete (RC) beams in the presence of fibers are considered. The contribution in terms of postcracking resistance in the tension zone of the beams is also included. The model was verified on the basis of experimental data available in the literature and is able to include the following variables in the resistance provision: diameter and number of steel bars, depth to shear span ratio, resistance of materials and fiber characteristics, crack spacing, tensile stress in main bars, residual bond resistance, postcracking tensile resistance, and size effects. Finally, some of the more recent analytical expressions able to predict the shear resistance of <b>fibrous</b> concrete <b>beams</b> are mentioned and a comparison is made with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to prove experimentally that the ultimate shear strength of reinforced concrete beam would increase significantly when {{a certain amount of}} local fiber was added into the concrete mix. Six reinforced concrete beams with typical dimension of 120 mm x 240 mm x 1600 mm were made and divided into: (a) three beams were made of non fibrous concrete with vertical stirrups (code D 1, D 2, and D 3), (b) three beams were made of fibrous concrete with vertical stirrups (code D 1 F, D 2 F, and D 3 F). The local fiber weight added into the mixture were 46. 76 kg per cubic meter of concrete, Vf = 0. 7 %. Plain round steel bars with 16 mm diameters were used to provide the main tensile reinforcement. The yield stress of the steel was 446 MPa. Plain round steel bars with 16 mm and 10 mm diameters respectively were used to provide the main compressive reinforcement, the yield stress of the steel were 446 MPa and 379 MPa respectively. Plain round bars with 6 mm diameters were used to be vertical stirrups, the yield stress of the steel was 314 MPa. The beams were simply supported at two points, having spans of 1300 mm, and symmetrically loaded by 0. 5 P at the point located 400 mm from the supports. The load was applied to the beams with an increment of ΔP = 1 ton until the beams ultimate capacity was reached.

The concrete is binary blended with 15 % of fly ash by weight of cement as partial replacement of cement and addition of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 %, 1 % of crimped steel fibers with aspect ratio of 80 are used for the study purpose. Compressive strength of concrete is measured by testing standard cubes (150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm) at the age of 28 days, the combined torsion-bending-shear strength is measured by testing beams of size 100 x 100 mm and length 1200 mm with a bracket attached at center of size 100 x 100 x 300 mm. This bracket is adequately reinforced to avoid any failure at joint. The tests were conducted on 12 beams for varying percentages of steel fibers and studied for their behavior under combined torsion-bending-shear. The study involved the influence of fiber addition on the ultimate torsion-bending-shear strength of beams.
