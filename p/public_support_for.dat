5|$|According to a Saint Consulting {{survey in}} April 2007, wind power was the {{alternative}} energy source most likely to gain <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> future development in Canada, with only 16% opposed {{to this type of}} energy.

5|$|Blackman's {{guilty verdict}} {{led to a}} showing of <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Marine, with people {{creating}} social media groups and online petitions alternately asking that he be given a lenient sentence and calling for his release. The Daily Telegraph supported one Change.org petition for leniency.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Queen's Pier was {{completely}} demolished in February 2008. Its base piles were also removed in March 2008.

5|$|In contrast, however, many Christian evangelists {{and church}} {{organizations}} {{took a more}} supportive role. For example, televangelist Jim Bakker expressed <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the group Stryper, watching them perform and becoming personal friends with the band's members. Many new bands began to arise, eventually drawing the attention of record labels that specialized in Christian music.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{the affair}} brought such a shock {{that people were}} sobered. The legal battle had been lost, the {{railroad}} had won, {{and there was not}} enough <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> changing the policy of granting public lands to railroads. The only concession SP made was to reduce the land price slightly. In the end, most people simply stayed where they were and purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 3 November a YouGov poll {{conducted}} for The Daily Telegraph appeared {{to show that}} <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the industrial action had dropped in comparison to a similar {{poll conducted}} two weeks earlier. However, Richard O'Hagan of the Daily Mail argued {{that there was little}} support for the strikes due to the economic climate of Britain at the time.|$|E
5|$|The AEC would {{eventually}} concede, as well, that even {{low levels of}} radiation were harmful.

Looking at 30 years’ worth of legislative output and the <b>public’s</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the EU, Jørgen Bølstad argues that politicians have tried to please their electorates on the European level.

5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day {{has become known as}} Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E
5|$|From 1997 to 2004, Kefalas {{worked as}} a public policy {{advocate}} and community development coordinator for Catholic Charities until his departure amidst a controversy regarding his <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Roe v.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{political}} {{forces in the}} Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia. But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate George W. Joseph in the 1930 Republican primary, and later his law partner Julius Meier, were understood to demonstrate strong <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> public ownership of dams. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled {{the construction of the}} Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as public works projects. The legislation was attributed to the efforts of Oregon Senator Charles McNary, Washington Senator Clarence Dill, and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin, among others.|$|E
50|$|The National Space Institute was a space {{advocacy}} group, {{the first}} of its kind, established by Dr. Wernher von Braun to help maintain the <b>public's</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the United States space program.

5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> radical {{reform of the}} present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is to be restored to the system.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson {{to issue a}} sweeping injunction {{to break up the}} strike. Although there was <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} reelected Sherman {{to another}} six-year term that year, and when (after a three-month vacation in Europe) he resumed his seat he again {{turned to the}} greenback question. <b>Public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> greenbacks had grown, especially among businesspeople who thought withdrawal would lead to lower prices. When a bill passed the House suspending the authority to retire greenbacks under the Contraction Act, Sherman supported it in the Senate. It passed the Senate 33–4, and became law in 1868.|$|E
40|$|Since 2000, Vladimir Putin {{has spent}} two terms as Russia’s President and one as Prime Minister. Now {{that he has}} regained the presidency, many {{commentators}} {{are concerned that the}} Russian public has become more accepting of his increasingly autocratic government. Ellen Carnaghan argues that in societies undergoing political change like Russia, the concept of ‘democracy’ may vary widely from accepted norms, and using survey data, finds that the Russian <b>public’s</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> democracy may be greater than previously thought...|$|R

5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the protection of elephants and that it {{sends a message to}} poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} {{represented the}} first <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Zionism {{by a major}} political power – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter.

5|$|The {{potential}} to draw an MLS expansion team helped drive <b>public</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> building the stadium in 1997.

In 2007, it was announced that Seattle would be the home of an expansion team. The first Sounders FC regular season match was at the stadium on March 19, 2009. Fredy Montero scored the first goal in a 3–0 Seattle victory.|$|E
