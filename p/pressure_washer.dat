500|$|Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{his most}} controversial pieces of the series on 15 October, with a depiction of the Lower Manhattan skyline featuring the former Twin Towers, with a burnt-orange chrysanthemum in place where one of the hijacked airplanes struck the North Tower. The silhouette appeared {{on the side of a}} building in TriBeCa, with an identical depiction along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, facing the downtown skyline. The Brooklyn Heights piece was eventually buffed out by the city, requiring chemicals and a high-powered <b>pressure</b> <b>washer.</b> The removal followed a taunt Banksy had directed toward the city on his website. Meanwhile, the sister piece in TriBeCa served as a shrine, people placing flowers next to it and as well as a letter asking no one to touch the painting. [...] Acrylic glass was eventually installed to protect the piece, before someone painted over it.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>washer</b> is a {{high pressure}} mechanical sprayer {{that can be used}} to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles, and concrete road surfaces. Frank Ofeldt in the United States invented the steam <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> or [...] "high-pressure Jenny" [...] in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|SEPTA Regional Rail's {{method of}} {{preventing}} slippery rail is the Gel Trains. These three trains spray a high-pressure mixture of Sandite on the rails; in the fall, the Gel Trains also clean the rails using the {{high-pressure water jet}} method ahead of the gel application. These trains consist of a <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> and gel dispenser mounted on a converted flatcar, and a tank car which carries water. They are pulled on one end by one of SEPTA's work diesels (or a diesel borrowed from a local shortline such as the West Chester Railroad), and controlled {{at the other end}} by a former LIRR [...] "Power Pack" [...] cab unit (one a former ALCO FA, the other a former EMD F7). However, as of 2015; The FA and F7 were retired and replaced by Comet 1 cab cars.|$|E

50|$|Portable sewer jetters and <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> sewer jetter {{attachments}} {{are primarily}} used by service personnel and homeowners to remove soft obstructions throughout {{the length of}} a building's sewer drain and to prevent the recurrence of clogs by cleaning the sides of drain pipes and flushing out residue. <b>Pressure</b> <b>washer</b> sewer jetter attachments are generally lower in cost and weight than electric drain cleaners with an equivalent reach, and can present a lower risk of scratching plumbing fixtures.|$|E
50|$|The basic <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> {{consists}} of a motor (either electric, internal combustion, pneumatic or hydraulic) that drives a high-pressure water pump, a high-pressure hose and a trigger gun-style switch. Just as a garden hose nozzle is used to increase the velocity of water, a <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> creates high pressure and velocity. The pump cannot draw more water from the pipe to which the washer is connected than that source can provide: the water supply must be adequate for the machine connected to it, as water starvation leads to cavitation damage of the pump elements.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike outdoor <b>pressure</b> <b>washers</b> with {{application}} <b>pressures</b> of 1,000 - , spray-and-vac {{units are}} designed for long-term indoor use on grout and other surfaces, and offer variable application pressures ranging from 110 - [...]|$|R
50|$|In 2014 Vax diversified {{its product}} range from vacuums, carpet washers and steam {{cleaners}} to include <b>pressure</b> <b>washers,</b> air purifiers and de-humidifiers. The following year Vax introduced a cordless vacuum cleaner with a lift-out cylinder design.|$|R
50|$|Some Australian states, such as Queensland, {{prohibit}} the cleaning of fibro with <b>pressure</b> <b>washers,</b> {{because it can}} spread the embedded asbestos fibres over a wide area. Safer cleaning methods involve using a fungicide and a sealant.|$|R
5000|$|The hot-water {{high-pressure}} washer {{was invented}} by Alfred Kärcher in 1950, but Frank Ofeldt in the United States claimed to have invented the steam <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> or [...] "high-pressure Jenny" [...] in 1927.|$|E
50|$|In 1974 the {{corporate}} color was changed from blue to yellow. From that year, {{under the leadership}} of Alfred Kärcher’s widow Irene Kärcher, the company launched the HD 555, the first <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> for private users.|$|E
50|$|Caustic {{chemicals}} can {{be applied}} to break down the grease. After that, hot water can be used to rinse away the residue. Chemicals are generally applied with either a garden type sprayer, downstream injection through a <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> or with a chemical foamer.|$|E
50|$|The {{engines are}} often used on hot <b>pressure</b> <b>washers</b> and generators, {{and a variety of}} larger {{construction}} equipment like trenchers, ride-on trowels, concrete saws and vibratory rollers. They’re also suitable for industrial and turf applications, including large riding lawnmowers.|$|R
50|$|In August 1999, Pentair {{bought the}} DeVilbiss Air Power Company for $460 million in cash.

50|$|The {{power lines}} and their {{surroundings}} must be maintained by linemen, sometimes assisted by helicopters with <b>pressure</b> <b>washers</b> or circular saws which may work 3 times faster. However this work often occurs in the dangerous areas of the Helicopter height-velocity diagram.|$|R
50|$|Disadvantages of <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> sewer jetter {{attachments}} {{and many}} portable jetters include {{an inability to}} extract tree roots and other hard obstructions. Disadvantages of truck- and trailer-mounted sewer jetters include high relative cost and weight, and the requirement for extensive training to comply with manufacturers' safety guidelines.|$|E
50|$|An {{insulator}} <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> is {{a mechanical}} high-pressure washer designed to remove contamination/pollution from {{overhead power line}} insulators with the power on (energized) using low conductivity water. Cleaning is necessary to prevent flashovers (high-voltage shorts to earth across the insulators), which can damage power line equipment.|$|E
50|$|Soft washing is a {{cleaning}} technique {{that can be}} achieved either by using a <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> with a special tip that will reduce the pressure rating down to around 500 psi (or less), or using a tank, gun, hose, and a 12-volt, air diaphragm, or gas-engine style pump.|$|E

50|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the area of minimizing the need for labor in this industry by use of technology. The availability of technology such as the <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> has made it more efficient. More recently, in high tech societies the use of fully automated robotic window cleaners is starting to become common.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{versions}} of the snow machines found at ski resorts exist, scaled down to run off household size air and water supplies. Home snowmakers receive their water supply either from a garden hose or from a <b>pressure</b> <b>washer,</b> which makes more snow per hour. Plans also exist for do-it-yourself snowmaking machines made out of plumbing fittings and special nozzles.|$|E
50|$|Triplex pumps with shorter lifetimes {{are commonplace}} {{to the home}} user. A person who uses a home <b>pressure</b> <b>washer</b> for 10 hours a year may be {{satisfied}} with a pump that lasts 100 hours between rebuilds. Industrial-grade or continuous duty triplex pumps {{on the other end}} of the quality spectrum may run for as much as 2,080 hours a year.|$|E
50|$|The {{engines are}} {{commonly}} used on <b>pressure</b> <b>washers.</b> They {{can also be used}} on construction equipment such as soil compactors, generators and air compressors, and various lawn and garden equipment including tillers, edgers, reel mowers and blower/vacs. The engines have also found to work well on go-karts.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>pressure</b> <b>washers</b> nowadays connect to an existing water supply, like a garden hose, but some models store water in an attached tank. Usually {{there is an}} on/off button that controls the water stream and many models allow the user to adjust the water pressure.|$|R
