25|$|In 1789, {{the first}} U.S. Senate adopted rules {{allowing}} senators {{to move the}} <b>previous</b> <b>question</b> (by simple majority vote), which meant ending debate and proceeding to a vote. But in 1806, the Senate's presiding officer, Vice President Aaron Burr argued that the previous-question motion was redundant, had only been exercised once in the preceding four years, and should be eliminated. The Senate agreed and modified its rules. Because it created no alternative mechanism for terminating debate, filibusters became theoretically possible.|$|E
25|$|Passage of the {{legislation}} in the United States House of Representatives using the self-executing rule method was considered, but rejected by House Democrats. Instead, on March 21, 2010, the House {{held a series of}} votes: the first vote on ordering the <b>previous</b> <b>question</b> on the special rule resolution that set the terms of debate, the second on the rule itself, the third on the Senate bill, the fourth on a minority attempt to amend the reconciliation bill itself, and finally a vote on the reconciliation bill itself. The reconciliation bill passed on a vote of 220–211, with all 178 Republicans and 33 Democrats voting against it.|$|E

The bill {{was sent to the}} House, and a vigorous debate ensued on December 23. During the debate, which continued past midnight, Desha appeared {{on the floor of the}} chamber to lobby legislators to support the bill and actually moved the <b>previous</b> <b>question</b> to end debate, which was, in the words of Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison, a [...] "flagrant violation of House rules". The House passed the bill by a vote of 5443, and Desha signed it immediately.|$|E
