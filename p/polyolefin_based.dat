40|$|The {{study of}} the {{rheology}} of <b>polyolefins</b> <b>based</b> on homogenous metallocenic catalyst has been mainly devoted {{to the understanding of}} material process ability. When used at a more advanced and sophisticated level, however, rheology is a useful tool to highlight the details of the polymer microstructure, such as the chemical stereo-regularity or the degree of chain branching. Rheology is also used to study the crystallization kinetics of the polymers and it gives more precise analysis than the conventional techniques like differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) when the crystallization kinetics are slow. When cooled below thermodynamic melting temperature, crystalline polymers undergo crystallization. The early stages of this process are characterized by the gradual change in the mechanical response of the material from the liquid to the solid, which is due to the microstructure evolution of the system. This {{is one of the great}} features of the rheological technique, which distinguishes it from the traditional DSC technique. In the present research work relationships between rheological parameters and molecular structure of syndiotactic polypropylenes (sPP) and poly- 1 butenes of different stereoregularity are explored by performing oscillatory shear experiments using ARES rheometer. The rheological response is found very sensitive to the degree of syndiotacticity of syndiotactic polypropylene, while in the case of poly- 1 butenes, it is also found dependent on the stereoregularity. Crystallization behavior of a series of syndiotactic polypropylenes of different degrees of syndiotacticity is investigated by performing both isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization tests using rheological and differential scanning calorimetric techniques. The aim is to investigate the effect of degree of syndiotacticity on the crystallization behavior of the syndiotactic polypropylene and to couple the rheological methods to more conventional techniques (such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry). Crystallization behavior is found strongly dependent on the degree of syndiotacticity of syndiotactic polypropylene. Good agreement is found between the results obtained by both the rheological and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) methods. The effect of extensional flow on the crystallization kinetics of sPB is examined both in the melt and crystal phase by applying different extensional rates using sentmanat extensional rheometer (SER). Extensional flow is found to enhance the rate of crystallization in the crystal phase, which is further proved by the small angle X-Ray scattering experiment (SAX) ...|$|R

In recent years, packaging industry prefers to use hot melt adhesive based on polyolefin because polyolefin provide ease of processing, low off-taste, low smell and heat seal ability. In this research, it is intended to develop the formulation for Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) based hot melt adhesive with the same properties of <b>polyolefin</b> <b>based</b> hot melt adhesive since EVA offers low cost than polyolefin. To develop new formulation of EVA hot melt adhesive (HMA), EVA copolymers with various melt index were blended together with resin, wax and antioxidant in the molten state. The performance of new formulations was compared with commercial polyolefin hot melt adhesive. Three formulations of EVA hot melt adhesive have been developed. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature and melt viscosity were studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Brookfield Viscometer. From DSC curve, the result indicated that three new formulations and commercial polyolefin has a glass transition temperature between - 20 0 C and - 25 0 C. Implying, the EVA copolymer blend with resin is compatible. The peak observed on the heating curve corresponded to the melting point, Tm. EVA-HMA 1 and EVA-HMA 3 is comparable with commercial polyoelfin based on identical broad peak. The melt viscosity of all EVA HMA formulation and commercial polyolefin HMA decrease with increasing the temperature. Hot melt adhesive with lower viscosity will have more flexibility to flow out, indicating that it has better wetting properties when applied to the substrate. EVA-HMA 3 have the best performance to be made the hot melt adhesive for the packaging industry because of comparable thermal properties and viscosity at desired temperature with commercial polyolefin adhesive.

40|$|PLA {{offers a}} {{competitive}} and CO 2 neutral matrix to commonly used <b>polyolefin</b> polymer <b>based</b> composites. Moreover, {{the use of}} PLA reduces dependency on oil when producing composite materials. However, PLA has a tendency of hydrolytic degradation under melt processing conditions {{in the presence of}} moisture, which remains a challenge when processing PLA reinforced natural fibre composites. Natural fibres such as cellulose fibres are hygroscopic with 6 – 10 wt% moisture content at 50 – 70 % relative humidity conditions. These fibres are sensitive to melt processing conditions and fibre breakage (cutting) also occur during processing. The degradation of PLA, moisture absorption of natural fibres together with fibre cutting and uneven dispersion of fibres in polymer matrix, deteriorates the overall properties of the composite. In the given research paper, bleached softwood kraft pulp (BSKP) reinforced PLA compounds were successfully melt processed using BSKP with relatively high moisture contents. The effect of moist BSKP on the molecular weight of PLA, fibre length and the mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. By using moist never-dried kraft pulp fibres for feeding, the fibre cutting was decreased during the melt compounding. Even though PLA degradation occurred during the melt processing, the final damage to the PLA was moderate and thus did not deteriorate the mechanical properties of the composites. However, comprehensive moisture removal is required during the compounding in order to achieve optimal overall performance of the PLA/BSKP composites. The economic benefit gained from using moist BSKP is that the expensive and time consuming drying process steps of the kraft pulp fibres prior to processing can be minimized...|$|R

The hardness, tensile and dielectric properties of composite specimens prepared by compression molding of the obtained compound, with filler content ranging from 0 to 40 % (w/w), were examined. The tensile strength of the examined composites decreases {{especially in the case}} of high-density poly(ethylene) (HDPE) and poly(propylene) (PP) composites at relatively higher filler content. The modulus of elasticity was improved only for the low-density poly(ethylene) (LDPE) composites, in comparison with unfilled specimens, and this behavior is in agreement with the observed improvement in the hardness values of these composites. Dielectric spectroscopy has been used as a characterization method of the prepared composites. It was found that the addition of newspaper fibers to the polyolefins does not significantly affect the insulating properties of the materials. In conclusion, it seemed that polyolefin/paper fiber composites with acceptable properties can be prepared by the solution/precipitation technique studied in this work.

However, it is now recognised that the traditional technique for printing circuit patterns - optical lithography based on refractive optics (lenses) - cannot continue to sustain such rapid growth. In order to meet future lithographic demands {{there are a number}} of ‘next generation’ techniques under investigation. Of these, the current leading candidate for a successor is Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) lithography is explored in detail in Chapter 1. However, in order for this technology to fulfil the demands of high volume production, there are number of key challenges still to be resolved including the development of photoresists capable of simultaneously fulfilling sensitivity, resolution and line edge roughness (LER) requirements, and the reduction and management of contamination levels on the highly sensitive optical components employed in the systems. Thus, the investigations in this thesis are twofold, firstly the interaction of poly(olefin sulfone) s with EUV radiation and their performance as photoresist materials is examined and secondly, investigations into the use of such materials for studying photoresist derived contamination are performed. The poly(olefin sulfone) s, formed by the reaction of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and an olefin, are introduced in Chapter 1. These materials have been identified as candidate materials for EUV resists using rational design methodologies and are known to be highly susceptible to degradation by radiation however, no studies on their interaction with EUV radiation have been performed to-date. These investigations are described in Chapter 2 where the behaviour of two poly(olefin sulfone) materials under EUV irradiation conditions is studied. Using open frame exposures, the sensitivity of the materials towards degradation is found. The mechanism and products generated by EUV-induced degradation is explored by conducting outgassing and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis. The knowledge gained from studies reported in Chapter 2 is used to design a second generation of comb-architectured materials consisting of a poly(olefin sulfone) backbone and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) arms. The synthesis, characterisation of these materials is reported in Chapter 3. In addition, this chapter explores the sensitivity of the materials towards degradation by EUV radiation and presents the first example of successful EUV patterning of poly(olefin sulfone) materials. Chapter 4 investigates a range of poly(olefin sulfone) materials for studying photoresist derived contamination. The synthesis and characterisation of 11 materials is presented and outgassing and contamination studies are performed for each. The results of this study demonstrated that the amount of contamination deposited on EUV optical surfaces depends on both the molecular weight and the chemical structure of the contaminant. In summary, this project resulted in an understanding of the behaviour of a wide range of <b>poly(olefin</b> sulfone) <b>based</b> materials under EUV irradiation, both as photoresist materials and as materials for studying the contamination of EUV optical components. The knowledge gained may lead to the design of photoresists and optical components capable of meeting the requirements for implementation of EUV lithography...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{recycling}} {{has significantly}} positive {{impacts on the}} environment, economics and society. Using recycled polymer to replace virgins reduces the growing amount of post-consumer polymer wastes, decreases the demand for fossil fuel and creates local jobs. As the most used polymer types, polyolefins certainly have attracted attention of recycling. Mechanical sorting has been pointed out as the preferred route for the recovery of relatively clean and homogeneous plastic waste streams. Whereas washing and compounding technologies for polymer scrap have dramatically improved over the last decade, there is as yet no sorting technology commercially available that is both cheap and effective. Consequently, the amount of recycled post-consumer mixed plastics remains low and the recycled polymer value is even worse. Innovative recycling technologies for post-consumer wastes should be extremely powerful, simple, cost-effective and accurate enough to create high quality products. Magnetic density separation (MDS) is such a technology. Early research showed that MDS {{has the potential to}} turn around the poor image of polyolefin recycling. However substantial research was needed to improve the separation process before high quality secondary polyolefins could be obtained from complex waste mixtures. This thesis starts with the characterization of the main resources of secondary polyolefins to determine the proper input streams for MDS. Concerning the lifetimes and the total consumption of polyolefin applications, household packaging and car components are two interesting streams for MDS. To reach the necessary separation accuracy for gaining high quality secondary PP and PE in one single step, MDS needs to be sensitive to very small differences in the physical properties of the input materials. Therefore, three main aspects influencing the separation process were studied: wettability of polymers, quality of the process liquid and flow turbulence. For this thesis, a new wetting process to eliminate the effect of air bubbles on the apparent polymer density was developed, a simple method to avoid the segregation of the process liquid was provided, and the sources of turbulence were studied and reduced. Based on all of these achievements, two MDS setups were designed and their performance on the post-consumer polyolefins was evaluated. For both setups, over 98 % of the polyolefin waste can be successfully recycled with sufficient separation accuracy: 10 kg/m 3. The output products of the MDS were analysed to assess their quality: composition, rheological and mechanical properties. According to the analyses, the derived products from MDS were high purity PP and PE. Based on the mechanical analyses, the separated household wastes showed good and consistent properties, independently from their origin, which were comparable with neat polymers. A model that simulates the MDS process was constructed {{on the basis of the}} fundamental principle of MDS and the major factors affecting the process. The study concluded that the separation accuracy of MDS in polymer recycling is determined by the flow turbulence and the uneven magnetic field. The combined effect of these two factors indicates that for most of the polymers turbulence is the major cause of an inaccurate separation. Both the experiments and the simulations concluded that MDS can accurately separate <b>polyolefin</b> mixtures <b>based</b> on their density. With such high accuracies in density, polyolefin mixtures can be separated into different polymers according to their type by MDS in a single step.

One strategy to accelerate the mechanical degradation of polyolefin plastics in the environment is to blend them with carbohydrate based polymers. Unfortunately polyolefins are hydrophobic whereas carbohydrates tend to be hydrophilic so the two do not blend without chemical modification of the carbohydrate. In this study high density polyethylene, HDPE and thermoplastic starch, TPS are used as the polymers with deep eutectic solvents, DESs as the modifiers. Both TPS and DESs are biodegradable and the DESs are water miscible and biocompatible ensuring that the composite plastic contains a biodegradable flaw which should enable mechanical and chemical degradation. It is shown that DESs enable facile mixing of the two polymers. The composite has a strength similar to TPS but a ductility greater than either of the two components. The glass transition temperature of the composite plastic shows that they are homogeneously mixed and data suggests that the DESs act as lubricants rather than plasticisers.

40|$|<b>Polyolefin</b> <b>based</b> blends have {{tremendous}} commercial importance {{in view of}} their exceptional properties. In this study the interface of a biphasic polymer blend of PE (polyethylene) and PEO (polyethylene oxide) has been tailored to reduce the interfacial tension between the phases and to render finer morphology. This was accomplished by employing various strategies like addition of maleated PE (PE grafted maleic anhydride), immobilizing PE chains, ex situ, onto MWNTs by covalent grafting, and in situ grafting of PE chains onto MWNTs during melt processing. Multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs) with different surface functional groups have been synthesized either a priori or were facilitated during melt mixing at higher temperature. NH 2 terminated MWNTs were synthesized by grafting ethylene diamine (EDA) onto carboxyl functionalized carbon nanotubes (COOH(MWNTs) and further, was used to reactively couple with maleated PE to immobilize PE chains {{on the surface of}} MWNTs. The covalent coupling of maleated PE with NH 2 terminated MWNTs was also realized in situ in the melt extruder at high temperature. Both NH 2 terminated MWNTs and the in situ formed PE brush on MWNTs during melt mixing, revealed a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of the blend besides remarkably improving the dispersion of the minor phase (PEO) in the blends. Structural properties of the composites were evaluated and the tensile fractured morphology was assessed using scanning electron microscopy...|$|E
40|$|Composites {{based on}} {{resorcinol}} formaldehyde latex (RFL) coated aramid short fiber and a <b>polyolefin</b> <b>based</b> thermoplastic elastomer, namely ethylene octene copolymer (EOC) were prepared by melt mixing technique. The effects of both fiber loading and its length on the mechanical and thermal {{characteristics of the}} composite under natural and sheared conditions were investigated. Both the low strain modulus and Young&# 8217;s modulus were increased {{as a function of}} fiber loading and length. However, thermal stability of the composite was found to enhance with increase in fiber loading and was independent of fiber length. Due to poor interfacial interaction between the fiber and the matrix and the formation of fiber aggregation especially with 6 mm fiber at high loading, the elongation and toughness of the composite were found to decrease drastically. In order to solve this problem, a maleic anhydride adducted polybutadiene (MA-g-PB) was applied on the aramid fiber. The improvements in tensile strength, elongation at break, toughness to stiffness balance and a good quality of fiber dispersion especially with 6 mm short fiber were achieved. These results indicate the potential use of maleic anhydride adducted PB as a multifunctional interface modifying coupling agent for the aramid short fiber reinforced polymers to enhance the mechanical properties as well as fiber dispersion. FTIR analyses of the treated fiber and SEM analyses of the tensile fractured surfaces of the composite strongly support and explain these results...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} use of exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets {{have been}} explored {{in many areas}} of science and engineering due to its unprecedented chemical, physical and mechanical properties. The interest for the use of this kind of graphene has increased in the car industry sector in the last years, {{to take advantage of the}} peculiar properties of this innovative material. As a consequence, among the different use of graphene, we have started to explore its application as active filler for thermoplastic structural adhesives. In particular we are studying the possibility of taking advantage of its electro-magnetic properties in order to melt the adhesive layers used to bond parts made by different materials, by using electromagnetic induction or microwave. In this way, beside the typical advantage of using adhesive as joining technology, the vehicle components can also be easily disassembled with benefits in terms of repairing and recycling at the end-of-life. Although this additional property could be used to melt the adhesive, the addition of fillers in an adhesive matrix lead to an improvement of its mechanical properties. For these reasons in this work we have investigated the changes induced into the mechanical properties of a <b>polyolefin</b> <b>based</b> thermoplastic adhesive, modified with graphene nanoplatelets. Performed Single Lap Joint (SLJ) tests show a significant enhancement of the mechanical properties, in particular the ultimate strength, of the nano-modified adhesive in comparison with those of the pristine adhesive. These obtained results have been also compared with those obtained with the same adhesive modified by addition of ferrite or magnetite particles. Further the joint separation surfaces have been inspected and compared in order to show similarities and differences among the use of the different filler...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} simple, {{scalable}} approach {{to improve the}} interfacial characteristics and, thereby, the performance of commonly used <b>polyolefin</b> <b>based</b> battery separators. The nanoparticle-coated separators are synthesized by first plasma treating the membrane in oxygen to create surface anchoring groups followed by immersion into a dispersion of positively charged SiO 2 nanoparticles. The process leads to nanoparticles electrostatically adsorbed not only onto {{the exterior of the}} surface but also inside the pores of the membrane. The thickness and depth of the coatings can be fine-tuned by controlling the f-potential of the nanoparticles. The membranes show improved wetting to common battery electrolytes such as propylenecarbonate. Cells based on the nanoparticle-coated membranes are operable even in a simple mixture of EC/PC. In contrast, an identical cell based on the pristine, untreated membrane fails to be charged even after addition of a surfactant to improve electrolyte wetting. When evaluated in a Li-ion cell using an EC/PC/DEC/VC electrolyte mixture, the nanoparticle-coated separator retains 92 % of its charge capacity after 100 cycles compared to 80 and 77 % for the plasma only treated and pristine membrane, respectively.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of amine end-functionalised polymers by controlled free radical techniques {{has been investigated}} {{with a focus on}} methods that provide primary amino end-functionalised polystyrene. The aim of these investigations was to provide precursors to block and graft polyolefins and polyesters by interchain coupling reactions. The approaches investigated involved developing strategies for the {{synthesis of}} phthalimido-functional polymers which can be quantitatively deprotected to yield the desired amino-functional polymers. Initially synthesis by atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) was explored. A number of approaches based on &# 969;-functionalisation (end-group substitution) and &# 945;-functionalisation (functional initiator) were examined. A novel ATRP initiator, N-bromomethylphthalimide, provided the most promising results but still had limited applicability because of its low solubility in polymerisation media. The problems encountered with the ATRP approaches prompted an exploration of techniques based on reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) approach. Novel phthalimidomethyl RAFT agents (trithiocabonates, xanthates) were synthesized. The activity and scope of the new RAFT agents was investigated in polymerisations of styrene, n-butyl acrylate, Nisopropylacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone (trithiocarbonate) and vinyl acetate (xanthate). The syntheses of &# 945;-phthalimidomethylpolystyrene were successfully scaled up and hydrazinolysis afforded a range of &# 945;- aminomethylpolystyrenes of low polydispersity and controlled molecular weight. The syntheses of primary amino-functional polymers using the pthalimidofunctional RAFT agents necessitated the development of a convenient method for conversion of trithiocarbonate groups to inert chain ends. Thermolysis proved a most simple and efficient method of achieving this for both polystyrene and poly(n-butyl acrylate). Thermolysis also provided a means of further characterising the mechanism of the RAFT process. A simple and efficient method for amino end-group analysis was developed that involved in-situ derivatisation with trichloroacetyl isocyanate followed by 1 H NMR analysis. The method was shown to be a suitable method for determining a wide range protic end-groups (NH 2, OH, COOH) in synthetic polymers. Finally, metallocene <b>polyolefin</b> <b>based</b> coupling trials largely with controlled amino-functional polystyrene were conducted as an initial investigation into the production of high value added grafted polyolefins (and polyester). The grafting trials were carried out on a small scale with a view to directing future experiments...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} investigation of unconventional methods to enhance polymer properties either by using unique processing methods, such as solid-state deformation, or by using multifunctional additives that can simultaneously provide a number of property enhancements. The three main research areas of this dissertation are self-reinforced glassy thermosets, melt-processeable organic/inorganic thermoplastic elastomers and semi-crystalline thermoplastics with improved ductility due to a unique solid-state process treatment. Various thermosets, including epoxies, are used in systems with fibers or other additives to improve stiffness. However such systems are difficult to process due to increased viscosity. This work investigates a new method to reinforce thermoset materials with low molecular weight (LMW) crystallizable additives. Desoxyanisoin, which is a pre-cursor to a flame-retardant molecule 4, 4 ’-bishydroxydesoxybenzoin that is engineered to promote char, {{is used as a}} LMW organic crystallizable compound. At processing temperatures, desoxyanisoin is miscible with the matrix/epoxy thereby lowering the process viscosity. Upon cooling or reaction, desoxyanisoin phase separates and crystallizes providing unique in-situ reinforced composites. The mechanical and flammability properties of these desoxyanisoin-epoxy thermoset composites are described. Another approach to enhancement of flammability properties is demonstrated by fabricating organic/inorganic thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) based on isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) materials by reactive melt mixing in the presence of peroxides. These <b>polyolefin</b> <b>based</b> thermoplastic elastomers are similar to the dynamically vulcanized elastomer-thermoplastic blends of polyolefins with ethylene-propylene diene copolymer (EPDM). Herein PDMS is used as an EPDM equivalent. Furthermore, not only PDMS is dynamically cross-linked, but there are some cross-links with the amorphous iPP. Varying the content of PDMS allows for design of TPEs {{with a wide range of}} mechanical and physical properties. Lastly, an approach to enhance the toughness and ductility of semi-crystalline polymers by deforming the material in a solid state to a strain-softening regime is described. This treatment imposes changes in the post yield behavior by process of compression and shear in the solid state at low temperature, low pressures and unconfined geometry. Crystal-structure alteration due to orientation and fragmentation of the lamellae during this treatment leads to the enhancement in non-linear ductility. The fundamental principles governing this approach are investigated...|$|E
