40|$|Vaccination {{campaigns against}} A/H 1 N 1 2009 {{pandemic}} influenza virus (A/H 1 N 1 p) began in autumn 2009 in Europe, after {{the declaration of}} the pandemic at a global level. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of individuals vaccinated against A/H 1 N 1 p in Norway who were already infected (asymptomatically or symptomatically) by A/H 1 N 1 p before vaccination, using a mathematical model. A dynamic, mechanistic, mathematical model of A/H 1 N 1 p transmission was developed for the Norwegian population. The model parameters were estimated by calibrating the model-projected number of symptomatic A/H 1 N 1 <b>p</b> <b>cases</b> {{to the number of}} laboratory-confirmed A/H 1 N 1 <b>p</b> <b>cases</b> reported to the surveillance system, accounting for potential under-reporting. It was assumed in the base case that the likelihood of vaccination was independent of infection/disease state. A sensitivity analysis explored the effects of four scenarios in which current or previous symptomatic A/H 1 N 1 p infection would influence the likelihood of being vaccinated. The number of model-projected symptomatic A/H 1 N 1 <b>p</b> <b>cases</b> by week during the epidemic, accounting for under-reporting and timing, closely matched that of the laboratory-confirmed A/H 1 N 1 <b>p</b> <b>cases</b> reported to the surveillance system. The model-projected incidence of symptomatic A/H 1 N 1 p infection was 27 % overall, 55 % in people < 10 years old and 41 % in people 10 - 20 years old. The model-projected percentage of individuals vaccinated against A/H 1 N 1 p who were already infected with A/H 1 N 1 p before being vaccinated was 56 % overall, 62 % in people < 10 years old and 66 % in people 10 - 20 years old. The results were sensitive to assumptions about the independence of vaccination and infection; however, even when current or previous symptomatic A/H 1 N 1 p infection was assumed to reduce the likelihood of vaccination, the estimated percentage of individuals who were infected before vaccination remained at least 32 % in all age groups. This analysis suggests that over half the people vaccinated against A/H 1 N 1 p in Norway during the 2009 pandemic may already have been infected by A/H 1 N 1 p before being vaccinated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the often-studied problem of sorting, for a parallel computer. Given an input array distributed evenly over p processors, {{the task is}} to compute the sorted output array, also distributed over the p processors. Many existing algorithms take the approach of approximately load-balancing the output, leaving each processor with Θ (n) elements. However, in many <b>p</b> <b>cases,</b> approximate load-balancing leads to inefficiencies in both the sorting itself and in further uses of the data after sorting. We provide a deterministic parallel sorting algorithm that uses parallel selection to produce any output distribution exactly, particularly one that is perfectly load-balanced. Furthermore, when using a comparison sort, this algorithm is 1 -optimal in both computation and communication. We provide an empirical study that illustrates the efficiency of exact data splitting, and shows an improvement over two sample sort algorithms.

40|$|Mutations of {{spliceosome}} {{components are}} common in myeloid neoplasms. One of the affected genes, PRPF 8, encodes the most evolutionarily conserved spliceosomal protein. We identified either recurrent somatic PRPF 8 mutations or hemizygous deletions in 15 / 447 and 24 / 450 cases, respectively. 50 % of PRPF 8 mutant and del(17 <b>p)</b> <b>cases</b> were found in AML and conveyed poor prognosis. PRPF 8 defects correlated with increased myeloblasts and ring sideroblasts in cases without SF 3 B 1 mutations. Knockdown of PRPF 8 in K 562 and CD 34 + primary bone marrow cells increased proliferative capacity. Whole RNA deep sequencing of primary cells from patients with PRPF 8 abnormalities demonstrated consistent missplicing defects. In yeast models, homologous mutations introduced into Prp 8 abrogated a block experimentally produced in the second step of the RNA splicing process suggesting that the mutants have defects in proof-reading functions.

40|$|Ab initio {{calculations}} {{with the}} 6 - 31 G** basis set {{are used to}} examine the structure and energetics of H 3 X-HF-HF (X = N, P). Only one minimum is located on the potential energy surface in each case. The fully optimized geometries are quite bent, with O(XFF) equal to about 70 °, and may be described as cyclic, containing two strong H bonds and one much weaker interaction between the terminal subunits. Each trimer is held together by an interaction energy considerably higher than the sum of H-bond energies of the two constituent dimers; three-body terms are - 4. 1 and - 1. 4 kcal/mol for the N and <b>P</b> <b>cases,</b> respectively. The geometries provide additional evidence of cooperativity: addition of the third subunit to a preexisting dimer leads to contraction of the H-bond length and further stretching of the HF bonds. The latter elongations are directly proportional to reductions in the calculated stretching force constants, experimental vibrational frequency shifts, and integrated band intensities...|$|E
40|$|We explore field {{theories}} {{of a single}} p-form with equations of motions of order strictly equal to two and gauge invariance. We give a general method for the classification of such theories which are extensions to the p-forms of the Galileon models for scalars. Our classification scheme allows to compute an upper bound {{on the number of}} different such theories depending on p and on the space-time dimension. We are also able to build a non trivial Galileon like theory for a 3 -form with gauge invariance and an action which is polynomial into the derivatives of the form. This theory has gauge invariant field equations but an action which is not, like a Chern-Simons theory. Hence the recently discovered no-go theorem stating that there are no non trivial gauge invariant vector Galileons (which we are also able here to confirm with our method) does not extend to other odd <b>p</b> <b>cases.</b> Comment: 29 page...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{holographic}} complexity of noncommutative field theories. The four-dimensional N= 4 noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory with Moyal algebra along {{two of the}} spatial directions has a well known holographic dual as a type IIB supergravity theory {{with a stack of}} D 3 branes and non-trivial NS-NS B fields. We start from this example and find that the late time holographic complexity growth rate, based on the "complexity equals action" conjecture, experiences an enhancement when the non-commutativity is turned on. This enhancement saturates a new limit which is exactly 1 / 4 larger than the commutative value. We then attempt to give a quantum mechanics explanation of the enhancement. Finite time behavior of the complexity growth rate is also studied. Inspired by the non-trivial result, we move on to more general setup in string theory where we have a stack of Dp branes and also turn on the B field.

Most of the i(18 <b>p)</b> <b>cases</b> reported {{so far in}} the literature are sporadic due to de novo formation, while familial and mosaic cases are infrequent. It is a rare chromosomal abnormality, occurring once in every 140 000 livebirths, affecting males and females equally.

The small metacentric marker chromosome was confirmed as i(18 p) in the proband by cytogenetic and FISH analysis 47,XX + i(18 p) ]. Cytogenetic investigations in the family members revealed normal chromosome numbers, indicating the case as a de novo event of i(18 p) formation. It could be due to the somewhat advanced maternal age (32 years) and/or expression of recessive genes in the proband, who is the progeny of consanguineous marriage, which could have led to misdivision and nondisjunction of chromosome 18 in meiosis 1, followed by failure in the chromatid separation of 18 p in meiosis II and by inverted duplication...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of extremum estimators {{from the perspective of}} generalization ability (GA) : the ability of a model to predict outcomes in new samples from the same population. By adapting the classical concentration inequalities, we derive upper bounds on the empirical out-of-sample prediction errors {{as a function of the}} in-sample errors, in-sample data size, heaviness in the tails of the error distribution, and model complexity. We show that the error bounds may be used for tuning key estimation hyper-parameters, such as the number of folds K in cross-validation. We also show how K affects the bias-variance trade-off for cross-validation. We demonstrate that the L_ 2 -norm difference between penalized and the corresponding un-penalized regression estimates is directly explained by the GA of the estimates and the GA of empirical moment conditions. Lastly, we prove that all penalized regression estimates are L_ 2 -consistent for both the n ≥ p and the n < <b>p</b> <b>cases.</b> Simulations are used to demonstrate key results.
