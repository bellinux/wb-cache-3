40|$|Green {{water is}} water with {{dissolved}} algae. Dissolved algae in {{water can be}} a nuisance. In this research, dissolved air flotation followed by ultrafiltration was used to separate algae from green water. DAF as a <b>pretreatment</b> <b>before</b> ultrafiltration can prolong membrane’s lifetime and improve its removal performances in the green water treatment process. Chemical agent (coagulant) that used for coagulation in this research is alum and PAC, Pressure used in this operation is 5 - 7 Bar. Coagulation feed’s turbidity os 40 – 60 NTU. Obtained the result that the proper coagulant using daf for green water is PAC. For PAC, the optimum concentration is 25 gr/L, while alum is 50 gr/l.. This research also proved that the DAF <b>pretreatment</b> <b>before</b> ultrafiltration in green water treatment can helped out the works of ultrafiltration membrane...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether heat-shock pretreatment exerted a protective effect against sorbitol-induced apoptotic cell death in K 562, U 937 and HeLa cell lines and whether such protection was associated with a decreased cytochrome c release from mithocondria and a decreased activation of caspase- 9 and - 3. Following heat-shock pretreatment (42 +/- 0. 3 degrees C for 1 hr), these cell lines were exposed to sorbitol for 1 hr. Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA fragmentation, whereas caspase- 9,- 3 activation, cytochrome c release and heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) were assayed by Western Blot. Sorbitol exposure-induced apoptosis in these different cell lines with a marked activation of caspase- 9 and caspase- 3, whereas heat-shock <b>pretreatment</b> <b>before</b> sorbitol exposure, induced expression of HSP 70 and inhibited sorbitol-mediated cytochrome c release and subsequent activation of caspase- 9 and caspase- 3. Similarly, overexpression of HSP 70 in the three cell lines studied prevented caspase- 9 cleavage and activation as well as cell death. Furthermore, we showed that the mRNA expression of iNOS decreased during both the heat-shock treatment and heat-shock <b>pretreatment</b> <b>before</b> sorbitol exposure. By contrast, the expression of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD proteins increased during heat-shock <b>pretreatment</b> <b>before</b> sorbitol exposure. We conclude that, heat-shock pretreatment protects different cell lines against sorbitol-induced apoptosis through a mechanism that is likely to involve SOD family members. (c) 2009 UICC...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to <b>pretreatment</b> <b>before</b> anaerobic digestion {{some researchers have}} suggested substrate pretreatment during the anaerobic digestion process. Secondary thermophilic microaerobic treatment (STMT) during anaerobic digestion helps in reset the digestion process by buffering the pH and increasing the microorganism activity, which provides a secondary increase in biomass degradation. This may be a successful solution to improve the low fermentation efficiency during the later stages of the anaerobic digestion process. The effect of STMT on the anaerobic digestion of corn straw improved the VS removal efficiency and afforded a higher methane yield. Similar to microaerobic <b>pretreatment</b> <b>before</b> the anaerobic digestion process, the oxygen supply in STMT during anaerobic digestion process not only reduces the concentration of toxic metabolites (e.g., ethanol, acetic acid and lactic acid) but also promotes the synthesis of certain lipids required for {{the stability of the}} anaerobe cell membrane (Fu et al. 2015 c) as shown in Table  2.|$|R
