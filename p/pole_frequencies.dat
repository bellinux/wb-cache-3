40|$|It {{has long}} been noted the {{distinct}} periodicities in the electron flux response in the outer belts are associated with solar wind speed periodicities. The well-organized high-speed streams in the solar wind drive the flux, most commonly resulting in 27, 13. 5 and 9 -day peaks in the periodogram during the declining phase of the solar cycle. The distribution of peak power across L-shells is calculated and a connection is made with the P 1 peak in the impulse response function. Next, the periodogram estimates the power spectrum relating weak, diffuse periodicities {{in the number of}} coronal mass ejection occurrences to relativistic electron flux periodicities. Because coronal mass ejections occur preferentially during ascending phases of the solar cycle, this supplements the distinct periodicities from high-speed streams evident during declining phases of the solar cycle. Finally, the successful estimation of exogenous coefficients in an autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model is shown to require excitation at all <b>pole</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the transfer function between the output and the input. Specifically, the solar wind speed should excite all <b>pole</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the electron flux response for complete identification. Additionally, because only the first two autoregressive coefficients are dominant, system identification of eight coefficients in an ARX time series model via the Kalman filter suggests a lower order ARX model, such as the stochastic linear oscillator may be more appropriate...|$|E

40|$|Physically the {{conventional}} beamforming method (CBF) {{is based on}} a decomposition of the incident wave field into plane or spherical elementary waves whose relative phases are interpreted to mean that the directions of incidence and source locations can be identified and classified. A central assumption of the CBF is its application in the acoustic free field. This assumption is particularly invalid in confined spaces such as a vehicle interior, in which to a certain frequency range (below the Schroeder frequency) modal influences dominate the sound field. Under these conditions the CBF only shows a poor localization ability; up to a complete localization failure. However, to apply beamforming under these conditions and in this frequency range, in this thesis two approaches are being pursued in parallel to minimize the room acoustic influences on the Beamforming and thus improve the localization result particularly in a vehicle interior. A first approach is based on the pre-processing of cross-spectral matrix (CSM) using the so-called generalized cross-correlation. A second approach uses “macro modeling” to approximate the <b>pole</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the room transfer functions. Based on the determined <b>pole</b> <b>frequencies</b> an inverse filter is automatically generated, which also applied to the CSM minimizes modal influences before the actual beamforming. Both approaches are as well discussed theoretically as practically examined and evaluated in consecutive steps. For this purpose, based on principle studies on defined reflection surfaces, the behavior of both approaches inside a scale model room are shown, analyzed and evaluated. Subsequently, both approaches are evaluated under the real conditions of the vehicle interior. A digression regarding the combination of beamforming with arbitrary transfer functions for the further development of the beamforming beyond the free field assumption concludes the investigation work. Finally, this thesis is concluded by the chapter “Zusammenfassung und Ausblick”...|$|E

Traditional FIR and IIR design techniques work on a linear frequency scale, which is usually not optimal for audio applications.

However, the direct implementation of warped or Kautz filters is computationally less efficient compared to an IIR filter of the same order. The perceptually motivated frequency resolution can also be achieved by the proposed design method, without the disadvantage of increased computational complexity. The filter design has two phases. First, the <b>pole</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the second-order sections are set to a predefined logarithmic scale, or can be determined from a warped filter design.
