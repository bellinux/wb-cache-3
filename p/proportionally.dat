5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and <b>proportionally</b> longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and <b>proportionally</b> longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{estimates}} that the isle of Chios had <b>proportionally</b> {{the largest number of}} slaves.|$|E
5|$|Corvus brachyrhynchos hesperis – western crow: Western North America except arctic north, Pacific Northwest {{and extreme}} south. Smaller overall with a <b>proportionally</b> more slender bill and {{low-pitched}} voice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Proportionally,</b> {{the skull}} is much shorter and {{smaller than that}} of Edmontosaurus (formerly Trachodon), Kritosaurus, or Saurolophus, but when {{including}} its crest, its superficial area is almost as large.|$|E
5|$|Between 1940 and 2005, the {{population}} of Juniata County was <b>proportionally</b> the third fastest-growing population of any county in Pennsylvania, with only Snyder County's and Perry County's populations growing faster. In this time period, the county's population has increased by 50.69%, or 7,792 people. In the 1980s, the county's rate of population growth was more than 50 {{times higher than the}} rate of population growth in Pennsylvania. The county's rate of population growth in the 1970s was even higher.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{belongs in}} the {{subfamily}} Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae, along with Tarbosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known– with the exception of Alioramus– for their robust build with <b>proportionally</b> larger skulls and longer femora than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus macropus, {{described}} by Swainson in 1837, is the Australian peregrine falcon. It {{is found in}} Australia in all regions except the southwest. It is non-migratory. It is similar to brookei in appearance, but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black. The feet are <b>proportionally</b> large.|$|E
5|$|M. l. leucopterus is {{restricted}} to Dirk Hartog Island, off the western coast of Australia, and nuptial males display black-and-white plumage. This subspecies is {{the smallest of the}} three and bears a <b>proportionally</b> longer tail. It was collected again in 1916 by Tom Carter, 98years after de Freycinet's expedition collected the type specimen.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became <b>proportionally</b> smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full feathered coat in relatively large dromaeosaurs. Additionally, the animal displays <b>proportionally</b> large, aerodynamic wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurs. Dakotaraptor is an even larger dromaeosaur species with evidence of feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill knobs.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus is {{classified}} as a theropod in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. Other members include Tyrannosaurus and the earlier Daspletosaurus, both from North America, and possibly the Mongolian genus Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known for their robust build with <b>proportionally</b> larger skulls and longer femurs than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Deinocheirus was reconstructed through CT scans and {{presented}} at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the cerebrum was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The brain was <b>proportionally</b> small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have <b>proportionally</b> large brains, and the small brain of Deinocheirus may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance {{would not have been}} as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone microstructure study {{presented at the}} 13th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists in 2015 showed that Deinocheirus probably had a high metabolic rate, and grew rapidly before reaching sexual maturity.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were <b>proportionally</b> {{shorter than}} in any other large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. The forearm was only a quarter the size of the upper arm. There were no carpalia in the hand, so that the metacarpals articulated directly with the forearm. The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like metacarpal that may have represented an external 'spur'. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. Carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having <b>proportionally</b> shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today's emus and kiwis, which also have vestigial forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The cortex is <b>proportionally</b> larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
5|$|The {{long black}} and white tail fin can be up {{to a third of}} body length. Several {{hypotheses}} attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are <b>proportionally</b> the longest fins of any cetacean. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.|$|E
5|$|The scoring for {{the home}} version is <b>proportionally</b> {{identical}} to the original except that each item is worth 1/10th its arcade value, with the bonus Vitamins as the only variation, being worth 100 points, which is the equivalent of the 1000 point scoring melon bonus item that appears in the 7th and 8th levels of the arcade game. Unlike the arcade version, if Pac-Man loses a life while the vitamin appears, the vitamin may not necessarily be forfeited.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of {{locomotion}} is hopping, {{with both}} feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. However, birds may run when performing the rodent-run display. Its balance is assisted by a <b>proportionally</b> large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.|$|E
5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large-population states. Those who argue that the College favors low-population states point out that such states have <b>proportionally</b> more electoral votes {{relative}} to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (<b>proportionally</b> allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, regardless of what state they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.|$|E
5|$|They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being {{consistently}} {{smaller than}} males. The size difference {{between males and}} females is <b>proportionally</b> greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females, enabling gender to be told from tracks.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were <b>proportionally</b> short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were <b>proportionally</b> more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases <b>proportionally</b> by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, a {{relatively}} large amount of juvenile material is known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have <b>proportionally</b> shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was <b>proportionally</b> small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In most media appearances, pterosaurs {{are most}} often {{depicted}} as piscivores, a behaviour only a few groups actually had in reality. They are also often shown as aerial predators similar to birds of prey, grasping human victims with their taloned feet. No pterosaur species known so far possesses prehensile feet; all known pterosaurs have flat, plantigrade feet with no opposable toes, often poorly muscled and, {{in the case of}} pteranodontians, generally <b>proportionally</b> small. However, some pterosaurs might have had raptorial tendencies; Thalassodromeus possesses powerful jaws akin to those of phorusrhacids, and Hatzegopteryxs short neck and more powerful jaws have been interpreted as a speciation on larger prey.|$|E
5|$|Ownby {{confirms}} {{estimates that}} Falun Gong is practiced {{by hundreds of}} thousands of people outside China, with the largest communities found in Taiwan and in North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, and Toronto. Demographic surveys by sociologist Susan Palmer and David Ownby in North American communities found that 90% of practitioners were ethnic Chinese (in Europe, there are <b>proportionally</b> more Caucasians). The average age was approximately 42. Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master's degrees, and 24% had a bachelor's degree.|$|E
5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have <b>proportionally</b> shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of {{intelligence}} {{that may or may not}} be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E
5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a party with {{a high number of}} votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is <b>proportionally</b> less than its share of votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were robustly {{built and}} <b>proportionally</b> long, {{measuring}} 70% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. The radius of the forearm measured 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for grasping. The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the thumb). The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of seats in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties <b>proportionally</b> {{to the number of}} votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E
5|$|There are fifteen Scottish {{universities}}, some {{of which}} are amongst the oldest in the world. These include the University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow, the University of Aberdeen and the University of Edinburgh—many of which are ranked amongst the best in the UK. <b>Proportionally,</b> Scotland had more universities in QS' World University Rankings' top 100 in 2012 than any other nation. The country produces 1% of the world's published research with less than 0.1% of the world's population, and higher education institutions account for 9% of Scotland's service sector exports. Scotland's University Courts are the only bodies in Scotland authorised to award degrees.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands <b>proportionally</b> with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
5|$|To the south, {{the ward}} of Barton {{is the third}} most densely {{populated}} in Salford with little population change between 1991and2001. It has <b>proportionally</b> more over-85-year-olds than {{the city as a}} whole, with low adult and primary school education standards, but significant improvements in GCSE results of late. Some parts of Barton are amongst the worst20% of areas in the country for child poverty, with below-city-average childcare provision. Unemployment is higher than average for Salford. Almost half the homes in the ward are terraced housing, with an extra 300 properties built between 1994and2004.|$|E
5|$|Until the 21st century, Istiodactylus was {{the only}} known {{pterosaur}} of its kind, and was placed in its own family, Istiodactylidae, within the group Ornithocheiroidea. Istiodactylus differed from other istiodactylids by having a <b>proportionally</b> shorter skull. The distinctive teeth of Istiodactylus indicate {{that it was a}} scavenger that may have used its teeth to sever morsels from large carcasses {{in the manner of a}} cookie cutter. The wings of Istiodactylus may have been adapted for soaring, which would have helped it find carcasses before terrestrial carnivores. Istiodactylus is known from the Wessex Formation and the younger Vectis Formation, which represent river and coastal environments that were shared with various pterosaurs, dinosaurs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|With no {{government}} subsidy (s=0) the resulting equilibrium {{will be the}} standard Cournot outcome, {{as shown in the}} graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however has the effect of shifting the domestic firm's best response function to the right. Because its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not <b>proportionally</b> (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with <b>proportionally</b> larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
