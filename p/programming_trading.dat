In the broadest sense, anyone who uses technical tools in finance {{could be called}} a financial engineer, for example any computer programmer in a bank or any statistician in a government economic bureau. However, most practitioners restrict the term to someone educated in {{the full range of}} tools of modern finance and whose work is informed by financial theory. It is sometimes restricted even further, to cover only those originating new financial products and strategies. Financial engineering {{plays a key role in}} the customer-driven derivatives business which encompasses quantitative modelling and <b>programming,</b> <b>trading</b> and risk managing derivative products in compliance with the regulations and Basel capital/liquidity requirements.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} how buy {{and sell}} trading rules are generated using gene expression programming with special setup. Market concepts are presented and market analysis is discussed with emphasis on technical analysis and quantitative methods. The use of genetic algorithms in deriving trading rules is presented. Gene expression programming is applied in a form where multiple types of operators and operands are used. This gives birth to multiple gene contexts and references between genes {{in order to keep}} the linear structure of the gene expression programming chromosome. The setup of multiple gene contexts is presented. The case study shows how to use the proposed gene setup to derive trading rules encoded by Boolean expressions, using a dataset with the reference exchange rates between the Euro and the Romanian leu. The conclusions highlight the positive results obtained in deriving useful trading rules. Gene Expression <b>Programming,</b> <b>Trading</b> Rules, Genetic Algorithms, Exchange Rate...|$|E

So programmed trading system can help investors to capture the law of profit and control the risk and position management plays an important role. In addition, using programmed trading system can help traders in the actual operation before using historical data to test operation method, can effectively {{reduce the cost of}} trial and error. This paper, by using Dalian corn futures price data as the research object, first elaborated the futures price and the reason for choosing grey model, secondly to grey GM (1, 1) model of the introduction and model are discussed, and thus constitute the futures price gray forecasting model, and using this model, the futures price reasonable prediction. Then using Dalian corn futures price data set up GM (1, 1) model, and applied the grey system tool analysis and model test, to predict the futures price. So it can be concluded that the grey system could be a forecasting model of the futures price...|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{liquidation}} {{problem with}} transaction costs, {{which includes a}} positive fixed cost, and market impact costs, is studied in this paper as a constrained stochastic optimal control problem. We assume that trading is instantaneous and {{the dynamics of the}} stock to be liquidated follows a geometric Brownian motion. The solution to the impulse control problem is computed at each time step by solving a linear partial differential equation and a maximization problem. In contrast to results obtained from the static formulation of Almgren and Chriss [J. Risk, 2000, 3, 5 - 39], when risk is not considered, the optimal liquidation strategy from our stochastic control formulation depends on temporary market impact cost and permanent market impact cost parameters. In addition, our computational results indicate the following properties of the optimal execution strategy from the stochastic control formulation. Due to the existence of a no-transaction region, it may not be optimal for some individuals to sell their assets on some trading dates. As the value of the permanent market impact parameter increases, the expected optimal amount liquidated at the terminal time increases. As the value of the quadratic temporary impact cost parameter increases, the expected optimal amount liquidated at trading times tends to be uniform, and the no-transaction region shrinks. In the presence of quadratic temporary market impact costs, in contrast to optimal strategies that result from fixed and/or proportional transaction costs alone, portfolios in the selling region are neither re-balanced into the no-transaction region nor into the sell and no-transaction interface.

5000|$|A popular {{explanation}} for the 1987 crash was selling by program traders, most notably {{as a reaction to}} the computerized selling required by portfolio insurance hedges. [...] However, economist Dean Furbush points out that the biggest price drops occurred when trading volume was light. In <b>program</b> <b>trading,</b> computers perform rapid stock executions based on external inputs, such as the price of related securities. Common strategies implemented by <b>program</b> <b>trading</b> involve an attempt to engage in arbitrage and portfolio insurance strategies.As computer technology became more available, the use of <b>program</b> <b>trading</b> grew dramatically within Wall Street firms. After the crash, many blamed <b>program</b> <b>trading</b> strategies for blindly selling stocks as markets fell, exacerbating the decline.

40|$|<b>Program</b> <b>trading</b> and intraday {{changes in}} the S&P 500 Index are correlated. Future prices and, to a lesser extent, cash prices lead <b>program</b> <b>trades.</b> Index {{arbitrage}} trades are followed by an immediate change in the cash index, which ultimately reverses slightly. No reversal follows nonarbitrage trades. The cumulative index changes associated with buy-and-sell trades and with arbitrage and nonarbitrage trades all are similar. Price decompositions suggest that the results are not due to microstructure effects. <b>Program</b> <b>trades</b> in this 1989 - 1990 sample {{do not seem to}} have created major short-term liquidity problems. The results are stable within the sample.

There are essentially two reasons to use <b>program</b> <b>trading,</b> either because of the desire to trade a large number of stocks at the same time (for example, when a mutual fund receives an influx of money it will use that money to increase its holdings in the multiple stocks which the fund is based on), or alternatively to arbitrage temporary price discrepancies between related financial instruments, such as between an index and its constituent parts.|$|R
