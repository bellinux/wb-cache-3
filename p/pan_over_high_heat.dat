5000|$|Since the {{mushrooms}} hold {{a lot of}} water, they are often prepared using a [...] "dry sauté" [...] method: after cleaning, {{the mushrooms}} are sliced {{and put in a}} covered <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> with no oil or butter. The mushrooms then release much of their water, which can be allowed to boil off or be poured off and used as a stock. Many people often cook the mushrooms with butter because it [...] "sweetens" [...] them.|$|E
5000|$|Sautéing ( [...] or , {{from the}} French sauté , lit.

50|$|One {{traditional}} {{recipe for}} cranachan is 3 oz pinhead oatmeal, 1/2 imppt ml double (or whipping) cream, and 2 tablespoons (35 ml) of whisky. The oatmeal should be toasted in a <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> a <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> then dust should be sifted out. The oatmeal is soaked in whisky overnight {{and then added}} to the whipped cream, {{with a little more}} whisky added to the mixture. Some raspberries are placed {{in the bottom of the}} serving glass before adding the cream mixture. An option is to break up some of the raspberries and gently blend into the mixture. The volume of whisky used may be adjusted to personal taste.|$|R
50|$|Different {{cultures}} and language {{tend to have}} their own unique ways of cooking and each of them has different terminologies which often come from historical necessities. Traditional cooking methods in Malay cuisine are quite similar to life in Malay villages, slow and laidback as most authentic Malay delicacies cooked on low heat for a long time as compared to Chinese food. There are numerous methods of cooking terminologies that are used in Malay cooking that consist of dry and moist methods. Tumis (use a small amount of oil or fat in a shallow <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> relatively <b>high</b> <b>heat),</b> salai (smoked or grilled food on the fire such as dried fish and the ingredients are usually cut into pieces or thinly sliced to facilitate fast cooking), sangai (method of cooking whereby food mainly dries spices are frying without oil), layur (warm over low heat to dry) are examples of terminologies for dry-heat cooking methods. On the other hand, moist-heat cooking method includes terms such as tanak (cooking in a pot especially rice), jerang (boiling or simmering normally used of liquids), celur (blanching or dipping something such as vegetable into the hot water) and reneh (simmering or boiling food).|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{preparation is}} to roast or grill the whole pieces of fish <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat.</b> Finnan haddie is also often served poached in milk {{for breakfast and}} {{is an important part}} of traditional kedgeree and the Arnold Bennett omelette.|$|R
25|$|British usage, barbecuing {{refers to}} a fast cooking process done {{directly}} <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat,</b> while grilling refers to cooking under a source of direct, moderate-to-high heat—known in the United States as broiling. In American English usage, grilling {{refers to a}} fast process <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat or hot smoke, similar to some forms of roasting. In a typical U.S. home grill, food is cooked on a grate directly over hot charcoal, while in a U.S. barbecue the coals are dispersed to the sides or at a significant distance from the grate. Its South American versions are the southern Brazilian churrasco and the Argentine asado.|$|R
50|$|Hanger steak resembles {{flank steak}} in texture and flavor. It is a vaguely V-shaped pair of muscles with a long, {{inedible}} membrane {{running down the}} middle. The hanger steak is usually the most tender cut on an animal, and is best marinated and cooked quickly <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> (grilled or broiled) and served rare or medium rare to avoid toughness.|$|R
5000|$|Tonkotsu (豚骨, [...] "pork bone"; {{not to be}} {{confused}} with tonkatsu) soup usually has a cloudy white colored broth.It is similar to the Chinese baitang (白湯) and has a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> for many hours, which suffuses the broth with a hearty pork flavor and a creamy consistency that rivals milk, melted butter or gravy (depending on the shop).|$|R
50|$|Since Andong jjimdak {{is cooked}} <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat,</b> it has less fat and can have various tastes by adding diverse {{ingredients}} according to recipe. It is popular among students and blue-collar workers {{due to the}} abundant portions compared to the price (generally around 20,000 won). Andong jjimdak is also considered a nutritious dish due to the high protein content from the chicken, and various vitamins provided by the vegetables in the dish.|$|R
50|$|The liquid extract, {{made after}} around {{six months of}} {{fermentation}} of myeolchi-jeot, is filtered and boiled {{to be used in}} kimchi. Alternatively, two parts myeolchi-jeot can be mixed with one part water, boiled <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat,</b> filtered, let set, and the upper, clear layer is used in kimchi. The boiled and filtered myeolchi-jeot liquid may also used to flavor seaweed dishes. Myeolchi-jeot made with boned anchovies are seasoned and eaten as banchan (side dish).|$|R

2500|$|To impart wok hei the {{traditional}} way, {{the food is}} cooked in a seasoned wok <b>over</b> a <b>high</b> flame while being stirred and tossed quickly. The distinct taste of wok hei is partially imbued into the metal of the wok itself from former cooking sessions and brought out again when cooking <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat.</b> In practical terms, the flavour imparted by chemical compounds results from caramelization, Maillard reactions, and the partial combustion of oil that come from charring and searing of the food at very <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> in excess of [...] Aside from flavour, wok hei also manifests itself in the texture and smell of the cooked items.|$|R
50|$|In Texas, {{the local}} {{barbecue}} is often entirely {{made up of}} beef brisket or large rib racks, where the meat is seasoned with a spice rub and cooked over coals of mesquite, and in other portions of the state they smoke their meat and peppery sausages <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> using pecan, apple, and oak and served it with a side of pickled vegetables, a legacy of German and Czech settlers of the late 1800s. California is home to Santa Maria-style barbecue, where the spices involved generally are black pepper, paprika, and garlic salt, and grilled over the coals of coast live oak.|$|R
50|$|Game meats fit nicely {{into the}} popular lighter culinary style of today. As {{naturally}} lean meats, they are ideally suited for cooking quickly <b>over</b> the <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> of a grill or wok, stir-fried or roasted {{and served with}} a light sauce, salad and vegetables.|$|R
50|$|Typically in grilling, {{the food}} will be seared <b>over</b> very <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> {{and then moved}} to a lower-temperature area of the grill to finish cooking. In braising, the seared surface acts to flavor, color and {{otherwise}} enrich the liquid in which the food is being cooked.|$|R
5000|$|A balti, or bāltī gosht ( [...] , बाल्टी गोश्त) {{is a type}} of curry {{served in}} a thin, pressed-steel wok called a [...] "balti bowl". It is served in {{restaurants}} throughout the United Kingdom. The name may have come from the metal dish in which the curry is cooked, rather than from any specific ingredient or cooking technique. Balti curries are cooked quickly using vegetable oil rather than ghee, <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> {{in the manner of a}} stir-fry, and any meat is used off the bone. This combination differs sharply from a traditional one-pot Indian curry which is simmered slowly all day. Balti sauce is based on garlic and onions, with turmeric and garam masala among other spices.|$|R
2500|$|Pit-beef {{prevails}} in Maryland {{and is often}} enjoyed at large outdoor [...] "bull roasts", which are commonly fundraising events for clubs and associations. Maryland-style pit-beef is not the product of barbecue cookery in the strictest sense; the meat is not smoked but grilled <b>over</b> a <b>high</b> <b>heat.</b> The meat is typically served rare with a strong horseradish sauce as the preferred condiment.|$|R
50|$|The round {{shape of}} the grill allows two or more chefs to cook food simultaneously, and to cook quickly due to the thinly sliced ingredients, so the food is {{typically}} cooked in one revolution of the grill.

50|$|Another {{version of}} the classic Marseille bouillabaisse, {{presented}} in the Petit LaRousse de la Cuisine, uses congre, dorade, grondin, lotte, merlan, rascasse, saint-pierre, and velvet crabs (étrilles), and includes leeks. In this version, the heads and trimmings of the fish are put together with onions, celery and garlic browned in olive oil, and covered with boiling water for twenty minutes. Then the vegetables and bouquet garni are added, and then the pieces of fish in a specific order; first the rascasse, then the grondin, the lotte, congre, dorade, etrilles, and saffran. The dish is cooked for eight minutes <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat.</b> Then the most delicate fish, the saint pierre and merlan, are added, and the dish is cooked another 5-8 minutes. The broth is then served over bread with the rouille on top, and the fish and crabs are served on a large platter.|$|R
5000|$|In Vietnamese cuisine, it {{is called}} cơm cháy (literally [...] "scorched rice"). It is {{typically}} fried in oil until golden brown, then topped with chà bông (pork floss) or tôm khô (dried shrimp), mỡ hành (chopped scallions cooked by pouring boiling oil over them to release their aroma), and chili paste to produce a popular dish called cơm cháy chà bông or cơm cháy tôm khô (although both the pork and shrimp may be used, {{in which case the}} dish is called cơm cháy chà bông tôm khô or cơm cháy tôm khô chà bông). Cơm cháy may be made from the crust of rice left over from cooking rice in an iron pot, or, more commonly since the advent of electric rice cookers in the late 20th century, from leftover rice that is fried in oil <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> to acquire a crispy texture.|$|R
5000|$|To {{make the}} dish, the broth is {{prepared}} first by boiling a cleaned chopped chicken, whole garlic, onions, ginger and {{a type of}} fresh green chili pepper called [...] "Cheongyang gochu" [...] (청양고추) altogether in a pot. The pepper {{is famous for its}} extreme spiciness and {{plays an important role in}} tasting the dish. Cellophane noodles are soaked in water. The cooked chicken is simmered with a sauce made from ganjang, mullyeot (물엿, syrup-like condiment), sugar, and pepper in the broth. Slices of shiitake, and diced carrots, potatoes, and other vegetables are added in the pot and boiled <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> for ten minutes. Whilst the carrots and potatoes are almost getting cooked, a little amount of wheat flour and spinach, sliced cucumber, scallions and the noodles are added to the pot as well. After cooking, the dish is put on a plate and sesame seeds are spread over it.|$|R
5000|$|Foods termed [...] "grilled" [...] may {{actually}} be prepared on a hot griddle or flat pan. The griddle or pan may be prepared with oil (or butter), and the food is cooked quickly <b>over</b> a <b>high</b> <b>heat.</b> Griddle-grilling is best for relatively greasy foods such as sausages. Some griddle-grilled foods may have grill marks applied to them during the cooking process with a branding plate, to mimic the appearance of charbroil-cooked food.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{produces}} {{high temperatures}} under full application and thus causes a high temperature {{variation in the}} engine bay from no operation to normal and full operation.

40|$|Usually waders (Aves, Charadrii) feed in the {{inter-tidal zone}} over the low tide period and roost <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide. But {{occasionally}} when their energetic needs increase, due to {{adverse weather conditions}} or to a need to store fat to fuel migration, the birds also feed during high tide, sometimes in agricultural land. At the Ria de Aveiro, about 44 % (corresponding to 4500 birds) of the wintering dunlin (Calidris alpina) use artificial salt pan habitats throughout the winter whilst the others utilize natural intertidal habitats, mainly mudflats. The dunlin that feed intertidally in natural areas, such as the Canal de Mira, do not feed <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide. In contrast, the birds that use the salt pan area feed both during low tide, in abandoned salt pans whose walls are breached and thus allow access to the tide, and high tide, in active salt pans, and keep on doing so throughout the winter. The energetic needs of both groups of birds {{are thought to be}} similar. However, the benthos of the abandoned salt pans seem to be different, and poorer in energetic terms, from those of the natural mudflats. It is argued that dunlin wintering in the salt pan area must compensate for this by feeding <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide in active salt pans. Rather than just being a means of obtaining more energy at certain times of high energy demand, it would seem that feeding in active salt <b>pans</b> <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide should be considered as a normal component of the feeding strategy of these birds, a strategy that is different from those wintering in the natural mudflats. These findings highlight the importance of the salt exploitation industry to waders and also show that artificial habitats can support large numbers of wintering waders...|$|R
5000|$|Chorchori: Usually a {{vegetable}} dish {{with one or}} more varieties of vegetables cut into longish strips, sometimes with the stalks of leafy greens added, all lightly seasoned with spices like mustard or poppy seeds and flavoured with a pouron. Sometimes a chochchori may have small shrimp. The skin and bones of large fish like bhetki or chitol can be made into a chochchori called kata-chochchori (kata meaning fish-bone). The stir frying process and the lightness of a chochhori is not unlike that of chop suey, which is a term for assorted pieces, and this shows the influence of the Chinese in Bengali household cooking. The chochhori would be generally an assortment of vegetable and fish bones and other things that would have been rather thrown away, fried in a korai,(a slightly rounded wok), <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> at first, and then simmered to let the vegetables cook down to being just done, and then taken off the flame immediately to stop cooking. The cooking procedure adds to the confirmation of the entrance of Chinese style of cooking into Kolkata during the mid-1800s, prior to which this particular dish was not very popular in Bengali cuisine.|$|R
50|$|Sautéed {{mushrooms}} is {{a common}} dish prepared by the sautéing of sliced or whole edible mushrooms. Butter is typically used when sautéing the dish, and margarine and cooking oils such as olive oil and canola oil are also used. Clarified butter can be used, as can a mixture of oil and butter. The dish is typically cooked for <b>over</b> a <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> until the mushrooms are browned, with the oil or butter being very hot in a pan before the mushrooms are added. Overcooking may create an inferior dish by the causing the mushrooms to lose moisture and becoming shriveled.|$|R
50|$|To make bap, rice is {{scrubbed}} {{in water}} and rinsed several times. This process produces tteumul (water from the last washing of rice). It is then soaked for thirty minutes before boiling, which helps the grains cook evenly. With unpolished brown rice and bigger grains such as Job's tears, {{it is necessary to}} soak the grains for several hours to overnight to avoid under-cooking. The grains are then cooked. In a regular heavy bottomed pot, rice can be cooked <b>over</b> medium <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> with the lid on for about ten minutes, stirred, and then left to simmer on low heat for additional five to ten minutes.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{made from}} flat rice noodles (...) or kway teow (...) of {{approximately}} 1 cm or (in the north of Malaysia) about 0.5 cm in width, stir-fried <b>over</b> very <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> with light and dark soy sauce, chilli, a small quantity of belachan, whole prawns, deshelled blood cockles, bean sprouts and chopped Chinese chives. The dish is commonly stir-fried with egg, slices of Chinese sausage, fishcake, beansprouts, and less commonly with other ingredients.Char kway teow is traditionally stir-fried in pork fat, with crisp croutons of pork lard. In Penang, Char kway teow is commonly served {{on a piece of}} banana leaf on a plate, so as to enhance the aroma on the noodles.|$|R
50|$|It {{takes about}} five hours to cook the whole dish. Slits {{are made in the}} top of the inner bones with a sharp knife before the ribs are cut to make the flesh {{separate}} easily from the prepared beef rib. The ribs are chopped into pieces of a 5-6 cm length, and a whole radish is inserted into a pot with water <b>over</b> a <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> at first. As time goes by, the heat is lowered to a medium temperature. Once the beef becomes soft after being simmered for about four to five hours, the radish is taken out of the pot. It is flatly sliced into a 3 cm length. The ribs are also taken out of the pot and seasoned with minced scallions, garlic, and pepper powder, sesame oil, a mixture of sesame and salt, and soy sauce. As the soup is chilled, fat floating on the surface is removed. The seasoned ribs and sliced radish are again put into the pot and are simmered one more time.|$|R
5000|$|If {{it is not}} pre-seasoned, a new {{cast iron}} skillet or dutch oven {{typically}} comes from the manufacturer with a protective coating of wax or shellac, otherwise it would rust. This needs to be removed before the item is used. An initial scouring with hot soapy water will usually remove the protective coating. Alternatively, for woks, {{it is common to}} burn off the coating <b>over</b> <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> (outside or under a vent hood) to expose the bare metal surface. For already-used pans that are to be re-seasoned, the cleaning process can be more complex, involving rust removal and deep cleaning (with strong soap or lye, or by burning in a campfire or self-cleaning oven to remove existing seasoning and build-up.Once the pan has been heated, dried, and thinly layered with oil or fat, it is placed in an oven, grill, or other heating enclosure for the oil to be polymerized onto the metal's surface. The process of polymerization is dependent on the oil, temperature of the enclosure, and the duration. The precise details of the seasoning process differ from one source to another, and there is much disagreement regarding the correct oil to use. There is also no clear consensus about the best temperature and duration. Lodge Manufacturing uses a proprietary soybean blend in their base coats as stated on their website. Others use lard, or animal fats. Some advocate the use of food-grade flaxseed oil (a drying oil). The temperature recommended for seasoning varies from high temperatures above [...] to temperatures below [...] Some say that a temperature around the smoke point of the oil or fat should be targeted since this will allow vaporization of the lighter hydrocarbons from the oil, leaving behind heavier molecules for optimal polymerization and carbonization to occur. And, there is also no consensus on the correct duration of heating: from half an hour to an hour is often recommended.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a description of}} marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and oceanic boundary layer(OBL) interactions at the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence. Although this region is {{known as one of}} the most energetic zones of the World Ocean, very few studies have addressed the mechanisms of OA interaction there. Based upon novel, direct in situ simultaneous OA observations, our results show that the OBL-MABL exchanges are closely correlated with the sea surface temperature (SST) field. The heat fluxes range from 110 W. m 2 over warm waters down to 18 W. m 2 <b>over</b> cold waters. <b>Higher</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes and air-sea temperature differences are associated with stronger near-surface winds. This suggests that the MABL is modulated at the synoptic temporal and spatial scale by the strong surface thermal gradients between the (warm) Brazil and the (cold) Malvinas (Falklands) currents...|$|R
