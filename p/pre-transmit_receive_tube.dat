In internally threaded jewelry, the bead has a <b>receiving</b> <b>tube</b> machined into it (this is referred to as [...] "countersunk"), with a threaded post extending from the center, which mates with the threaded <b>receiving</b> <b>tube</b> on the bar. Being much less likely to cause damage and irritation, especially at the time of piercing, internally threaded jewelry is considered superior to externally threaded jewelry. It is usually slightly more expensive than externally threaded jewelry, due to the extra machining and labor involved.|$|R

Methods: Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were divided into 4 groups: (1) control mice fed ad libitum (Control); (2) tumor-bearing mice fed ad libitum (TB); (3) control mice <b>receiving</b> <b>tube</b> feeding (CTF); and (4) tumor-bearing mice <b>receiving</b> <b>tube</b> feeding (TBTF).

To {{compare the}} results of intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) reduction by 3 treatment modalities, (a) glaucoma tube implants, (b) noncontact YAG laser cyclophotocoagulation (cycloYAG), and (c) contact transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation (cyclodiode), in cases of advanced glaucoma refractory to alternative treatments. Methods. A consecutive group of 45 eyes that received cycloYAG were matched against two control groups of patients who had <b>received</b> <b>tube</b> surgery or cyclodiode, each control group having been derived from a database of patients. Results. Mean pretreatment IOP improved from 41. 3, 38. 6, and 32. 0 mmHg for the tube, cycloYAG, and cyclodiode groups, respectively, to 16. 4, 22. 1, and 19. 3 [*]mmHg, respectively.

Visual acuity deteriorated 2 or more Snellen lines in 16 %, 7 %, and 9 % of the patients in the tube, cycloYAG, and cyclodiode groups, respectively. Complications included retinal detachment, hypotony, and phthisis. Conclusions. All 3 methods provided acceptable IOP lowering in the short and medium term. Control of IOP was best in patients <b>receiving</b> <b>tube</b> surgery. Cyclodiode and cycloYAG treatments were similarly effective in lowering IOP.

40|$|Feeding {{disorders}} {{are common in}} disabled children, and family reactions are critical factors influencing the severity and course of this problem. This study hypothesized that feeding disorders in disabled children would be significantly more stressful to parents than other childhood disabilities; that pediatric feeding disorders would be more stressful in single parent families than two parent families; and that childhood feeding disorders would be less stressful to fathers than to mothers. Two copies each of the Friedrich Questionnaire on Resources and Stress (QRS-F) and a demographic data survey were sent to 79 families of disabled children. Responses were received from 47 subjects representing 31 households. Analysis of Variance of the QRS-F scores indicated significantly greater stress levels in families of disabled children who <b>received</b> <b>tube</b> feedings, but not in families whose disabled children required special assistance with oral feeding. There was an inadequate number of responses from single parent families to statistically compare their stress levels to two parent families with feeding disordered children. The comparison of fathers and mothers of disabled children with feeding disorders did not yield {{a statistically significant difference}} in stress levels. The greater stress levels found in parents of disabled children who <b>received</b> <b>tube</b> feedings shows a need to provide improved education and training programs, as well as support after hospital discharge, to families with tube fed children.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recurrent and {{persistent}} otitis media is often treated by tympanostomy tube insertion to ventilate {{the middle ear}} and restore hearing. This study examined the factors that predict which children {{are most likely to}} <b>receive</b> tympanostomy <b>tubes</b> through 3 years of age. METHODS: Multiple logistic regression was conducted on data from a nationally representative sample of children (N = 8285). RESULTS: By 3 years of age, 6. 8 % of US children had tubes inserted. Logistic regression indicated that after control for number of ear infections, children without any gaps in health insurance, who attended a day-care center, who were White, whose birth-weight was less than 1500 g, and who lived in the Midwest or South {{were significantly more likely to}} have tympanostomy tubes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that differences exist as to who <b>receives</b> <b>tubes.</b> Of particular concern are differences by race/ethnicity and continuity of health insurance coverage. With expansions in health care coverage to larger proportions of uninsured children, it will be important to monitor these programs to ensure that all children who may need tympanostomy tubes have access to them...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on tube insertions in a partial immunized pediatric population. Study Design. Retrospective ecological study. Methods. This study used Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for the period 2000 – 2009. Every child under 17 years old who <b>received</b> <b>tubes</b> during this 10 -year period was identified and analyzed. The tube insertion rates in different age groups and the risk to <b>receive</b> <b>tubes</b> in different birth cohorts {{before and after the}} release of the vaccine in 2005 were compared. Results. The tube insertion rates for children under 17 years of age ranged from 21. 6 to 31. 9 for 100, 000 persons/year. The tube insertion rate of children under 2 years old decreased significantly after 2005 in period effect analysis (β = − 0. 074, P < 0. 05, and the negative β value means a downward trend) and increased in children 2 to 9 years old throughout the study period (positive β values which mean upward trends, P < 0. 05). The rate of tube insertion was lower in 2004 - 2005 and 2006 - 2007 birth cohorts than that of 2002 - 2003 birth cohort (RR = 0. 90 and 0. 21, 95 % CI 0. 83 – 0. 97 and 0. 19 – 0. 23, resp.). Conclusion. The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may reduce the risk of tube insertion for children of later birth cohorts. The vaccine may have the protective effect on tube insertions in a partial immunized pediatric population...|$|R
