From 1866 he was often caricatured in Japan Punch, which was founded and edited by Wirgman. In an October 1866 fire that destroyed much of Yokohama, Beato lost his studio and many, <b>perhaps</b> <b>all,</b> of his negatives.|$|E
5|$|With a stocky, {{powerful}} build, the Exmoor pony {{is strong}} for its height, and {{noted for its}} hardiness and endurance. The chest is deep and the back broad, the croup level. The legs are short, with good bone and hard hooves. Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds, which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar, this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study. The study, when properly translated, refers to a feature, found in multiple horse breeds and <b>perhaps</b> <b>all</b> animals with sizable lower jaws, {{that appears to be}} an extra branch of blood supply in the area. While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply, its frequency among the general horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable.|$|E

25|$|Today, it is {{generally}} thought that many or <b>perhaps</b> <b>all</b> dinosaurs had higher metabolic rates than living reptiles, but also {{that the situation is}} more complex and varied than Bakker originally proposed.

25|$|Among the mammals {{that have}} {{lost the ability to}} {{synthesize}} vitamin C are simians and tarsiers, which together make up one of two major primate suborders, Haplorrhini. This group includes humans. The other more primitive primates (Strepsirrhini) have the ability to make vitamin C. Synthesis does not occur in a number of species (<b>perhaps</b> <b>all</b> species) in the small rodent family Caviidae that includes guinea pigs and capybaras, but occurs in other rodents (rats and mice do not need vitamin C in their diet, for example).|$|E

25|$|Current algebras {{arise in}} quantum field {{theories}} {{as a consequence}} of global gauge symmetry. Conserved currents occur in classical field theories whenever the Lagrangian respects a continuous symmetry. This is the content of Noether's theorem. Most (<b>perhaps</b> <b>all)</b> modern quantum field theories can be formulated in terns of classical Lagrangians (prior to quantization), so Noether's theorem applies in the quantum case as well. Upon quantization, the conserved currents are promoted to position dependent operators on Hilbert space. These operators are subject to commutation relations, generally forming an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. A model illustrating this is presented below.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the United States Geological Survey {{under the}} Volcano Hazards Program began an {{intensive}} effort {{to monitor and}} study geologic unrest in Long Valley Caldera. The goal is to provide residents and civil authorities with reliable information {{on the nature of}} the potential hazards posed by this unrest and timely warning of an impending volcanic eruption, should it develop. Most, <b>perhaps</b> <b>all,</b> volcanic eruptions are preceded and accompanied by geophysical and geochemical changes in the volcanic system. Common precursory indicators of volcanic activity include increased seismicity, ground deformation, and variations in the nature and rate of gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the loss}} of Ruad, Molay {{abandoned}} the tactic of small advance forces, and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major Crusade, as well as strengthening Templar authority in Cyprus. When a power struggle erupted between King Henry II and his brother Amalric, the Templars supported Amalric, who took the crown and had his brother exiled in 1306. Meanwhile, pressure increased in Europe that the Templars should be merged with the other military orders, <b>perhaps</b> <b>all</b> placed {{under the authority of}} one king, and that individual should become the new King of Jerusalem when it was conquered.|$|E

25|$|De' Barberi {{spent a year}} in Nuremberg, where Dürer lived, in 1500–1, and {{influences}} flowed in both directions between him and Dürer for a number of years. None of his engravings are dated, so much of the dating of them depends on resemblances to dated prints by Dürer; this is complicated by uncertainty in some cases as to who was influencing who. Five of his engravings were in an album of Hartmann Schedel's, which was bound up in December 1504, which gives further evidence as to dating. De' Barberi had probably made some engravings before leaving Italy, but his best engravings (and <b>perhaps</b> <b>all</b> of them) were probably done after his move to Germany in 1500.|$|E
500|$|Al-Zamakhshari, {{a famous}} {{commentator}} of the Qur'an, acknowledged the splitting {{of the moon}} as one of Muhammad's miracles. But he also suggested that the splitting might take place only {{on the day of}} judgment. The Muslim scholar Yusuf Ali provides three different interpretations of the verse. He holds that <b>perhaps</b> <b>all</b> three are applicable to the verse: Moon once appeared cleft asunder at the time of Muhammad in order to convince the unbelievers. It will split again when the day of judgment approaches (here the prophetic past tense is taken to indicate the future). Yusuf Ali connects this incident with the disruption of the solar system mentioned in [...] Lastly, he says that the verses can be metaphorical, meaning that the matter has become clear as the moon.|$|E
500|$|Oak Ridge {{security}} personnel considered any private party {{with more than}} seven people as suspicious, and residents—who believed that US government agents were secretly among them—avoided repeatedly inviting the same guests. Although original residents of the area could be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection. Everyone, including top military officials, and their automobiles were searched when entering and exiting project facilities. One Oak Ridge worker stated that [...] "if you got inquisitive, you were called on the carpet within two hours by government secret agents. Usually those summoned to explain were then escorted bag and baggage to the gate and ordered to keep going." [...] Nonetheless, despite being told that their work would help end the war and <b>perhaps</b> <b>all</b> future wars, not seeing or understanding {{the results of their}} often tedious duties—or even typical side effects of factory work such as smoke from smokestacks—and the war in Europe ending without the use of their work, caused serious morale problems among workers and caused many rumors to spread.

500|$|Although {{there is}} {{reference}} to Viking horsemen {{fighting in the}} 10th century Battle of Sulcoit, in Ireland, their primary use for horses in Britain – some of which they captured or seized, and some of which they brought with them – was to facilitate rapid travel. This is a central purpose for which horses were used in Anglo-Saxon England, particularly in warfare, since conflict between the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms was carried out over long distances. In the 7th century, King Penda of Mercia, in central England, took his armies north to Bamburgh, nearly [...] north of Hadrian's Wall; and Oswald of Northumbria was killed fighting the Mercians in Shropshire. These armies probably rode horses to war, {{and the maintenance of}} horses was required of many, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>all,</b> who held land under Anglo-Saxon kings. In the 7th century, an Anglo-Saxon warrior was buried with his horse at Sutton Hoo; carvings on Anglo-Saxon stone crosses feature warriors on horseback; and 62"warhorses" [...] are recorded in Domesday Book. In the 11th century, Anglo-Saxon warriors on horseback fought successfully against Viking, Welsh and Scottish armies, the latter including Norman allies.|$|E
500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although the downside is that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>all</b> that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E
