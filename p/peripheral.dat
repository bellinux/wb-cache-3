5|$|Lead {{affects the}} <b>peripheral</b> nervous system (especially motor nerves) {{and the central}} nervous system. <b>Peripheral</b> nervous system effects are more {{prominent}} in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children. Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their myelin coats.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with <b>peripheral</b> benzodiazepine receptors. <b>Peripheral</b> benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} <b>peripheral</b> nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These <b>peripheral</b> receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Software <b>peripherals</b> [1] {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a design alternative to traditional <b>peripherals.</b> We propose a software architecture, design methodology and scheduling scheme for implementing software <b>peripherals</b> on general purpose processors, with fast context switch and high resolution timers. Our design flow automatically generates code for scheduling software <b>peripherals.</b> We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed work by experimenting {{with a set of}} five software <b>peripherals</b> scheduled to execute on a MIPS processor. Our performance evaluations show that the performance impact of the software <b>peripherals</b> on user-level tasks is minimal (i. e., 10. 11 % on a 100 MHz processor) – strongly suggesting that with the right architecture, software <b>peripherals</b> can be efficiently accomodated in typical embedded applications.

The company was formerly known as Texas Industrial <b>Peripherals.</b>|$|R
30|$|Historically, early {{personal}} computers and their <b>peripherals</b> were mostly {{designed and built}} by the same company. The <b>peripherals</b> used to be much less complex than today (microcode, firmware, etc.) and the processor manufacturers used to trust the <b>peripherals.</b> However, with the increasing demand for higher performance levels and hardware services, more sophisticated architectures have emerged with multiple input/output communication channels. In particular, normalized communication buses have been specified to allow tier manufacturers to complement bare architectures with complex <b>peripherals.</b> Then, to relieve the host processor from performing certain data copies and operations, DMA cycles {{have been added to}} these external buses, allowing <b>peripherals</b> to perform read/write accesses to other <b>peripherals</b> and RAM segments. These communication channels raise serious security concerns as they offer opportunities to attackers to corrupt the system and the hosted applications using some malicious <b>peripherals.</b> To cope with such attacks, also called I/O attacks, some hardware protection components, such as the IOMMU, have been included in modern computers.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based <b>peripheral</b> that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit <b>peripheral</b> which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances <b>peripheral</b> glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased <b>peripheral</b> use of glucose {{may be due}} to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with NIDDM.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{extend the life of}} the Genesis, Sega {{released}} two add-ons to increase its capabilities: a CD-based <b>peripheral</b> known as the Sega CD (Mega-CD outside North America), and a 32-bit <b>peripheral</b> known as the Sega 32X. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, and an estimated 665,000 32X units were sold by the end of 1994.|$|E

5|$|Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 {{specified}} {{a design}} for any connector {{smaller than the}} standard type A or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many <b>peripheral</b> devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors {{as though they had}} a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the <b>peripheral</b> end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E
