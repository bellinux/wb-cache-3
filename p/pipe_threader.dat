5000|$|Galvanized steel {{potable water}} supply and {{distribution}} pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3/8 in to 2 in. It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as [...] "galv" [...] or [...] "iron" [...] in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a <b>pipe</b> <b>threader.</b> It remains in common use for repair of existing [...] "galv" [...] systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is {{the most widely used}} pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.|$|E
