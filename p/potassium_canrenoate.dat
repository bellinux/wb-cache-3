To assess whether preconditioning with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system agents could limit myocardial tissue injury, we tested the force of contraction of human right atrial trabeculae during hypoxia-reoxygenation when exposed to aldosterone and/or <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate.</b> Materials and methodsWe studied the effect of aldosterone and/or mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> administration prior to hypoxia-reoxygenation and in normoxic condition on force of contraction in 51 human right atrial trabeculae obtained from patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery or aortic valve replacement. We also tested if adosterone exposure results in changes in levels of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation. ResultsThe force of contraction of trabeculae was significantly reduced by aldosterone administration under normoxic or hypoxia-reoxygenation conditions. The rapid onset of this effect - 25 minutes - suggests a nongenomic mechanism. When compared with controls, <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> by itself was not able to induce cardioprotection. However, coadministration of aldosterone and <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> preconditioned isolated human atrial myocardium exposed to hypoxia - reoxygenation.

Spironolactone (1 - 300 microM), canrenone (1 - 300 microM), and <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (0. 01 - 10 mM), in a concentration-dependent manner, relaxed rat aorta rings precontracted with phenylephrine (1 microM) or KCl (40 mM).

Rats were submitted to chronic treatment with either the aldosterone receptor antagonist <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (pc, 20 mg/kg/d) or both aldosterone and angiotensin II receptor antagonists with addition of losartan (los, 10 mg/kg/d). Isoproterenol induced cardiac hypertrophy, which was completely inhibited by <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> alone in atria and by <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> plus losartan in infarcted ventricles. Isoproterenol also induced cardiac fibrosis, which was completely inhibited in infarcted rats by <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> alone in right and left ventricles. In left ventricle, extent of fibrosis was, for control MI, 1. 30 ± 0. 34 %; MI + iso, 2. 50 ± 0. 27 %; MI + iso + pc, 0. 82 ± 0. 11 %; and MI + iso + pc + los, 1. 47 ± 0. 31 %. The deleterious effects of β-adrenoceptor stimulation on cardiac fibrosis seem therefore to involve aldosterone action.

AIMS To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of canrenone following administration of <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> to paediatric patients. METHODS Data were collected prospectively from 23 paediatric patients (2 days to 10 years of age; median weight 4 kg, range 2. 16 – 28. 0 kg) who received intravenous <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (K-canrenoate) as part of their intensive care therapy for removal of retained fluids, e. g. in pulmonary oedema due to chronic lung disease and for the management of congestive heart failure. Plasma samples were analyzed by HPLC for determination of canrenone (the major metabolite and pharmacologically active moiety) and the data subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis using NONMEM. RESULTS A one compartment model best described the data. The only significant covariate was weight (WT). The final population models for canrenone clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were CL/F (l h− 1) = 11. 4 × (WT/ 70. 0) 0. 75 and V/F (l) = 374. 2 × (WT/ 70) where WT is in kg.

40|$|In ST {{elevation}} {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) context, clinical {{studies have shown}} the deleterious effect of high aldosterone levels on ventricular arrhythmia occurrence and cardiac mortality. Previous in vitro reports showed that during ischemia-reperfusion, aldosterone modulates K+ currents involved in the holding of the resting membrane potential (RMP). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the electrophysiological impact of aldosterone on IK 1 current during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion. We used an in vitro model of "border zone" using right rabbit ventricle and standard microelectrode technique followed by cell-attached recordings from freshly isolated rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes. In microelectrode experiments, aldosterone (10 and 100 nmol/L, n= 7 respectively) increased the action potential duration (APD) dispersion at 90 % between ischemic and normoxic zones (from 95 ± 4 ms to 116 ± 6 ms and 127 ± 5 ms respectively, P< 0. 05) and reperfusion-induced sustained premature ventricular contractions occurrence (from 2 / 12 to 5 / 7 preparations, P< 0. 05). Conversely, <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> 100 nmol/L and RU 28318 1 μmol/l alone did not affect AP parameters and premature ventricular contractions occurrence (except Vmax which was decreased by <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> during simulated-ischemia). Furthermore, aldosterone induced a RMP hyperpolarization, evoking an implication of a K+ current involved in the holding of the RMP. Cell-attached recordings showed that aldosterone 10 nmol/L quickly activated (within 6. 2 ± 0. 4 min) a 30 pS K+-selective current, inward rectifier, with pharmacological and biophysical properties consistent with the IK 1 current (NPo = 1. 9 ± 0. 4 in control vs NPo= 3. 0 ± 0. 4, n= 10, P< 0. 05). These deleterious effects persisted in presence of RU 28318, a specific MR antagonist, and were successfully prevented by <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate,</b> a non specific MR antagonist, in both microelectrode and patch-clamp recordings, thus indicating a MR-independent IK 1 activation.

40|$|Spironolactone and <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> are diuretics {{that are}} used widely for {{management}} of cirrhotic ascites. The administra tion of spironolactone frequently leads to feminization, which has been noted less frequently {{with the use of}} <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate,</b> a salt of the active metabolite of spironolactone. The use of these two drugs has been associated with decreases in serum testosterone levels and spironolactone with a reduction in androgen receptor (AR) activity. This decrease in AR has been cited as the cause of the antiandrogen effect of these drugs. We therefore assessed the effect of both drugs on levels of androgen and estrogen receptors (ER) in the liver, a tissue that is responsive to sex steroids. Three groups of male rats (n = 12 rats each) were studied. Group 1 (control) received vehicle only; group 2 received spironolactone (5 mg/day); group 3 received <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (5 mg/day). After 21 days of treatment, the animals of all groups were killed and liver tissue was assayed for nuclear and cytosolic AR and ER, and for male specific estrogen binder (MEB), an androgen-responsive protein. Both drugs drastically decreased the nuclear AR content, as compared with the control group, but only spironolactone decreased cytosolic AR. When the total hepatic content of AR is considered, a highly significant decrease is observed only in rats treated with spironolactone. This reduction in hepatic AR content suggested loss of androgen responsiveness of liver. We confirmed this by assessing levels of MEB, and found that livers from group 2 animals had no detectable MEB activity, whereas livers from both group 1 and 3 had normal MEB activity. No changes were observed in nuclear ER and cytosolic ER of group 3 as compared with group 1. Nuclear estrogen receptor decreased and cytosolic ER increased in group 2, but with no change in total ER content. These results indicate that (a) only spironolactone appears to act as an antiandrogen in liver, resulting in a decrease in both AR and male specific estrogen binder content, and (b) neither drug results in elevated hepatic ER content, although spironolactone-treated animals show an altered subcellular localization. © 1987...|$|E

Methods We enrolled 46 patients (ages 60 +/- 11 years, 34 males) with a first episode of anterior transmural thrombolized myocardial infarction. At hospital discharge patients were randomized to receive <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate,</b> an oral aldosterone inhibitor, 50 mg once daily (group 1, n = 24) or placebo (group 2, n = 22).

Recently, R-fadrozole was coined as an aldosterone biosynthesis inhibitor, offering an appealing alternative to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to block aldosterone action. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of R- and S-fadrozole on plasma aldosterone and urinary aldosterone excretion rate and to compare their effectiveness vs. the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> to reverse established cardiac fibrosis. Male lean spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats (40 wk) were treated for 8 wk by sc infusions of low (0. 24 mg/kg·d) or high (1. 2 mg/kg·d) doses of R- or S-fadrozole or by <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> via drinking water (7. 5 mg/kg·d). At the high dose, plasma aldosterone levels were decreased similarly by R- and S-fadrozole, whereas urinary aldosterone excretion rate was reduced only by S-fadrozole. In contrast, whereas at the high dose, R-fadrozole effectively reversed preexistent left ventricular interstitial fibrosis by 50 % (vs. 42 % for canrenoate), S-fadrozole was devoid of an antifibrotic effect. The low doses of the fadrozole enantiomers did not change cardiac fibrosis or plasma aldosterone but similarly reduced urinary aldosterone excretion rate. In conclusion, R-fadrozole may possess considerable therapeutic merit because of its potent antifibrotic actions in the heart. However, the observed discordance between the aldosterone-lowering and antifibrotic effects of the fadrozole enantiomers raises some doubt about the mechanism by which R-fadrozole diminishes cardiac collagen and about the generality of the concept of lowering aldosterone levels to treat the diseased heart...|$|E

Male Syrian hamsters were anesthetized, tracheotomized and intubated. They were studied under baseline conditions or submitted to ischemia-reperfusion. Cheek pouch microvessels were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Microvascular parameters were determined by computerized methods. Under baseline conditions, aldosterone (0. 2, 0. 5, 2. 4 μM/L/ 2 min) induced dose-dependent constriction of all arterioles within 2. 0 ± 0. 5 min of administration. Diameter reduction was in the same range in smaller arterioles: A 3 ones constricted by 24 ± 3 % of baseline (at the highest dose). Aldosterone applied prior to ischemia and at reperfusion caused arteriolar constriction, marked microvascular permeability (0. 66 ± 0. 03 Normalized Grey Level), reduction in perfused capillary (- 70 ± 4 % of baseline) and leukocyte adhesion. All changes were statistically significant compared with ischemic animals. <b>Potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (mineralcorticoid receptor inhibitor) prior to aldosterone did not abolish the aldosterone-induced effects, while valsartan (angiotensin II AT 1 receptor inhibitor) prior to aldosterone ameliorated microvascular ischemia-reperfusion injury. In conclusion, aldosterone determined dose-dependent arteriolar constriction likely by angiotensin II type- 1 receptor activation (non-genomic mechanism) worsening the effects of ischemia-reperfusion on capillary perfusion, while protecting from free radical formation...|$|E
40|$|Metadata onlyOBJECTIVES: We have {{examined}} the acute effects (< 45 min) of aldosterone antagonism on heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, markers of cardiac vagal control, in 13 healthy subjects. BACKGROUND: Evidence for the beneficial effects of aldosterone antagonists comes from studies showing increased survival rates following their addition to standard heart failure therapy. Many mechanisms have been suggested for this action, including effects upon the autonomic nervous system. METHODS: Heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity were examined 30 min following the administration of <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (intravenous) (aldosterone antagonist) or saline (control). RESULTS: Active treatment reduced resting heart rate (- 6 +/- 1 beats/min [mean +/- standard error mean]) compared to control (0 +/- 1 beat/min) (p < 0. 001) and increased measures of high frequency (HF) heart rate variability. Root mean square of successive RR interval differences increased by 21 +/- 5 ms versus - 6 +/- 5 ms control (p < 0. 001); HF power increased by 1, 369 +/- 674 ms(2) with aldosterone antagonism compared to - 255 +/- 431 ms(2) following saline infusion (p < 0. 01). Baroreflex sensitivity (alpha-HF) was increased after active treatment (+ 4 +/- 2 ms/mm Hg vs. 0 +/- 1 ms/mm Hg control [p < 0. 05]). No changes in plasma potassium levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that aldosterone antagonists acutely improve cardiac vagal control, irrespective of any diuretic effects, and may in part explain their beneficial effects in treatment of heart failure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAIMS: Pre-treatment with {{mineralocorticoid}} receptor (MR) antagonists {{is reported}} to reduce myocardial infarct size from ischaemia/reperfusion. Here, we tested whether the MR antagonists <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> and eplerenone could protect in the more clinically relevant schedule of administration {{at the end of}} ischaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: In all models, hearts were subjected to 30 min regional ischaemia followed by 120 min (rabbits 4 h) reperfusion. A bolus of canrenoate 5 min prior to reperfusion in open-chest mice decreased infarct size in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum protection was seen at 1 mg/kg where infarction was 18 % of that in the control (P < 0. 001). Ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase (CD 73) as well as adenosine A(2 b) receptor knock-out mice could no longer be protected, suggesting a role for adenosine and the A(2 b) receptor in the mechanism. A 1 mg/kg bolus of canrenoate prior reperfusion also reduced infarct size in open-chest rabbits. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we studied isolated rat hearts. Eplerenone (10 microM) at the end of ischaemia was similarly protective in the rat heart and the protection was abolished by co-treatment with inhibitors of the adenosine receptor, protein kinase C, PI 3 -kinase, and ERK. In addition, eplerenone or canrenoate treatment increased phosphorylation of the pro-survival kinases Akt and ERK 1 / 2 at reperfusion in the rat hearts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, MR antagonists when given at the end of ischaemia are highly effective and potent cardioprotective drugs with a signalling similar to that of ischaemic pre-conditioning and, hence, could be a very promising candidate for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction in man...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundIn ST {{elevation}} {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) context, clinical {{studies have shown}} the deleterious effect of high aldosterone levels on ventricular arrhythmia (VA) occurrence {{as well as on}} cardiac mortality. However, the mechanisms of such harmful effects remain unknown. Methods and resultsWe used an in vitro model of “border zone” using rabbit ventricle and standard microelectrode technique, completed by cellattached experiments of freshly isolated rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes to assess the acute electrophysiological impact of aldosterone. During simulated ischemia, aldosterone (10 and 100 nmol/L) increased the APD dispersion at 90 % between ischemic and normoxic zones (from 95 ± 4 ms to 117 ± 5 ms and 131 ± 6 ms respectively, P< 0. 05) and reperfusion-induced sustained premature ventricular contractions occurrence (from 17 % to 67 % and 83 % respectively, P< 0. 05). Furthermore, aldosterone induced a resting membrane potential hyperpolarization, evoking an implication of a K+ current. Adding <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> to aldosterone superfusion prevented these deleterious effects contrary to RU 28318, a specific mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist. Cell-attached experiments, designed to identify the K+ current involved, showed that aldosterone 10 nmol/L activated (within 6. 2 ± 0. 4 min) a 30 pS K+-selective channel, inward rectifier, with pharmacological and biophysical properties consistent with the IK 1 current (NPo= 1. 96 ± 0. 36 in control vs NPo= 3. 01 ± 0. 43, n= 10, P< 0. 05). ConclusionsIn this in vitro model of “border zone”, aldosterone had a deleterious impact via a rapid and MR-independent IK 1 current activation. These conclusions may help to better understanding recent clinical studies results underlying the involvement of aldosterone in VA occurrence in STEMI context...|$|E

To compare clonidine (aspecific α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist) to SSP- 002021 R (prodrug of guanfacine, specific α 2 A-receptor agonist), both associated with diuretics, in experimental cirrhotic ascites. Six groups of 12 rats were studied: controls (G 1); controls receiving furosemide and <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (G 2); rats with ascitic cirrhosis due to 14 -week CCl 4 treatment (G 3); cirrhotic rats treated (over the 11 th- 14 th CCl 4 weeks) with furosemide and canrenoate (G 4), furosemide, canrenoate and clonidine (G 5), or diuretics and SSP 002021 R (G 6). Three rats of each group had their hormonal status and renal function assessed {{at the end of}} 11 th, 12 th, 13 th, and 14 th weeks of respective treatments. Cirrhotic rats in G 3 and G 4 gained weight over the 12 th- 14 th CCl 4 weeks. In G 4, brief increase in sodium excretion over the 11 th- 12 th weeks preceded worsening of inulin clearance and natriuresis (diuretic resistance). In comparison with G 4, the addition of clonidine (G 5) or guanfacine (G 6) to diuretics improved, respectively, sodium excretion over the 11 th- 12 th CCl 4 weeks, or GFR and electrolytes excretion over the 13 th- 14 th CCl 4 weeks. Natriuretic responses in G 5 and G 6 were accompanied by reduced catecholamine serum levels. α 2 A-receptor agonists restore glomerular filtration rate and natriuresis, and delay diuretic-resistant ascites in experimental advanced cirrhosis.

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the population pharmacokinetics of canrenone following administration of <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> (K-canrenoate) in paediatric patients. Methods: Data were collected prospectively from 37 paediatric patients (median weight 2. 9  kg, age range 2 days– 0. 85 years) who received intravenous K-canrenoate for management of retained fluids, {{for example in}} heart failure and chronic lung disease. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples (n =  213) from these were analysed for canrenone content and the data subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Another group of patients (n =  16) who had 71 matching plasma and DBS samples was analysed separately to compare canrenone pharmacokinetic parameters obtained using the two different matrices. Results: A one-compartment model best described the DBS data. Significant covariates were weight, postmenstrual age (PMA) and gestational age. The final population models for canrenone clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) in DBS were CL/F (l/h)  =  12. 86  ×  (WT/ 70. 0) 0. 75  × e [0. 066  ×  (PMA -  40]) and V/F (l)  =  603. 30  ×  (WT/ 70)  × (GA/ 40) 1. 89 where weight is in kilograms. The corresponding values of CL/F and V/F in a patient with a median weight of 2. 9  kg are 1. 11  l/h and 20. 48  l, respectively. Estimated half-life of canrenone based on DBS concentrations {{was similar to that}} based on matched plasma concentrations (19. 99 and 19. 37  h, respectively, in 70  kg patient). Conclusion: The range of estimated CL/F in DBS for the study population was 0. 12 – 9. 62  l/h; hence, bodyweight-based dosage adjustment of K-canrenoate appears necessary. However, a dosing scheme that takes into consideration both weight and age (PMA/gestational age) of paediatric patients seems more appropriate...|$|E
40|$|In an {{interesting}} editorial, Kaplan 1 has focused recently on {{the choice of}} thiazide diuretics and concluded that chlorthalidone, alone or {{in addition to other}} antihypertensive drugs, may replace hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The author also states that HCTZ and chlorthalidone, even at low doses (12. 5 to 25. 0 mg), can lower serum potassium and that an addition of small doses of spironolactone or eplerenone could provide maximal antihypertensive efficacy and prevent hypokalemia, particularly in resistant patients. A very important issue dealing with all diuretics is the volume depletion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Diuretics, with the exception of aldosterone receptor blockers, do not directly affect mineralocorticoid receptors. Recent studies of the literature have shown that aldosterone, even in situations of normal sodium intake, can enhance oxidative stress through activation of NADPH oxidase in particular clinical situations. Aldosterone is involved in inflammation atherosclerosis and heart hypertrophy and fibrosis, and the addition of aldosterone receptor blockers prevents the risk of complications in patients with heart diseases treated with other drugs (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study and Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study). Concerning the secondary hyperaldosteronism from diuretics, Brown and colleagues 2, 3 have compared the effect of HCTZ (25 mg per day) with the effect of spironolactone on the fibrinolytic balance in hypertensive subjects. Although HCTZ and spironolactone increased angiotensin II and aldosterone, only HCTZ increased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 antigen concentration. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism prevents the effect of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 antigen in normotensive subjects and improves the fibrinolytic balance in hypertensive subjects through a potassium-independent mechanism, the same pro-oxidative effect that is evident when administering triamterene, thus supporting the concept that aldosterone increases plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 synthesis independently from the potassium concentration. 2, 3 We have reported studies using human mononuclear leukocytes and have found that canrenone completely blocks the pro-oxidative effect of aldosterone in these cells, as measured by the protein expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and p 22 phox. 4 In patients treated with thiazides or furosemide, aldosterone receptors are not blocked, and the cardiovascular risk is reduced by the lowering of blood pressure but is also enhanced by the binding of high aldosterone levels to mineralocorticoid receptors at the level of target tissues and, in particular, at the level of mononuclear leukocytes, a major component of vascular inflammation. This mechanism could enhance the fibrotic and atherogenic processes. These observations further enforce the concept that the goal of therapy is not only the lowering of blood pressure and the controlling of potassium but also the prevention of the inflammatory effect of aldosterone, as specified by Kaplan 1 {{at the end of the}} editorial. Aldosterone receptor blockers do have a limited use in essential and secondary hypertension, particularly in Europe, as demonstrated by the Guidelines of the European Council of Hypertension (New Consensus Hypertension Guidelines from European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology 2007 : Antihypertensive Treatment), which considers thiazides but not aldosterone receptors blockers for treatment of resistant hypertension, and maybe aldosterone receptor blockers should have a larger prescription, considering that metabolites with minimal (<b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate</b> and canrenone) or absent (eplerenone) antiandrogenic activity are available in many countries...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sildenafil, a short-acting phosphodiesterase- 5 {{inhibitor}} (1), is {{safe and}} may benefit patients with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (2 – 8). However, it requires many daily administrations. We describe a patient with end-stage primary pulmonary arterial hypertension who improved while taking tadalafil, a long-acting phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor (9). Case Report: A 72 -year-old woman was hospitalized for progressive cardiopulmonary failure. Five years earlier, primary pulmonary arterial hypertension was diagnosed and the patient was hospitalized for hydropic decompensation and hypoxemia. Since then, she had been receiving permanent oxygen therapy and had also taken digoxin, amlodipine, furosemide, <b>potassium</b> <b>canrenoate,</b> and acenocoumarol. At the most recent hospitalization, the patient had dyspnea (New York Heart Association class IV) and 4 pitting edema of the legs up to the thighs, which had progressed over the previous 3 months. The patient’s blood pressure was 110 / 70 mm Hg, her pulse was 102 beats/min, her respiratory frequency was 32 breaths/min, and her temperature was 36. 8 °C. During oxygen therapy (fraction of inspired oxygen, 35 %), arterial PO 2 was 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm and right ventricular hypertrophy. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly without signs of pulmonary edema. Doppler echocardiography showed dilation of right chambers with severe tricuspidal regurgitation and estimated peak systolic pulmonary pressure of 105 mm Hg. Chest spiral computed tomography excluded pulmonary arterial embolism. Despite administration of intravenous diuretics and optimization of oxygen therapy, the patient’s condition did not substantially improve. Epoprostenol therapy was attempted but was stopped because the patient had symptomatic arterial hypotension despite a low infusion rate. Therefore, with the patient’s informed consent, we administered tadalafil (20 mg orally every other day) in addition to background therapy. After 2 weeks of tadalafil therapy, the patient improved remarkably (New York Heart Association class III); the only untoward effect was slight arterial hypotension that promptly regressed with amlodipine withdrawal. Blood pressure was 116 / 66 mm Hg, pulse rate was 84 beats/min, and respiratory frequency was 20 breaths/min. Leg edema was remarkably reduced. The patient’s arterial PO 2 was 70 mm Hg during oxygen therapy (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0. 28 %). Doppler echocardiography showed a notable reduction of the estimated peak systolic pulmonary pressure (80 mm Hg). Accordingly, doses of intravenous diuretics were progressively decreased and were administered orally. The patient was discharged and referred to outpatient care. After 6 months of tadalafil treatment, the patient’s functional status improved (New York Heart Association class II to III). Physical examination showed stable normotension, further reduction of heart rate and respiratory frequency, and disappearance of leg edema. Arterial PO 2 during oxygen therapy (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0. 24 %) remained stably above 70 mm Hg. Doppler echocardiography showed progressive reduction of estimated peak pulmonary systolic pressure (up to 65 mm Hg). Accordingly, we reduced oral doses of diuretics and prescribed oxygen therapy only during physical activity. Table.

Through this mechanism, it reduces mean pulmonary artery pressure and the pulmonary- to-systemic vascular resistance ratio and improves the overall ventilation–perfusion mismatch, arterial oxygenation, and functional capacity (3 – 8). However, {{because it has a}} half-life of about 4 hours (1), sildenafil requires many daily administrations, which in the long term may compromise treatment adherence and may be costly. In our patient with end-stage primary pulmonary arterial hypertension, we observed that long-term treatment with tadalafil, which has a half-life of about 18 hours, was safe and greatly improved pulmonary hemodynamics and arterial oxygenation (Figure). These improvements were paralleled by a striking improvement in clinical and functional status. Besides confirming the efficacy of phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors in treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension, this finding may alert physicians to the possibility that tadalafil may be more affordable than sildenafil. In fact, because its half-life is nearly 5 -fold greater than sildenafil’s (9), tadalafil may be administered once daily or even every second day, a feature that may improve adherence and reduce treatment costs...|$|E
