The United States is the world’s third largest cement producer, with production occurring in 37 states. Cement production {{is not only a}} source of combustion-related CO 2 emissions, but {{it is also one of}} the largest sources of industrial process-related emissions in the United States. Between 1990 and 2001, U. S. process-related emissions increased 24 %, from 33. 3 TgCO 2 to 41. 4 TgCO 22. National estimates of process-related emissions are calculated based on methodologies developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 3, 4.

40|$|Demand {{uncertainty}} {{is thought to}} influence irreversible capacity decisions. This paper examines {{the nature of this}} relationship in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> industry. Firms in this sector deliver cement for local markets either from domestic plants or from imports. Since cement is costly to transport over land, the difference in marginal cost between local production and imports varies across markets. In the presence of uncertain demand, capacity choices are shown theoretically to depend on whether firms are located on the coast or inland. Industry data from 1994 to 2006 are consistent with the predictions of the model. There is a positive relationship between capacity investment and demand uncertainty only for landlocked areas. The results provide a new rationale to explain the coexistence of home production and imports in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> market for large multinational firms, even in the long run. 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> industry, identifying cost-effective energy efficiency measures and potentials. The authors assess this industry at the aggregate level (Standard Industrial Classification 324), which includes establishments engaged in manufacturing hydraulic cements, including Portland, natural, masonry, and pozzolana when reviewing industry trends and when making international comparisons. Coal and coke are currently the primary fuels for the sector, supplanting the dominance of natural gas in the 1970 s. Between 1970 and 1997, primary physical energy intensity for cement production (SIC 324) dropped 30 %,from 7. 9 GJ/t to 5. 6 GJ/t, while carbon dioxide intensity due to fuel consumption (carbon dioxide emissions expressed in tons of carbon per ton cement) dropped 25 %, from 0. 16 tC/ton to 0. 12 tC/ton. Carbon dioxide intensity due to fuel consumption and clinker calcination dropped 17 %, from 0. 29 tC/ton to 0. 24 tC/ton. They examined 30 energy efficient technologies and measures and estimated energy savings, carbon dioxide savings, investment costs, and {{operation and maintenance costs}} for each of the measures. They constructed an energy conservation supply curve for U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> industry which found a total cost-effective reduction of 0. 6 GJ/ton of cement consisting of measures having a simple payback period of 3 years or less.

40|$|Cement {{manufacturing}} is {{a critically}} important {{industry in the}} United States and throughout the world. In 2006, U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> plants produced 99. 8 million metric tons of cement. Worldwide production accounted for about 2. 5 billion metric tons. As with most large manufacturing industries, by-product materials are generated. These industrial by-product and waste materials must be managed responsibly to insure a clean and safe environment. Cement kiln dust (CKD) is a significant by-product material of the cement manufacturing process. Over {{the past several years}} dramatic advances have been achieved in the management and use of cement kiln dust, thus reducing its dependency on landfill disposal. Sustainability is the cornerstone of the cement industry, not only in the products that use cement, but also in its manufacturing process.

The case studies are designed to shed light on the question of how unionization affects productivity. The empirical results support the conclusion that unionization leads to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise.

Based on team demography and organization learning ideas, {{we argue that}} CEO succession or executive team change enhances incremental organization change, while either strategic reorientation or the combination of CEO succession with executive team change triggers discontinuous organization change. We hypothesize that these contrasting intervention modes are appropriate in different contexts. A longitudinal study of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> industry from 1918 [...] 1986 demonstrates that simple CEO succession is positively associated with subsequent performance when context is stable, but significantly more negatively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. Executive team change has significant effects on organization adaptation in both stable and turbulent contexts. Strategic reorientations are negatively associated with subsequent performance in stable contexts, but significantly more positively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. As a set, these results reinforce a demographic approach to succession research and indicate that CEO succession, executive team change, and reorientation are each distinct and important levers shaping organization adaptation. The impacts of these levers are contingent on organization context. executive succession, reorientation, organization learning, top management teams, turbulence...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that unionization affects {{the rules and}} {{procedures}} governing the employment relation in organized establishments. The effect of these changes on establishment productivity, however, is unclear. Existing evidence {{is based on a}} comparison of union/nonâ€”union differences in value added per hour worked. Although positive union effects have been estimated, possible differences in prices and technology in the union and nonâ€”union sectors render the results inconclusive. The effect of unions on productivity is examined in the present paper using establishment level data from the U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> industry. The cement industry provides a useful empirical framework. Output is easily measured in physical terms, and data on both union and non-union establishments permit estimation of the union effect controlling for differences in technology. The results suggest that unionized establishments are 6 - 8 percent more productive than their non-union counterparts. This conclusion is supported in time series data, where a comparison of productivity before and after unionization reveals a positive union effect of similar magnitude. Since the statistical analysis controls for capital-labor substitution, scale effects and technological change, the evidence suggests that unionization leads to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise. The results are relatively robust. Specification changes and adjustments for omitted variables leave the basic findings intact. ...|$|R

In the U. <b>S.</b> <b>cement</b> industry, the comparative advantage (e. g., TFP or size) of entrants versus incumbents and regulatory entry barriers are important factors that determine the means of expansion. Using a rich database of the U. S. Census of Manufactures (1963 - 2002), an entry game is proposed to model this decision and estimate the supply and demand primitives to determine {{the importance of these}} factors. Two policies that affect the entry behavior and industry equilibrium are considered: An asymmetric environmental policy that creates barriers to greenfield entry and a policy that creates barriers to entry by acquisition. In the counterfactual analysis it is found that a less favorable environment for acquisitions during the Reagan-Bush administration would decrease the acquired plants by 90 % and increase greenfield entry by 21 %. Also, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 increased the number of acquisitions by 3. 5 %. Furthermore, my simulations suggest that regulations that create barriers to greenfield entry are less favorable in terms of welfare than regulations that create barriers to entry by acquisition. Finally, it is shown how the parameter estimates change with the traditional approach in the entry literature where entry by acquisition is not considered, and when using a simple OLS estimation.

40|$|Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an {{effective}} treatment for aggressive vertebral hemangiomas, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, spinal metastases, and myelomas. As percutaneous vertebroplasty is more commonly per-formed to treat various forms of back pain, new or modified cements are being used. This review examines the physio-chemical and biomechanical properties of various bone cements and additives. Since the mid- 1960 <b>s,</b> bone <b>cement,</b> primarily poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA), has been increasingly used for orthopedic applications. The expanding number of potential procedures {{has led to the}} devel-opment of new cements {{with a wide variety of}} physio-chemical and biomechanical properties. Determining the suitability of using a cement in an established o...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{highlights}} {{the use of}} structural methods by applying them to {{a large number of}} widely different contexts. The essays draw on data from several countries such as Colombia, India, and the US and develop empirical models that are applied {{to a wide range of}} policy issues. Some of these issues relate to the infant computer industry in India in the 1980 <b>s,</b> the <b>cement</b> industry in the US, factors underlying the ownership of blast furnaces in India in the 1990 s, entry decisions of producers in export markets, and even a down-to-earth issue such as the behaviour of pedestrians attempting to cross a stream of traffic at signalized intersections...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes several {{statistical}} {{tests for}} finite state Markov games {{to examine the}} null hypothesis that the data are generated from a single equilibrium. We formulate tests of (i) the conditional choice probabilities, (ii) the steady-state distribution of states and (iii) the conditional distribution of states conditional on an initial state. In a Monte Carlo study {{we find that the}} chi-squared test of the steady-state distribution performs well and has high power even with a small number of markets and time periods. We apply the chi-squared test to the empirical application of Ryan (2012) that analyzes dynamics of the U. <b>S.</b> Portland <b>Cement</b> industry and test if his assumption of single equilibrium is supported by the data. ...|$|R
