40|$|A {{method of}} {{maintaining}} radio communication despite {{the emergence of}} unpredictable fades and nulls in the radiation pattern of an antenna has been proposed. The method was originally intended to be applied {{in the design and}} operation of a radio antenna aboard a robotic exploratory vehicle on a remote planet during communication with a spacecraft in orbit around the planet. The method could also be applied in similar terrestrial situations for example, radio communication between two ground vehicles or between a ground vehicle and an aircraft or spacecraft. The method is conceptually simple, is readily adaptable to diverse situations, and can be implemented without adding greatly to the weight, cost, power demand, or complexity of a system to which it may be applied. The unpredictable fades and nulls in an antenna radiation pattern arise because of electromagnetic interactions between the antenna and other objects within the near field of the antenna (basically, objects within a distance of a few wavelengths). These objects can include general vehicle components, masts, robotic arms, other antennas, the ground, and nearby terrain features. Figure 1 presents representative plots of signal strength versus time during a typical <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> or aircraft through the far field of such an antenna, showing typical nulls and fades caused by nearby objects. The traditional approach to ensuring reliability of communication in the presence of deep fades calls for increasing the effective transmitter power and/or reducing the receiver noise figure at the affected ground vehicle, possibly in combination with appropriate redesign of the equipment at the spacecraft or aircraft end of the communication link. These solutions can be expensive and/or risky and, depending on the application, can add significantly to weight, cost, and power demand. The proposed method entails none of these disadvantages...|$|E

40|$|A {{dedicated}} deployable aerobraking structure {{concept was}} developed that significantly increases the effective area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> during aerobraking {{by up to}} <b>a</b> factor <b>of</b> 5 or more (depending on spacecraft size) without substantially increasing total spacecraft mass. Increasing the effective aerobraking area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> (without significantly increasing spacecraft mass) results in a corresponding reduction in the time required for aerobraking. For example, if the effective area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> is doubled, the time required for aerobraking is roughly reduced to half the previous value. The dedicated deployable aerobraking structure thus enables significantly shorter aerobraking phases, which results in reduced mission cost, risk, and allows science operations to begin earlier in the mission...|$|R
40|$|The Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{involves}} determining {{and controlling}} the attitude and {{position of the}} vehicle as it performs its mission. The attitude <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> is its orientation in space with respect to some reference system- it describes how the spacecraft body axes are oriented relative to an inertial or rotating coordinate system. The position and velocity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> are similarly referenced to some coordinate frame. They give the location, speed, and direction of motion of the <b>spacecraft.</b> The motion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> is described by four parameters: position, velocity, attitude, and attitude motion. Position and velocity {{are the subject of}} orbital mechanics. Attitude and attitude motion, however, are the subject of attitude dynamics, i. e. the motion of the spacecraft about its center of mass. Since environmental torques (gravity gradient, solar wind, atmospheric) are <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> <b>spacecraft</b> position and velocity, the spacecraftâ€™s orbit and attitude are coupled. For example, the velocity and altitude <b>of</b> <b>a</b> satellite determine the drag and aerodynamic torque applied, thus affecting its attitude and rotation rate...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study and control the {{attitude}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> {{it is necessary to}} understand the natural motion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> body in orbit.

The Simulink Attitude Analysis Model applies the equations of rigid body motion to the study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft?s</b> attitude in orbit. Using a TCP/IP connection, Matlab reads the values of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) hand controllers and passes them to Simulink as specified torque and impulse profiles.
