40|$|OBJECTIVES—A hyperintense putamen {{on either}} CT or MRI as a finding {{associated}} with chorea has occasionally been described and {{is almost always}} associated with non-ketotic hyperglycaemia. The cause of the hyperintensity of the striatum in these images is still controversial. Some reports have found that calcification was responsible whereas others have advocated <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> as the cause. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether hyperintense striata are caused by <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> or calcification, with the sequential imaging changes.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS—Five patients presenting with an acute onset of either hemichorea or generalised chorea and showed either unilateral or bilateral hyperdense striatum on the initial CT were assessed. Neuroimaging studies including sequential CT and MRI examinations and detailed biochemical tests were performed.  RESULTS—Three patients had pronounced hyperglycaemia and the other two patients had no biochemical abnormalities. In all patients, the first CT scans, performed within two weeks of the onset of chorea, showed a high density over the striatum contralateral to the chorea, which diminished or disappeared two months later. T 1 weighted imaging disclosed hypersignal intensities over the striatum contralateral to the chorea on admission which diminished two months later. T 2 weighted imaging at two months showed hyposignal intensity changes corresponding to the area with hypersignal changes on T 1 weighted images, implying haemosiderin deposition.  CONCLUSION—Based on the evolution of clinical manifestations and the findings of neuroimaging, putaminal <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> might be a new entity causing either hemichorea or generalised chorea. ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Trauma to {{the oral}} tissues {{can be caused}} by fellatio. Few cases are {{reported}} in the literature. Methods A case of oral palate lesions is presented and discussed. Results The patient developed a large band of <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> extending across the soft palate following the practice of fellatio. The diagnosis was made through an interview with the patient, which disclosed a probable case for fellatio as the cause of the palatal spots. At the follow-up visit 14 days later, the lesions disappeared. Conclusions Oral sex activity has increased over the last decades. The dental care professional should be aware that lesions of the palate may result from sexual behaviour. With this possibility in mind, those working in the area of head and neck medicine should consider fellatio as an addition to the differential aetiology of intraoral petechiae...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{work which}} forms part of ongoing studies into infant mortality SIDS. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) {{is the major}} {{cause of death in}} infants {{during the first year of}} life. SIDS describes the sudden unexpected death of an apparently well infant. A SIDS diagnosis is one of exclusion, that is, death cannot be explained by history, circumstance or a specific pathological condition. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism resulting in death in SIDS is unknown. Although a number of abnormalities in several organ systems have been associated with SIDS, no specific diagnostic pathology has been identified. Epidemiological data suggests a range of environmental and physiological conditions are associated with an increased risk of death from SIDS. These include frothy fluid in the airways, nose and mouth, intrathoracic <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage,</b> delayed dendritic spine maturation and delayed myelination of regions of the central nervous system and vagus nerves. The peak incidence of SIDS occurs between 6 to 11 weeks of life with 90...|$|E
40|$|Eighty-three (50 %) of 165 {{children}} with acute lymphoblastic or acute stem-cell leukaemia presenting during 1958 - 70 developed leukaemia {{of the central}} nervous system (C. N. S.). The rate of incidence of this complication is fairly constant throughout the first two-and-a-half years of the disease, but falls thereafter. The incidence of C. N. S. leukaemia is inversely correlated with the platelet count at the time of initial diagnosis of leukaemia, and directly correlated with the total leucocyte count and the presence of lymph-node enlargement. The major effect of initial leucocyte count is on the time of onset of clinical symptoms. It is suggested that leukaemic cells usually enter the C. N. S. from the blood as a result of intracranial <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> occurring around the time of initial diagnosis of leukaemia, and that the time for subsequent development of symptoms of C. N. S. disease is largely determined by the number and replication rate of leukaemic cells which gain access to the C. N. S. at that time. The increasing frequency of diagnosis of C. N. S. leukaemia in recent years is not wholly explained by increasing survival, and may in part be related to changes in the pattern of antileukaemic therapy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the safety of}} a vaginal microbicide, COL- 1492, containing 52. 5 mg nonoxynol- 9, applied once daily for 14 days among healthy volunteers. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind controlled trial with three arms, COL- 1492 gel versus placebo gel versus no-treatment controls, was conducted. Outcomes of interest were reported genital symptoms, incidence of gynaecological signs, and incidence of genital lesions revealed by colposcopy. Participants were enrolled in four centres (Belgium, The Netherlands, and two in Thailand). RESULTS: A total of 534 women participated in the study: 179 used COL- 1492, 178 used placebo, and 177 were no-treatment controls. Study visits were scheduled 1 week prior to enrollment (day - 7), day 0 (enrollment), day 8 and day 14. The most frequently reported genital symptom was vaginal discharge in both the COL- 1492 and placebo groups. This appeared to be related to leakage of the product out of the vagina. The incidence of lesions associated with epithelial disruption (ulcers and abrasions) was very low (< 2 %) and there was no statistically significant difference between the three groups. Of the lesions observed by colposcopy that did not involve epithelial disruption, <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> was the most frequently detected, with an incidence of 20. 1, 9. 0 and 7. 3 % in the COL- 1492, placebo and control groups, respectively. COL- 1492 users had a higher incidence of erythema (8. 4 versus 2 % in the other groups). CONCLUSION: COL- 1492 showed minimal toxicity when applied once daily.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that optimal hypertrophic and strength gains are induced through moderate- or high-intensity resistance training, equivalent {{to at least}} 60 % of an individual's 1 -repetition maximum (1 RM). However, recent evidence suggests that similar adaptations are facilitated when low-intensity resistance exercise (~ 20 - 50 % 1 RM) is combined with blood flow restriction (BFR) to the working muscles. Although the mechanisms underpinning these responses are not yet firmly established, it appears that localized hypoxia created by BFR may provide an anabolic stimulus by enhancing the metabolic and endocrine response, and increase cellular swelling and signalling function following resistance exercise. Moreover, BFR has also been demonstrated to increase type II muscle fibre recruitment during exercise. However, inappropriate implementation of BFR can result in detrimental effects, including <b>petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and dizziness. Furthermore, as BFR {{is limited to the}} limbs, the muscles of the trunk are unable to be trained under localized hypoxia. More recently, the use of systemic hypoxia via hypoxic chambers and devices has been investigated as a novel way to stimulate similar physiological responses to resistance training as BFR techniques. While little evidence is available, reports indicate that beneficial adaptations, similar to those induced by BFR, are possible using these methods. The use of systemic hypoxia allows large groups to train concurrently within a hypoxic chamber using multi-joint exercises. However, further scientific research is required to fully understand the mechanisms that cause augmented muscular changes during resistance exercise with a localized or systemic hypoxic stimulus...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Newcastle disease (ND) is an infectious, highly {{contagious}} {{and destructive}} viral disease of poultry {{and controlled by}} vaccination. In spite of vaccination, incidence of ND was reported in commercial layers with gastrointestinal lesions. This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence and pathotypes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) involved in gastrointestinal tract abnormalities of vaccinated commercial layer chicken of Namakkal region {{for a period of}} three years from 2008 and 2011. Materials and Methods: Pooled tissue (trachea, lung, spleen, proventriculus, intestine and caecal tonsils) samples collected from dead birds on postmortem examination from 100 layer flocks above 20 weeks of age with gastrointestinal lesions were subjected to isolation of NDV in embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index of the isolates were characterized. Flock details were collected from NDV positive flocks to assess the prevalence and impact of NDV on vaccinated commercial layer chicken. Results: Among the 100 flocks examined Newcastle disease virus was detected in 14 flocks as a single infection and 10 flocks as combined infections with worm infestation, necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis. Chicken embryo mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values ranged from 50. 4 to 96. 0 hrs and from 0. 650 to 1. 675 respectively.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} thrombatic meningoencephalitis (TME) in cattle at west Kordofan State. Out of 6659 heads of cattle which were examined during (2000 - 2001), 211 showed typical signs of TME such as hypersalivation, fever, respiratory distress, stairy coat with hair overgrowth, abortion or still birth, sharp decreasing in milk production, lameness, and blindness in some animals, some affected animals were dull and staying at wet and cool places {{for a long time and}} some were aggressive and fierce. On post-mortem of cattle affected with TME the blood vessels of the brain and meninges were severely congested. In addition minute foci of haemorrhage were observed on various sites of the brain. Lunges were congested and oedematous. <b>Petechial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> on skeletal muscles of the thighs was also observed. The Histopathological leasions observed in the brain section included thrombi, increasing gliosis and slight meningial haemorrhage. Bronchopneumonia, inflammatory cells infiltration and alveolar oedema and enphysema were seen in lung sections. Sera obtained from cattle showing clinical signs of TME were tested for presence of Haemophilus somnus antibodies in SAT, TAT and GID using antigens of five different strains of bacteria namely 13 A, 13 B, 12, 10 and 2. In SAT the seropositivity were 92 %, 73 %, 61. 6 %, 91. 4 % and 26. 5 % respectively. In TAT the percentage of positive sera were 95. 7 %, 87. 7 %, 85. 3 %, 95. 3 % and 59. 7 % respectively, however, non of the sera reacted in GID test. Using the above tests the prevalence of the disease in the total cattle of the State was about 3. 2 %. Administration of enrofloxacin (Avtryl- 5) intramuscularly at dose rate of 12. 5 mg/kg body weight of cattle for three successive days gave rise to a successful treatment and a partial recovery was achieved with oxytetracycline (oxtra- 5 %) given intramusculary at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg body weight of cattle for five days in early stage of the disease.
