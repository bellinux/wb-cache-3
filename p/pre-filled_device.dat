But problems of unsafe injection practices still persist. Now newer delivery devices like uniject are available for making vaccination very safe. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the Hepatitis-B (Shanvac-B) vaccine in Uniject <b>pre-filled</b> <b>device</b> administered to healthy adults and infants at 0, 1, 2 months schedule. METHODS: A total of 122 healthy subjects (62 adults and 60 infants) were administered three doses of the recombinant Hepatitis-B vaccine using Uniject <b>pre-filled</b> <b>device.</b> Blood samples for antibody titer estimation were taken before vaccination and 4 - 6 weeks after third dose. Subjects, parents or guardians were given diary cards to record any adverse reactions. RESULTS: Protective immune responses to the vaccine were seen in 96. 4 &#x 0025; of adults and 100 &#x 0025; of infants who completed the study. The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) in adults and infants were 518. 5 and 385. 41 mIU/ml respectively. Mild fever, itching, and swelling at injection site were the most common side effects observed. CONCLUSION: The safety and immunogenicity of the Hepatitis B Vaccine in the novel <b>pre-filled</b> <b>device</b> Uniject was effectively demonstrated in the present study...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} and {{architecture of the}} stratum corneum render it a formidable barrier to the topical and transdermal administration of therapeutic agents. The physicochemical constraints severely {{limit the number of}} molecules that can be considered as realistic candidates for transdermal delivery. Iontophoresis provides a mechanism to enhance the penetration of hydrophilic and charged molecules across the skin. The principal distinguishing feature is the control afforded by iontophoresis and the ability to individualize therapies. This may become significant as the impact of interindividual variations in protein expression and the effect on drug metabolism and drug efficacy is better understood. In this review we describe the underlying mechanisms that drive iontophoresis and we discuss the impact of key experimental parameters-namely, drug concentration, applied current and pH-on iontophoretic delivery efficiency. We present a comprehensive and critical review of the different therapeutic classes and molecules that have been investigated as potential candidates for iontophoretic delivery. The iontophoretic delivery of peptides and proteins is also discussed. In the final section, we describe the development of the first <b>pre-filled,</b> pre-programmed iontophoretic <b>device,</b> which is scheduled to be commercialized during the course of 2004...|$|R
