5|$|Patterns {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in the camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> have been studied. Although there are no subspecies, there is substantial genetic diversity within the species. Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited inbreeding within specific populations. This is similar to patterns described in Botta's <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> and the southern <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher,</b> {{both of which are}} members of the same genus. However, it contrasts with patterns noted in Baird's <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> and the plains <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher,</b> members of a separate genus, Geomys, which showed a higher degree of inbreeding.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{data on the}} {{longevity}} and mortality of the camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher.</b> It is presumably prey for carnivorous mammals, and its bones {{have been identified in}} regurgitated pellets of raptors such as the great horned owl. Parasites include mites, lice, fleas, roundworms and flatworms. The species' tougher skin may protect it from some fleas known to infest Botta's <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> and the Mazama <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher.</b> Mites known to parasitize the camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> include Androlaelaps geomys and Echinonyssus femuralis. Some authorities report Androlaelaps fahrenholzi as another parasitic mite, but a later publication did not report it. The chewing louse Geomydoecus oregonus has also been reported.|$|E

Other alpine flora, such as moss and lichens on the rocks, and wildflowers in season, make appearances. Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry, snowberry, willows and bog birch. Animals in the alpine zone include ptarmigans, small burrowing species like pika, marmots, and <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher,</b> and mountain goats.|$|E
5|$|The Texas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the}} surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> {{is found}} in the Willamette Valley and the {{drainage}} areas of the Yamhill River and other tributaries of the Willamette River. Its range extends north from Eugene to Portland and Forest Grove and west to Grand Ronde. A 1920 report of a Pleistocene fossil in Fort Rock, Oregon has been questioned, since it is far outside the species' current geographic range; as of 1987, the specimen could not be located for further evaluation.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{have seen}} a {{swimming}} ability in yellow-faced <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers.</b> However, this genus of <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> are less durable than other genera in water, {{perhaps because of the}} greater bulk (of its body) that inhibits its endurance.|$|R
40|$|In 1989 we {{postulated}} that using different varieties of alfalfa might minimize damages caused by <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (Geomys spp.). We tested a tap-rooted variety (Wrangler) and a fibrous-rooted variety (Spredor 2). From previous studies, Wrangler out performs Spredor 2 {{by as much}} as 27 % by the fourth year after planting. Spredor 2, however, has a creeping habit and it sends up new shoots on lateral roots. When a root breaks, it sends up new shoots. Therefore, we predicted that Spredor 2 would be damaged less by below-ground foraging by plains <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> (G. Bursarius). Additionally, Spredor 2 would send up new shoots when <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> damaged part of the root system and perhaps this would compensate for losses caused by gophers. During three difficult studies that were characterized by drought, floods, and predation on <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> by coyotes (Canis latrans), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensi), and badgers (Taxidea taxus), we finally had sufficient statistical power to make some conclusions. We planted the alfalfa varieties in 9 paired fields and further divided them in 2; with 1 field receiving <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> as a treatment and the other serving as a control. On the control fields, Wrangler out yielded Spredor 2 (P = 0. 01), but only by 9 %. Wrangler yields were reduced by 19 % (P = 0. 01) when <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> were present. We did not detect a difference in yields of Spredor 2 (P = 0. 30) due to <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers.</b> We think that these exciting data offer great promise to alfalfa growers that experience troubles with <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers.</b> We encourage others to duplicate these experiments in other regions...|$|R
5|$|Although the camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, it {{may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous {{and a few}} are predators. The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.|$|E
5|$|The camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> is, {{by a small}} margin, {{the largest}} member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E

5|$|The species' genetic {{diversity}} {{is similar to}} that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger geographic range and diversity of habitat. Compared to Townsend's <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher,</b> which is distributed across a much larger area, but less diverse habitat, it is more genetically heterogeneous. Although there is considerable differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers, their genetic variability does not affect the mammal's appearance. Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago. Such an event would cause a population bottleneck, leading to scattered, isolated populations.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move {{in and out of the}} park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher,</b> little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5000|$|Yellow-faced <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> usually inhabit deep sandy or silty soils {{that are}} {{relatively}} free from rocks. However, where Geomys (another genus of <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers)</b> is present, Cratogeomys {{is restricted to}} [...] "denser, shallower, sometimes rocket soils." [...] Research in Kansas showed that tracts that had no gophers occupying it consisted largely of areas with fine-textured soils that are planted with crops. The crops (corn, wheat, and grain sorghum) were harvested and disked annually along with the roadside ditches adjacent to the cropland. It was concluded that <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> {{are not able to}} inhabit these lands because land-use practices have destabilized the habitats, eliminating both refuge and dispersal corridors.|$|R

40|$|For many herbivorous mammals, oils from {{conifers}} are feeding repellents. Our {{study investigated}} effects of pine needle oil on feeding and other behaviors of northern <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers.</b> In one-choice feeding trials <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> were offered sweet potato from single feeding stations placed into each subject 2 ̆ 7 s home cage. Stations contained either a scent dispenser with pine needle oil or with mineral oil. Pine needle oil did not inhibit food retrieval under these conditions. Responses to pine needle oil {{and to a}} control odorant, d-pulegone, were also tested in mazes where subjects were offered choices between two goal boxes, each containing food associated with an odorant. To examine the possibility that <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> avoid any unfamiliar odor because of neophobia, freshly caught animals were tested in a maze offering a choice between goals scented with d-pulegone and goals containing mineral oil. The behavior of the animals {{in the side of}} the maze containing pulegone did not differ from their behavior in the side containing mineral oil, indicating indifference to this stimulus. Pine needle oil, however, elicited aversive responses. When one goal box contained pine needle oil, the second mineral oil, subjects were less frequently located {{in the side of the}} maze containing pine scent and consumed less food there. Responses of northern <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> to pine needle oil in mazes are similar to those of plains <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers</b> studied earlier under comparable conditions. Results obtained with both species suggest that pine needle oil may be an effective repellent for all species of <b>pocket</b> <b>gophers...</b>|$|R
5|$|The camas <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known}} as the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher, is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous gopher forages for vegetable and plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes color and texture over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth; males and females make purring (or crooning) sounds when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|E

25|$|Threats to {{the trees}} include land-clearing, rodents and exotic grasses. The {{non-native}} grasses are more aggressive and produce more seed than the native perennials, which attracts seed-eaters like Botta's <b>Pocket</b> <b>Gopher</b> that also feed on acorns and oak seedlings. Restoration includes breaching the levees, allowing floodwaters to scour out the non-native grasses, reduce rodent populations and deposit sediment. With the buildup of sand and sediments in the flooded areas, studies have shown an increase growth of cottonwoods and willows, which in turn trap more sediments during the next flood cycles.|$|E
25|$|The Aspen Parkland is {{agricultural}} land. The {{most prominent}} wildlife species {{which may be}} found are coyote (Canis latrans), hare, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), snowshoe hare, cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), northern <b>pocket</b> <b>gopher</b> (Thomomys talpoides), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii) and red fox. The Aspen Parkland is the environment of choice for the white-tailed deer. The Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion is characterized by white-tailed deer, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), coyote, rabbit, American badger (Taxidea taxus), red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and ground squirrel such as black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Animal populations of the Mixed Grassland enumerate pronghorn, white-tailed and mule deer, long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), small-footed myotis (Myotis subulatus), jack rabbit, coyote, Richardson's ground squirrel. The only Canadian site of black-tailed prairie dog is in the Mixed Grassland prairie ecoregion. The raised elevation of the Cypress Upland results in white spruce and aspen forests and an ecoregion more resembling the boreal forested areas than the prairielands. Moose, pronghorn, mule and white-tailed deer, elk, rabbit, and ground squirrel coyote are common in this ecoregion.|$|E
