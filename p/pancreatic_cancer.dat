5|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> <b>cancer</b> rarely occurs {{before the}} age of 40, {{and more than half of}} cases of {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. Risk factors for <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancer</b> include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5–10% are linked to inherited genes. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>cancer</b> is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stageI) to late (stageIV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.|$|E
40|$|TGF-β {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{to play an}} important role in the development of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> More than 50 % of human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers</b> bear mutations of Sma- and Mad-related protein (Smad) 4, a critical protein required for TGF-β signaling. To evaluate the in vivo function of TGF-β in the development of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers,</b> we generated a transgenic mouse model with pancreas-specific expression of Smad 7, a specific inhibitor of TGF-β signaling. Through the use of elastase I promoter, we directed the tissue specific expression of exogenous Smad 7. Consistently, the exogenous Smad 7 was detected only in the pancreas in the transgenic mice, and, furthermore, phosphorylation of Smad 2 was blocked in the pancreatic tissues. At 6 months of age, most transgenic animals developed premalignant ductal lesions in the pancreas, with characteristics of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a precursor to invasive <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> The premalignant lesions of the pancreas were accompanied by accelerated proliferation of the ductal epithelium and acinar cells, as well as increased fibrosis around the ductal lesions. This study not only demonstrated that in vivo inactivation of TGF-β signaling is implicated in the development of early stage of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers,</b> but also provided a promising animal model useful for the investigation and intervention of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers</b> in humans...|$|R

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the genetic and {{epigenetic}} changes that contribute to familial pancre-atic cancers. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the prevalence of common genetic and epigenetic alter-ations in sporadic and familial pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Methods: DNA was isolated from the microdissected cancers of 39 patients with familial and 36 patients with sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. KRAS 2 mutations were detected by BstN 1 digestion and/or cycle sequencing. TP 53 and SMAD 4 status were determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays of 23 archival familial pancreatic adeno-carcinomas and in selected cases by cycle sequencing to identify TP 53 gene mutations. Methylation-specific PCR analysis of seven genes (FoxE 1, NPTX 2, CLDN 5, P 16, TFPI- 2, SPARC, ppENK) was done on a subset of fresh-frozen familial pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Results: KRAS 2 mutations were identified in 31 of 39 (80 %) of the familial versus 28 of 36 (78 %) of the sporadic <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> Positive immunolabeling for p 53 was observed in 57 % of the familial <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers</b> and loss of SMAD 4 labeling was observed in 61 % of the familial <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers,</b> rates similar to those observed in sporadic <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> The mean prevalence of aberrant methylation in the familial <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers</b> was 68. 4 %, which was not significantly different from that observed in sporadic <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> Conclusion: The prevalence of mutant KRAS 2, inacti-vation of TP 53 and SMAD 4, and aberrant DNA methylation of a seven-gene panel is similar in familial pancreatic adenocarcinomas as in sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. These findings support the use of markers of sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinomas to detect familial <b>pancreatic</b> adenocarcinomas.

Aberrant expression of miRNAs may also contribute to the development and progression of human hepatobiliary and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> Recent studies have shown that some miRNAs play roles as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in hepatobiliary and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> miR- 122, let- 7 family, and miR- 101 are downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that it is a potential tumor suppressor of HCC. miR- 221 and miR- 222 are up-regulated in HCC and may act as oncogenic miRNAs in hepatocarcinogenesis. miRNA expression profiling may be a powerful clinical tool for diagnosis and regulation of miRNA expression could be a novel therapeutic strategy for hepatobiliary and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the roles of important tumor suppressor microRNAs and oncogenic microRNAs in hepatobiliary and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

This study investigated the clinical significance of the immunohistochemical localization of EGFR in patients with metastatic <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers</b> compared to those with surgically resected <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers.</b> Using 44 surgically resected primary <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers</b> and 40 primary or meta-static tumors from 20 autopsied patients with far advanced <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers,</b> the incidence of membranous and cytoplasmic EGFR overexpression was compared between primary tumors and far advanced tumors by immunohistochemistry using the Dako EGFR pharmDx™ kit, a global standard kit for EGFR assay. In the 44 surgically resected cancers, 13 (30 %) exhibited membranous overexpression of EGFR, comprising 1 case (2 %) with score 3 + and 12 cases (27 %) with score 2 + and 10 (23 %) exhibited cytoplasmic overexpression of EGFR. In the 40 tumors at a far advanced stage, the percentage of samples exhibiting positivity for membranous and cytoplasmic EGFR overexpression was 48 % (19 of 40) comprising 7 (18 %) with score 2 + and 12 (30 %) with score 3 + and 33 % (13 of 40), respectively. The far advanced tumors tended to show membranous and cytoplasmic EGFR overexpression more frequently than the surgically resected tumors, although the difference was not significant. These findings suggest that membranous and cytoplasmic overexpression of EGFR may be indicative of the potential aggressiveness of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

To identify miRNA signatures that may encode a difference, microarrays comprising 887 human miRNAs in strictly matched early stage (I-II) <b>pancreatic</b> body/tail <b>cancers</b> and head cancers were performed and the results were further verified by qRT-PCR. We found remarkably down-regulated miR- 501 - 3 p and up-regulated miR- 375 expressions in <b>pancreatic</b> body/tail <b>cancer</b> compared with head cancer. The recurrence rate was obviously lower in <b>pancreatic</b> body/tail <b>cancer,</b> and the down-regulation of miR- 501 - 3 p was significantly associated with low-risk of recurrence after curative surgery. By in vitro study, we provided first evidence that miR- 501 - 3 p could promote invasion of PDAC cells (Panc- 1 and Colo 357) possibly via decreasing the expression of E-Cadherin.
