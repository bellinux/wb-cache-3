50|$|With {{the use of}} precast shapes, crew sizing can be minimized. Speed of {{installation}} {{is another}} obvious benefit to both the installer and the owner, resulting in reduced costs due to shorter job duration. Material usage is also reduced, {{when compared to other}} installation methods such as guniting, where as much as 45% of extra material is required to compensate for rebound and other job losses. Environmental hazards such as dusting and tripping hazards associated with equipment and hoses are also reduced substantially, if not eliminated. Future repairs also become much more economical and quicker to accomplish. Repair areas can be isolated to just the immediate wear area within the boundaries of a shape. Anchor attachment points can typically be reused. Replacement shapes, purchased early and kept as spare parts on site, can be easily installed in a fraction of the time required for conventional repair methods. The initial bake-out of a new refractory lining on site can be a very expensive and time-consuming component of a refractory repair project. The use of precast and <b>prefired</b> refractory shapes can sometimes reduce or even eliminate the need for an extensive initial bake-out. If an entire repair is made with a <b>prefired</b> system, then normal furnace start up schedules can be used, without the fear of steam spalls or other damage during the initial heating. Bake-out of multi-component linings, which may include a combination of precast shapes and other materials placed in the field, can often be reduced by the pre-firing of the castable shapes, particularly if that material would have been the critical item determining the bake out schedule. This can {{have a positive impact on}} not only job costs, but in reducing down time as well.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{papers have}} {{reported}} on LTCC tapes for high frequency applications with K values from 4 - 16. High K (50 - 250) capacitor and high permeability (50 - 500) inductor materials {{have also been}} developed for buried component applications. Limitations in these materials have resulted in interest in transfer tapes (LTTT). These are laminated directly to <b>prefired</b> substrates. The resulting zero XY shrinkage provides precise dimensions while the intimate contact to ceramic substrates provides improved thermal conductivity and added strength. This paper presents a technology that {{takes advantage of the}} strengths of both. The new technology offers the ability to cofire multiple layers of lead free tape onto a ceramic substrate using low cost parallel processing. Test parts were built with LTCC tapes using low cost silver. Metallized layers were stacked before lamination to the ceramic substrate. Capacitors and inductors were formed in these structures. Symmetrical placement of the components was not required because the restricted XY shrinkage limits warping. Photoimageing on intermediate <b>prefired</b> layers can be used to attain precision feature definition. This technology also provides the ability to fire specific components at optimized temperatures directly on the <b>prefired</b> substrate as well as for placing low loss transmission lines before the laminate is applied. Data will be presented for the capacitors and inductors buried in these structures on alumina substrates...|$|E

40|$|The time {{interval}} between stand-replacing fires can influence patterns of initial postfire succession if {{the abundance of}} postfire propagules varies with <b>prefire</b> stand age. We examined the effect of fire interval on initial postfire lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) density in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) following the 1988 fires. We asked whether postfire propagule abundance, measured as <b>prefire</b> percent serotiny, varied with fire interval and could explain patterns in postfire succession. The response of lodgepole pine density to variation in fire interval was explained by spatial and temporal variation in <b>prefire</b> serotiny. At low elevations, postfire lodgepole pine recruitment correlated strongly with <b>prefire</b> percent serotiny, which varied nonlinearly with <b>prefire</b> stand age. As a result, postfire lodgepole pine densities varied nonlinearly with fire interval. In contrast, at high elevations serotiny was low, varied little with stand age and did not influence postfire lodgepole pine densities, although, fire interval was still {{a significant predictor of}} postfire densities. At high elevations, fire interval varied nonlinearly with postfire lodgepole densities, presumably due to the temporal variation in propagule abundance from open cones in adjacent unburned stands. Temporal variation in stand-level serotiny at low elevations was best explained by age of individual trees. Logistic regression indicated that trees expected to be serotinous had a low probability of exhibiting serotiny at a young age, with increasing probability as trees matured up to 140 yr. This increase in serotiny with tree age likely accounts for the initial increase in stand-level percent serotiny with stand age at low elevations. The spatial variation in serotiny was correlated with variation in historical fire regimes. Fire interval models derived from lower elevations in YNP indicate that fire occurred historically at 135 – 185 -yr intervals, whereas at higher elevations fires occurred at 280 – 310 -yr intervals. The spatial patterns of serotiny appear to have been influenced by variability in historical fire regimes across the Yellowstone landscape, which has conditioned contemporary successional responses to disturbance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Postfire {{development}} of cover and diversity was studied in an upland Picea mariana-dominated {{forest in the}} Canadian Subarctic. Short-term vegetation responses of 10 - and 22 -year-old cleared rights-of-way and a forest site were investigated two and three growing seasons after a wildfire. <b>Prefire</b> and postfire investigation of the study site allowed direct comparison of species cover and frequency values, {{as well as the}} Shannon-Wiener diversity index, before and after the fire. The fire considerably reduced diversity on all sites. Species diversity increased with the level of <b>prefire</b> disturbance. <b>Prefire</b> disturbance influenced the fire’s characteristics by altering the fuel load and soil moisture, which in turn affected the postfire revegetation through different soil and microclimatic conditions. The sites that were most severely disturbed before the fire experienced the most rapid revegetation, including the highest diversity index and highest plant cover. Of the sites that were undisturbed before the fire, the natural drainage swales offered the best growing conditions after the burn. Furthermore, <b>prefire</b> disturbance increased the patchiness of the burned area, and the residual flora of unburned patches added to postfire floristic diversity.

40|$|CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, {{has started}} {{construction}} of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a superconducting accelerator that will collide protons at a center of mass energy of 14 TeV from the year 2005 onwards. The kicker magnet pulse generators of the LHC beam extraction system require fast high power switches. One possible type is the pseudospark switch (PSS) which has several advantages for this application. A PSS fulfilling most of the requirements has been developed in the past years. Two outstanding problems, <b>prefiring</b> at high operating voltages and sudden current interruptions (quenching) at low voltage could be solved recently. <b>Prefiring</b> can be avoided for this special application by conditioning the switch at two times the nominal voltage after each power pulse. Quenching can be suppressed by choosing an appropriate electrode geometry and by mixing Krypton to the D 2 gas atmosphere. One remaining problem, related to the required large dynamic voltage range (1. 7 kV to 30 kV) is under active investigation: steps in forward voltage during conduction, occurring at low operation voltage at irregular time instants and causing a pulse to pulse jitter of the peak current.

This research investigates several methods used to obtain low loss, highly compact power supplies. Within these constraints, the Dissertation investigates the issues of design, materials, and cost in order to design and achieve these miniaturized power supplies. This research addresses high performance ceramic, passive component integration. Three key issues; electrical characterization, thermal analysis and simulation, and material characterization, are examined in this work. Thick film passive components (capacitors and resistors) on AlN have been developed. Also, guidelines for the design implementation and steps necessary to integrate these passive components on <b>prefired</b> alumina (Al 2 O 3) and aluminum nitride (AlN) ceramic surfaces, for power electronic applications, have been generated. The use of aluminum nitride, as a high performance ceramic substrate and the resulting issues concerning compatible inks, have been investigated. Since a sizable amount of heat is generated by power electronic circuits, the integrated components are analyzed with respect to tolerance and degeneration over a range of temperatures and frequencies. Thick film capacitors on the order of 120 pF/mm with breakdown voltage ratings of 250 V have been developed on <b>prefired</b> AlN. Resistors were developed with impedances ranging from 10 W to 10 MegW.

40|$|A low-clay {{version of}} fine {{translucent}} china {{was designed to}} have desired properties and acceptable behaviour during manufacture. Low-clay contents of 10 to ISw/o were employed to reduce the deterious effects of preferential clay particle alignment and its adverse effect on colour. For example, alignment of clay particles in cast wares causes anisotropic drying and firing shrinkages and these cause distortion. Replacing clay with a pre fired body with low Fe and Ti contents, as in the present case, allowed a very white material to be produced. The <b>prefired</b> body was made with calcium carbonate, aluminium trihydroxide, quartz and a small fluxing addition of an hydrated magnesIUm carbonate. Desification of a whiteware is enhanced by increasing volume fraction of the viscous liquid and reducing by its viscosity. Both of these also enhance sagging. Consequently, compositional change cannot on its own lead to the favourable combination of high density, required to give translucency, with little sagging, that will allow wares to be fired without significant distortion. It was found by trail and error that use of finer particles reduced the sagging occurring in the densification heat treatment and enhanced densification. This finding allowed the body to be designed so that it densified without sagging excessively. After establishing this important result, an iterative approach was employed to produce a ware that was very white, translucent, had the required thermal expansion coefficient for glaze fitting, shrank acceptably during the first firing and did not sag during the second firing that stimulated glost firing. The finding on sagging was applied to an anorthite/mullite porcelain body that was under development. This body was also made with a low-clay content and the same <b>prefired</b> body. This whitware has potential to replace bone china and hard porcelain {{for use in the}} servere service conditions of hotels and restaurants. It has a higher fracture toughness than hard porcelain but has the same scratch resistant glaze and is more resistant to thermal shock. The sagging of the anorthite/mullite porcelain was substantially reduced while the body was densified. This was achieved by using a combination of finer particles and a reduction in the liquid-phase content that developed during firing...|$|E

The technology seems to show a simplification: the early Islamic glazes were applied on <b>prefired</b> bodies and after fritting a lead-silica mixture, whereas for the later Islamic productions the raw materials for the lead glazes were not fritted and they were applied over unfired bodies.

This was achieved by applying the glaze in a different manner (on one side of the pot to obtain yellow or on both sides to btain green), or using different pastes (already used to produce pottery for different uses). Finally, there are differences between Islamic and Hispano-Moresque tin glazes related to the crystal size of the opacifier (tin oxide crystals), which should indicate some technological differences in temperature, glaze composition and the process to obtain the frits because of the high dependence b tween viscosity, temperature and crystal nucleatio...|$|E

Species {{diversity of the}} <b>prefire</b> fungal flora was very high, including {{a high proportion of}} locally rare species and four threatened polypore species in Finland. In 1992 part of the study area (7. 3 ha) was clear-cut and a 1. 7 ha forest stand in the center of study area was left standing with a tree volume of 150 m 3 /ha, and later on (June 1 st) in the same year the whole area was burned. Burning was very efficient and all trees in the forest stand were dead one year after the fire. Also the ground layer burned almost completely. In 1993 the fungal flora of the 284 sample trees was studied again. Most of the trees had burned strongly and the fungal species diversity and the evenness in community structure had decreased considerably as compared with the <b>prefire</b> community. Species turnover was also great, especially in corticoid fungi. Greatest losses in the species numbers occurred in moderately and strongly decayed trees, in coniferous trees and in very strongly burned trees. Fungal flora of non-decayed and slightly decayed trees, deciduous trees and slightly burned trees seemed to have survived the fire quite well, and in these groups the species numbers had increased slightly as compared with the <b>prefire</b> community. Fungal species suffering from fire (anthracophobe species) were mainly growing in moderately and strongly decayed trees before the fire, whereas species favoured by fire (anthracophile species) were growing in less decayed trees.

This study used landscape-scale variations in environmental conditions, stand structure, and disturbance from an extreme fire year in Alaska to examine how these factors affected successional trajectories in boreal forests dominated by black spruce. Because fire intervals in interior Alaska are typically too short to allow relay succession, the initial cohorts of seedlings that recruit after fire largely determine future canopy composition.

A low-clay {{translucent}} whiteware {{has been}} formulated and the {{studies have been}} carried out to establish the necessary conditions required for different whiteware manufacturing processes, such as slip casting. The aim of the present work is to identify the conditions for the preparation of stable low-clay whiteware slips with high solids content for the production of slip-cast objects with improved properties, as well as to establish a relationship between the slip properties and the final object properties. The slips containing 88 wt % nonplastic <b>prefired</b> materials and 12 wt % clay mixtures were prepared and the effects of type and amount of various commercial deflocculants and solids content on the casting behaviour were investigated. It was found that for each deflocculant there exists an optimum concentration range within which low viscosity is achieved for a slip of high solids content. It was determined that the addition of 0. 1 % Dolaflux SP NEU commercial deflocculant was enough to reduce the viscosity at a level required for successful casting. Casting trials showed that the combination of high slip solids content and slower casting rate results in objects with higher densities both in the green and fired state.

40|$|Solid state {{electrochemical}} {{sensors that}} measure nitrogen oxides (NOx) in lean exhaust {{have been investigated}} {{in order to help}} meet future on-board diagnostic (OBD) regulations for diesel vehicles. This impedancemetric detection technology consists of a planar, single cell sensor design with various sensing electrode materials and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte. No reference to ambient air is required. An impedance analysis method yields a signal that is proportional to the analyte gas concentration at a specific frequency. These sensors function by detecting the change in impedance caused by electron exchange in the redox reactions of NOx gases at the sensing electrodes. From the impedance data, the resulting shift in phase angle is calculated, which can be calibrated to yield to the NOx concentration at low parts per million (ppm) levels. The applicability of surface micromachining techniques to unfired ceramic sheets has been evaluated for the potential to reduce the size and mass of sensors. A reduction in size according to the principles of microsystems technologies (MST) is desired for faster light-off, lower temperature operation, decreased heater power, and a faster response leading to decreased emissions. Both wet and dry etching have been investigated. These techniques, however, were not effective at micromachining unfired ceramic sheets of partially stabilized zirconia. Three varieties of impedance-based, lean NOx sensors have been fabricated manually, tested with both NO and NO 2 gases at concentrations typical of diesel exhaust, and analyzed under various conditions. All sensors consisted of a planar, single cell design. Sensing electrodes were either gold wire or <b>prefired,</b> gelcast lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM, La 0. 85 Sr 0. 15 MnO 3). The LSM sensors were mounted on dense substrates consisting either of alumina (Al 2 O 3) or of partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ, ZrO 2 with Y 2 O 3). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were used to interrogate the sensors. At low frequency (10 Hz), a signal was obtained proportional to low analyte gas concentration. The effects of temperature, total gas flow rate, and cross sensitivity to oxygen were examined for all sensors. Sensors with gold wire electrodes showed higher sensitivity to NOx than gelcast LSM sensors. None of the impedancemetric sensors showed dependence on total gas flow rate within the examined flow range of 100 - 500 sccm. They did exhibit, however, cross sensitivity to O 2, requiring Po 2 to be known in order to evaluate NOx concentration. In addition, a strong temperature dependence was observed for the sensors with gold wire electrodes. The phase angles correlated linearly with temperature at 10 ^ 5 Hz. Generally, lowering the sensing temperatures resulted in larger phase angle responses, possibly due to the slower kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at lower temperatures. The lowest temperature evaluated for sensors with gold wire electrodes, 600 °C, exhibited the largest change in phase angle. Nevertheless, even the lowest operating temperature examined was several hundred degrees above the temperature of the exhaust in the designated location of the sensor, requiring the sensors described herein to be continuously heated by a separate power source. At high frequency (10 ^ 5 Hz), a linear correlation between phase angle and temperature was observed between 600 - 700 °C in the sensors with gold wire working electrodes. As a result, a stable sensor could be calibrated to serve as a thermometer. Equivalent circuit modeling was performed for the sensors in order to better understand the processes underlying the sensing mechanism. Excellent agreement with gold sensor data was obtained with a R 0 -(R 1 C 1) -(R 2 C 2) circuit. The subcircuit elements are associated with the following physical processes: (0) contact resistance, (1) charge transport through electrolyte bulk, and (2) adsorption and dissociation of O 2. NOx exposure evoked changes in the parameter values of R 2 and C 2 only. Both varied linearly over the entire range of NO (0 - 100 ppm). This finding suggests that these parameters can be calibrated to determine NO concentration. The rate limiting step was likely a process with atomic oxygen such as dissociation or surface diffusion. An equivalent circuit with an additional Cole element successfully modeled the output of the NOx sensors with LSM electrodes: R 0 -(R 1 Q 1) -(R 2 Q 2) -(R 3 Q 3). The Cole element accounted for the additional time constant exhibited by the impedance spectra. The subcircuit elements were associated with similar physical processes as the sensors with gold wires except the additional circuit element (2) was attributed to an electrode-based conductivity process (through electrode bulk or interfacial conductivity). Design of experiments techniques were applied to the NOx sensors with gold wire electrodes. The optimum sensor design was achieved with a thicker electrolyte and was insensitive to the spacing between sensing electrodes. Within the design space investigated, the surface area of the electrode affected NO 2 -sensing and specifically reduced surface area enhanced detection. Equivalent circuit modeling performed in conjunction with the optimization studies confirmed that R 1 in the model of the system with gold electrodes refers to bulk electrolyte resistance. Thicker porous electrolyte resulted in lower resistance, contrary to expectations, suggesting that the increased surface area is involved in the sensing mechanism. Although the sensor results showed promise, the technology based on this material system faces several challenges prior to commercialization. Signal drift and poor manufacturability are interrelated problems. Signal drift results from microstructural changes (aging) in the electrolyte during exposure to high temperature gases. Elevating the sintering temperature to 1500 °C as is standard practice in the manufacturing of oxygen sensors using high temperature cofired ceramic (HTCC) methods would mitigate aging by completing the microstructural phase transformation, however, this temperature would degrade the electrodes. Typically the electrodes and electrolyte are cofired in order to achieve good contact, but at 1500 °C the gold electrodes would melt, and the LSM electrodes would form nonconductive zirconate phases. Microfabrication methods that physically deposit the electrolyte might address the aging issue, but this approach would require significant cost reduction analysis and implementation in order to be successful in the marketplace. In summary, this dissertation presents research that is novel in numerous respects. It relates the first publicly available study of surface micromachining techniques applied to unfired sheets of ceramic material. In addition, it contains the first ever published optimization study of impedance-type NOx sensors; design of experiments techniques were applied to sensors with gold wire electrodes. Last of all, this treatise conveys the first ever analysis of gelcast LSM electrodes used in a NOx sensor...|$|E

40|$|Quantifying biomass {{consumption}} and carbon release {{is critical to}} understanding the role of fires in the carbon cycle and air quality. We present a methodology to estimate the biomass consumed and the carbon released by the California Rim fire by integrating postfire airborne LiDAR and multitemporal Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. First, a support vector regression (SVR) model was trained to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) from LiDAR-derived metrics over the unburned area. The selected model estimated AGB with an R 2 of 0. 82 and RMSE of 59. 98 [*]Mg/ha. Second, LiDAR-based biomass estimates were extrapolated to the entire area {{before and after the}} fire, using Landsat OLI reflectance bands, Normalized Difference Infrared Index, and the elevation derived from LiDAR data. The extrapolation was performed using SVR models that resulted in R 2 of 0. 73 and 0. 79 and RMSE of 87. 18 (Mg/ha) and 75. 43 (Mg/ha) for the postfire and <b>prefire</b> images, respectively. After removing bias from the AGB extrapolations using a linear relationship between estimated and observed values, we estimated the {{biomass consumption}} from postfire LiDAR and <b>prefire</b> Landsat maps to be 6. 58 [*]±[*] 0. 03 [*]Tg (1012 [*]g), which translate into 12. 06 [*]±[*] 0. 06 Tg CO 2 e released to the atmosphere, equivalent to the annual emissions of 2. 57 million cars.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Four {{studies were}} conducted. First, {{mountain}} big sagebrush communities were burned at Lava Beds National Monument, California, and The Crooked River National Grassland, Oregon. In {{two years at}} Lava Beds, basal cover of Idaho fescue in one community and Thur- ber's needlegrass {{in one of three}} communities did not recover. Basal cover of bluebunch wheatgrass and Sandberg's bluegrass re- covered or increased above <b>prefire</b> levels at the expense of Idaho fescue and Thurber's needlegrass. Bunchgrasses recovery was based on height and production which increased to equal or exceed <b>prefire</b> levels. At Crooked River, height and production of bluebunch wheat- grass were much higher than <b>prefire</b> levels, but basal cover remain- ed extremely low after two years. Prescribed burning recommenda- tions were presented. Secondly, after hot and cool in situ propane barrel burns, mountain big sagebrush seed emergence in the greenhouse was stimu- lated. Basin big sagebrush seed emergence was reduced by both fire intensities. Emergence was inverse to fire intensity for both sub- species. Wyoming big sagebrush was not affected by fire. Both in- tensities reduced emergence of most herbaceous species from mountain big sagebrush dominated soils. Hot fires were required to reduce emergence of the few herbaceous species affected by fire on basin and especially Wyoming big sagebrush dominated soils. A trend of in- creasing fire resistance with increasing site severity was evident. Thirdly, individual and area fuel loading equations were de- veloped for each component of fuel of the three subspecies of big sagebrush. R² values for individual shrub equations ranged from. 36 to. 96. Line intercept cover, the number, and the height of intercepted shrubs were used to estimate area fuel loadings with R² values ranging from. 42 to. 84. This method of estimating area fuel loading provides relatively high precision at reduced cost. Fourthly, basal cover and leaf length or plant height were used to estimate bunchgrass production. R² values for burned plant equations were higher (. 66 -. 87) than R² values for unburned- ungrazed plant equations (. 35 -. 85). Basal cover accounted for at least 70 percent of the variation in Thurber's needlegrass, burned Idaho fescue, and burned bluebunch wheatgrass production. Comparisons based on indirect estimation yielded results comparable to clipping...|$|R
