5|$|By war's end, Black Hawk and {{nineteen}} {{other leaders}} of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks.

On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in Washington, D.C., before being taken to Fort Monroe.

5|$|Etty did not base The Combat on {{any single}} {{incident}} from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, {{but on his}} own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> him separately in his studio, {{rather than as a}} group.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the bottoms of her breasts showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Ivory and the Right to Censor began feuding with Chyna {{after the}} latter <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Playboy in late 2000.

Chyna challenged Ivory for the Women's Championship at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001. Ivory retained her title when she pinned Chyna, who had appeared to re-aggravate her neck injury. Chyna challenged Ivory {{for the title}} once more at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 and defeated Ivory in a brief match, ending Ivory's third reign as Women's Champion. The Right to Censor stable was finally disbanded on April 26, 2001.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, Monroe {{spent most of her}} {{childhood}} in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a radioplane factory in 1944 as part of the war effort, she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946–1947) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story resulted in increased interest in her films.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
