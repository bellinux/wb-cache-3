The 1991 budget, {{in which he}} seized the {{opportunity}} presented by Thatcher's resignation to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to the basic rate of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by two percentage points, was greeted by positive coverage in The Economist which dubbed him a Nimble Novice. In the 1992 budget his proposal to advance to a 20% basic rate of income tax {{through a combination of}} a narrow initial band, a cut in tax on deposit interest and curtailment of tax allowances was hailed as an elegant way of combining populism with progressivism, though events were later to lend support to Nigel Lawson's view that this approach was strategically inept. His final budget in 1993 was more sympathetically received by financial specialists than John Major's 1990 budget or Kenneth Clarke's budget of November 1993. Lamont attributes the large <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>borrowing</b> <b>requirement</b> (i.e. fiscal deficit) of these years to the depth of the recession triggered by his inability to cut interest rates sooner within the ERM.|$|E
2500|$|Lamont's second {{task was}} to reduce {{government}} borrowing, which was rising sharply because of the twofold impact of the ERM on the public finances. The loss of output had reduced tax revenues and increased public spending as unemployment rose. The sharp falls in inflation further reduced tax revenues compared to previous forecasts {{at the same time}} as increasing public spending after inflation, because public spending is planned in cash terms which becomes worth more in real terms if inflation falls. The March 1993 budget forecast a <b>Public</b> <b>Sector</b> <b>Borrowing</b> <b>Requirement</b> for 1993-94 of £50bn, equivalent to 8% of GDP. [...] In terms of the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement, the definition currently in use to measure the UK government deficit, the actual deficit for 1993–94 of 6.9% was the highest since 1975–76 at 9.2% but just over half the 13.3% deficit projected for 2009–10 in the April 2009 budget.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In both {{economically}} {{developed and}} developing countries, privatisation, budget austerity measures and market liberalisations have become key aspects of structural reform programs {{in the last three}} decades. These three recommended policies were parts of strong revival of classical and new-classical school of thought since the middle of 70 s. Such programs aim to achieve higher microeconomic efficiency and foster economic growth, whilst also aspiring to reduce <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>borrowing</b> <b>requirements</b> through the elimination of unnecessary subsidies. For firms to achieve superior performance a change in ownership from public (state ownership) to private has been recommended as a vital condition. To assess the ownership role, the economic performances of private, public and mixed enterprises in Austria is compared through the use of factor analysis method. The extracted factors, using data of two years, 1998 and 2000, do not pick ownership as a key performance factor. ...|$|R

High interest rates prevalent in the Turkish economy also push SMEs to stay liquid instead of going to investment. This finding provides support to the complementarity theories which suggest that companies choose between investing their funds to the financial assets or real assets. Since the investment in the financial assets finances the soaring <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>borrowing</b> <b>requirements,</b> it doesn't immediately channel back to the real economy.

40|$|Current account {{imbalances}} have {{in recent}} years become a concern of policy makers and public opinion {{in a number of}} countries. It is often argued that budget imbalances of the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> are {{at the root of the}} current account imbalances. The aim of this paper is to provide a suitable framework for investigating the determinants of the current account and to use this framework to study the relationship between budget- and current-account imbalances. It is concluded that reactions of the private sector to goverment policies may partially, fully, or even more than fully offset the effects on the current account of budget consolidation efforts depending on the way in which fiscal policy is altered to achieve a reduction in the <b>public</b> <b>sector’s</b> <b>borrowing</b> <b>requirement.</b> Simple correlations between fiscal deficits and the current account may be misleading, not only due to the presence of other shocks, but also because it matters how the deficit is changed. ...|$|R

40|$|When economies "dollarize," their {{exchange}} rate and monetary policy, both {{considered to be}} sources of instability, are simultaneously discarded. Often, dollarization becomes an attractive option for developing countries that have experienced successive failures of {{exchange rate}} and monetary management. This paper makes use of a theoretical model that shows, contrary to the commonly accepted view, that a dollarized economy would experience financial instability {{in the event of}} external shocks should it attempt to operate discretionary fiscal policies. Shocks not simultaneously contained by adjustments to spending would lead to ever-increasing fiscal and current account deficits because <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>borrowing</b> <b>requirements</b> can only be financed by selling bonds in the open market at constantly rising rates of interest. Hence, such a path cannot be an option. Alternatively, if fiscal spending were curbed at par with the shock, external and current account balances would converge to equilibrium, but trigger a recession and increased unemployment. Since this, too, is unacceptable, dollarization {{turns out to be a}} "dead end. "...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{adjustment}} of budget figures for the effect of inflation {{on the value of}} government debt. It asks whether such adjustment improves their performance as a measure of 'fiscal impact'. If inflation significantly influences the impact of budgets on the real economy, policy-makers may make inappropriate fiscal policy decisions if they are guided by unadjusted budget figures. The article argues that if agents perceive holdings of government debt as part of their wealth, changes in the real value of debt will have an effect on consumption behaviour. Therefore {{to assess the impact of}} fiscal policy on consumption it may be necessary to adjust budget figures so that they accurately indicate changes in the real value of debt held by the private sector. This article adjusts a series of structural <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>borrowing</b> <b>requirements</b> (PSBR) for the effect of inflation on the real value of government debt held by the private sector. An empirical analysis concludes that the inflation-adjusted budget series provides a superior measure of fiscal impact on consumption, and hence the real economy.

We find empirical evidence that too much <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>borrowing</b> harms financial deepening, and that banks mainly lending to the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> tend to be more profitable but less efficient.

The rising trend of the general government debt/GDP ratio was reversed in 1989, as a surge in tax revenues linked to the tax reform and the shrinking public enterprise deficits reduced the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>borrowing</b> <b>requirement</b> (PSBR) relative to GDP.
