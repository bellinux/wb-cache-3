One can distinguish medial and lateral {{components in the}} pathway, originating in corresponding medial and lateral subdivisions of EC. We analyzed the innervation by medial and lateral <b>perforant</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>fibers</b> of parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the subiculum. A neuroanatomical tracer (biotinylated dextran amine, BDA) was stereotaxically injected in the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, thus selectively labeling either perforant pathway component. Transport was allowed for 1 week. Transported BDA was detected with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor™ 488. Parvalbumin neurons were visualized via immunofluorescence histochemistry, using the fluorochrome Alexa Fluor™ 594. Via a random systematic sampling scheme using a two-channel, sequential-mode confocal laser scanning procedure, we obtained image series at high magnification from the molecular layer of the subiculum. Labeled entorhinal fibers and parvalbumin-expressing structures were three dimensionally (3 D) reconstructed using computer software. Further computer analysis revealed that approximately 16 % of the 3 D objects ('boutons') of BDA-labeled fibers was engaged in contacts with parvalbumin-immunostained dendrites in the subiculum. Both medial and lateral <b>perforant</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>fibers</b> and their boutons formed such appositions. Contacts are suggestive for synapses. We found {{no significant differences between}} the medial and lateral components in the relative numbers of contacts. Thus, the medial and lateral subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex similarly tune the firing of principal neurons in the subiculum by way of parvalbumin positive interneurons in their respective terminal zones. © 2008 IBRO...|$|R
40|$|The {{entorhinal cortex}} (EC) conveys {{information}} to hippocampal field CA 1 either directly {{by way of}} projections from principal neurons in layer III, or indirectly by axons from layer II via the dentate gyrus, CA 3, and Schaffer collaterals. These two pathways differentially influence activity in CA 1, yet conclusive evidence is lacking whether {{and to what extent}} they converge onto single CA 1 neurons. Presently we studied such convergence. Different neuroanatomical tracers injected into layer III of EC and into CA 3, respectively, tagged simultaneously the direct entorhino-hippocampal fibers and the indirect innervation of CA 1 neurons by Schaffer collaterals. In slices of fixed brains we intracellularly filled CA 1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (LM) and stratum radiatum (SR). Sections of these slices were scanned in a confocal laser scanning microscope. 3 D-reconstruction was used to determine whether boutons of the labeled input fibers were in contact with the intracellularly filled neurons. We analyzed 12 pyramidal neurons and 21 interneurons. Perforant path innervation to pyramidal neurons in our material was observed to be denser than that from CA 3. All pyramidal neurons and 17 of the interneurons received contacts of both perforant pathway and Schaffer input on their dendrites and cell bodies. Four interneurons, which were completely embedded in LM, received only labeled perforant pathway input. Thus, we found convergence of both projection systems on single CA 1 pyramidal and interneurons with dendrites that access the layers where <b>perforant</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>fibers</b> and Schaffer collaterals end. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

Consequently, {{over the course of}} three studies, the current dissertation aimed to narrow this research gap by addressing the following research questions: 1) Which <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways</b> support early literacy skill in young children 5 - 10 years old? 2) Are microstructural properties of these tracts predictive of age-related changes in reading across an interval of two years? 3) Do different components of the recently identified VOF differentially support reading? To answer these questions, we used diffusion-weighted imaging to measure white-matter development and to relate the microstructural properties of each <b>fiber</b> <b>pathway</b> to early literacy and literacy development. We report several novel findings that contribute to our growing understanding of the white matter connections supporting early literacy and literacy. For the first time, these studies revealed that the re-identified VOF can be reliably tracked in young children, bilaterally and is composed of three main components, which project from occipital temporal sulcus to angular, and middle and superior occipital gyri.

Thus, astrocyte engagement in the fully developed mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>pathway</b> was slow and territorial, contrary to that frequently proposed for astrocytes within microcircuits.

40|$|The retrogenesis {{model of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits {{that changes in}} white matter (WM) follow an inverse pattern of myelogenesis. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{was used to test}} the retrogenesis model. Specifically, greater loss of WM {{microstructural}} integrity (e. g., lower values of fractional anisotropy; FA) was predicted in late -myelinating WM <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways</b> (e. g., association pathways) in AD patients relative to healthy older adults, whereas early-myelinating <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways</b> (e. g., projection pathways) were not expected to show group differences. Furthermore, it has been proposed that AD includes a disconnection syndrome. Thus, higher cognitive functions dependent upon the synchronization of distributed neural networks (e. g., executive functions) were predicted to correlate with WM integrity. This study included 16 AD patients (mean age = 77. 4, 64 % female) and 14 demographically-matched healthy older adults (mean age = 77. 3, 50 % female). Image processing via tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to perform voxelwise statistics across subjects on FA skeleton maps. Additionally, region of interest (ROI) group comparisons were performed on early-myelinating (posterior limb of internal capsule, cerebral peduncles), late-myelinating (inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus), and commissural (genu, splenium) <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways.</b> Permutation-based voxelwise analysis corrected for multiple comparisons revealed significantly lower FA values in AD patients compared to healthy older adults in late-myelinating association <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways</b> (superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus) and other <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways</b> that connect brain regions afflicted early by AD neuropathology (cingulum, fornix, splenium; p <. 05). No significant differences were seen in early-myelinating pathways. These group differences remained significant after controlling for grey matter, WM, and white matter hyperintensity volumes. ROI analyses showed significantly lower FA in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p <. 05). Pearson correlations revealed that dementia severity and neuropsychological composite scores in the domains of executive functions, processing speed, and memory were significantly related to WM integrity (p <. 05). In conclusion, we found that patients with AD show demonstrable changes in vulnerable WM <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways</b> that likely reflect both retrogenesis and Wallerian degeneration (WM degeneration secondary to neuronal loss). WM integrity was associated with changes in higher-order cognition, supporting the view of AD as a disconnection syndrome.

Since simulating the diffusion process, which is truly a physical phenomenon reflecting the underlying architecture of cerebral tissues, makes full use of the diffusion tensor data, including both the magnitude and orientation information, the proposed approach is expected to enhance robustness and reliability in white matter fiber reconstruction.

Consistent with these findings, β-adrenergic antagonists blocked both the late and the early phase of LTP induced by mossy fiber stimulation.

Because activation of trk receptors involves phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues (Segal et al., 1996), the availability of antibodies that selectively recognize the phosphorylated form of trk receptors at the Shc site permits an immunohistochemical assessment of trk receptor activation. We reported previously increased phosphospecific trk (p-trk) immunoreactivity in the mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>pathway</b> of the hippocampus during epileptogenesis in rats (Binder et al., 1999 b). Because the p-trk antibody does not distinguish among trkA, trkB, and trkC, {{the identity of the}} neurotrophin receptor(s) undergoing phosphorylation was uncertain. The development of mice carrying a point mutation of the Shc binding site (Y 515 F) in the trkB gene (trkB shc) provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that trkB is the neurotrophin receptor undergoing phosphorylation. Epileptogenesis in wild-type (WT) mice was associated with increased p-trk immunoreactivity in both the mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>pathway</b> and CA 3 stratum oriens of hippocampus. In contrast, the epileptogenesis-associated increase of p-trk immunoreactivity was reduced in trkB shc mutant mice. The development of epileptogenesis as measured by electrophysiological and behavioral indices did not differ between trkB shc mutant and WT mice. These data demonstrate that the neurotrophin receptor trkB undergoes phosphorylation in the mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>pathway</b> and CA 3 stratum oriens of the hippocampus during limbic epileptogenesis.

50|$|These nuclei receive {{inhibitory}} (GABAergic) inputs from Purkinje {{cells in}} the cerebellar cortex and excitatory (glutamatergic) inputs from mossy fiber and climbing <b>fiber</b> <b>pathways.</b> Most output <b>fibers</b> of the cerebellum originate from these nuclei. One exception is that fibers from the flocculonodular lobe synapse directly on vestibular nuclei without first passing through the deep cerebellar nuclei. The vestibular nuclei in the brainstem are analogous structures to the deep nuclei, since they receive both mossy fiber and Purkinje cell inputs.|$|R
