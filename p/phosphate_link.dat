The reaction used cytidine diphosphate (CDP) -ribitol as a substrate and in addition required the presence of CDP-glycerol, uridine diphosphate (UDP) -N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and adenosine triphosphate. Incubation of radioactive CDP-glycerol with the crude cell wall preparation resulted in the transfer of glycerol phosphate residues to the cell wall; this reaction was greatly stimulated {{by the presence of}} UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.

It has also been shown to be involved with cell membrane formation and function, enzyme regulation, and gene transcriptional control. In mammals, polyphosphates are involved with blood coagulation and inflammation, immune response, bone tissue development, and brain function.|$|R

The most common RNA analogues are 2'-O-methyl-substituted RNA, locked nucleic acid (LNA) or bridged nucleic acid (BNA), morpholino, and peptide nucleic acid (PNA). Although these oligonucleotides have a different backbone sugar or, {{in the case of}} PNA, an amino acid residue in place of the ribose phosphate, they still bind to RNA or DNA according to Watson and Crick pairing, but are immune to nuclease activity. They cannot be synthesized enzymatically and can only be obtained synthetically using phosphoramidite strategy or, for PNA, methods of peptide synthesis.|$|R
50|$|The CpG {{sites or}} CG sites are regions of DNA where a {{cytosine}} nucleotide {{is followed by}} a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5' → 3' direction. CpG is shorthand for 5'—C—phosphate—G—3' , that is, cytosine and guanine separated by only one phosphate; <b>phosphate</b> <b>links</b> any two nucleosides together in DNA. The CpG notation is used to distinguish this single-stranded linear sequence from the CG base-pairing of cytosine and guanine for double-stranded sequences. The CpG notation is therefore to be interpreted as the cytosine being 5 prime to the guanine base. CpG {{should not be confused with}} GpC, the latter meaning that a guanine {{is followed by a}} cytosine in the 5' → 3' direction of a single-stranded sequence.|$|R

40|$|Posttranslational {{phosphorylation}} {{of proteins}} {{is an important}} event in many cellular processes. Whereas phosphoesters of serine, threonine and tyrosine have been extensively studied, only limited information is available for other amino acids modified by a phosphate group. The formation of phosphohistidine residues in proteins has been discovered in prokaryotic organisms {{as well as in}} eukaryotic cells. The ability to biochemically analyze phosphohistidine residues in proteins, however, is severely hampered by its extreme lability under acidic conditions. In our studies we have found that by replacing the <b>phosphate</b> <b>linked</b> to the histidine residue with a thiophosphate, a phosphohistidine derivative with increased stability is formed. This allows the analysis of phosphohistidine-containing proteins by established biochemical techniques and will greatly aid in the investigation of the role of this posttranslational modification in cellular processes...|$|R
40|$|A {{chromatin}} protein, A 24, a conjugate of histone H 2 A and evolutionally conserved ubiquitin, {{was virtually}} the only structural polypeptide that {{was present in}} interphase but missing in mitosis of a Chinese hamster cell line (DON). Because a 10 % increase in the H 2 A/DNA ratio observed in interphase-mitosis transition explained the stoichiometric conversion of A 24 to H 2 A, it appears that ubiquitin bound to H 2 A of nucleosomal surfaces in interphase is released at mitosis whereas the total H 2 A remains as a structural component of nucleosomes. Regardless of protein synthesis, ubiquitin was again bound to H 2 A when cells entered the G 1 phase. Based on the electrostatic nature of the COOH-terminal region of H 2 A, where ubiquitin binds, and the mitosis-specific rise of covalently <b>linked</b> <b>phosphates</b> in histones H 1 and H 3, we propose that an ionic interaction between the positively charged H 2 A COOH-terminal regions on fibers and negatively charged <b>phosphates</b> <b>linked</b> to serine or threonine of H 1 and H 3 molecules on adjacent fibers could generate an assembly of chromatin fibers in mitosis...|$|R

Phenyl <b>phosphates</b> <b>linked</b> via nitrogen to methyl esterified amino acid analogues were studied, where the amino acid was an unnatural alpha-alkyl (or aryl) glycine or an alpha,alpha-dialkyl glycine. All compounds were characterized by a range of spectroscopic, spectrometric and analytical methods and were subjected to in vitro evaluation of their anti-human immunodeficiency virus efficacy. It is notable that certain unnatural amino acid derivatives could substitute for alanine with only a relatively small loss of activity and, moreover, that this activity did not fall-off with increasing alkyl chain length for the C 2 -C 4 mono-alkyl series.

40|$|Polyphosphate (polyP) {{consists}} of tens {{to hundreds of}} <b>phosphates,</b> <b>linked</b> by ATP-like high-energy bonds. Although polyP is present in mammalian mitochondria, its physiological roles there are obscure. Here, we examine the involvement of polyP in mitochondrial energy metabolism and ion transport. We constructed a vector to express a mitochondrially targeted polyphosphatase, along with a GFP fluorescent tag. Specific reduction of mitochondrial polyP, by polyphosphatase expression, significantly modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics, {{as indicated by the}} reduction of inner membrane potential and increased NADH levels. Furthermore, reduction of polyP levels increases mitochondrial capacity to accumulate calcium and reduces the likelihood of the calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition, a central event in many types of necrotic cell death. This confers protection against cell death, including that induced by β-amyloid peptide, a pathogenic agent in Alzheimer's disease. These results demonstrate a crucial role played by polyP in mitochondrial function of mammalian cells...|$|R

50|$|Glycogen {{phosphorylase}} has a {{pyridoxal phosphate}} (PLP, derived from Vitamin B6) at each catalytic site. Pyridoxal <b>phosphate</b> <b>links</b> with basic residues (in this case Lys680) and covalently forms a Schiff base. Once the Schiff base linkage is formed, holding the PLP molecule {{in the active}} site, the phosphate group on the PLP readily donates a proton to an inorganic phosphate molecule, allowing the inorganic phosphate to in turn be deprotonated by the oxygen forming the α-1,4 glycosidic linkage. PLP is readily deprotonated because its negative charge is not only stabilized within the phosphate group, {{but also in the}} pyridine ring, thus the conjugate base resulting from the deprotonation of PLP is quite stable. The protonated oxygen now represents a good leaving group, and the glycogen chain is separated from the terminal glycogen in an SN1 fashion, resulting in the formation of a glucose molecule with a secondary carbocation at the 1 position. Finally, the deprotonated inorganic phosphate acts as a nucleophile and bonds with the carbocation, resulting in the formation of glucose-1-phosphate and a glycogen chain shortened by one glucose molecule.|$|R

PolyP forms complexes and modulates activities of many proteins including ion channels. Here we investigated the role of polyP in {{the function of the}} transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM 8) channel. Using whole-cell patch-clamp and fluorescent calcium measurements we demonstrate that enzymatic breakdown of polyP by exopolyphosphatase (scPPX 1) inhibits channel activity in human embryonic kidney and F- 11 neuronal cells expressing TRPM 8. We demonstrate that the TRPM 8 channel protein is associated with polyP. Furthermore, addition of scPPX 1 altered the voltage-dependence and blocked the activity of the purified TRPM 8 channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, where the activity of the channel was initiated by cold and menthol in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -biphosphate (PtdIns(4, 5) P 2). The biochemical analysis of the TRPM 8 protein also uncovered the presence of poly-(R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB), which is frequently associated with polyP. We conclude that the TRPM 8 protein forms a stable complex with polyP and its presence is essential for normal channel activity...|$|R
40|$|Acidocalcisome-like organelles {{are found}} in all kingdoms of life. Many of their functions, such as the {{accumulation}} and storage of metal ions, nitrogen and phosphate, the activation of blood clotting and inflammation, depend on the controlled synthesis and turnover of polyphosphate (polyP), a polymer of inorganic <b>phosphate</b> <b>linked</b> by phosphoric anhydride bonds. The exploration {{of the role of}} acidocalcisomes in metabolism and physiology requires the manipulation of polyP turnover, yet the complete set of proteins responsible for this turnover is unknown. Here, we identify a novel type of polyphosphatase operating in the acidocalcisome-like vacuoles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which we called Ppn 2. Ppn 2 belongs to the PPP-superfamily of metallophosphatases, is activated by Zn(2 +) ions and exclusively shows endopolyphosphatase activity. It is sorted to vacuoles via the multivesicular body pathway. Together with Ppn 1, Ppn 2 is responsible for a substantial fraction of polyphosphatase activity that is necessary to mobilize polyP stores, for example in response to phosphate scarcity. This finding opens the way to manipulating polyP metabolism more profoundly and deciphering its roles in phosphate and energy homeostasis, as well as in signaling...|$|R

40|$|Cellulose is {{the main}} {{component}} of wood {{and one of the most}} important renewable raw materials. In several tree species including Populus species, carbon for cellulose biosynthesis is derived from the disaccharide sucrose. This thesis describes experimental work on the mechanism of sucrose cleavage in developing wood and subsequent production of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) for cellulose biosynthesis. Sucrose synthase (SUS) has been proposed previously to interact directly with cellulose synthase complexes (CSC) and specifically supply UDP-Glc for cellulose biosynthesis. To investigate the role of SUS in wood biosynthesis, transgenic lines of hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. x tremuloides Michx.) with strongly reduced soluble SUS activity in developing wood were characterized. The reduction of soluble SUS activity to few percentage of wild type increased soluble sugar content but decreased wood density and consequently reduced the lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose content per volume of wood. The results demonstrate that SUS has an important role in carbon flux from sucrose to all wood polymers but has no specific role in supplying UDP-Glc to cellulose synthesis machinery. I also investigated the role of cytosolic neutral/alkaline invertases (cNINs) during cellulose biosynthesis in hybrid aspen by analysing transgenic lines where NIN activity was decreased during secondary cell wall formation. The decrease in NINs activity caused a reduction in UDP-Glc and consequently reduced crystalline cellulose content but increased amorphous cellulose in cellulose microfibrils of wood. The results in this study demonstrated that cNIN activity is a major rate-controlling step in the cellulose biosynthesis. There is a lack of global analytical methods to measure sugar <b>phosphates</b> <b>linked</b> to cell wall polymer biosynthesis. To address this problem, I worked with the UPSC metabolomics facility to develop a robust method based on chloroform/methanol extraction, two-step derivatization and detection using reverse phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS) without adding ion-pairing reagent. The method could quantitatively identify 18 sugar phosphates including UDP-Glc and structural isomers in Populus leaf and wood extracts. The method can now be used to gain deeper understanding into wood metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis...|$|R

For study one, cattle were assigned to backgrounding diets containing low or high concentrations of wet distillers grains (WDGS) and either corn gluten feed or modified wet distillers grains (MDGS) during finishing. For study two, cattle were fed one of five finishing diets; corn, wet distillers grains (WDGS), WDGS + vitamin E, WDGS + Ethoxyquin/TBHQ, or WDGS + vitamin E + Ethoxyquin/TBHQ. Shoulder clods from each dietary treatment were ground and lean, fat, and composite samples were taken for fatty acid analysis. Patties were overwrapped for retail display and analyzed for lipid oxidation, discoloration and objective color. Cooked beef links were manufactured with salt and <b>phosphate.</b> <b>Links</b> from the first study contained different concentrations of rosemary and green tea extract. Beef was stuffed into links, cooked, and lipid oxidation was measured throughout refrigerated or frozen storage. For study one, {{there were no differences}} in lipid oxidation of patties, yet ground beef from heifers finished with MDGS discolored faster than beef from cattle finished on corn gluten feed. Increased lipid oxidation in beef links occurred when cattle were fed distillers grains during backgrounding or finishing but antioxidants reduced lipid oxidation similarly regardless of concentration. For study two, ground beef patties showed no dietary differences for instrumental color, only increased percent discoloration over time. All ground beef TBARS increased over time, and supplementation of vitamin E resulted in lower TBARS values than corn after 2 d of retail display. An increase in PUFA and C 18 : 2 was observed in lean and composite fatty acids in WDGS versus corn-finished cattle. Both dietary and postmortem antioxidants were effective at extending shelf life in ground beef from cattle fed distillers grains. Additionally, the effect of feeding distillers grains on shelf life varies depending on when distillers grains was supplemented. Advisor: Gary A. Sulliva...|$|R

Application of the Förster theory indicated that the changes in energy transfer resulted from changes in distances between the chromophores and/or changes in their relative orientations.
