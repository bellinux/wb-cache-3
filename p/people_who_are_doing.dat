She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, there are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{has often}} name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles {{he did with}} rapper Proof in 1992 where they {{performed}} against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single [...] "Just Don't Give a Fuck", Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In [...] "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with Vibe saying that Eminem [...] "raps like a girl". While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song [...] "Purple Pills" [...] in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> that are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two. Following me, any white rapper is going to have to hear 'oh, you think you’re Vanilla Ice?', so I am sure he’s heard that." [...] In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song [...] "We Made You". In the 2011 single [...] "Fast Lane", Eminem raps about riding in his car while listening to [...] "Ice Ice Baby".|$|E

Horrible men and women will write to the papers crying out for more blood, more cruelty. Everything that can make for anger and revenge will be screamed from every newspaper.

You are told that there are 8000 human beings in Port of Spain alone without visible means of subsistence, and you congratulate Port of Spain on being such an Elysium that people can live there--not without eating, for every child and most women you pass are eating something or other all day long--but without working. The fact is, that though they will eat as much and more than a European, if they can get it, they can do well without food; and feed, as do the Lazzaroni, on mere heat and light. The best substitute for a dinner is a sleep under a south wall in the blazing sun; and there are plenty of south walls in Port of Spain. In the French islands, I am told, such Lazzaroni are caught up and set to Government work, as 'strong rogues and masterless men,' after the ancient English fashion. But is such a course fair? If a poor man neither steals, begs, nor rebels (and these people do not do the two latter), has he not as much right to be idle as a rich man? To say that neither has a right to be idle is, of course, sheer socialism, and a heresy not to be tolerated.|$|E
