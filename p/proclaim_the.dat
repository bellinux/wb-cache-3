5|$|The {{brothers}} are mentioned {{for the last}} time in 812, when a group of disgruntled soldiers tried to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> brothers emperors {{in the aftermath of the}} fall of Debeltum to the Bulgars. Emperor Michael I Rangabe (r. 811–813), however, promptly dismissed the soldiers involved and moved the brothers to the island of Aphousia, where they died sometime later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council—together with the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London as well as representatives of Commonwealth realms—makes a {{proclamation}} declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the Church of Scotland, as required by law. It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an allocution to the Privy Council on that occasion, and this Sovereign's Speech is formally published in The London Gazette. Any such Special Assembly of the Privy Council, convened to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarch's statutory oath, is known as an Accession Council. The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952: as Elizabeth II was abroad when the last demise of the Crown took place, the Accession Council met twice, once to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> sovereign (meeting of 6 February 1952), and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain, to receive from her the oath required by statute (meeting of 8 February 1952).|$|E
5|$|The coin was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589. Although {{it could have been}} used as a coin, it was more likely made as a medallion to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> wearer's conversion to Christianity. The coin is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but the side with the cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of a patriarchal cross in any medium.|$|E
50|$|Karl's {{refusal to}} abdicate was {{ultimately}} irrelevant. On {{the day after}} he announced his withdrawal from Austria's politics, the German-Austrian National Council <b>proclaimed</b> <b>the</b> Republic of German Austria. Károlyi followed suit on 16 November, <b>proclaiming</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Democratic Republic.|$|R

5000|$|The Serb Democratic Party {{established}} SAOs in Serb-inhabited territories. Between September-November 1991, six entities {{had been}} <b>proclaimed.</b> <b>The</b> Serbs {{set up their}} own parliament, having left the Bosnian parliament in October 1991. <b>The</b> Serb parliament <b>proclaimed</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Serb Republic" [...] (Republika Srpska) on 27 March 1992.|$|R
5|$|With the {{appropriation}} bills approved by both Houses, {{they were sent}} over to Yarralumla where Kerr gave them Royal Assent. With supply assured, he then received Fraser, who advised him that 21bills (including the electoral redistribution bills) which had been introduced since the last election fulfilled the double dissolution provisions of Section57. Fraser asked that both Houses be dissolved for an election on 13 December. Kerr signed the proclamation dissolving Parliament, and sent his Official Secretary, David Smith, to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> dissolution from {{the front steps of}} Parliament House.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert {{presided over}} the Council of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia. This {{gathering}} mandated that all clergy should explain the basic tenets of Christianity to the laity, as well as legislating on clerical dress, control of monasteries, and {{the behavior of the}} clergy. It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> decisions of the council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E
5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh {{to back down}} and make concessions, {{and he ended up}} in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E

5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
5|$|The Winter Games {{have evolved}} since their inception. Sports and {{disciplines}} {{have been added}} and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic programme. Some others, including curling and bobsleigh, have been discontinued and later reintroduced; others have been permanently discontinued, such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it. Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced {{the profile of the}} Games. It generated income via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to <b>proclaim</b> <b>the</b> superiority of their political systems.|$|E
