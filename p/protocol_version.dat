25|$|OSPF is an {{interior}} gateway protocol (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets solely within a single routing domain, such as an autonomous system. It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network.

OSPF supports Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>Version</b> 4 (IPv4) and Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>Version</b> 6 (IPv6) networks and supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.|$|E

25|$|The {{internet}} layer {{provides an}} unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol {{is the principal}} component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>version</b> 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>version</b> 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.|$|E

25|$|Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>version</b> 4 uses {{specially}} designated address formats {{to facilitate}} recognition of special address functionality. The {{first and the}} last subnets obtained by subnetting have traditionally had a special designation and, early on, special usage implications. In addition, IPv4 uses the all ones host address, i.e. the last address within a network, for broadcast transmission to all hosts on the link.|$|E
25|$|The {{routing prefix}} may be {{expressed}} in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (/), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 is the prefix of the Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>version</b> 4 network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. The IPv6 address specification 2001:db8::/32 is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{component of the}} Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems, including IP addresses, for computers on the network. IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>Version</b> 4 (IPv4) is the initial version used on {{the first generation of}} the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3billion (109) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. [...] A new <b>protocol</b> <b>version,</b> IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.|$|E

The most common network addressing architecture is Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>version</b> 4 (IPv4), but its successor, IPv6, has been increasingly deployed since approximately 2006. An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits, for readability written in a form consisting of four decimal octets separated by dots, called dot-decimal notation.

In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>version</b> 6 requires Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), ICMPv6, and IGMPv6 and is often accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer.|$|E
