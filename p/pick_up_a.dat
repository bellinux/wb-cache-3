5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock.

On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout.

5|$|Following Miami's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech {{began its}} first {{offensive}} {{possession of the}} game at its 24-yard line.

These drove Tech into Miami territory and gave the Hokies a first down. Once there, however, Miami's defense stiffened and Tech was forced to punt. Miami recovered the ball at its 12-yard line, and the Hurricanes began their second possession of the game. Fullback Chris Hobbs and running back Smokey Roan alternated carries, picking up yardage and first downs before entering Virginia Tech territory. On the Hurricanes' first play on Tech's side of the field, however, Miami committed two penalties, pushing the Hurricanes back 20 yards. Following the penalties, Miami was unable to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> first down and punted back to the Hokies.|$|E
