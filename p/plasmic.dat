60|$|The {{news was}} {{imparted}} with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial {{usage of the}} Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth {{in the presence of}} the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a <b>plasmic</b> memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.|$|E
60|$|It {{had better}} be stated here and now {{at the outset that}} the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly {{addicted}} runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm {{on the one hand and}} on the other a happily chosen position, succubitus felix of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the <b>plasmic</b> substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.|$|E

40|$|In {{unconsolidated sediments}} subject to strain, clays and silts are realigned into {{particular}} optical birefringent arrangements (<b>plasmic</b> fabrics), which {{provide information on}} the style and intensity of sediment deformation. A relatively new, non-destructive, optical microscopy technique for automatically recording and quantifying birefringence (previously commercialized under the name ‘Metripol’) is pioneered in this study as a valuable and innovative micromorphological tool with which to examine deformation in unconsolidated sediments. Metripol is applied to unistrial <b>plasmic</b> fabric in glaciotectonized and ice keel scoured sediment from the Netherlands and former Glacial Lake Agassiz (Manitoba, Canada) respectively. Colour-coded images are produced in which colour represents relative optical retardation and thus optical anisotropy through the quantity |sinδ| and optical orientation of anisotropy through the angleØ(also indicated by linear azimuths). In this study Metripol typically demonstrates that the better developed the unistrial <b>plasmic</b> fabric is, the higher the |sinδ| values, the larger the areas of high |sinδ| values, and the longer and more densely populated the azimuths. In addition, some unistrial <b>plasmic</b> fabrics under Metripol demonstrate lower |sinδ| than previous examples and the surrounding sediment, despite being ‘perceived’ as demonstrating higher birefringence under a standard petrographic microscope. This is particularly true in clay-rich sediments and has implications for the way we currently describe and interpret unistrial <b>plasmic</b> fabrics in unconsolidated sediment. Finally, the identification and quantification of additional structures that would otherwise have gone undetected using a standard petrographic microscope (e. g. linear and circular structures {{that are likely to}} represent discrete shears and skelsepic <b>plasmic</b> fabric, respectively) highlight the potential for Metripol to gather information on the deformation history of unconsolidated sediments that is unavailable to standard techniques...|$|E

40|$|Microscopic {{oriented}} clay bodies {{known as}} plasma separations to soil micromorphologists show {{various degrees of}} symmetry and regularity in their patterns. They could be regarded as sensitive and reliable indicators of stress-strain regime of a soil. Empirical and experimental evidence signifies the importance of stress, specifically that generated by in situ swelling, in the genesis of <b>plasmic</b> fabrics. Hitherto, most work in this field is confined to geometric characterization, with limited attempts to dynamic interpretations of their origin. This paper enlists appropriate concepts in soil mechanics, structural geology and agricultural engineering to interpret the possible stress-strain components that rearrange fabric units into plasma separations. Some pertinent concepts, including physico-chemical behaviour of the clay-water system, shrink-swell phenomenon, stress-strain, deformation and failure of soil, are employed to explain the origin of <b>plasmic</b> fabrics by mechanical principles. A conceptual model is suggested to synthesize the conditions, changes and consequences related {{to the formation of}} <b>plasmic</b> fabrics. Strongly developed plasma separations in natural soils are attributed to the establishment of an anisotropic state of stress generated by in situ swelling, in conjunction with the passive pressure of lateral confinement and vertical overburden. The difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses produces a deviatoric stress that can, at certain stages of a shrink-swell cycle, exceed the shear strength of the soil. The extra stress is relieved plastically by shear deformation which is manifested as the alignment of platy particles in domain configuration by rotation and translation along the shear planes. Soil mainly fails in compressive (plastic) mode along a large number of small shear planes which form the plasma separations.

Biol. 234, 1284] which showed significant homologies to eukaryotic calcium ATPases. To investigate the specificity and activities of this plasma membrane-bound enzyme, we expressed the slightly modified gene in an ATPase deficient E. coli strain. The expressed ATPase showed an apparent molecular mass of about 97 kDa and is localized in the E. coli plasma membranes. The introduced 6 xHis tag at the N-terminus allowed the purification of the Synechocystis 6 xHis-ATPase by single-step affinity chromatography using a Ni 2 +-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The ATPase activity of the enzyme is inhibited by vanadate (IC 50 = 119 μM), N-ethylmaleimide, N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and inhibitors of eukaryotic sarco(endo) <b>plasmic</b> reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPases; however, it is stimulated by thapsigargin. Formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediates depends on calcium ions indicating that the Synechocystis P-ATPase acts as a calcium pump equivalent to eukaryotic sarco(endo) <b>plasmic</b> reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPases...|$|E
40|$|The sarco(endo) <b>plasmic</b> {{reticulum}} {{of animal}} cells contains an ATP-powered Ca 2 + pump {{that belongs to}} the P-type family of membrane-bound cation-translocating enzymes. In Schistosoma mansoni, the sarco(endo) <b>plasmic</b> reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) is encoded by the SMA 1 and SMA 2 genes. A full-length SMA 2 cDNA clone was isolated, sequenced, and expressed into a yeast Ca 2 +-ATPase-deficient strain requiring plasmid-borne rabbit SERCA 1 a for viability. The S. mansoni Ca 2 +-ATPase supports growth of mutant cells lacking SERCA 1 a, indicating functional expression in yeast and a role in calcium sequestration. Subcellular fractionation showed that the SMA 2 ATPase is localized in yeast internal membranes. SMA 2 expression {{was found to be}} associated with thapsigargin-sensitive, Ca 2 +-dependent ATPase activity. The activity increased 2 -fold upon calcineurin inactivation, which correlates with in vivo stimulated contribution of SMA 2 in calcium tolerance. These results suggest that calcineurin controls calcium homeostasis by inhibiting Ca 2 +-ATPase activity in an internal compartment...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of wall layers and ornamentation of ascospores is studied with the electron microscope in {{members of the}} Otideaceae and Pezizaceae. Primary wall, endospore, and epispore develop {{in the same way}} as in Ascodesmis and the Pyronemataceae; the {{development of}} the secondary wall and the formation of the patterns of ornamentation resemble that in the Pyronemataceae. Special attention is paid to specialized <b>plasmic</b> structures...|$|E
40|$|Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an {{immunosuppressive}} drug {{widely used in}} treatment of auto-immune diseases or after organ transplants. However, several side effects are commonly associated with CsA long term intake, some regarding to loss of reproductive organ function due to oxidative damage. Considering that phytotherapy is an important tool often used against oxidative stress, {{we would like to}} describe the beneficial effects of Heteropterys tomentosa intake to minimize the damage caused by CsA to the ventral prostate tissue of Wistar rats under laboratorial conditions. Thirty adult Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) were divided into: control group (water); CsA group (Cyclosporin A); Ht group (H. tomentosa infusion) and CsA[*]+[*]Ht group (CsA and H. tomentosa infusion). <b>Plasmic</b> levels of hepatotoxicity markers, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose were quantified. The ventral prostate tissue was analyzed under light microscopy, using stereological, morphometrical and immunohistochemical techniques. H. tomentosa did not cause any alterations either of the <b>plasmic</b> parameters or of the ventral prostate structure. CsA caused alterations of GOT, total and indirect bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels in the plasma; CsA-treated rats showed alterations of the ventral prostate tissue. There were no alterations regarding the plasma levels of GOT, triglycerides and glucose of CsA[*]+[*]Ht animals. The same group also showed normalization of most of the parameters analyzed on the ventral prostate tissue when compared to the CsA group. The treatments did not alter the pattern of AR expression or the apoptotic index of the ventral prostate epithelium. The results suggest a protective action of the H. tomentosa infusion against the side effects of CsA on the ventral prostate tissue, which could also be observed with <b>plasmic</b> biochemical parameters...|$|E
