50|$|Child of All Nations {{takes place}} in Surabaya, {{currently}} Indonesia’s second largest city, {{as well as being}} the capital East Java. Surabaya is rumored to have taken its name from several places. The first of which are the words suro (shark) and bayo (crocodile), which are the two animals said to have battled for greatness in local legend. Another source of the city’s name is said to have originated from the Javanese <b>phrase</b> “sura <b>ing</b> baya”, which means to bravely face danger. The controversy over the cities name is said to come from conflict between natives and colonialists in 1945 which ties in closely with conflicts found throughout the novel Child of All Nations. Surabaya traded hands several times before eventually becoming governed by the Dutch East Indies Company in November 1743. This change in control led to Surabaya becoming a trade hub and critical city in the Dutch colony, eventually leading to the largest Dutch naval base in the region being established there.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the semantics {{of natural}} language expressions {{that are associated}} with the intuitive notion of ‘place’. We note that the nature of such terms is highly contested, and suggest that this arises from two main considerations: 1) {{there are a number of}} logically distinct categories of place expression, which are not always clearly distinguished in discourse about ‘place’; 2) the many non-substantive place count nouns (such as ‘place’, ‘region’, ‘area’, etc.) employed in natural language are highly ambiguous. With respect to consideration 1), we propose that place-related expressions should be classified into the following distinct logical types: a) ‘place-like’ count nouns (further subdivided into abstract, spatial and substantive varieties), b) proper names of ‘place-like’ objects, c) locative property <b>phrases,</b> and <b>d)</b> definite descriptions of ‘place-like’ objects. We outline possible formal representations for each of these. To address consideration 2), we examine meanings, connotations and ambiguities of the English vocabulary of abstract and generic place count nouns, and identify underlying elements of meaning, which explain both similarities and differences in the sense and usage of the various terms...|$|R
40|$|The histc-y of {{facilities}} master planning in the U. S. Navy dates back 150 years. In 1825, Secretary of the Navy Samuel Southard noted with alarm the rapidly deteriorating {{state of the}} nation's Naval yards and recommended an urgent program of planning for their restoration. Although this propo!. I was carried out, the succeeding maintenance of the yards has been frustrated by a succession of encumbering circumstances. I 1 The cycle of national conflict, marked by accelerated development; and intervening periods of peace, characterized by relative somnolence; has burdened the Navy with a physical plant that was, for the most part, sporadically conceived, hastily built, and destined for ultimate neglect. The present result is a vast inventory {{of facilities}} which are chaotically arranged and are largely obsolete, unsightly, and even unsafe. The rapid nationwide urbanization following World War II has compounded the problem as the Navy is the "urbanite " of the <b>armE.</b> <b>d</b> services.

According to the professor, she appeared nervous and struggled to explain her answer, and so he asked her to take a few days to think about it and then they would talk again. After the next class, Sloan asked to speak with Professor Skinner. She admitted that she had gotten stuck and had searched the internet to find help. She offered to turn herself into Honor Council, which Professor Skinner agreed would be appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Copyright 2009, Sonova. Published {{version of}} the paper {{reproduced}} here with permission from the publisher. "This chapter presents {{an overview of the}} history, principles and clinical practice that might be labelled “Conversation Therapy” (henceforth, CT) in the context of aural rehabilitation (AR) for adults who have post-lingual hearing impairment (HI). Conversation is recog-nised as the major activity limitation/participation re-striction arising from HI and as such, the therapy, as out-lined in this chapter, is designed primarily to address the everyday conversation difficulties of adults who have HI. The focus on post-lingual HI implies that clients pres-ent with normal adult speech, language and conversa-tional abilities limited only by the reduction in ease of speech reception as a consequence of their HI. While the AR work outlined here is by no means limited to this population, it is designed with the view that the individ-ual had normal adult everyday spoken communication skills prior to the onset of their HI. The hallmarks of the clinical activities included in CT are: (a) their focus on interaction rather than on speech reception, (b) the incorporation of the full range of structural linguistic, interactional, environmental and interpersonal context cues, (c) the incorporation of units of speech (or more appropriately, “talk”) larger or longer than the syllable, word, <b>phrase</b> or sentence, (<b>d)</b> the use of tasks which can be designed with the client’s situation specific difficulties in mind and (e) the increased atten-tion paid {{to the role of the}} conversation partner in the resolution of conversational difficulties arising from the post-lingual HI. This chapter makes no claim that CT is a new ther-apy in AR, nor that it has been developed in a concerted or coordinated fashion. Rather, the term is applied retro-spectively, grouping certain existing therapy activities by their focus on conversational or interactional conse-quences of post-lingual HI, including therapies such as environmental and hearing tactics (Kaplan, Bally, & Garretson, 1985) as well as communication therapy (Er-ber, 1996, 2002; Erber, & Lind, 1994) and psychosocial intervention (Pedley, Giles, & Hogan, 2005) ...|$|R

This is qualitative research. The design of this research is content analysis. The data in this study are the word and the language that indicate antonymy. Source of data used in this research is the translated text of the Quran (sura Makiyyah). Techniques of collecting data in this research are the see and record methods. This study uses the technique of triangulation theory, namely the study of semantics and discourse. This study uses padan and agih as data analysis techniques. The basic technique used of padan, is referential classify. The advanced techniques is same comparation connectifity. The basic technique used of agih, is the technique for direct element (BUL).
