40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the relationship of managerial compensation to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. This study discusses the arguments that have made the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses an intuitively appealing concept within the broad agency literature, and, based on these arguments, conducts empirical tests aimed at determining whether managerial compensation does relate to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. ^ The most current means of studying the income-compensation relationship, the compensation coefficients, makes finding a good understanding of managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan loss reserves an important goal. The loan loss provision is hypothesized to be a function of loan quality and managerial compensation. If internal and external parties interested in bank performance and reporting better understand the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses, more efficient labor contracts can be written and financial performance and reporting should be improved. ^ The structure of the empirical tests flows from the argument that earnings management represents a cost to shareholders. This argument rests {{on the assumption that the}} <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses specifically plays a central role in managerial compensation at financial institutions. Recent work in agency theory is utilized to construct the setting in which the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses is tested for its ability to influence earnings. The empirical model constructed is a multiple regression equation with the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan loss as the dependent variable, and asset equity, income and compensation item as independent variables. ^ The empirical results show that the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses is much like the arguments would suggest. Although assets, equity and income are the dominant factors in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses, managerial compensation plays a role in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. ...|$|R

40|$|Tax-effect {{accounting}} {{has been}} controversy since its origin in allocation {{has generally been}} adopted the subject in the 1940 s. Tax across the English speaking world, even though underlying basic issues have not been resolved. A {{review of the literature}} shows that issues such as: whether income tax is an expense; whether the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred income tax is a liability and whether the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> future income tax benefit is an asset have not been resolved because of differing opinions as to what is an expense, liability or an asset. The development of a conceptual framework in Australia, which provides definitions of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, has provided an opportunity to reexamine some of the unresolved issues mentioned above. Since the conceptual framework, in SAC 4, defines an expense in terms of whether it increases a liability or reduces an asset the re-examination was directed at ascertaining whether the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred income tax satisfies the definition and recognition criteria for a liability. The results were inconclusive. However, it was possible to conclude that the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred income tax does not readily satisfy the criteria in SAC 4. An empirical investigation was then undertaken to ascertain whether selected user groups treat the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred income tax as a liability. The investigation surveyed investment houses, company secretaries, auditors and the parties to trust deeds. Evidence gathered suggest that investment houses and company secretaries treat the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred income tax all a liability. Auditors appear to regard the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> income tax as a deferred credit; not a liability. No evidence was found that the parties to trust deeds treat the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred income tax In a systematic way. It is concluded that the parties to trust deeds do not consider the nature of the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> deferred income tax when negotiating borrowing limitation ratio. It is hoped that the finding of this investigation will be highly relevant to any review of the standards on tax-effect accounting in Australia...|$|R
