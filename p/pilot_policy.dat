40|$|The Italian {{education}} system is nowadays witnessing {{a clash of}} discourses that implies different policy agendas, educational aims and social values. Within this scenario, {{the last decade has}} seen the prevailing of a hybrid discourse combining the neoliberal emphasis on the production of human capital and a third way-like compromise between social equity and economic competitiveness. The curriculum setting is one of the field where such a clash is more evident thanks also to the ambivalent pendulum between delegation to school autonomy and recurrent centralisation. This work analyzes the practicing of different curricula in a school labelled as ‘failing’ and involved in a local government <b>pilot</b> <b>policy</b> aiming at improving its performances. The data were collected through documentary analysis of policy documents, schools’ curriculum planning, observations, in-depth interviews with teachers and experts involved in the <b>pilot</b> <b>policy.</b> The materials have been analyzed through a coding and sub-coding process, using the software NVivo 8. Using foucauldian discourses as heuristic devices, the paper shows how those curricula are shaped by the enactment of different set of values and purposes concerning citizenship, social and economic education. The work highlights how some of the curricula enacted by teachers are well-suited to match the students’ needs in terms of care, emotional well-being and citizenship education with the provision of the requirements for entering into the labour market. On the contrary, the <b>pilot</b> <b>policy</b> enacted to improve their school performances forces the teachers to adopt a standardised curriculum that results mainly inpired by an economic rationale. The policy constructs the student as a deficit and does not recognize the reflexive engagement of the teachers with the dilemmas of contemporary education...|$|E

30|$|In {{a recent}} study, Hall 2012 evaluates {{the effects of}} {{introducing}} a more comprehensive school system on dropout rates in Sweden.

In Sweden, the municipalities involved in the pilot scheme were decided by a central authority {{on the basis of}} observable characteristics. Hall identifies the effects of the policy on the treated municipalities by exploiting the exogenous variation provided by a set of municipality characteristics. Her estimates show that the probability that upper secondary school students drop out increased by 3.8 percentage points with the <b>piloted</b> <b>policy,</b> mainly {{as a result of the}} behavior of low performing students.

Fighter training programs are expensive for taxpayers, and the USAF and RAAF face significant resource problems developing and implementing these programs. Using policy feedback theory and punctuated equilibrium theory as the theoretical foundation, the purpose of this comparative, multi-case study of current USAF F- 16 and RAAF F- 18 fighter <b>pilot</b> training <b>policies</b> was to inform training policy development and efficacy of future USAF and RAAF fighter pilot training programs. Data were gathered from training policy documents and 12 interviews with F- 16 and F- 18 pilots. Data were deductively coded and analyzed using policy feedback and punctuated event themes. Findings indicate that policy feedbacks and punctuated events influence fighter <b>pilot</b> training <b>policy.</b> Best practices for training include optimum stress management, appropriate academic course timing, and phase-based training techniques.

40|$|The Smart City is defined, {{among other}} things, by its ability “to measure and {{recognize}} potential problems {{just as they}} start to arise […] and act {{to make the necessary}} corrections. ” [1] This concept is borrowed from feedback control theory and reflects the centrality of timely, accurate and explicative information in the process of urban governance. Postulating that information is accurate and explicative, though, requires a rather exceptional assumption: that available data and methodologies justify inferences, thus making policy decisions “evidence-based”. In this work, we define a three-step process to provide decision-makers with information that is sufficient to justify evidence-based local policy decisions on urban crime. Of the three steps, the first one contains a number of methodological innovations and therefore is discussed in greater detail, whereas the other two, while depending on the outcome of the former, are straightforward applications of existing methods. This first step consists of an analytical methodology to explore and model the supposed influence of socio-economic, demographic and spatial factors on crime. The main contribution on the actual literature is the integration of data originating from different databases and with different territorial levels. In particular, we propose a variation of the most widely used techniques which analyze urban structures in terms of networks and graphs, an innovation which gives space a more relevant position in statistical models for evidence based decision making rather than a mere spatial distance matrix. When implemented as an ongoing and evolving process, such methodology produces an extensive knowledge of the covariates of crime, which is the input of the second step, a set of quasi-experimental designs [2] of small scale <b>pilot</b> <b>policy</b> actions on plausible crime determinants. Finally, in the third step, the evaluation of the <b>pilot</b> <b>policy</b> actions and their outcomes provides the necessary evidence to infer on the plausible determinants of crime, therefore supporting (or not) large scale policy decisions. Smart Security as a process implies three main elements of innovation: the introduction of spatial configuration as a component of urban crime models because of its influence on pedestrian and vehicular movement patterns [3]; the collection and analysis of data from different sources and at different scales; the identification of a finite number of urban environment types with different performances in terms of security. To illustrate these points, we make use of data from the 2011 UK Census in London and from the UK Police records during 18 months in the period 2013 – 2014...|$|E
30|$|As an {{external}} factor restraining personal behavior, each institution’s implementation and adaptation over different periods and across different communities will certainly affect individual behavior. Over the past 40  years {{of the implementation}} of family planning policy, the content, methods, and efforts towards implementation were constantly being adjusted. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, the general family planning policy advocated “late, rare, less,” {{and in the early}} 1980 s, the policy changed to the “one-child” policy that put on the “brakes” to control the population (Benfeng and Jingjing 2011; Chunyuan 2000). Then, at the start of 1984, rural one-daughter households were permitted to have a second child, followed in 1985 by the city of Yicheng in Shanxi Province becoming the first batch of pilot areas to permit a second child and in 1987, the city of Jiuquan in Gansu Province passing a two-child <b>pilot</b> <b>policy.</b> Since 2000, there has been a policy change that emphasized social service. 1 In 2014, along with the “selective two-child” policy introduced in cities, some rural communities have also adopted the two-child policy, which places no limits on the gender of the first child and does not require a certain time interval to pass between the birth of the first and second child. As of October 2015, the two-child policy has been implemented throughout the country.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{data transmission}} through a time-selective, correlated (first-order Markov) Rayleigh fading channel subject {{to an average}} power constraint. The channel is estimated at the receiver with a pilot signal, and the estimate is fed back to the transmitter. The estimate is used for coherent demodulation, and to adapt the data and pilot powers. We explicitly determine the optimal pilot and data power control policies in a continuous-time limit where the channel state evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process, and is estimated by a Kalman filter at the receiver. The optimal <b>pilot</b> <b>policy</b> switches between zero and the maximum (peak-constrained) value (``bang-bang'' control), and approximates the optimal discrete-time policy at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (equivalently, large bandwidths). The switching boundary is {{defined in terms of}} the system state (estimated channel mean and associated error variance), and can be explicitly computed. Under the optimal policy, the transmitter conserves power by decreasing the training power when the channel is faded, thereby increasing the data rate. Numerical results show a significant increase in achievable rate due to the adaptive training scheme with feedback, relative to constant (non-adaptive) training, which does not require feedback. The gain is more pronounced at relatively low SNRs and with fast fading. Results are further verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Comment: 39 pages.

40|$|Demographic ageing {{threatens to}} unravel European social {{protection}} systems and labour {{markets in the}} not too-distant future. Welfare state reform is called for across policy domains yet remains controversial. How can European societies safeguard social rights without endangering the financial sustainability of welfare systems? Two paradigmatic ideas have guided our research, namely, those of ‘productive’ as compared to ‘active’ ageing. The productive ageing paradigm postulates that the problems posed by demographic ageing can only be coped through longer working lives. At the same time, the universal benefits associated with the modern welfare state need to be reduced, i. e. the insurance principle should be strengthened {{at the expense of}} the re-distributive principle. The alternative ‘active ageing’ paradigm considers the solutions proposed by the ‘productive ageing’ paradigm as both short-sighted and inadequate. While recognising the necessity to promote longer working lives, it considers that the main barrier to this is age-related discrimination. Older or ageing people must be recognised as active citizens and promoted as such – in the labour market, in health care and in community activities. Hence the emphasis of the ‘active ageing’ paradigm on senior citizenship Despite the uptake in most countries of the ‘senior citizenship’ discourse (even if not always the term ‘active ageing’) in special reports, inquiries, research programmes or <b>pilot</b> <b>policy</b> programmes, a closer examination of related reforms at the level of specific policy domains shows that we are far from meeting the requirements of a substantive policy reform as foreseen by the active ageing paradigm and recommended by the European Commission’s Communication Towards a Europe of All Ages (1999). This is the case for labour market policy, pension policy and health policy. Mentality is changing at an even slower rate within the private sector. Instead we may observe the consolidation of the efficiency paradigm that is directed towards rationalisation and budgetary discipline...|$|E
40|$|Everywhere {{it is now}} {{difficult}} {{to think of what}} our educational actuality is without confronting "accountability". This fashionable, multilayered term is today a "planetspeak" (Novoa, 2002). In the anglophon arena accountability policies are central to educational systems, meanwhile other countries are swinging from policy makers' eagerness to borrow accountability strategies from abroad to educators’ resistance to accept initiatives which they think threatening their professional values. In Italy, in the last decades several attempts to create evaluation systems were unsuccessfully implemented. This paper draws on the dynamics that emerged in a recent initiative launched by the ministry, aimed at piloting a voluntary teacher reward scheme. The "best" teachers of selected schools would have been awarded “financial prizes” after assessment of their performances and professional reputation. What the government expected to be a proud celebration of a new meritocratic turn, after ages of “bureaucratic egalitarianism”, resulted in rejection and complaint. A documentary analysis has been undertaken of ministerial official documents and presentations and of documents, contributions, comments published by national press and professional websites. First, the paper describes the inner logic of the new accountability policy framing the pilot {{within the context of a}} wider project to establish a new form of governmentality based on ‘performativity’ and reputation. Second, the ‘discourses’ developed around the pilot are analysed, looking at both the Ministry’s attempts and the unions’, teachers’ and public opinion’s reactions. The paper shows the slippery implications of the “merit logic” and how, in the messy Italian political scenario, it left both sides to handle a hot potato. The ministry’s proposal makes even sharper the contradictions of its policy and cuts. Meanwhile unions and associations locked themselves up in corporatist positions leading teachers towards a possible trap: their complaint is interpreted as the “guilty” rejection of a professional category which refuses evaluation, enhancing their “bad reputation”. We argue that the ritualistic enactment of the <b>pilot</b> <b>policy</b> resulting from these struggles is a missed opportunity to develop more democratic forms of evaluation, where a real account is given of what happens in schools and why (Ranson, 2003) and evaluation is interpreted as a form of contextualized and knowledge-grounded reflection (Goodson, 2003) on professional practice. However the debate is paramount and well documented, its analysis provides a meaningful inventory of how resistance and its dynamics occur in the field, teachers’ angry and passionate voices shed light on a range of counter-elaborations and possible perspectives...|$|E

40|$|This study {{described}} and analyzed {{the experiences of}} administrators in six Indiana school corporations that adopted a school-year budget under authorization provided by Public Law 50 (PL 50 - 1996). The study had the following objectives: (a) to identify reasons why school corporations {{became involved in the}} pilot project, (b) to determine what happened {{as a result of the}} pilot project, (c) to determine if the pilot project was perceived as successful by the school officials in the pilot group, and (d) to identify recommendations of superintendents and business officials about further use of a fiscal year budget in Indiana school corporations. A qualitative research methodology was used in this study. Data collection consisted of interviews with superintendents and business officials in the pilot group during January 2000. The administrators joined the pilot group because they believed all Indiana school corporations would eventually convert to a fiscal year budget and that their experiences would facilitate the conversion. They supported the concept of a fiscal year budget because it was congruous with the school-year. During implementation of the fiscal year budget, the administrators felt abandoned and did not receive the support they expected. Yet, based on their experiences with a fiscal year budget, the administrators supported a conversion to a fiscal year budget for all school corporations. Administrators recommended the state phase-in a fiscal year budget for other non-pilot school corporations. These findings suggest that administrators had valid reasons for joining the pilot group. In addition, administrators viewed the absence of key leaders at the state level as problematic for the pilot project. Based on the evidence, it appears that a fiscal year budget produced the following advantages for the participating corporation administrators: (a) allowed for better tracking of expenditures, (b) required less work to determine the cost of a school-year program, (c) allowed for more freedom in the summer, and (d) provided for a less stressful year-end. The success of the pilot group did not produce support for fiscal year budgets from either non-pilot school corporation officials or from state officials.

The dislodging of the McMaster grounding assumption within the practice of the Peer Review Pilot creates conceptual fissures that can be traced throughout the Pilot's documentation.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines initial {{applications of}} Behavioural Economics (BE) to policymaking. It focuses primarily but not exclusively on {{what can be}} learnt from the early adopters of policies inspired by BE, notably America and Britain. BE is defined by its inductive scientific approach to economics, which results in empirical demonstrations that are persuasive to policymakers facing practical problems. The analysis identifies three routes via which BE has influenced policy: (1) the theory of libertarian paternalism ("nudges"), (2) the provision of toolkits for policymakers seeking behavioural change, and (3) {{the expansion of the}} skill-set of applied economists (and scientists in related disciplines). The effectiveness of each route is assessed, in terms of the likelihood of successfully integrating scientific advances with policy development. The analysis concludes that route (3) {{is the only one that}} can adapt to the ongoing and rapid evolution of what is a young science. Successful policy applications are most likely where there is expert input to policy development and the capacity to engage in applied experimentation and <b>piloting</b> of <b>policy</b> ideas. The implication is that countries, including Ireland, are more likely to reap the benefits of BE if they create an effective interface between applied economists and policymakers.

Based on fieldwork carried out since 2011 in this sector, this article reveals that the production of specific activity figures requires resource mobilisation and precise tasks on the part of organisations. The production of activity data therefore can reflect the autonomy of these administrative organisations. In limiting the capacity of these organisations specifically tasked with benefits attribution decisions, political authorities have also limited the autonomy they could in theory have claimed, and, in so doing, have limited their capacity to make these decisions independently of the political configurations and economic situations within which these benefits are recognise...|$|R
40|$|Background: Childhood {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{has been}} a neglected area in national TB control programme (NTCP) in high burden countries. The NTP Pakistan adapted the global approaches by developing and <b>piloting</b> its <b>policy</b> guideline on childhood TB in ten districts of the country. We developed an intervention package including a deskguide and a monitoring tool and tested with the ongoing childhood TB care in a district. The objective of our study was to measure effectiveness of intervention package with deskguide and monitoring tool by comparing TB case finding and treatment outcomes among districts in 2008, and performance assessment in intervention district. Method: An intervention study with cohort design within a routine TB control programme comparing case findings and treatment outcomes {{before and after the}} intervention, and in districts with and without intervention. We enrolled all children below 15 years registered at all nine public sector hospitals in three districts of Pakistan. The data was collected from hospital TB records. Results: In eight months during 2007 there were 164 childhood TB cases notified, and after intervention in 2008 a total of 194 cases were notified. In intervention district case finding doubled (110 % increase) and correct treatment practice significantly increased in eight months. Successful outcomes were significantly higher in intervention district (37, 100 %) compared to control district A (18, 18 %, p < 0. 05) and control district B (41, 72 %, p < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|The over-arching {{theme of}} this thesis is the effects of parental {{background}} on children {{and the effectiveness of}} policies designed to improve the academic outcomes of socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The first chapter of this thesis explores the causal link between the education of one generation and that of their children by using IV to account for the endogeneity of parental education and paternal earnings. The second chapter evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention designed to improve the academic success at university of students from socio-economically disadvantaged families. The third and final chapter examines the potential issues in expanding a programme targeted at financially poorer students beyond its initial pilot phase. Chapter One addresses the intergenerational transmission of education and investigates the extent to which early school leaving (at age 16) may be due to variations in parental background. An important contribution of the chapter is to distinguish between the causal effects of parental income and parental education levels. Least squares estimation reveals conventional results – weak effects of income (when the child is 16), stronger effects of maternal education than paternal, and stronger effects on sons than daughters. We find that the education effects remain significant even when household income is included. However, when we use instrumental variable methods to simultaneously account for the endogeneity of parental education and paternal income, only maternal education remains significant (for daughters only) and becomes stronger. These estimates are consistent to various set of instruments. The impact of paternal income varies between specifications but becomes insignificant in our preferred specification. Our results provide limited evidence that policies alleviating income constraints at age 16 can alter schooling decisions but that policies increasing permanent income would lead to increased participation (especially for daughters). Chapter Two is an evaluation of a comprehensive university access programme that provides financial, academic and social support to low socioeconomic students using a natural experiment which exploits the time variation in the expansion of the programme across high schools. Overall, we identity positive treatment effects on retention rates, exam performance and graduation rates, with the impact often stronger for higher ability students. Gender differences are also identified. We find similar results for access students entering through the standard admissions system and those entering with lower grades. This suggests that access programmes can be effective at improving academic outcomes for socioeconomically disadvantaged students. In Chapter Three, we compare the effects of the pilot implementation and the subsequent national roll-out of a large programme, the Educational Maintenance Allowance, in the UK which provides financial transfers to youth who remain in post-compulsory education. While <b>piloting</b> <b>policies</b> is becoming standard in policy evaluation, little is known of their external validity. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences methodology and several cohorts of the Youth Cohort Study for England and Wales, we estimate the effect of the Education Maintenance Allowance on post-compulsory school participation both in the piloting stage and in its national implementation. We find that the pilot scheme and the national extension had an effect on post- 16 schooling but that the evidence in support of the national extension is weaker...|$|R
