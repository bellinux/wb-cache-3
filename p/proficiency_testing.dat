In this study, the effectiveness of an adaptive learning platform, Wiley Plus ORION, was evaluated using <b>proficiency</b> <b>test</b> scores compared to paper-based test scores in a first-year introductory engineering physics course. Learners’ performance activities on the adaptive learning platform as well as their performance on the <b>proficiency</b> <b>tests</b> and their impact on the paper-based midterm averaged test were investigated using both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. A comparison between learners’ performance on the <b>proficiency</b> <b>tests</b> and a paper-based midterm test was done to evaluate whether there was a correlation between their performance on the <b>proficiency</b> <b>tests</b> and the midterm test. Focus group interviews were carried out with three categories of learners to elicit their experiences.

40|$|Increased task demand will {{increase}} the pilot mental workload (PMWL). When PMWL is increased, mental overload may occur resulting in degraded performance. During pilots' instrument flight rules (IFR) <b>proficiency</b> <b>test,</b> PMWL is typically not measured. Therefore, {{little is known about}} workload during the <b>proficiency</b> <b>test</b> and pilots' potential to cope with higher task demands than those experienced during the test. In this study, fighter pilots' performance and PMWL was measured during a real IFR <b>proficiency</b> <b>test</b> in an F/A- 18 simulator. PMWL was measured using heart rate (HR) and heart rate variation (HRV). Performance was rated using Finnish Air Force's official rating scales. Results indicated that HR and HRV differentiate varying task demands in situations where variations in performance are insignificant. It was concluded that during a <b>proficiency</b> <b>test,</b> PMWL should be measured together with the task performance measurement...|$|R
