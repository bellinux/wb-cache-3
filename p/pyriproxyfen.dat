50|$|Insecticides {{are known}} to be costly, and there is also an {{increasing}} resistance of the whitefly to insecticides. In a study of the silverleaf whitefly, a pest of other curcurbits family plants including zucchini squash, cucumber, and pumpkin was examined. In particular squash is infected with Squash silverleaf, which is a serious physiological disorder that involves silvering of the surface of leaves, reduction in chlorophyll concentrations and higher reflectance. To combat this disease, insect growth regulator (IGR), <b>pyriproxyfen</b> has been used. This hormone is a juvenile hormone analogue, which affects hormonal balance and chitin in premature insects, which causes deformation and death during molting and pupation stages. Therefore, making <b>pyriproxyfen</b> effective in reducing the whitefly populations. It reduces the fruit damages, and increases the size, weight, and quality of fruit. Effectively, IGR does not kill adult whiteflies, but instead sterilizes the eggs of those adults that are treated. It is also a potent inhibitor of embryogenesis, adult formation and metamorphosis. It kills larva and keeps adults from completing the last nymphal stage. The IGR has low toxicity to mammals, fish, birds and bumblebees.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyriproxyfen</b> is a pyridine-based {{pesticide}} {{which is}} found to be effective against a variety of arthropoda. It was introduced to the US in 1996, to protect cotton crops against whitefly. It has also been found useful for protecting other crops. It is also used as a prevention for flea control on household pets, for killing indoor and outdoor ants and roaches. Methods of application include aerosols, bait, carpet powders, foggers, shampoos and pet collars.|$|E
50|$|Entomologists {{with the}} U.S. Arid-Land Agricultural Research Center {{identified}} {{the most common}} causes of death of the whitefly which included predatory insects, parasites, and weather induced dislodgement.

40|$|To improve {{compatibility}} between {{chemical and}} biological controls, the use of selective insecticides such as insect growth regulators (IGRs) is crucial.

Therefore, we compared <b>pyriproxyfen</b> and buprofezin (an IGR) with that of no treatment (control) in a bitter melon crop for the control of populations of SLW and for their effects on fruit production. <b>Pyriproxyfen</b> controlled SLW and tended to have heavier fruits than the control treatment and reduced the abundance of nymphs and exuvia.

40|$|Selective {{insecticides}} such as insect growth regulators {{that kill}} pests but cause {{little or no}} harm to non-target organisms have become increasingly important in crop production systems worldwide. The insect growth regulator <b>pyriproxyfen</b> has been successfully used {{for the last decade}} in Arizona as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) program for the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, a problematic pest in Arizona and other regions of the world throughout the world. A serious threat to the continued success of the IPM program in Arizona is the evolution of insecticide resistance in B. tabaci. To enhance the ability to design sound strategies for managing whitefly resistance to <b>pyriproxyfen</b> we: 1) compared susceptibility to <b>pyriproxyfen</b> between male and female B. tabaci; 2) determined the dominance of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> resistance; 3) determined if fitness costs were associated with resistance; 4) estimated the number of genes affecting resistance; 5) developed resistance management models. Laboratory and field bioassays investigated the genetics of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> resistance in males and females from a pyriproxyfen-susceptible and pyriproxyfen-resistant strain (> 1000 fold resistance). Results showed that male and female B. tabaci did not differ in susceptibility to <b>pyriproxyfen,</b> resistance was partially to completely dominant under approximated field conditions, and fitness costs were not associated with resistance. Similar traits in field populations could threaten the efficacy of <b>pyriproxyfen.</b> Model results indicated that the current IPM program for B. tabaci could be improved by curtailing the use of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> in cotton-intensive regions, synchronizing the use of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> with key crop production stages in the field, and applying the lowest <b>pyriproxyfen</b> concentration needed to provide effective control. Knowledge generated from this research has provided insight into factors affecting B. tabaci resistance to <b>pyriproxyfen,</b> which could improve management strategies for B. tabaci in Arizona cotton and other crops. This project represents a proactive approach to understanding <b>pyriproxyfen</b> resistance and its potential impacts before resistance evolves to problematic levels in the field.

However, evidence of efficacy and community effectiveness (CE) remains limited. The aim of this systematic review is to compile and analyse the existing literature for evidence on the CE of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> as a vector control method for reducing Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus populations and thereby human dengue transmission. Systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, Cochrane library, WHOLIS, Web of Science, Google Scholar as well as reference lists of all identified studies. Removal of duplicates, screening of abstracts and assessment for eligibility of the remaining studies followed. Relevant data were extracted, and a quality assessment conducted. Results were classified into four main categories of how <b>pyriproxyfen</b> was applied: - 1) container treatment, 2) fumigation, 3) auto-dissemination or 4) combination treatments,-and analysed with a view to their public health implication. Out of 745 studies 17 studies were identified that fulfilled all eligibility criteria. The results show that <b>pyriproxyfen</b> can be effective in reducing the numbers of Aedes spp. immatures with different methods of application when targeting their main breeding sites. However, the combination of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> with a second product increases efficacy and/or persistence of the intervention and may also slow down the development of insecticide resistance. Open questions concern concentration and frequency of application in the various treatments. Area-wide ultra-low volume treatment with <b>pyriproxyfen</b> currently lacks evidence and cannot be recommended. Community participation and acceptance has not consistently been successful and needs to be further assessed. While all studies measured entomological endpoints, only two studies measured the reduction in human dengue cases, with inconclusive results. Although <b>pyriproxyfen</b> is highly effective in controlling the immature stages of dengue transmitting mosquitoes, and-to a smaller degree-adult mosquitoes, there is weak evidence for a reduction of human dengue cases. More well designed larger studies with appropriate standardised outcome measures are needed before <b>pyriproxyfen</b> is incorporated in routine vector control programmes. Additionally, resistance to <b>pyriproxyfen</b> has been reported and needs investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of technical <b>pyriproxyfen</b> and diflubenzuron was evaluated at the laboratory level against Aedes aegypti, where we achieved adult emergence inhibition (EI 50) values of 0. 048 and 1. 59 ppb (microg/liter), respectively. We compared these data with values obtained for temephos. We prepared emulsifiable concentrate formulations of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> and diflubenzuron {{in the laboratory}} and obtained EI 50 values of 0. 01 and 0. 02 ppb, respectively. We also obtained 100 % adult emergence inhibition with 0. 1 % slow-release sand formulations of <b>pyriproxyfen</b> and diflubenzuron. In a simulated field study, the granular sand formulations of <b>pyriproxyfen,</b> diflubenzuron, and temephos remained active for over 4 mo. In a field study, a 0. 2 % granular formulation of diflubenzuron and 1 % temephos showed a similar performance. 0. 894 JCR (2008) Q 3, 36 / 72 Entomolog...|$|E
