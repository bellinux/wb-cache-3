5000|$|In 1972, a {{group at}} the University of Illinois filed for a patent on an optical {{touchscreen}} that became a standard part of the Magnavox Plato IV Student Terminal and Thousands were built for this purpose.

40|$|The {{plasma panel}} sensor (PPS) is a gaseous micropattern {{radiation}} detector under current development. It has many operational and fabrication principles common to <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> <b>panels.</b> It comprises a dense matrix of small, gas plasma discharge cells within a hermetically sealed <b>panel.</b> As in <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> <b>panels,</b> it uses nonreactive, intrinsically radiation‐hard {{materials such as}} glass substrates, refractory metal electrodes, and mostly inert gas mixtures.

50|$|Artificially {{generated}} microplasmas {{are found}} on the flat panel screen of a plasma display. The technology utilizes small cells and contains electrically charged ionized gases. Across this <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> <b>panel,</b> there are a millions of tiny cells called pixels that are confined to form a visual image. In the plasma display panels, X and Y grid of electrodes, separated by a MgO dielectric layer and surrounded by a mixture of inert gases - such as argon, neon or xenon, the individual picture elements are addressed. They work {{on the principle that}} passing a high voltage through a low-pressure gas generates light. Essentially, a PDP {{can be viewed as a}} matrix of tiny fluorescent tubes which are controlled in a sophisticated fashion. Each pixel comprises a small capacitor with three electrodes, one for each primary color (some newer displays include an electrode for yellow). An electrical discharge across the electrodes causes the rare gases sealed in the cell to be converted to plasma form as it ionizes. Being electrically neutral, it contains equal quantities of electrons and ions and is, by definition, a good conductor. Once energized, the plasma cells release ultraviolet (UV) light which then strikes and excites red, green and blue phosphors along the face of each pixel, causing them to glow.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{engineering}} {{proposal for}} a flat-panel TV was by General Electric {{as a result of}} its work on radar monitors. Their publication of their findings gave all the basics of future flat-panel TVs and monitors. But GE did not continue with the R&D required and never built a working flat panel at that time. The first production flat-panel display was the Aiken tube, developed in the early 1950s and produced in limited numbers in 1958. This saw some use in military systems as a heads up display, but conventional technologies overtook its development. Attempts to commercialize the system for home television use ran into continued problems and the system was never released commercially. The Philco Predicta featured a relatively flat (for its day) cathode ray tube setup and would be the first commercially released [...] "flat panel" [...] upon its launch in 1958; the Predicta was a commercial failure. The <b>plasma</b> <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> was invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois, according to The History of Plasma Display Panels. The first active-matrix addressed display was made by T Peter Brody's Thin-Film Devices department at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1968. In 1977, James P Mitchell prototyped and later demonstrated what was perhaps the earliest monochromatic flat panel LED television display LED Display. , 50% of global market share in flat-panel display (FPD) production is by Taiwanese manufacturers such as AU Optronics and Chimei Innolux Corporation.|$|E
