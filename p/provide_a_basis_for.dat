5|$|The {{hospital}} {{registered the}} cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion. Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests do not <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.|$|E

25|$|John VIII died in 1448. His reign lasted two decades. His {{achievement}} was the continued {{survival of the}} Empire. Yet Byzantium was now hanging by a thread.

John was severely constrained by his circumstances, and proved unable to improve {{the fortunes of the}} state. He was succeeded by his brother Constantine XI.

25|$|Incompatibilism {{requires}} {{a distinction between}} the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, metaphysical libertarian free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).|$|E

25|$|Olfactory cues are {{widespread}} within {{parental care}} {{to assist in}} the dynamic of the mother-infant relationship, and later development of the offspring. In support of fetal olfactory learning, newborn infants display behavioral attraction to the odor of amniotic fluid. For example, babies would more often suck from a breast treated with an amount of their own amniotic fluid, rather than the alternative untreated breast. Newborns are initially attracted to their own amniotic fluid because that odor is familiar. Although exposure to amniotic fluid is eliminated after birth, breast fed babies have continued contact with cues from the mother’s nipple and areola area. This causes breast odors to become more familiar and attractive, while amniotic fluid loses its positive value. Maternal breast odors are individually distinctive, and <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> recognition of the mother by her offspring.|$|E

25|$|Eudoxus {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} non-quantified mathematical magnitude to describe and work with continuous geometrical entities such as lines, angles, areas and volumes, thereby avoiding the use of irrational numbers. In doing so, he reversed a Pythagorean emphasis on number and arithmetic, focusing instead on geometrical concepts {{as the basis of}} rigorous mathematics. Some Pythagoreans, such as Eudoxus' teacher Archytas, had believed that only arithmetic could <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> proofs. Induced by the need to understand and operate with incommensurable quantities, Eudoxus established what may have been the first deductive organization of mathematics on the basis of explicit axioms. The change in focus by Eudoxus stimulated a divide in mathematics which lasted two thousand years. In combination with a Greek intellectual attitude unconcerned with practical problems, there followed a significant retreat from the development of techniques in arithmetic and algebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{build-up}} to the 2008 campaign {{went well}} for KR. Firstly, the {{team won the}} Reykjavik Tournament after beating Fjölnir 1–0 in the final, although Helena was not present at the match. This was followed by success in the Icelandic League Cup after a 4–0 victory over Valur in the final. Helena stated that she hoped the cup win would <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a promising Úrvalsdeild campaign. Two new signings, those of Iceland international players Guðrún Sóley Gunnarsdóttir and María Björg Ágústsdóttir, were made during the close season and the team was tipped to be crowned Icelandic champions in 2008. However, the league season proved {{to be similar to}} the previous year as KR again finished second in the league behind Valur despite winning 16 of their 18 fixtures. On 9 September 2008, Helena announced that she would not continue to manage the team for the following season as she wished to take a year out from football.|$|E
25|$|Another {{measure of}} the {{performance}} of the Dutch economy during the 18th century is the estimate that De Vries and Van der Woude have made of the per capita GDP of the Dutch economy in 1742 (for which year tax records <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> estimation and extrapolation). They arrive at an estimated GNP of between 265 and 280 million guilders, or 135–142 guilders per capita. This {{was at the end of}} a long period of secular decline after the economic zenith of 1650. The next decades saw some economic resurgence. In the decade 1800–1810 (again a period of economic decline) the national income of the (slightly contracted) population can be estimated at 307 million guilders, or 162 guilders per capita. To put all of this in perspective: in 1740 the GNP of Great Britain was about £80 million, or 120 guilders per capita (and therefore about 20 percent lower than the Dutch per capita income). After this the British per capita income started on a rapid increase, due to the Industrial Revolution. It therefore eventually overtook the Dutch per capita income, but probably only around 1800.|$|E
