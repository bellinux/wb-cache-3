40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper describes how the computer aided engineering software programmes, ADAMS and MADYMO, have been used at Coventry University to carry out computer simulations investigating civil helicopter occupant protection systems. The work was carried out {{as part of the}} European 6 th Framework HeliSafe TA project which considered the potential improvements in occupant safety through, for example, the introduction of airbags and new improved harness concepts. Models were developed {{at the start of the}} project to demonstrate the capability to model different landing scenarios for a full helicopter representation, including the fuselage, landing gears and tyres. The methods described here focussed on modelling the cockpit and cabin areas with representative models of the crash test dummies, the seats, the harnesses and a pilot airbag. The main elements of the models were developed using a multibody systems approach with additional use of finite elements for the modelling of airbags and harnesses. The simulations performed fed into a larger programme of work involving 12 European partners. The simulations performed supported, within the larger programme of work, a series of physical tests involving sled testing of cabin and cockpit mock-ups and full scale instrumented crash testing of helicopter structures including a pilot dummy a forward facing <b>passenger</b> <b>dummy</b> and a side seated <b>passenger</b> <b>dummy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Automobile crashes are {{the largest}} single {{cause of death for}} {{pregnant}} females and the leading cause of traumatic fetal injury mortality in the United States. A previously validated MADYMO computer model of a 30 -week pregnant occupant was used in this study to investigate the pregnant occupant response in a New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) frontal barrier motor vehicle crash. The effect of the restraints, all tests had a 3 point seatbelt and an airbag, and the vehicle performance in the crash are incorporated by applying the measured pelvic acceleration in the front seat <b>passenger</b> <b>dummy</b> to the pregnant occupant model. Included in the study are nine vehicle models that represent the compact, medium, and sport utility vehicle classes during the years 1996 to 2006 for a total of 26 NCAP tests with corresponding simulations. Uterine strain from the computational model, a good predictive measure of the risk of fetal injury due to placental abruption, indicates the average risk of adverse fetal outcome associated with these NCAP tests is 85 ± 13 % with a minimum risk of 55 % and a maximum risk of 100 %. NCAP star rating correlates with the risk of adverse fetal outcome (p= 0. 001) with 3 stars having an average risk of 99 ± 3 % (n= 3), 4 stars having an average risk of 89 ± 11 % (n= 14), and 5 stars having an average risk of 75 ± 13 % (n= 9). However, even the best NCAP rating, 5 stars, is still indicative of a high risk of fetal injury. This high risk is consistent with published pregnant occupant case studies that have an equivalent change in velocity of slightly more than 56. 3 kph (35 mph). Although this study is limited to computational modeling, it suggests more research in protecting the pregnant occupant is needed...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{displacement}} ventilation system, {{relying on}} air supply through the ceiling, has been developed, installed and investigated in the Do 728 test {{bed of the}} German Aerospace Center. The system uses a new ceiling air outlet concept, which allows for simultaneous supply of air and further functions like e. g. lighting or acoustic damping in future applications. Six different ventilation scenarios, among them mixing ventilation, cabin displacement ventilation, ceiling based displacement as well as combined ceiling and floor based dis-placement ventilation were studied and compared. <b>Passenger</b> thermal <b>dummies</b> were used to simulate ex-perimentally {{the impact of the}} passengers under real conditions. Flow velocities, fluid temperatures and sur-face temperatures were measured in the cabin, including the vicinity of the <b>passenger</b> <b>dummies.</b> This data was used to determine integral quantities like the temperature difference between cabin air and incoming air, the heat removal efficiency, the mean temperature stratification and the mean velocity levels in order to analyze and score the ventilation scenarios. A combined operation of the floor and ceiling based displacement ventilation system can ensure at once high heat removal efficiencies as well as predictably comfortable flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{ventilation}} systems {{as well as}} {{state of the art}} mixing ventilation (MV) were installed and investigated in a generic car mock-up under cooling conditions. The cabin of the full-scale facility comprises displacement ventilation air inlets at floor and ceiling level, which can be used solely or combined and allow for thermal comfort benefits, well-known from studies in aircraft cabins. Surface and fluid temperatures were analysed with an infrared camera and local temperature sensors. Omnidirectional velocity probes were used to capture the fluid velocities and temperatures in the vicinity of thermal <b>passenger</b> <b>dummies.</b> Regarding the comfort relevant flow parameters, mixing ventilation shines out with high air velocities and turbulences levels, but homogeneous temperature distributions. The novel ventilation concepts, on the other hand, allow for comfortable velocity and turbulence levels, but tend to comfort critical temperature stratifications, except for ceiling based displacement ventilation. Further differences are observed concerning the heat removal efficiency, which is highest for CDV and the heat exchange with the surrounding, which is highest for MV...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{quantify}} the influence of heat release on ventilation efficiency and thermal comfort parameters of displacement ventilation in a generic train compartment. A series of human subject studies was conducted for various mean room temperatures. Complementary, measurements using thermal manikins with variable sensible heat release were performed for the same mean room temperatures. Three main findings were achieved: First, values of latent and sensible heat release of human subjects in displacement ventilation are in very good agreement with the standard using T_chest as mean room temperature. Second, the heat removal efficiency (HRE) decreases with increasing mean cabin temperature, that is decreasing sensible heat release, during human subject tests. However, the HRE remains stable during the test with thermal manikins at a constant sensible heat release. Third, we found that variation of the sensible heat has a negligible impact on the flow velocities near the <b>passenger</b> <b>dummies.</b> This indicates that the cooling performance is limited by the rate of fresh air available through the fresh air lake...|$|R

40|$|Three novel {{ventilation}} systems are compared regarding their static performance to mixing ventilation in a full-scale generic car cabin mock-up (GCC) under winter, spring/fall and summer conditions. Herewith, our study {{focuses on the}} air supply efficiency and the equivalent temperature as measures to quantify the achievable air quality and thermal passenger comfort, respectively. The novel {{ventilation systems}} comprise cabin displacement ventilation (CDV), ceiling based cabin displacement ventilation (CCDV) and a hybrid CDV/CCDV ventilation setting (HV). As test environment, the GCC was equipped with four thermal <b>passenger</b> <b>dummies</b> (TPDs), which provide the thermal impact of the real passengers {{and serve as a}} means to access the local equivalent temperature at the same time. Further, the mock-up was equipped with a jacket heating/cooling system to experimentally simulate different seasonal conditions. Regarding ventilation efficiency, the novel ventilation concepts perform comparable or better than MV. At breathing level, CDV shows the best performance with LVEs 50 % larger as compared to MV. Concerning passenger thermal comfort, none of the systems was able to provide comfortable conditions in the winter scenario. However, during spring/fall and summer conditions CCDV and HV provide the best thermal comfort. While the cooling efficiency is largest with MV and CDV during summer conditions, the novel systems provide improved heating efficiency in the winter scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} a localized, {{transient}} head load on the temperature fields in aircraft cabin air flows was investigated in the Do 728 test bed of the German Aerospace Center. Surface and fluid temperatures were analyzed using more than 340 local sensors {{as well as a}} grid of polystyrene spheres, which was imaged by an infrared camera. To simulate the impact of the real <b>passengers,</b> thermal <b>passenger</b> <b>dummies</b> were used. The spatial spreading of the heat released by the local source could be characterized for {{the state of the art}} mixing ventilation system (MV – mixing ventilation) and a novel ventilation system (CCDV – ceiling based cabin displacement ventilation), which provides fresh air at low momentum through the cabin ceiling. As expected, CCDV provides lower cabin temperatures due to its higher heat removal efficiency. While MV tends to accumulate the heat released by the local source in the passenger zone, warm air is able to ascend to the ceiling more easy at CCDV due to the lower inertia forces. The different amount of inertia forces in the flow between MV and CCDV has a measureable impact on the temporal behavior of the resulting flow patterns during operation of the heat source, which is well reflected in the fluctuations of the temperature elevations...|$|R
50|$|A {{steam dummy}} or dummy engine, in the United States and Canada, was a steam engine {{enclosed}} {{in a wooden}} box structure made to resemble a railroad <b>passenger</b> coach. Steam <b>dummies</b> had some popularity in {{the first decades of}} railroading in the U.S., from the 1830s but passed from favor after the Civil War. In Europe, locomotives of this type were described as Tram engines.|$|R
40|$|Passenger comfort {{becomes more}} and more {{important}} in the automotive industries. Thus it is necessary to investigate the ventilation concepts realized in automotives e. g. inlet flows or interactions between the inlet-flow and linings. The here presented investigations aimed at the determination of the flow field between the left front air inlet and the left sidewindow of a mini-van by solving the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equation and the validation of these predictions comparison the predictions with flow field measurements. Therefore experimental and numerical investigations for a fixed flow-rate and 4 different inlet configurations were carried out at the facilities of the DLR in Göttingen. The configuration of the mini-van consists of standard interiours with carpets, instrument panels, and linings but without seats and <b>passenger</b> (<b>dummies)</b> for both numerical and experimental investigations. The calculations have been performed using the CFD codes of STAR-CD with the second-order differencing schemes MARS (monotone advection and reconstruction scheme) and CD (for density only) solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with various turbulent models and different meshing strategies. The differences of the predicted flow fields have been analysed in order to choose approach suited for such simulations. For a non-intrusive determination of the velocity components of the instantaneous flow-field the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique in a 2 C- 2 D setup was employed. To illuminate the tracer particles a Nd:YaG Laser has been used. Imaging of the scattered light from the tracer particles was performed using a high-resolution CCD-Kamera with a frame grabbing rate of 0. 5 Hz. For any of the four inlet configurations 1000 image-pairs have been recorded. Experimental and numerical results show the interaction of the inflow-jet with the B-pillar of the respective side window for different inlet configuration. A quantitative comparison between numerical and experimental data in terms of the normalized differential vector (U_exp - U_cfd) /U_mean shows a good agreement in general, though a superior agreement if the experimental and numerical results was achieved if the k-omega LowRe turbulence model was used in the simulations. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the performance of}} five different ventilation scenarios in a passenger aircraft cabin with unsteady and unbalanced heat loads. The ventilation scenarios comprise mixing ventilation (MV), cabin displacement ventilation (CDV), ceiling based cabin displacement ventilation (CCDV) and two hybrid CCDV/CDV settings. To ensure a realistic test environment, we equipped the cabin of a grounded short-range aircraft (Dornier 728) with 70 thermal <b>passenger</b> <b>dummies</b> (TPDs) and more than 340 local temperature and velocity sensors. A grid of polystyrene spheres in combination with an infrared camera allowed for the acquisition of instantaneous temperature fields in the fluid. A local, unsteady heat load was realized using a specially developed cylindrical heat source at a nominal power of 200 W. At MV and CCDV, the released heat remained concentrated {{in the vicinity of}} the heat source and expands mainly to the rows adjacent to the source. At CDV, the released heat rises straight to the ceiling and leaves the cabin, having just a minimal impact on the mean cabin temperature. At the hybrid scenarios, a dispersion of the released heat over the next one to two adjacent rows was observed, resulting in a much more homogeneous temperature in the proximity of the heat source. To study the reaction to inhomogeneous thermal boundary conditions, we {{investigated the}} influence of dedicated load distributions in the cabin on the cabin air temperatures as compared to a fully occupied cabin. At CDV and the hybrid scenarios, the impact on the temperatures at chest level is located very strongly at the positions of the deactivated TPDs. For MV and CCDV, the localization is much less pronounced. Herewith, CDV shines out with the weakest imprint of the deactivated TPDs on the temperature field. Looking at the absolute temperature level in the passenger zone, we find the weakest impact of the heat load distribution for CDV, followed by MV and CCDV. The hybrid scenarios unveil the strongest temperature changes. On the other hand, the hybrid scenarios shined out with the most homogeneous temperatures in the passenger zone, while MV and CCDV, revealed the largest inhomogenities...|$|R

The <b>dummy</b> was equipped with a system of three-axis accelerometers. The type of progressive safety gear that has the shortest time of reaction and the shortest effective braking distance in its group, was chosen for tests. The tests were carried out on an emplacement, which simulated the movement of passenger lift. Tests of emergency braking were performed at variable load of a cabin corresponding to the mass of different passengers number. The cabin was dispelled by the gravity force using its free-fall. During the braking, the values of accelerations effected on individual parts of dummy, were measured. Based on them and using HIC and Nij indexes, the impact of temporary accelerations on passenger’s health was determined...|$|R

5000|$|A normal {{motion picture}} film is played back at 24 frames per second, while {{television}} uses 25 frames/s (PAL) or 29.97 frames/s (NTSC). High-speed film cameras can film up to {{a quarter of}} a million frames per second by running the film over a rotating prism or mirror instead of using a shutter, thus reducing the need for stopping and starting the film behind a shutter which would tear the film stock at such speeds. Using this technique one second of action can be stretched to more than ten minutes of playback time (super slow motion). High-speed video cameras are widely used for scientific research, [...] military test and evaluation, and industry. [...] Examples of industrial applications are filming a manufacturing line to better tune the machine, or in the car industry filming a crash test to investigate the effect on the crash <b>dummy</b> <b>passengers</b> and the automobile. Today, the digital high-speed camera has replaced the film camera used for Vehicle Impact Testing. Television series such as MythBusters and Time Warp often use high-speed cameras to show their tests in slow motion. Saving the recorded high-speed images can be time consuming because , consumer cameras have resolutions up to four megapixels with frame rates of over 1,000 per second which will record at a rate of 11 gigabytes per second. Technologically these cameras are very advanced, yet saving images requires use of slower standard video-computer interfaces. While recording is very fast, saving images is considerably slower.To reduce the storage space required and the time required for people to examine a recording, only the parts of an action which are of interest or relevance can be selected to film. When recording a cyclical process for industrial breakdown analysis, only the relevant part of each cycle is filmed.|$|R
