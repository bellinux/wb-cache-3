Such projects have broadened the scope for understanding this new area of space research. Different CubeSats have been developed by other universities and institutions for different applications. The process of design, development and deployment of CubeSats involves several stages of theoretical and practical work ranging from understanding the concepts associated with communication subsystems, data handling subsystems to innovations in the field like implementing compatible operating systems in the CubeSat processors and new designs of transceivers and other components. One of the future trend setting research areas in CubeSat projects is the implementation of ROS in CubeSat. Robot Operating System (ROS) is aiming to capture the future of many embedded systems including Robotics. In this thesis, an attempt is made to understand the challenges faced during implementing ROS in CubeSat to provide a foundation for the OBDH subsystem and provide important guidelines for future developers relying on ROS run CubeSats. Since using traditional transceivers and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> would be expensive, we have tried simulating Arduino to act as transceiver and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>subsystems.</b> Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple microcontroller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board designed to make the process of using electronics in major embedded projects more accessible and inexpensive. Another important focus in this thesis has been to establish communication between CubeSat kit and Arduino. The major motivating factor for this thesis was to experiment with and come up with alternate ways which could prove as important measures in future to develop an effective and useful CubeSat by cutting down on development costs. An extensive literature review is carried out on the concepts of Arduino boards and ROS and its uses in Robotics which served as a base to understand its use in CubeSat. Experiment is conducted to communicate the CubeSat kit with Arduino. The results from the study of ROS and experiments with Arduino have been highly useful in drafting major problems and complications that developers would encounter while implementing ROS in CubeSat. Comprehensive analysis to the results obtained serve as important suggestions and guidelines for future researchers working in this field.

40|$|Biological tissue healing has {{recently}} attracted {{a great deal}} of research interest in various medical fields. Trauma to teeth, deep and root caries, and orthodontic treatment can all lead to various degrees of root resorption. In our previous study, we showed that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) enhances the growth of lower incisor apices and accelerates their rate of eruption in rabbits by inducing dental tissue growth. We also performed clinical studies and demonstrated that LIPUS facilitates the healing of orthodontically induced teeth-root resorption in humans. However, the available LIPUS devices are too large to be used comfortably inside the mouth. In this paper, the design and implementation of a low-power LIPUS generator is presented. The generator is the core of the final intraoral device for preventing tooth root loss and enhancing tooth root tissue healing. The generator consists of a power-supply subsystem, an ultrasonic transducer, an impedance-matching circuit, and an integrated circuit composed of a digital controller circuitry and the associated driver circuit.

40|$|Power {{consumption}} has arguably {{become the}} most important design consideration for modern, high-density servers, but current power management implementations have not evolved beyond primitive responses to thermal emergencies and do not manage to varying power and cooling constraints. We present a technique that manages the peak power consumption of a high-density server by implementing a feedback controller that uses precise, system-level power measurement to periodically select the highest performance state while keeping the system within a fixed power constraint. A control theoretic methodology is applied to systematically design this control loop with analytic assurances of system stability and controller performance, despite unpredictable workloads and running environments. This technique is particularly valuable when applied to servers with multiple power supplies, where a partial failure of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>subsystem</b> can result in a loss of performance in order to meet a lower power constraint. Conventional servers use simple open-loop policies to set a safe performance level in order to limit peak power consumption.

Development and {{theoretical}} {{ground of the}} analytical method for the calculation of the active, reactive and total powers in the electric traction devices, taking into consideration the non-stationary character of the stochastic processes change of the voltage and current in {{the elements of the}}se systems. Methodology. The mathematical methods of the random processes theory and the “discrete electrical engineering” methods are used for solving the main problem of this paper. Findings. The Method of the Correlation and Dispersion is developed for definition of the active power, the reactive power by Fryse and the total power of the devices in the elements of the electric traction system of the main-line railways. The method is based on the well-known concepts of auto- and inter-correlation functions of the random processes which govern the feeder voltages and the currents in the traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>subsystem</b> as well as the currents and voltages of the electric rolling stock. The method developed in this paper allows estimating the powers of both stationary and non-stationary processes. This method can be used for the analysis of both the traction mode and the regenerative braking mode of the electric rolling stock. The total power components were calculated for the one of the feeder areas of the Prydniprovsk railway using this method. The results show the significant flow of the reactive power in the traction power supply system. This fact is also confirmed by the high values of the reactive power coefficient. Originality. Scientific novelty of the research is consisted in the following. Firstly, for defining the active and reactive powers in elements of the traction power supply system the new method (the Method of Correlation and Dispersion) is created and grounded.

Microsatellite BIRD (Bispectral InfraRed Detection, mass 95 kg, sizes 550 x 610 x 620 mm) was launched with Indian PSLV on October 22 nd, 2001 into a sun-synchronous orbit. Payload consists of precise optical devices: VIS/NIR – Wide Angle Optoelectronic Stereo Scanner and MWIR/LWIR camera with activily cooled infrared sensors, operating within the MWIR range (from 3, 4 to 4, 2 µm) and within the LWIR range (from 8, 5 to 9, 3 µm wavelength). These cameras require an accurate control of optical axes geometrical parallelism and a faithful thermal control. The mean satellite power is about 35 – 40 W, with 10 – 20 min peak of 200 W power consumption in observation mode. The microsatellite thermal control system (TCS) has been designed to keep the satellite equipment within – 10 … + 30 ° C for cold and hot cases. It includes a thermally stable design of the payload structure, heat transfer elements (conductors and grooved heat pipes), thermally connecting the satellite’s segments, two radiators, multilayer insulation and low-conductive stand-offs. More than 9 years of operation in space has brought an enormous volume of telemetric data about the performance of the TCS, based on information of temperature sensors, on power consumption and on the attitude relative to Sun and Earth. The TCS successfully maintained the required temperature level of satellite components.

Snake magnets are {{also a part of}} the RHIC ring, and these snake magnets also require <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> There shall be a total of 24 snake <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> in both rings. <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> technology, connections, control systems and interfacing with the Quench Protection System will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{receiver}} <b>subsystem</b> <b>supplies</b> {{the front}} end assembly (downconverter) and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for the ORION Mobile Station. These assemblies are designed to withstand severe environmental conditions. The mechanical, electronic, environmental and maintenance design considerations encountered during the design phase of this project are discussed. The two channel S/X downconverter has a 400 MHz bandwidth channel. Phase stability of 2 and 7 deg at S- and X-bands, respectively, is achieved with a temperature stabilized first local oscillator...|$|R
