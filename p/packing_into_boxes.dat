50|$|De Bruijn's theorem states that, if a {{harmonic}} brick is <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> a <b>box,</b> {{then the}} box {{must be a}} multiple of the brick. For instance, the three-dimensional harmonic brick with side lengths 1, 2, and 6 can only be <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>boxes</b> in {{which one of the}} three sides is a multiple of six and one of the remaining two sides is even. Packings of a harmonic brick <b>into</b> a <b>box</b> may involve copies of the brick that are rotated with respect to each other. Nevertheless, the theorem states that the only boxes that can be packed in this way are boxes that could also be packed by translates of the brick.|$|R

40|$|In this work, a novel {{method to}} model off-diagonal {{disorder}} in organic materials has been developed. The off-diagonal disorder is taken {{directly from the}} geometry of the system, which includes both a distance and an orientational dependence on the constituent molecules, and does not rely on a parametric random distribution. To study this method, a system is generated by running molecular dynamics simulations on phenylene-vinylene oligomers <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>boxes.</b> The impact of the model is then investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations of the charge transport in these boxes and a comparison is made to the commonly used model of off-diagonal disorder, where only the distance dependence is properly accounted for.

40|$|We present {{our work}} on the {{dimensioning}} of a packet-switching wavelength division multiplexing ring {{in order to reduce}} its infrastructure (capital expenditure) cost. We study a new all-optical architecture: the packed optical add-drop multiplexer (POADM). We aim to minimize the overall cost of the network by reducing the number of indispensable devices in the nodes and the number of required wavelengths. We formalize the packing problems underlying the ring dimensioning. The elements to be packed are made up of transmissions that share the same destination. We assume that elements can be cut before being <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>boxes.</b> We furnish a complete theoretical analysis of the complexity and approximability of these problems. We define also several measures of quality for a cut and provide an optimal cutting strategy, according to these measures. Our subsequent contribution is a heuristic solution that solves the bi-criteria packing problem (the number of boxes and the number of cuts are minimized simultaneously). The exhaustive numerical results of this heuristic algorithm come next. We rely on our optimal cutting strategy to appraise the efficiency of other strategies. We also adapt the only existing POADM dimension-ing algorithm, more restrictive than ours, and we confront it with our solution. The analysis of results allows us to provide network design guidelines to perform the dimensioning in the most efficient way...|$|R

Transport {{to the surface of}} the steel was as gaseous carbon monoxide, generated by the breakdown of the carburising compound and the oxygen <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> the sealed <b>box.</b> This takes place with pure carbon but too slowly to be workable. Although oxygen is required for this process it is re-circulated through the CO cycle and so can be carried out inside a sealed box. The sealing is necessary to stop the CO either leaking out or being oxidised to CO2 by excess outside air.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of packing {{two-dimensional}} objects of quite arbitrary shapes including in particular curved shapes (like ellipses) and assemblies of them. This problem arises in industry for the packaging and transport of bulky objects which are not individually <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>boxes,</b> like car spare parts. There has been considerable work on packing curved objects but, most of the time, with specific shapes; one famous example being the circle packing problem. There is much less algorithm for the general case where different shapes can be mixed together. A successful approach has been proposed recently in [Martinez et al., 2013] and the algorithm we propose here is an extension of their work. Mar-tinez et al. use a stochastic optimization algorithm with a fitness function that gives a violation cost and equals zero when objects are all packed. Their main idea is to define this function as a sum of n!/(2 !*(n- 2) !) elementary functions that measure the overlapping between each pair of different objects. However, these functions are ad-hoc formulas. Designing ad-hoc formulas for every possible combination of object shapes can be a very tedious task, which dramatically limits the applicability of their approach. The aim {{of this paper is to}} generalize the approach by replacing the ad-hoc formulas with a numerical algorithm that automatically measures the overlapping between two objects. Then, we come up with a fully black-box packing algorithm that accept any kind of objects. [Martinez et al., 2013] T. Martinez, L. Vitorino, F. Fages, and A. Aggoun.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>packing</b> many small <b>boxes</b> <b>into</b> a single larger box {{underlies}} {{a number of}} cutting, packing, scheduling, and transportation applications. There {{are a number of}} heuristic solvers, but the progress in exact solvers, in general, and integer programming solvers, in particular, has been limited. Padberg [Math. Methods Oper. Res., 52 (1) : 1 – 21, 2000] estimated his extension of the integer linear programming formulation of Chen et al. could cope with “about twenty boxes”. Our computational experiments confirm that the seemingly trivial decision whether twelve unit-cubes can be <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> a <b>box</b> with the unit-base and height eleven (“ 3 D Pigeon Hole”), cannot be made within an hour by modern integer programming solvers using this formulation. We present a new, “space-indexed”, linear programming relaxation, which often provides lower bounds within 1 percent of optimality, and makes it possible to solve instances of 3 D Pigeon Hole problem with ten million boxes within an hour. Results of extensive computational tests of both formulations are reported. 1...|$|R

Additionally the mechanical systems were developed for other purposes by a 3rd party, Mosler, who sold a sorting system known as the Selectriever. By combining the two technologies, Laura could develop a highly competitive device for costs well below the Photostore.|$|R
