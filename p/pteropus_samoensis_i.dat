5000|$|The {{two species}} of flying foxes (bats) {{protected}} in the park are: <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> (known locally as pe'a voa) meaning [...] "fruit bat of the forests" [...] and Pteropus tonganus locally called pe'afaunua, which means [...] "fruit bat of settled lands"; The roosting place of <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> (with prominent light colored face with brown body) is the canopy of ridge top trees, which roost alone or in small groups and are active during day time with two feeding peaks, the Pteropus tonganus (with black colored face with seal brown body) species roost in large groups (100 or more in numbers in each group) in thick forest habitat, also sometimes seen close to villages. Both species have a wing span of 1 m at adulthood, and weigh about 500 grams.|$|R
50|$|The Samoa {{flying fox}} or Samoan flying fox (<b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis)</b> is {{a species of}} flying fox in the family Pteropodidae. It is found in American Samoa, Fiji, and Samoa (where it is known as pe'a and pe'a vao). Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Tatau is {{an ancient}} Polynesian artform which is {{associated}} with the rites of passage for men. Pe'a is also the Samoan word for the flying fox (fruit bat, <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis),</b> and there are many Polynesian myths, proverbs and legends associated with this winged creature. One legend from the island of Savai'i is about Nafanua, Samoa's goddess of war, rescued by flying foxes when she was stranded on an inhospitable island.|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of flying foxes (genus Pteropus) from the Samoan {{archipelago}} are described {{on the basis of}} modern museum specimens collected in the mid- 19 th century. A medium-sized species (P. allenorum, n. sp.) is introduced from the island of Upolu (Independent Samoa), based on a specimen collected in 1856 and deposited in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. It has not been collected again, and we regard it as almost certainly extinct. This species is smaller bodied and has much smaller teeth than both extant congeners recorded in the contemporary fauna of Samoa (<b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> and P. tonganus). The closest relative of this new species may be Pteropus fundatus of northern Vanuatu. The disjunct historical distribution of these two small-toothed flying foxes (in Vanuatu and Samoa) suggests that similar species may have been more extensively distributed in the remote Pacific in the recent past. Another species, a very large flying fox with large teeth (P. coxi, n. sp.), is described from two skulls collected in Samoa in 1839 – 1841 during the U. S. Exploring Expedition; it too has not been collected since. This robust species resembles <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> and <b>Pteropus</b> anetianus of Vanuatu in craniodental conformation but is larger than other Polynesian Pteropus, and in some features it is ecomorphologically convergen...|$|R
40|$|Prehistoric {{bones from}} caves {{on the island}} of 'Eua, Kingdom of Tonga, {{document}} the former presence of the megachiropterans <b>Pteropus</b> ton-ganus, <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis,</b> and Notopteris mac-donaldi and the microchiropterans Emballonura semicaudata and Chaerephon jobensis. Of these five species of bats, only Pteropus tonganus and Emballonura semicaudata still occur on 'Eua or anywhere else in Tonga. Bones of all five species occur in sediments that predate the arrival of hu-mans on 'Eua (i. e., those more than 3500 - 3000 years old) as well as in younger deposits. The ex-tinction of bat species on 'Eua, as with the two species of lizards and 23 species of land birds, is probably related to human impact...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of the peka, or fruit bat, of the genus Pteropus from Niue (= Savage) Island (190 S, 1690 W, 480 km east of Tonga, 500 km southeast of Samoa and about 1, 040 km west of the Southern Cook Islands), South Pacific, by Gunther (1874) as Pteropus tonganus Quoy & Gaimard, 1830, is confirmed. Upon comparing the peka, the only fruit bat on Niue, with the other Pteropus species present on the nearest islands of Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and Uvea, we concluded that the differences between <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> and P. nawaiensis are insignificant and that {{the latter is a}} subspecies of P. samoensis. The present distribution, numbers, roosting and feeding habits, and present status of Pteropus tonganus on Niue Island are described...|$|R
50|$|Animal species include fruit bats {{such as the}} Samoa flying-fox (<b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis),</b> {{land and}} seabirds, skinks and geckos. The birdlife of Samoa {{includes}} a total of 82 species, of which 11 are endemic, found only in Samoa. Endemic birdlife found only on Savai'i include species such as the Samoan white-eye (Zosterops samoensis) which is only found in the high cloud forests and alpine scrub around Mt Silisili, and Samoan moorhen (Gallinula pacifica), which was last recorded in 1873 near Aopo with possible sightings in 1984 and 2003. The tooth-billed pigeon, (Didunculus strigirostris), {{also known as the}} manumea is also endemic and now increasingly rear leading to the current proposition to upgrade it to critically endangered. It is the national bird of Samoa and is found on some of the local currency. It is likely that the extensive loss of lowland forest, hunting and invasive species are responsible for the decline of this stunning species.|$|R
40|$|Speakman and {{co-workers}} suggested the diurnal Samoan flying fox, <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis,</b> {{may be at}} risk of hyperthermia when flying during the day, particularly at high levels of insolation. We monitored activity of this bat and climate simultaneously at two different sites and four times of year in American Samoa. Flight activity varied significantly with time of day, between days, study sites and seasons. Out of the six data sets collected, the four with the highest mean levels of insolation showed a significant decrease in bat numbers with increasing temperature and sunlight. When each individual activity count was directly compared to the predictions of Speakman {{and co-workers}}' biophysical model, 85 to 95 % of bat flight activity was found to be in conditions the model suggested would not pose a risk of hyperthermia. This supports the suggestion that in extreme conditions the animals would not fly as they risked overheating. The 5 to 15 % of counts in which animals were seen to fly in conditions the model predicted they should not may be explained by erroneous assumptions underlying the model predictions...|$|R
40|$|The nocturnal {{behaviour}} of bats {{makes it}} difficult to determine their foraging habits at night, especially in regards to the height or altitude at which they fly. This is particularly true for the larger flying foxes that can travel up to 40 km in a single night(Spen cer et al., 1991; Parsons et al., 2006). Despite the value of such information for many aspects of the foraging ecology and ecophysiology of bats, gathering information on the flight altitudes used by bats remains a challenge that has led to the use of inventive sampling techniques. Active radar systems monitoring aircraft movements have detected the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) flying at altitudes of over 3, 000 m (10, 000 feet) (Williams et al., 1973), while helium filled kite balloons in combination with bat echolocation detection devices have identified molossid and emballonurid bats foraging at heights of almost 600 m (1968. 5 feet) (Fenton and Griffin, 1997). The diurnal Sa moan flying fox, <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis,</b> has been observed soaring on thermal updrafts (Rich mond et al., 1998; Lindhe Norberg et al., 2000; Thomson et al., 2002), but unfortunately knowledge on the actual flying altitude of this or any other pteropodid species remains unknown...|$|R
40|$|The poorly studied bat fauna of the Fiji Islands is of notable {{conservation}} importance {{because it}} includes one endemic species, several near endemics, {{and the best}} global populations of several threatened species. In addition, some of the species play a keystone role as pollinators and seed dispersers in valuable forest ecosystems. We visited 30 islands of the archipelago to survey bats and assess their conservation status and the potential threats to their continued existence. The Vulnerable Notopteris macdonaldi occurs on the three main islands but may only have nurseries on one of them. The Critically Endangered, endemicMirimiri acrodonta appears to be restricted to a small montane area on a single island. Pteropus tonganus is consumed throughout rural Fiji but remains common and is not currently threatened by the harvest. The Near Threatened <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> is locally common on the largest islands but threatened on some smaller islands. The Endangered Chaerephon bregullae exists only on two islands and appears to concentrate in a single large colony to nurse young. The EndangeredEmballonura semicaudata has declined dramatically in Fiji, as across most of its range, although a few substantial populations remain on some small islands. Factors threatening these species are variable but include small ranges, concentration in a reduced number of colonies, deforestation, over-harvesting, and introduced predators. We propose conservation measures and indicate a number of priority sites...|$|R
40|$|Many {{tropical}} herbivores {{alter their}} diets {{throughout the year}} in response to different levels of food availability. Fruit bats, including <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> Peale and <b>Pteropus</b> tonganus Quoy & Gaimard, are phytophagous species that may increase their consumption of foods such as unripe fruit and leaves in periods of low fruit diversity and volume. These periods include the tropical dry season or following the frequent hurricanes that batter the Samoan Archipelago. We examined the nutritional composition of leaves and immature fruits and compared the levels of organic and mineral nutrients with those of ripe fruit. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to examine patterns of variation in nutrient components of leaves, unripe fruit, and ripe fruit, {{as well as to}} compare the mean levels of nutrients. Overall, unripe fruit provided levels of nutrients comparable with those of ripe fruit of the same species for many organic and mineral components. Unripe fruit were only half as rich in iron as ripe fruit, but unripe fruit had high levels of calcium compared with ripe fruit of the same species. Leaves are often cited as a rich source of protein for fruit bats, and our results were consistent with this suggestion. Leaves were also found to be rich in zinc, manganese, and calcium. Therefore, flying foxes and other herbivores probably do not avoid unripe fruits and leaves because of their low nutrient levels. It may be that these famine foods are not normally consumed {{because of the presence of}} secondary compounds, low concentrations of palatable sugars, or a distasteful and hard pericarp on unripe fruits...|$|R
40|$|Indigenous {{custodians}} manage important forest {{areas and}} have vital roles in biodiversity conservation in the Pacific, but {{their understanding of}} the role of bats in rainforest function is limited, and their perception of bats often negative, possibly compromising opportunities for conservation. To determine whether bat and forest conservation could be mediated by the identification of services provided by bats, we assessed similarity between bat-serviced (pollination and seed dispersal) and people-valued forest plants in Fiji. In nearly 500 diet samples from all four Fiji flying-fox species, we found 37 pollen morphospecies associated with Notopteris macdonaldi, <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis,</b> and Pteropustonganus. Thirteen morphospecies overlapped among bats, but were used in different proportions. No fruit was recorded in the diet of N. macdonaldi. Twenty-two fruit species groups (co-generic species that could not be distinguished) were recorded for Pteropus spp. A rainforest plant community represented by a survey of 2983 plants contained 75 % of species groups valued by people (medicinal, cultural, economic uses), and bats serviced at least 42 % of these species (96 % valued by humans). The high similarity between bat and human resources (Sørensen’s coefficient, SS = 0. 68) increased in a sub-sample of the 30 most abundant tree genera (SS = 0. 80). Plant endemism was high in the rainforest community (70 %). Most endemic species were valued by people (SS = 0. 78 for abundant trees) and serviced by bats (SS = 0. 77). The great overlap between the plant assemblage benefiting from bat services and that valued by humans indicates that conservation approaches tailored to individual communities could be developed to promote bat conservation in traditionally-owned landscapes where negative perception of bats exists...|$|R
40|$|Bats seldom soar {{because it}} is {{behaviour}} generally {{associated with the use}} of thermals, which are normally of insuf®cient strength at night to support the behaviour. Daylight ¯ying bats, however, such as the Samoan ¯ying fox <b>Pteropus</b> <b>samoensis</b> may be able to exploit thermals for soaring. This may give the bats one of two advantages. It may reduce the energy costs of transport because gliding ¯ight is much cheaper than active ¯apping ¯ight. However, because less endogenous heat is generated by soaring, a second advantage may be that it reduces the thermal stress placed on these bats. Thermal stress is a factor that we have shown previously probably constrains the daylight ¯ying behaviour of this species. Observations of the patterns of soaring behaviour at two sites on American Samoa in March and October 1995 supported the predictions of the energy saving but not the hyperthermia avoidance hypothesis. Soaring was a common behaviour under all conditions and was used extensively when conditions did not pose a threat of hyperthermia. In March, the bats also adopted ¯ight patterns over time that exposed them to areas of the valleys where insolation was greatest, presumably increasing their risk of hyperthermia but bringing energy saving bene®ts. Modelling the expected heat ¯ows during soaring and ¯apping ¯ight using an established model revealed that soaring reduced the risk of hyperthermia, when ¯ying in the shade of clouds, because of the energy savings resulting from reduced endogenous heat production. However, when soaring in sunlight, these savings are more than offset by the increased exogenous heat uptake, because a greater proportion of the wing surface is exposed when soaring. Despite its low endogenous energy cost, soaring in sunlight is not thermally advantageous, and the behaviour of the bats re¯ected this fact. Key words: soaring behaviour, Samoan ¯ying fox, Pteropus samoensi...|$|R
