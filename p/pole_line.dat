25|$|Davis' Toad Tunnel is a {{wildlife}} crossing that {{was constructed in}} 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on The Daily Show. Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped {{from one side of}} a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the <b>Pole</b> <b>Line</b> Road overpass which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21inches (53cm) wide and 18inches (46cm) high.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, in {{conjunction}} with the subway construction project, Queens Boulevard was widened with up to twelve lanes in some places, and a right-of-way of [...] in width was created. With the widening, Queens Boulevard was wide enough {{for the construction of a}} four track subway line without serious disruption of surface travel, with the area alongside the boulevard not built up in many places. More often than not in some places, billboards would be visible instead of buildings. During the construction of the line, electric utility service was temporarily provided by a wooden <b>pole</b> <b>line.</b> Once the construction of the line was completed, the utility service was underground, and the Queens Boulevard trolley line was replaced by bus service (today's [...] ), in part due to competition with the newly constructed subway line. Because the construction of the Queens Boulevard Line utilized the cut-and-cover tunneling method, Queens Boulevard had to be torn up and in order to allow pedestrians to cross, temporary bridges were built over the trenches. Like other IND lines, many stations' mezzanines stretched the full length and width of their stations, and are now considered to be overbuilt.|$|E
40|$|Research on size {{structure}} of skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> fishermen {{inside and outside}} of fish aggregation device area has been done from January until June 2016 in Gulf of Bone waters. The objectives of research were to analysis of size structure percentage of suitable length to catch and yield composition of <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> with FAD and without FAD. Size structure was analyzed by method of Bhattacharya percentage of suitable length to catch by method of Mallawa and catch composition by column diagram. The result showed that the size structure was different between skipjacks captured by <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> with FAD and without FAD where skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> with FAD dominated by small fishes while skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> without FAD dominated by large fishes percentage of suitable length to catch of skipjack captured by <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> without FAD was high than <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> with FAD while both were still low yields of <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> with FAD and <b>pole</b> and <b>line</b> without FAD consist of skipjacks and yellow fin tuna where skipjack was dominant for all trip...|$|R

25|$|The tuna {{are caught}} by the {{following}} methods: <b>pole</b> and <b>line,</b> handline and longline.
