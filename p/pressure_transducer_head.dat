Existing pressure sensing technologies are available which suit these demanding applications, however these transducers are usually relatively expensive.

A temperature compensation routine was developed which improved the accuracy of the piezoresistive <b>pressure</b> <b>transducers</b> over a substantial range of operating temperatures.
