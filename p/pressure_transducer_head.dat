Existing pressure sensing technologies are available which suit these demanding applications, however these transducers are usually relatively expensive. This project investigates the use of inexpensive piezoresistive <b>pressure</b> <b>transducers</b> in the measurement of transient fluid pressures. A temperature compensation routine was developed which improved the accuracy of the piezoresistive <b>pressure</b> <b>transducers</b> over a substantial range of operating temperatures.
