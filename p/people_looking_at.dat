25|$|General Building – 33 Shortland Street. Neo-Classical {{skyscraper}} {{built for}} the Yorkshire Insurance Company. Designed by W R Bloomfield in 1928. Bloomfield was probably the first Maori architect. The Shortland Street facade of this building was extended in 1977. Few <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the building would {{be aware that the}} right hand {western} side of the building is from 1928 and the left hand {eastern} from 1977 as the classical detailing was perfectly replicated.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique {{and they want to be}} who they are. A relationship, or whatever, it is just breaking out and feeling free." [...] Hollywood Records described [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she has to stay true to herself in relationships".|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were less}} {{enthusiastic about the}} episode than the general consensus. Although Josh Wigler of MTV declared [...] "TS-19" [...] a [...] "compelling hour", he professed that it was lacking for a season finale. [...] "While there was a massive fireball and a decent amount of zombie action," [...] explained Wigler, [...] "not to mention some concrete information regarding the outbreak, there are still several plot threads that haven't come close to resolution." [...] Vanity Fair Mike Ryan argued that {{in contrast to a}} [...] "great season", the episode was a mediocre conclusion to The Walking Dead first season, writing that [...] "this might have been the silliest hour of television that I've ever watched". Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club issued [...] "TS-19" [...] a B– grade: despite proclaiming that [...] "there was some good stuff" [...] in the episode, Pierce opined that it fell below his expectations. He denounced many scenes in the episode—notably the explosion sequence—as he felt it was a waste of cinematography. [...] "The fact that almost all the scenes played out in dark, closed quarters wasted The Walking Dead gorgeous cinematography; the pacing was again off beat, with far too much padded scenes of <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> one another in shock; and, though I'm usually not bothered by plot contrivances, there's no way anyone in a vehicle that close to such a huge explosion would have lived through it." [...] Writing for Cinema Blend, Nick Venable said that it was an interesting episode, although it could have been executed in a better manner.|$|E

2500|$|According to Smalley, [...] "The {{photographs}} in the gymnasium were taken primarily in western Pennsylvania between 1988 and 2000, though many <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them think their quirky compositions date them {{from the turn of}} the 20th century. When editing and sequencing the book, I wanted to resist any antique design conceits and, instead, present the images in a clean and direct manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Walter Kimbrough of the {{historically}} black college, Philander Smith College, argued that U.S. News, [...] "focuses on institutional resources, student selectivity and graduation rates {{to select the}} top institutions. But since many HBCUs struggle with these issues, he says the rankings in effect discourage students from going to those schools [...] If there are <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the rankings as a measurement {{of the quality of}} an institution, they think [...] do not have any type of qualities [...] do not tell you who the best schools are, just the most privileged.", ...|$|E
2500|$|Carolyn Ann (Callie) Khouri {{was born}} in San Antonio, Texas, but {{was brought up in}} Kentucky. Her family name is of Christian Arab origin, meaning priest in the Arabic language. Khouri's {{interest}} in theatre arts began when she took part in high school plays. Following her graduation from St Mary's High School in Paducah, Kentucky, she studied landscape architecture at Purdue University before changing her major to drama. Khouri dropped out of Purdue and moved to Los Angeles, California where she waited tables [...] and studied at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and with acting teacher, Peggy Feury. [...] She soon realized that being an actress was not her destiny: [...] "I can't stand <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me," [...] says Khouri.|$|E

40|$|Studying how <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{a product}} is {{important}} for understanding human interpretation of design products. This research studies the perception of design products {{by using eye tracking}} technology and applying established usability research methods. The gaze path analysis shows that <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the same product differently depending on their motivation. Our initial findings suggest that people have at least three different first impression perception strategies - narrow, holistic and combined strategy. New knowledge of how people perceive products may help designers in presenting their ideas and in completing the designs...|$|R

2500|$|Acquired {{situational}} narcissism (ASN) {{is a form}} of narcissism {{that develops}} in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of celebrity. It was coined by Robert B. Millman, {{professor of psychiatry at the}} Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society. [...] Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. [...] "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them that they stop looking back at other people." [...] In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder, differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. [...] "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable," [...] so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is Norma Desmond, the main character of Sunset Boulevard.|$|E

60|$|He {{never went}} out in the evening now, and only twice to the House, when his vote was more than usually important; but Mrs. Evelyn was taking Sydney into society, and the {{shrinking}} Esther needed a chaperon much more, being so little aware of her own beauty, that she was wont to think something amiss with her hair or her dress when she saw <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E

60|$|The speed {{began to}} slacken and Williamson {{collected}} his belongings. Dick handed him his coat {{as the train}} stopped, but did not shake hands with him. Somehow he felt he would rather not. After a careless good-by, Williamson jumped down, and Dick sat in a corner, struggling against the faintness that was overcoming him. He would feel better when the train started, but he must be alone; {{he could not have}} <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him while he felt as he did.|$|E
6000|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} round, the pace slackened a little; and Delamayn was in front again. He kept ahead, until the opening of the {{eleventh}} round. At that point, Fleetwood flung up one hand in the air with a gesture of triumph; and bounded past Delamayn with a shout of [...] "Hooray for the North!" [...] The shout was echoed by the spectators. In proportion as the exertion began to tell upon the men, so the excitement steadily rose among the <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|E

5000|$|Incremental {{decision-making}} and escalating commitment: <b>People</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a decision {{as a small}} step in a process, and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions. This can be contrasted with zero-based decision-making (see Slippery slope).|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, my way {{is short}} and simple. We must put things into our rooms that people will look at, {{so that they will}} forget to look at the {{furniture}}, and never once trouble their heads about it.

60|$|They {{were not}} burly, red-faced, and stout, as I had {{sometimes}} conceived of the English people, but just full enough {{to suggest the}} idea of vigor and health.

60|$|The Nelson monument, with Lord Nelson, in a cocked hat, on its top, is very grand in its effect. All {{about the}} square there were sundry loungers, <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the bas-reliefs on Nelson's Column, {{children}} paddling in the reservoirs of the fountains; and, {{it being a}} sunny day, it was a cheerful and lightsome, {{as well as an}} impressive scene. On second thoughts, I do not know but that London should have a far better display of architecture and sculpture than this, on its finest site, and in its very centre; for, after all, there is nothing of the very best. But I missed nothing at the time.|$|E
