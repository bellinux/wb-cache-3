It facilitates the utilization of high molarity electrolytes and therefore the cells exhibit good rate performance and stability. The cathodes in the 5 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) electrolyte show the highest discharge capacities (up to 1404 mA h gs− 1) and capacity retention (72 % after 50 cycles at C/ 5).

Isotherms of methane, ethane, propane, hydrogen, nitrogen, and CO 2 were measured. The atypical shape of these isotherms is attributed to the breathing properties of the material, in which a transition from a very narrow <b>pore</b> <b>form</b> to a narrow <b>pore</b> <b>form</b> and from a narrow <b>pore</b> <b>form</b> to a large <b>pore</b> <b>form</b> occurs, depending on the total pressure {{and the nature of}} the adsorbate, as demonstrated by in situ XRD patterns measured during adsorption. Apart from CO 2, all tested gases interacted weakly with the adsorbent. As a result, they are excluded from adsorption in the narrow <b>pore</b> <b>form</b> of the <b>material</b> at low pressure. CO 2 interacted much more strongly and was adsorbed in significant amounts at low pressure. This gives the material excellent properties to separate CO 2 from other gases. The separation of CO 2 from methane, nitrogen, hydrogen, or a combination of these gases has been demonstrated by breakthrough experiments using pellets of NH 2 -MIL- 53 (Al). The effect of total pressure (130 bar), gas composition, temperature (303403 K) and contact time has been examined.

The first type released only K+, and included gramicidin A. The second type predominantly released K+, preceding the release of calcein, and included amphotericin B and nystatin. The third type, including antimicrobial peptides, such as gramicidin S, alamethicin, and melittin, and several membrane-active drugs, like celecoxib (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), 1 -dodecylazacycloheptan- 2 -one (named azone; skin permeation enhancer), and chlorpromazine (tranquilizer), caused the release of K+ and calcein simultaneously. Thus, the sizes of <b>pores</b> <b>formed</b> in a liposomal membrane increased in the following order: types one, two, and three.

Our {{results show that the}} PAMAM dendrimer, in either its protonated (P) or non-protonated (NP) states can spontaneously enter the protein lumen. Protonated dendrimers interact strongly with the negatively charged protein pore lumen. As a consequence, P dendrimers assume a more expanded configuration efficiently blocking the pore when compared with the more compact configuration adopted by the neutral NP dendrimers creating a greater void space for the passage of water and ions. To quantify the effective blockage of the protein pore, we have calculated the pore conductance as well as the residence times by applying a weak force on the ions/water. Ionic currents are reduced by 91 % for the P dendrimers and 31 % for the NP dendrimers. The preferential binding of Cl-counter ions to the P dendrimer creates a zone of high Cl-concentration {{in the vicinity of the}} internalized dendrimer and a high concentration of K+ ions in the transmembrane region of the pore lumen. In addition to steric effects, this induced charge segregation for the P dendrimer effectively blocks ionic transport through the pore.
