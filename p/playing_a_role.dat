5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

5|$|Following the battle, John {{accompanied}} the Nicaeans in their rapid {{occupation of the}} Epirote domains, but he quickly became alienated from them. He brought his own followers to Vonitsa, from where he contacted his father, who had taken refuge in the Ionian Islands. Michael accepted his son's apologies, and soon joined him on the mainland. Byzantine control over Epirus {{had not yet been}} consolidated, and father and son were quickly able to recapture the Epirote capital of Arta and then relieve the besieged city of Ioannina. Within a short time, the Nicaeans had been evicted from Epirus. John's half-brother Nikephoros was then sent in spring 1260 to recover Thessaly, which he mostly accomplished after defeating and capturing the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos. Part of eastern Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, remained in Nicaean hands for several years thereafter. Again, despite his association with Thessaly, John is not mentioned as <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in these events or in the administration of the Thessalian territories in the early 1260s, which seem rather to have been under the control of Nikephoros.|$|E
5|$|History of the hermitage is {{traced to}} the 9th century when Padmasambhava (Padma ’byung gnas) meditated here. The main cave where he did penance {{is known as the}} ‘Cavern of Dochung Chongzhi (Rdo cung cong zhi’i phug pa)’. Over the centuries, the monastery has seen many leading lights of the Tibetan monastic order <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in its building, such as the Zhang ’gro ba’i mgon po g.yu brag pa (1123–1193), female saint Ma cig lab sgron, Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho’s (1641–1713), Ngawang Jampa (Phur lcog sku phreng dang po ngag dbang byams pa, 1682–1762) and Pan chen blo bzang ye shes (1663–1737). Royal family members like the Queen Tsering Trashi (Rgyal mo tshe ring bkra shis) and the Tibetan King Pho lha nas (1689–1747) also {{supported}} the activities of the hermitage. However, the most significant face of development occurred during the third Purchok incarnation Lozang Tsültrim Jampa Gyatso (Phur lcog sku phreng gsum pa blo bzang tshul khrims byams pa rgya mtsho) who was teacher of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas.|$|E
5|$|The moths migrate in {{response}} {{to changes in the}} host plants. Chrysiridia larvae defoliate the whole plant, and even eat the flowers and fruit, and thus have a considerable negative impact on the reproduction and survival of seedlings. The plants probably react by changing their nutrient and secondary compound levels, becoming toxic to the larvae and causing high mortality. Omphalea populations that are not damaged by moths {{for long periods of time}} have lower toxicity. These factors cause mass increases in local population, followed by sudden crashes. The population crashes might result from increased larval mortality, but are more likely caused by the emigration of the adult moths. Through semiochemicals, the plant may recruit hymenopteran parasitoids as a protection, hence <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the population dynamics of the moth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the relation between beliefs and goals in agent theory. Beliefs play three roles in reasoning about goals: they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the generation of unconditional desires from conditional ones, they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in adoption of desires as goals, and they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> {{in the selection of}} plans to achieve goals. In this paper {{we consider the}} role of goals in reasoning about beliefs. Though we assume that goals do not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the belief generation problem, we argue that they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the belief selection problem. We show the rationality of the use of goals in belief selection, in the sense that there are cases in which agents that take their goals into account in selecting a belief set from a set of alternatives outperform agents that do not do so. We also formally distinguish between the rational role of goals in belief selection and irrational wishful thinking...|$|R

25|$|Quinolinic acid may be {{involved}} in schizophrenia; however, there has been no research done to examine the specific effects of quinolinic acid in schizophrenia.
