The lower middle-order batsman's half-century helped the team to a modest 217 for eight. He then returned to claim four for 35 while off-spinner S Kazi took four wickets for 28 runs to help bowl Odisha out for 177. Odisha's top-scorer, Govind <b>Podder</b> (74) was among the spinner's wickets.|$|E

60|$|All-Muggleton had {{the first}} innings; and the {{interest}} became intense when Mr. Dumkins and Mr. <b>Podder,</b> {{two of the most}} renowned members of that most distinguished club, walked, bat in hand, to their respective wickets. Mr. Luffey, the highest ornament of Dingley Dell, was pitched to bowl against the redoubtable Dumkins, and Mr. Struggles was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered <b>Podder.</b> Several players were stationed, to 'look out,' {{in different parts of the}} field, and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee, and stooping very much as if he were 'making a back' for some beginner at leap-frog. All the regular players do this sort of thing;--indeed it is generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out properly in any other position.|$|E
60|$|The umpires were {{stationed}} behind the wickets; the scorers {{were prepared to}} notch the runs; a breathless silence ensued. Mr. Luffey retired a few paces behind the wicket of the passive <b>Podder,</b> and applied the ball to his right eye for several seconds. Dumkins confidently awaited its coming with {{his eyes fixed on}} the motions of Luffey.|$|E

50|$|His {{first book}} was Deceivers. Deceivers is a {{compilation}} of two thrillers set in {{the backdrop of the}} social sector. Since then, 18 of his books have been published, 15 crime fiction but also two romantic comedy and one non-fiction. His latest releases are 3 mixed up men, romantic novel, Dynasty, crime thriller and Chief Minister's Mistress crime thriller. Chief Minister's Mistress is reviewed in Indian Express and Joygopal <b>Podder's</b> skills are compared there with those of John Grisham.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Run--run--another.--Now, then {{throw her}} up--up with her--stop there--another--no--yes--no--throw her up, throw her up!'--Such were the shouts which {{followed}} the stroke; {{and at the}} conclusion of which All-Muggleton had scored two. Nor was <b>Podder</b> behindhand in earning laurels wherewith to garnish himself and Muggleton. He blocked the doubtful balls, missed the bad ones, took the good ones, and sent them flying to all parts of the field. The scouts were hot and tired; the bowlers were changed and bowled till their arms ached; but Dumkins and <b>Podder</b> remained unconquered. Did an elderly gentleman essay to stop the progress of the ball, it rolled between his legs or slipped between his fingers. Did a slim gentleman try to catch it, it struck him on the nose, and bounded pleasantly off with redoubled violence, while the slim gentleman's eyes filled with water, and his form writhed with anguish. Was it thrown straight up to the wicket, Dumkins had reached it before the ball. In short, when Dumkins was caught out, and <b>Podder</b> stumped out, All-Muggleton had notched some fifty-four, while the score of the Dingley Dellers was as blank as their faces. The advantage was too great to be recovered. In vain did the eager Luffey, and the enthusiastic Struggles, do all that skill and experience could suggest, to regain the ground Dingley Dell had lost in the contest--it was of no avail; and in an early period of the winning game Dingley Dell gave in, and allowed the superior prowess of All-Muggleton.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, to state,' {{said the}} little man, 'I thank my honourable friend, {{if he will}} allow me to call him so (four hears and one {{certainly}} from Mr. Jingle), for the suggestion. Sir, I am a Deller--a Dingley Deller (cheers). I cannot lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the population of Muggleton; nor, Sir, I will frankly admit, do I covet that honour: and I will tell you why, Sir (hear); to Muggleton I will readily concede all these honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay claim--they are too numerous and too well known to require aid or recapitulation from me. But, sir, while we remember that Muggleton has {{given birth to a}} Dumkins and a <b>Podder,</b> let us never forget that Dingley Dell can boast a Luffey and a Struggles. (Vociferous cheering.) Let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen. Sir, I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion. (Cheers.) Every gentleman who hears me, is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual, who--to use an ordinary figure of speech--"hung out" [...] in a tub, to the emperor Alexander:--"if I were not Diogenes," [...] said he, [...] "I would be Alexander." [...] I can well imagine these gentlemen to say, [...] "If I were not Dumkins I would be Luffey; if I were not <b>Podder</b> I would be Struggles." [...] (Enthusiasm.) But, gentlemen of Muggleton, is it in cricket alone that your fellow-townsmen stand pre-eminent? Have you never heard of Dumkins and determination? Have you never been taught to associate <b>Podder</b> with property? (Great applause.) Have you never, when struggling for your rights, your liberties, and your privileges, been reduced, if only for an instant, to misgiving and despair? And when you have been thus depressed, has not the name of Dumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out; and has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it had never expired? (Great cheering.) Gentlemen, I beg to surround with a rich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of [...] "Dumkins and Podder."' ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Osborne {{thought she}} would be a great match, too, for his son. He should leave the army; he should go into Parliament; he should cut a figure in the fashion and in the state. His blood boiled with honest British exultation, as he saw the name of Osborne ennobled in the person of his son, and thought that he might be the {{progenitor}} of a glorious line of baronets. He worked in the City and on 'Change, until he knew everything relating to the fortune of the heiress, how her money was placed, and where her estates lay. Young Fred Bullock, one of his chief informants, would have liked to make a bid for her himself (it was so the young banker expressed it), only he was booked to Maria Osborne. But not being able to secure her as a wife, the disinterested Fred quite approved of her as a sister-in-law. [...] "Let George cut in directly and win her," [...] was his advice. [...] "Strike while the iron's hot, you know--while she's fresh to the town: in a few weeks some d---- fellow from the West End will come in with a title and a rotten rent-roll and cut all us City men out, as Lord Fitzrufus did last year with Miss Grogram, who was actually engaged to <b>Podder,</b> of <b>Podder</b> & Brown's. The sooner it is done the better, Mr. Osborne; them's my sentiments," [...] the wag said; though, when Osborne had left the bank parlour, Mr. Bullock remembered Amelia, and what a pretty girl she was, and how attached to George Osborne; and he gave up at least ten seconds of his valuable time to regretting the misfortune which had befallen that unlucky young woman.|$|E
40|$|Culture and Society {{are often}} the main gist of most novels. These two factors often {{influence}} and control the characters, thus helping {{in the development of}} the plot. A plot, as defined by Egan (1978), is used to indicate an outline of events and serves as a skeleton in a literary piece. In other words, it is a tool in making sure the main incidents or scenarios are presented in a particular order to establish a clear understanding of what is being written. Culture and society plays the essence in a novel as it constructs these main ideas in engaging the interest of a reader and also extends the intended message of the particular writer. This paper looks into how culture and society helps in developing the plots of the selected novels using the feminist approach. Tanushree <b>Podder’s...</b>|$|R

More specifically, the article will tackle metafiction in these works from a narrative point of view. The study will generally deal with metafiction as self-reflexive genre dealing with narrative devices, including the work’s comments on itself {{as a work of}} fiction. In this respect, the study is going to approach the narrative elements of the selected works to examine the effect of metafiction {{in the context of the}} selected works and how they provide the reader with their complex narrative fabric. Therefore, three main metafictional devices are going to be utilized in the study i. e., the self-reflective devices, the mimetic devices, and the narrative devices. These devices will be elaborated in the light of Patricia Waugh’s metafictional arguments. Consequently, a narrative conceptual framework will be followed to analyze the selected works’ plots...|$|R
