25|$|The {{difference}} in the 20th century was that the acts of demolition were often acts of desperation and last resort; a demolished house could not be valued for <b>probate</b> <b>duty.</b> A vacant site was attractive to property developers, who would pay a premium for an empty site that could be rebuilt upon and filled with numerous small houses and bungalows, which would return a quick profit. This was especially true {{in the years immediately}} following World War II, when Britain was desperate to replace the thousands of homes destroyed. Thus, in many cases, the demolition of the ancestral seat, strongly entwined with the family's history and identity, followed the earlier loss of the family's London house.|$|E

I should be much disposed to abolish the tea licences as greatly restrictive of the consumption of a dutiable and useful commodity. I modified them; but {{am not sure that}} this was enough. The B.I.R. could throw light on this subject. 3. The <b>probate</b> <b>duty</b> calls, I fear, loudly for change; but I wanted either time or courage to take it in hand. 4. The remaining conveyance duties, apart from railways, I always considered as marked for extinction. On this subject Mr. Ayrton has rather decided antecedents. 5. The fire insurance duty is sure to be further assailed. Though not as bad (relatively to other taxes) as is supposed, it is bad enough to be very hard to defend in an adverse House; {{and this is one of}} the questions on which it is not likely that the opposition will help to see fair play. The promises that liberal reduction will lead to recovery of anything like the old or previous revenue have always been confidently pressed by irresponsible men, and are in my opinion illusory. The tax is a tax on property: and, as we have too few of these rather than too many, what would seem desirable is to commute it; leaving no more than a penny stamp on the policy. This might perhaps be done, if it were made part of a large budget. 6. The income-tax at 6d., I suppose, presents a forward claim. 7. The commutation of malt duty for beer duty must always, I presume, be spoken of with respect; but the working objections to it have thus far been found too hard to deal with.|$|E

The Bequest has been established to support culture and the community, with half the funding benefiting Victorian charities (particularly those that support women and children) {{and the other half}} used to acquire and donate art works to the National Gallery of Victoria. [...] After the payment of legacies and <b>probate</b> <b>duties,</b> the residue of the estate was £378,033, a huge sum, the equivalent of about A$35 million at 2000 values. The Gallery selected a number of works from Felton's personal collection for retention by it, and the remainder was sold at auction, the proceeds being added to the Bequest.|$|R

50|$|The iexpansion {{of direct}} {{taxation}} is evident on comparing 1840 with 1908. In the former year the <b>probate</b> and legacy <b>duties</b> brought in about one million pounds; the other direct taxes; even including the house duty, {{did not raise}} the total to £3,000,000. In 1908 the direct taxation of property and income supplied £51,500,000, or one-third of the total receipts as against less than one-twentieth in 1840.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Probate</b> and legacy <b>duty</b> {{focused on}} the [...] of the estate, as opposed to its , thus {{excluding}} real property from taxation. Neither duty captured property passing by way of settlement, which was {{outside the scope of}} probate and administration. Succession duty was introduced by William Gladstone as a measure to capture more unearned wealth at the point of succession that would not otherwise be chargeable to legacy duty. In that regard, real property was included in its scope, but only on the life interest therein, as opposed to its full market value. Leasehold interests were excluded from legacy duty, thus having them fall within the new duty.|$|R
50|$|Copley was {{commissioner}} for crown lands and immigration in Thomas Playford's 1890-92 ministry. But {{the appointment of}} a legislative councillor to the position was opposed in the Lower House and he was transferred to agriculture and education. He was a 'strong farmer's advocate' and introduced progressive <b>probate</b> and succession <b>duties</b> and 'homestead block' measures, based on New Zealand legislation. This led to the inauguration of 10-acre (4 ha) holdings at Gawler Blocks, Peterborough, Cottonville and Croydon. He sat on the 1891 and 1898-99 pastoral lands commissions. Copley was minister of agriculture and education in Sir John Downer's 1892-93 ministry, and chief secretary briefly in 1893 when he piloted the bill for free education through the council.|$|R
50|$|<b>Probate</b> <b>duty</b> was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the Stamps Act 1694, in order to help finance England's involvement in the War of the League of Augsburg. It originally applied to all probates of wills and letters of administration for personal estates valued greater than £20, at a fixed duty of 5 s.. It was converted into a graduated rate in 1780 by Lord North, as a consequence of financing British activity in the American Revolutionary War. Penalties for failing to file probate or administration documents were introduced in 1795, and accounts for calculating liability were first required in 1805. As probate and administration were unknown in Scotland, inventory duty {{was introduced}} in 1804 to provide for similar liability there. Ireland introduced <b>probate</b> <b>duty</b> separately in 1774.|$|E
50|$|The Goschen {{proportions}} {{were originally}} set at 80:11:9, for England & Wales, Scotland, and Ireland respectively.

A claim by the English courts for <b>probate</b> <b>duty</b> on his {{investments}} in New Zealand was contested by his executors {{on the grounds that it}} did not form part of his English estate and that duty had already been paid on it in New Zealand. The court initially found in the executors' favour. The decision was subsequently overturned and further appeal to the House of Lords refused.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Disraeli, {{the most}} unsparing {{of all the}} assailants of Peel, tried his own hand in 1852. To have the genius and the {{patience}} of a great partisan chief is one gift, and this he had; to grasp the complex material interests of a vast diversified society like the United Kingdom demands powers of a different order. The defeat of Mr. Disraeli's budget {{at the end of}} 1852 seemed to complete the circle of fiscal confusion. Every source of public income was the object of assault. Every indirect tax was to be reduced or swept away, and yet no two men appeared to agree upon the principles of the direct taxes that were to take their place. The window duty, the paper duty, the tax on advertisements, the malt-tax, the stamp on marine insurances, were all to vanish, but even the most zealous reformers were powerless to fill the void. The order-book of the House of Commons was loaded with motions about the income-tax, and an important committee sat in 1851 to consider all the questions connected with the possibility of its readjustment and amendment. They could not even frame a report. The belief that it was essentially unjust to impose the tax at one and the same rate upon permanent and temporary incomes, prevailed in the great mass, especially of the liberal party. Discussions arose all through this period, descending not only to the elementary principles of taxation, but, as Mr. Gladstone said, almost to the first principles of civilised society itself. Party distraction, ministerial embarrassment, adjournment after adjournment of a decision upon fundamental maxims of national taxation--such was the bewildered scene. At last a statesman appeared, a financier almost by accident (for, as we have seen, it was by no special choice of his own that Mr. Gladstone went to the exchequer), but a financier endowed with a practical imagination of the highest class, with a combination of the spirit of vigorous analysis and the spirit of vigorous system, with the habit of unflagging toil, and above all, with the gift of indomitable courage. If anybody suggested the reappointment of Hume's committee, the idea was wisely dismissed. It was evidently, as Graham said, the duty of the executive government to lead the way and to guide public opinion in a matter of this crucial importance. It seemed impossible and unworthy to avoid a frank declaration about the income-tax. He was strongly of opinion (March 15) that a larger measure would be carried with greater certainty and ease than simple renewal; and that a combination of income-tax, gradually diminishing to a fixed term of extinction, with reduction of the interest of debt, and a review of the <b>probate</b> and legacy <b>duties,</b> afforded the best ground for a financial arrangement both successful and creditable. It was strong ideas of this kind that encouraged Mr. Gladstone to build on a broad foundation.|$|R
50|$|The window tax, which {{continued}} {{throughout the}} 18th century, had been supplemented during the American War by {{a tax on}} inhabited houses (one of Adam Smith's suggestions).Again, <b>probate</b> <b>duty</b> had been gradually raised during the 18th century, the legacy duty being introduced in 1780, which was moderate and did not affect land. Though direct and quasi-direct taxes had been dramatically increased, their growth was eclipsed by that of excise and customs. With each succeeding year of war, further articles attracted duty whilst tax rates were raised.|$|E
50|$|In close {{relation}} with the income-tax is the estate duty, with its adjuncts of legacy and succession duties. After Pitt's failure to carry the succession duty in 1796, no change was made until Gladstone's introduction in 1853 of a duty on land and settled property parallel to the legacy duty on free personality. Apart from certain minor alterations, the really vital change was the extension in 1894 of the old <b>probate</b> <b>duty</b> into a comprehensive impost applicable to all the possessions of a deceased person. This Inheritance Tax (to give it its scientific title) operates as a complementary property tax, and is thus an addition to the contribution from incomes derived from large properties.|$|E

50|$|Selwyn {{was called}} to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, on 27 January 1840, practised chiefly before the Master of the Rolls, and amassed a large fortune. He served as Commissary to the {{university}} of Cambridge from 1855 to 1868, became a Queen's Counsel on 7 April 1856, and in the same year was made a bencher of his inn. He entered parliament as member for Cambridge University in April 1859, and sat for that constituency until 1868. He was a staunch conservative and a churchman. He first spoke in the house on the address to the queen on arming the volunteer corps, and on 13 August 1859 made a speech on a question of privilege connected with the Pontefract election inquiry. In the same month he moved a resolution whereby the committee on the Stamp Duties Bill was enabled to introduce a clause extending <b>probate</b> <b>duty</b> to property exceeding one million in value, and a few months later secured the rejection of Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn's Endowed Schools Bill.|$|E
