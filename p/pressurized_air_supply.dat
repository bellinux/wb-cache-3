40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of differing turbocharger rotor bearing systems {{and to develop a}} coupled rotor-cartridge model for the ball bearing rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. The ball bearing rotor is supported by an angular contact ball bearing cartridge. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a TTR was designed and developed with the capability of reaching speeds in excess of 100, 000 rpm driven by compressed air. The TTR was used to compare and contrast the whirl and friction characteristics of two identical turbochargers differing only by the support structure of the rotor system; one containing a floating ring bearing turbocharger (FRBT) and the other a ball bearing turbocharger (BBT). A pair of displacement sensors was installed to measure the whirl of the rotor {{near the end of the}} compressor. The BBT was shown to be significantly more rigid and stable as compared to the FRBT with an average reduction in radial rotor motion of 47 %. The motion of the BBT consisted of mainly synchronous motion whereas the FRBT was dominated by subsynchronous motion throughout the entire range of speeds. The TTR was also used to compare frictional losses within the bearings. A study of run-down times after the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> was removed indicated that the BBT has significantly lower frictional losses under all operating conditions tested with an average increase in run-down time of 14. 1 %. ^ A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was designed specifically for the turbocharger ball bearing system to monitor the internal bearing temperature located on the cage during operation. It was shown to be able to withstand the harsh environments of turbocharger fnapplications operating at high speeds. The sensor accurately monitored transient bearing cage temperature due to changes in operating speed. ^ Custom sensors were developed in order to measure the axial forces acting on the rotor due to aerodynamic effects. The sensors utilized cantilever beams outfitted with strain gages to measure the applied load from the bearing cartridge. Results of dynamic testing indicated the magnitude and direction of the axial force is dependent on the operating conditions of the turbine and compressor. ^ To achieve the objectives of the analytical investigation, the explicit finite element method (EFEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) were coupled to investigate dynamics of flexible rotor systems supported by deep groove ball bearings. DEM was used to develop the dynamic bearing model (DBM) in which all of the components of the bearing (i. e. races, balls, and cage) have six degrees-of-freedom. The flexible shaft was modeled with a full 3 D elastic formulation using the EFEM. Rotor and inner races of the bearings were fully coupled such that both translation and rotation of the flexible rotor are transmitted to the bearings. The resulting reaction forces and moments calculated in DBM were in turn applied to the nodes of the shaft. The combined rotor-bearing model was used to investigate the motions of the inner races at low speeds and the resulting reaction forces and moments from the supporting bearings due to a large applied load on the shaft. In the current coupled modeling approach, the deformation of the shaft affected the internal components of the bearing by altering the orientation of the inner race which results in ball spin and slip. The preceding rotor-bearing model was extended to represent the turbocharger rotor-cartridge system that is under consideration. A DEM angular contact ball bearing cartridge model was coupled with an EFEM shaft to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. The bearing cartridge consists of a common outer ring, a pair of split inner races, and a row of balls on each end of the cartridge. The coupled rotor-cartridge model was used to investigate the shaft motion and bearing dynamics as the system traverses critical speeds. The analytical and experimental shaft motion results were in close agreement. The cartridge model allowed for thorough investigation of bearing component dynamics. Effects of ball material properties were found to have a significant impact on turbocharger rotor and bearing dynamics. ...|$|E

40|$|Bearings today {{need to be}} able to run at {{very high}} speed, {{providing}} high positional accuracy for the structure that it supports, and requiring very little or no maintenance. For this to happen, bearings must have tight tolerances and very low or zero friction during operation. This pushes many traditional contact-type bearings to their limits as they often fail due to friction, generating heat and causing wear. By comparison, existing non-contact bearings fare better because of their very low or zero friction. But some have their own problem too. For example, the fact that aerostatic bearings require an air supply means having to use a separate air compressor and connecting hoses. This makes the installation bulky. Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic bearings cannot support loads at zero speed. Both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearings may cause contamination to the work-pieces and the work environment because of the use of lubricating fluid. A potential solution to the above-mentioned problems is the new squeeze film air bearing. It works on the rapid squeeze action of an air film to produce separation between two metal surfaces. This has the benefit of being compact with a very simple configuration because it does not require an external <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply,</b> can support loads at zero speed and is free of contamination. For this research, two squeeze film air journal bearings, made from material of Al 2024 - T 3 and Cu - C 101 with the same geometry, were designed. The bearing is in the shape of a round tube with three fins on the outer surface and the journal, a round rod. When excited at a certain normal mode, the bearing shell flexes with a desirable modal shape for the squeeze film action. The various modes of vibration of Al bearing were obtained from a finite-element model implemented in ANSYS. Two Modes, the 13 th and 23 rd, at the respective frequencies of 16. 320 kHz and 25. 322 kHz, were identified for further investigation by experiments with respect to the squeeze film thickness and its load-carrying capacity. For Cu bearing, the two Modes are also 13 th and 23 rd at the respective frequencies of 12. 184 kHz and 18. 459 kHz. In order to produce dynamic deformation of the bearings at their modes, a single layer piezoelectric actuator was used as a driver. The maximum stroke length and the maximum blocking force of the single layer piezoelectric actuator were determined using manual calculation and ANSYS simulation. In the coupled-field analysis, the single layer piezoelectric actuator was mounted on the outside surface of the bearing shell and loaded with an AC and a DC voltage in order to produce the static and dynamic deformation. For the static analysis, the maximum deformation of Al bearing shell is 0. 124 μm when the actuators are driven at the DC of 75 V. For the dynamic analysis, the actuators are driven at three levels of AC, namely 55, 65 and 75 V with a constant DC offset of 75 V and the driving frequency coincided with the modal frequency of the bearing. The maximum dynamic deformation of Al bearing shell is 3. 22 μm at Mode 13 and 2. 08 μm at Mode 23 when the actuators were driven at the AC of 75 V and the DC of 75 V. Similarly, the FEA simulation was used for analyzing Cu bearing. Furthermore, the dynamic deformation of both Al and Cu bearing at Mode 13 and 23 are validated by experiments. This research developed two theoretical models that explain the existence of a net pressure in a squeeze film for the levitation. The first model uses the ideal gas law as first approximation whilst the second uses the CFX simulation to provide a more exact explanation. In terms of the load-carrying capacity, Mode 13 was identified to be better than Mode 23 for both bearings. However, at Mode 13, Al bearing has a higher load-carrying capacity than Cu bearing. This is due to Al bearing having a higher modal frequency and amplitude. Finally, the coupled-field analysis for fluid solid interaction (FSI) was studied at both Mode 13 and 23 for Al bearing. The findings are that: a) the fluid force in the squeeze film can affect the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell, especially at high oscillation frequency, more at Mode 13 than at Mode 23 due to the relatively high pressure end-leakage in the latter; b) the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell increases with the gap clearance in a logarithmic manner at Mode 13; and c) the micron levels of gap clearance provide a damping effect on the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell at Mode 13 and at Mode 23, though much less dominant.

Producer gas produced from biomass gasification consists of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H 2), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen (N 2). It has low calorific value (LCV) around 4 - 6 MJ/Nm 3 because of CO 2 content is about 10 - 20 % by volume. Limestone or specifically calcium carbonate, CaCO 3 can be heated up to form calcium oxide, CaO where is used to absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2) of the producer gas to increase its low calorific value. In this paper a cold model experiment in a small bubbling fluidized bed (SBFB) has been conducted to determine the optimum mixing of CaCO 3 - sand at certain pressure and flow rate as a first step to design a CO 2 absorption reactor in the School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Science Malaysia.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 This report {{presents}} the off-design analysis of various wood-fired combined-cycle power plants {{using a computer}} model to simulate plant performance. The combined-cycle systems investigated are characterized by having a woodfueled combustor, an indirect-fired gas turbine, and a Rankine steam cycle. This work was conducted {{as part of a}} larger biomass energy project at Oregon State University. Three particular systems were studied in this report. First, system 5 utilizes a wet-cell combustor requiring little fuel preparation. Hot combustion gases leave the combustor and flow through a heat exchanger where steam produced in the heat recovery steam generator is superheated. The combustion gases then flow through a second heat exchanger heating <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> by the compressor. The hot, compressed air stream is returned to the gas turbine driving the gas turbine-compressor set after which the turbine exhaust is used as combustion air. After leaving the heat exchangers, the combustion gases flow into the heat recovery steam generator where feedwater is converted to steam. Finally, the relatively cool combustion gases flow through air pollution devices before being discharged to the atmosphere. With system 2, the wet-cell combustor is replaced with a suspension burner requiring additional fuel preparation (fuel moisture content dried to 12 percent wet basis and a smaller particle size). A trimburner unit is implemented in system 7 raising the temperature of the air entering the gas turbine to 1612 F. Other than the previously noted exceptions, systems 2, 5 and 7 are identical in design except for changes in heat transfer area. To facilitate fuel drying, the gas temperature entering the dryer is increased by reducing the heat recovery steam generator size approximately 45 percent in system 2. The computer simulation consists of a main program and component models. The main program coordinates the transfer of information between component models and checks for convergence of the solution. Equations describing individual processes occurring in each component are evaluated in their respective model. Unknown variables require an initial guess when commencing program execution. Variables are continuously updated during each subsequent iteration until convergence is obtained. The computer simulation allowed various system component operating limitations to be analyzed over a range of anticipated off-design conditions. Based on monthly variations in fuel moisture content and ambient temperature, the power output and efficiency of each plant were simulated over an entire year.

Producer gas as a alternative fuel, produced from biomass gasification process can be used to generate power and electricity. However, in air blown gasification, the producer gas produced has Low Calorific Value (LCV) about 4 - 6 MJ Nm - 3 with CO 2 content around 10 - 20 % by volume. To increase the LCV, the used of calcium oxide, CaO as sorbent to absorb CO 2 in the producer gas can make biomass technology more viable. In the present study, the aim is to study the fluidization of the bed in terms of the bed expansion and the pressure drop of the 1000 μm CaO-sand mixtures at different percentages, the air volume flow rate and <b>pressurize</b> <b>air</b> intake in the cold model experiment. The behaviors of 1000 μm CaO-sand mixtures have been conducted in a Small Bubbling Fluidized Bed (SBFB). The results show that the decrease of the CaO percentages from 70, 60, 50 to 40, will increase the pressure drop (ΔP) in the SBFB under constant pressure of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 bars.

Fabrics produced using fancy yarn find applications in normal and high-fashion clothing, curtains, carpets, upholstery fabrics, as a base for "effect" wallpaper manufacture and many more. Ring spinning is successfully employed to manufacture fancy yarn. Rotor spinning, which offers economical benefits over ring spinning, has also been employed to produce fancy yarn. A number of ideas have been applied in practice to produce fancy yarn on rotor spinning machines. The approach of these conventional devices has been to control the speeds of the mechanical elements of the rotor spinning machine. Because the rotor spinning machine is a very high speed spinning machine, with the latest ones having rotor speeds of over 100 000 rpm, the conventional devices become limited in their approach, not application. A new approach is therefore necessary to produce fancy yarn on rotor spinning machines. This work is a new approach in that direction. The principal idea is to affect the fibre flow without altering the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor spinning machine. To bring about this influence of the fibre flow, <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> has been employed for the first time. The concept of using <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> not only offers a new alternative to produce fancy yarn on rotor spinning machines, but also offers a simple and relatively inexpensive route to fancy yarn manufacture. Hence, this approach has been referred to as <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> method of producing fancy yarn. The fibres flowing in the fibre transport channel of the rotor spinning box are affected by <b>pressurized</b> <b>air.</b> This influence of the flowing fibres by the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> causes the effects or the imperfections in the yarn being spun to result in a fancy yarn. The duration of the time the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> is applied to affect the fibre flow, influence the characteristics of the effects such as thickness, length and appearance. By programming the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> blowing time, effects can be produced in a predetermined way. In this way the need to alter highly frequently the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor spinning machine is obviated. As with the conventional methods employed on rotor spinning machines in the production of fancy yarns, the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> method also has its own limitations. While the conventional methods can only produce effect lengths longer than the rotor circumference, the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> method can only produce effect length shorter than the rotor circumference. But by combining the conventional method and the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> method, the shortcomings of the two methods can be overcome in a unique way. This work, being the first of its kind, provides a fairly comprehensive understanding of the concept of using <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> in the production of fancy yarns on rotor spinning machines...|$|R
50|$|The gravity {{separator}} separates products of same size but with difference in specific weight. It has a vibrating rectangular deck, {{which makes it}} easy for the product to travel a longer distance, ensuring improved quality of the end product. The <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> in the deck enables the material to split according to its specific weight. As a result, the heavier particles travel to the higher level while the lighter particles travel to the lower level of the deck. It comes with easily adjustable air fans to control the volume of air distribution at different areas of the vibrating deck to meet the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> needs of the deck. The table inclination, speed of eccentric motion and the feed rate can be precisely adjusted to achieve smooth operation of the machine.|$|R
