50|$|The Railway Mail Association (RMA) was {{originally}} The National Association of Railway Postal Clerks when chartered {{under the laws}} of New Hampshire in 1898 as a fraternal beneficiary association. In 1904 the name was changed to the RMA and lasted until 1949 when the Post Office Department renamed the Railway Mail Service as Postal Transportation Service. At that time, it became the National <b>Postal</b> <b>Transport</b> Association.|$|E
50|$|This Association was {{organized}} as a fraternal benefit society for railway clerks by five men in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1898. The original {{name of the}} association was the National Association of Railway Postal Clerks. The name of the society was changed to Railway Mail Association in 1904, and the National <b>Postal</b> <b>Transport</b> Association in 1949. In 1961 it became the United Federation of Postal Clerks Benefit Association. It adopted its present name in 1972.|$|E

5000|$|The National <b>Postal</b> <b>Transport</b> Association (NPTA) was the {{successor}} to the Railway Mail Association. The name change was prompted by the United States Post Office Department reorganizing the Railway Mail Service as the Postal Transportation Service on October 1, 1949. In 1961, the NPTA merged with the National Federation of Post Office Clerks (NFPOC) and the United National Association of Post Office Clerks (UNAPOC) to form the 115,000-member United Federation of Postal Clerks (UFPC).|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, {{commercial}} airlines and airports {{began to be}} developed in the United States {{as a result of}} the Federal government's use of private contractors for <b>postal</b> <b>transport,</b> inspired by Charles Lindbergh's famous transatlantic flight in 1927. New York was in dire need of a new airport by 1934 when Fiorello H. La Guardia was elected mayor. Plans for the airport, which was to be federally sponsored and funded through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), were approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on September 3, 1937.|$|E
50|$|Schanche grew up at {{the trading}} post of Karstenøya on Ytter-Vikna in Nord-Trondelag, Norway. From 1742 {{he worked as a}} procurator in Trondheim. When the {{postmaster}} in the city was suspended in 1748, Schanche became acting postmaster. He visited Copenhagen in 1752 and put forward their ideas for postal reform in Norway. In 1758, Schanche's postal proposals were adopted virtually in their entirety. This resulted in the mail system in Norway undergoing its biggest change since the establishment of postal service in 1647. His plan was instrumental in the transition from <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> being a duty imposed on farmers as mail carriers. The majority of postal farmers now received salaries and the rural sub-post office system is formalized.|$|E

50|$|The {{precarious}} {{economic situation}} of the Government of Montevideo led to the transfer of several sources of revenue, {{including those of the}} postal service. Early in 1846 the Board of Directors of the Purchasing Company took possession of the Postal Administration, which it retained until 1852, when it was returned to State ownership. One of the first measures adopted by the new administration was the organisation of a <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> service to and from the interior of the country. For this purpose, Atanasio Lapido was nominated as Postal Contractor, with the task of installing staging posts throughout the country. These began to come into operation in May 1853. In April 1856 the General Postal Director, Miguel Solsona, left office, and Mr. Lapido also took over the post of Postal Director, on an unpaid basis.|$|E
5000|$|Iberia, Compañía Aérea de Transportes was {{incorporated}} on 28 June 1927 {{with a capital}} investment by the financier Horacio Echevarrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa of 1.1 million pesetas. Flight operations started on 14 December 1927. Within a year, the company {{was sponsored by the}} Spanish government to provide <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> between Madrid and Barcelona. During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, the aviation companies in Spain were combined and became state-controlled as a general interest public utility, coming into effect in early 1928. As a consequence, Iberia was merged into Compañía de Líneas Aéreas Subvencionadas S.A. (CLASSA) and ceased activities as an independent airline on 29 May 1929. The name [...] "Iberia" [...] continued to be registered by Director-General Daniel de Araoz y Aréjula. As the name [...] "Iberia" [...] was still registered, it was used when operations began in nationalist-held territory {{towards the end of the}} Spanish Civil War. Following the Civil War, Iberia became a purely domestic airline. At the end of the 1930s, the airline served the Seville-Larache-Cabo Juby-Las Palmas, Barcelona-Saragosa-Burgos-Salamanca-Seville-Tetuan and Palma-Barcelona-Vitoria runs using Junkers Ju-52 aircraft.|$|E

In Britain, the Vindolanda tablets, a series of letters written on wooden tablets to and by members of the garrison of Hadrian's Wall, show the operation of the cursus on the island.|$|R
50|$|Flight {{operations}} {{started on}} December 14, 1927 with inaugural flights aimed to coincide at a commemorative show in Madrid. The opening ceremony at Carabanchel aerodrome {{was attended by}} Alfonso XIII {{and the president of}} Iberia, Horacio Echeberrieta. The maiden flight from Madrid left on schedule, taking off from Madrid at 12:30 and arriving in Barcelona 3½ hours later. However the Barcelona to Madrid flight was briefly forced to stop in Almazán, Soria due to reduced visibility caused by snow. Although this flight had set off at 9:00, aiming to arrive in Madrid at midday, the delay meant it arrived in Madrid two hours after the dignitaries had already left.Within a year, the company was sponsored by the government to provide <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> between Madrid and Barcelona. Meanwhile, Deutsche Luft Hansa was favourably rewarded for the 24% investment in the Iberia company when it was granted the regular service between Germany and Spain. On January 5, 1928 the route Barcelona - Marseilles - Geneva - Zürich - Stuttgart - Leipzig/Halle - Erfurt - Berlin was initiated. In July 1928, a twin-engined Dornier Wal was added to the fleet. This seaplane was used on a pioneering route between Cádiz and the Canary Islands. This was used to test the viability of a postal route to South America, by extending the route via Cape Verde Islands.|$|E
5000|$|On September 27, 1985, {{the gang}} moved its hideout from its old address {{to a new}} {{apartment}} on Blekinge Street in Copenhagen. The new hideout apartment was rented {{in the name of}} a fictitious computer club, and all documents were signed {{in the name of a}} stolen identity, while the bills were paid in cash to avoid alerting the real person by that name. On December 3, 1985, the gang robbed a money transport from a post office, yielding DKK 1.5 million (US$0.16 million) in cash and DKK 68 million in cancelled checks. No individual gang member was found guilty in this. Niels Jørgensen was arrested during an attempted car theft on June 3, 1986. To avoid arousing any suspicion by the gang, the police pretended to believe his cover story and the charges were silently reduced to a fine. On Monday December 22, 1986, the gang stole the Christmas weekend takings of Danish clothing mega store [...] "Daells Varehus", as those takings were being picked up by a bank courier. During the escape from the mega store, they fought off several shop employees, including the security chief (a former elite soldier) who sustained a fractured skull from pistol-beating. For their next robbery, the gang therefore developed a new soft baton designed not to cause skull fractures. The robbery yielded about DKK 4.7 million (US$0.63 million) in cash. No individual gang member was found guilty in this. The gang's last robbery came on November 3, 1988 at 05:13:40 am. A <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> of money and valuables was robbed as it arrived at the old central postal office, carrying DKK 9.3 million (US$1.4 million) in cash and bearer bonds plus about DKK 5 million in other valuables. As the gang left with their takings, the Police arrived earlier than anticipated. In the ensuing shootout, a rookie police officer was killed by buckshot from the sawnoff shotgun used during the robbery. This enraged the police so badly that they decided to actually share information between the secret police and the robbery squad.|$|E
30|$|An {{ecosystem}} {{approach can be}} helpful in designing holistic diffusion programs for digitally transforming small businesses and in mobilizing the relevant stakeholders to fund and sustain them. These programs would focus on actual usage and payoffs from e-commerce, rather than focusing solely on digital investment. They would be tailored to country context, to address policy and institutional factors, such as payment systems, privacy and data security, legal protection for online transactions, customs and trade compliance procedures, and Internet governance. They should address issues of access to Internet and broadband, and the diverse forms of digital divide. They may also address those infrastructural issues (e.g., <b>postal,</b> <b>transport,</b> logistics, electricity) that impact SMEs’ e-commerce most adversely. And perhaps most important to SMEs, diffusion programs can promote capability development and advisory services to SMEs to leverage and integrate e-commerce adoption into their business strategies and practices. Effective programs are typically sponsored by the state, in collaboration with local governments, and trade and business associations.|$|E

40|$|Under an entry-exit gas tariff system, {{reservation}} {{of capacity}} is split into entry capacity, to transport {{gas from the}} injection points to a virtual balancing point, and exit capacity, to transport gas from the balancing point to the exit points in the system. Entry-exit tariff for gas transport systems have been recommended by the 3 rd EU Energy Package, since they are cost reflective, facilitate gas trade and can provide signals for the location of gas injections or off-takes. The advisability of applying an entry-exit tariff system is discussed in this paper. Apart from this, authors propose an entry-exit tariff model {{and apply it to}} compute charges for the Spanish gas transport system in 2009. Results produced by the model are presented as coefficients which should multiply the current <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> tariff. The paper concludes that entry-exit tariffs would be useful location signals which would result in a better use of the gas transport system in Spain. In those cases where demand exceeds available capacity, as it occurs at the congested connection with France, entry-exit tariffs could be supplemented by capacity charges at entry points resulting from auctions.

40|$|Citrulline is a nonessential free amino acid, {{detectable}} {{in various}} biological fluids such as plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. The plasma citrulline concentration is increasingly {{considered to be}} a reliable biomarker of enterocyte function. Current analysis usually involves lengthy HPLC separations as a part of classical amino acid profiling, or mass spectrometry usually in combination with derivatization. We employed UPLC-HILIC-tandem mass-spectrometry (MS/MS) of acetonitrile-derived supernatants from plasma samples of control subjects and of patients who had received myeloablative chemotherapy. Detection was achieved by the selected reaction monitoring of transitions: m/z 176 [...] > 70 and 180 [...] > 74 (for the deuterated standard), respectively. The method was precise and accurate with inter-day CV< 3. 9 % (n= 30), recoveries ranging from 98. 0 to 100. 3 % and high linearity from 0. 3 to at least 2, 000 micromol/L. The results for 202 plasma samples agreed well with those obtained by the classical HPLC-fluorescence method. By a simple protein precipitation/extraction step and the UPLC separation the result can be available within 30 min of receipt with a capacity of at least 12 assays per hour. Citrulline in blood and plasma or serum was stable for at least 2 days at room temperature which would permit <b>postal</b> <b>transport</b> to the laboratory. The UPLC-MS/MS method for measuring plasma citrulline concentrations is fast and robust and is therefore an ideal tool for monitoring the intestinal enterocyte capacity of patients with various pathological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Before the {{emergence}} of modern modes of transport, the traditional road infrastructure was the major historical means of carrying out nationwide socio-economic exchange. However, the history of transport infrastructure has received little attention from researchers. Given this background, the work reported here examined the long-term development of transport networks in China. The national road network was selected for study and the 3500 years from 1600 BC to 1900 AD {{was chosen as the}} study period. Indicators were designed for the maturity level of road networks and an accessibility model was developed for the paths of the shortest distance. The evolution of the road network in China since the Shang Dynasty (1600 BC) was described and its major features were summarized to reveal long-term regularities. The maturity level of the road network and its accessibility was assessed and regions with good and poor networks were identified. The relationship between China's natural, social, and economic systems and the road network were discussed. Our analysis shows that the road network in China has a number of long-term regularities. The continuously expanding road network follows a path of inland expansion especially towards the border areas. However, its coverage and accessibility are characterized by a core-peripheral configuration, which has close relationships with, not only the natural conditions, but also national defense and warfare. The centralization of national power, national land governance, <b>postal</b> <b>transport,</b> the transport of specialized cargos, and international trade are also related {{to the development of the}} road network. This research draws attention to the evolving regularities of transport networks...|$|E
