On {{the same}} day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to St Mary Redcliffe church, {{but there was a}} <b>poor</b> <b>turnout.</b> Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation.

Attendance at pre-polling booths saw an increase from 20.3% of participating voters in 2013 to 25.9% in 2016. On top of the <b>poor</b> <b>turnout,</b> 6.15% of those who turned out cast an invalid vote, compared to 3.55% in 2013, and nine voters left the polling booth without submitting their ballot.|$|E
25|$|Phase 2B saw polling in 12 {{states for}} 140 {{constituencies}} – {{the most in}} any phase of this election. This phase was largely peaceful and saw about 55% turnout. There were stray incidents of violence in areas with active Naxalite groups in Jharkhand and Bihar. The <b>poor</b> <b>turnout</b> in this phase was blamed on a heat wave sweeping the country that took the noon-time temperature on election day up to between 42 and 46degrees Celsius {{in various parts of}} the country. Two polling officials even died due to sun stroke in Orissa with two also falling ill.|$|E

The fundraisers have also been used in order to restore the village greens, plant trees and more.

2500|$|According to the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee (BOCOG), the 6.8million {{tickets to}} the Games were sold out. The {{prevalence}} of empty seats at many events caused journalists and visitors to be suspicious about these claims. Beijing Olympic organisers {{were said to have}} given some 2.7million tickets to officials and corporate sponsors, many of whom did not attend the events. A mainland journal suggested that the day-tickets without right of re-entry was also part of the problem. In one instance, people in the audience left the stadium after the Chinese women's volleyball match, but they were not allowed back when they found out there was another game. A senior BOCOG official expressed concern about the empty seats, saying that the hot, humid weather could have caused the <b>poor</b> <b>turnout.</b> Officials admitted to bussing in locals or [...] "cheerleaders" [...] to fill seats. The empty seats angered athletes of countries outside China, who had been told that 80 percent of tickets had been reserved for the Chinese.|$|E
50|$|In the end, the Liberals {{picked up}} an easy victory, as expected, but while their actual vote total did not go down by much, their {{percentage}} of the vote went down over 10 points from the previous election as turnout was over 9% {{more than in the}} 2004 election. This high turnout is virtually unheard of for by-elections which normally have extremely <b>poor</b> <b>turnouts.</b> The additional voters appear to have been brought out by the tense national political situation and mostly voted for the Conservatives who picked up nearly 17 percentage points and the New Democrats who also increased their vote total.|$|R

2500|$|The San Pedro fishing {{industry}} {{reached its peak}} in the 1940s, and fell into decline by the 1980s with the closure of canneries and increased foreign competition. [...] For many years, the annual blessing of the fleet, seeking God's blessing for a bountiful harvest and for the fleet's safety, drew large crowds to San Pedro. [...] At its peak {{the blessing of the}} fleet drew 100,000 people and 200 fishing boats. [...] However, by 1987, the crowd gathered for the blessing had dwindled to 200 people and 16 fishing boats, as the Los Angeles Times reported that the <b>poor</b> <b>turnout</b> was [...] "a sad reminder of the story of the San Pedro {{fishing industry}}," [...] which had [...] "fallen upon stormy economic seas." [...] The blessing ceremony was also accompanied for many years by a festival that attracted up to 250,000 visitors in the late 1960s, and included a boat parade that was reportedly the second most photographed event in the nation, trailing only Pasadena's Rose Parade. [...] In 1985, Mary Star of the Sea began to offer a special fishermen's Mass on the same day as the blessing of the fleet. [...] At the 1987 fishermen's Mass, Msgr. Gallagher told the congregation: [...] "Times have changed. [...] The fishing industry is not what it used to be. But yet we've seen this remnant of people [...] [...] [...] who adjust to the changing conditions, who persevere in the face of adversity. [...] We pray in a very special way for the abundance of the fish of the sea, for the fishermen, that they will truly have a great catch." ...|$|E

30|$|Downs [10] {{identifies}} {{the existence of}} an individual “sense of social responsibility” for the political system as a whole. People vote because they have been taught that voter participation is a necessary precondition for a well-functioning democracy. Hence, individuals develop a sense of responsibility and vote in order to sustain democracy. According to the “Downs’ Paradox”, the costs of voting can be higher than the benefits and this simple cost-benefit calculus leads to a <b>poor</b> electoral <b>turnout.</b> One of the explanation is the voter’s cost–benefit calculus, which can represent a voter’s concerns for the functioning of her polity, but also other intrinsic benefits provided by the act of voting itself, such as the warm glow of acting in a pro-social way. However, as compared to the probability of being “pivotal”, the time resources I should engage could refrain myself from voting.|$|R

30|$|According to Downs’ Paradox {{a simple}} {{cost-benefit}} calculus {{leads to a}} <b>poor</b> electoral <b>turnout.</b> For the charging scheme of Edinburgh, Hencher and Li (2013) notice a turnout of nearly 62  % of Edinburgh residents who vote in {{a referendum on the}} implementation of a City centre cordon. The charging scheme was rejected by nearly 75  % of the voters [17]. A frequently observed phenomenon on urban toll is that just before a scheme is implemented, support drops to an all times low. This is a consistent pattern described for Stockholm by Winslott-Hiseliuset et al. (2009), for Norwegian cities by Odeck and Brathen [44] and Odeck and Kjerkreit [45], and for London by TfL [63]. In Manchester, a two-cordon congestion charging scheme was proposed and tested with a local referendum. The level of turnout is more than 50  % (53, 2  %) and the scheme was rejected by 79  % of voters.|$|R
