40|$|The Navachab Gold mine, an orogenic lode gold deposit, {{is located}} in the Karibib region of the Pan-African (ca. 550 - 500) Damara belt of central Namibia. Gold {{mineralisation}} is developed within the steeply NW dipping limb of the Karibib dome. Here, ore envelopes trend along three main orientations: a) trends shallowly towards the NE (the down plunge extent), b) trends sub-vertically in and along the down plunge extent and c) trends sub-horizontally across the down plunge extent. The down plunge extent represents the bulk of the gold mineralisation, hosting the only high grade ores mined at Navachab. As such, past work primarily focused on establishing the controls to the mineralisation observed here. The sub-vertical and sub–horizontal ore trends are seen as secondary, lower grade, being hosted in the footwall. By cutting pushbacks into the footwall, in an effort to regain access to high grade pit bottom, future gold production almost exclusively relies upon optimally mining these ores. This underlines the importance to investigate and outline the mineralising controls to the secondary ore trends. This study identified the following prevailing quartz vein sets developed within the footwall, set (1) dips shallowly towards the NE (conjugate vein set), (2) steeply towards the NW (bedding parallel veins) and (3) steeply towards the SE (S 2 foliation parallel). The NW and SE dipping sets contain high average gold grades, occurring at an infrequent vein density. The NE dipping veins, as a result of occurrence density alone, was highlighted as the dominant gold hosting set. Veining occurred during the late stages of the NW-SE directed, sub-horizontal shortening (D 2) event and is associated with top-to-the-NW thrusting and NW-verging folds. Re-Os molybdenite dating from auriferous quartz veins indicates mineralisation occurred at 525 - 520 Ma. As crustal shortening amplified the Karibib dome, flexural flow developed fractures along bedding planes, providing the control to bedding parallel veins (NW dipping). With continued crustal compression the dome later experienced fold lock up associated with reduced mean rock stress and sub-horizontal extension occurred along the steeply NW dipping limb. Horizontal extensional gashes sucked in fluids to form the shallowly NE dipping conjugate vein set. These features suggest the regional D 2 strain as the first-order control to quartz vein development, down plunge and within the footwall ores. To further define the secondary ores, lithological and structural controls were evaluated on a more detailed local scale. With equal amounts of biotite schist and calc-silicate host rock (bulk of the footwall lithology) material analysed, the biotite schist units were found to contain a larger volume amount of quartz veins. The mineralisation incurred is also developed at higher average gold grades compared to that of the calc-silicates, demonstrating biotite schist having the optimal rheology for quartz vein emplacement. Normal faulting and thrusting occurs widespread, at all scale levels, across the footwall. These were primarily observed along bedding foliations and secondly at higher angles cutting across foliation. The study did not constrain the extent of these, but can conclude faulting plays a very prominent role in re-distributing the secondary ores parallel to bedding along sub-vertical trend planes. Great care should be placed in properly modelling these with 3 D software such as Leapfrog. The Navachab gold mineralisation came about as a result of convergent and collisional tectonics activating metamorphic dehydration of the crustal metapelites. As these fluids ascended they absorbed gold from the crust, emplaced by either a magmatic or paleo-placer source. The gold enriched hydrothermal fluids amalgamated in large scale 1 ste order structures (shearing of the steep NW limb of the Karibib Dome, the Mon Repos Thrust Zone) that acted as primary active fluid path ways. In the case of Navachab the gold enriched fluid fluxed along these pathways while interacting with fluid sinks related to a physical throttle (brittle schist, folding, bedding <b>parallel</b> <b>shears)</b> and/or a chemical trap (marbles). By summarising and detailing the fluid sinks and active fluid pathways identified by this and previous works, it is strongly recommended that a mineral approach system be designed and implemented as targeting model to lead future exploration endeavours...|$|E

In the nonrotating case, shear instability is possible only for convectively supercritical waves, with horizontal wavevector aligned parallel or nearly parallel to the plane of IGW propagation. Transverse convection, with wavevector aligned perpendicular to the plane of IGW propagation, displays faster growth than <b>parallel</b> <b>shear</b> or convective instability at any horizontal wavenumber.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a fluid in a vertical tube, subjected to an oscillatory pressure gradient, is studied experimentally for both a Newtonian and a viscoelastic shear-thinning fluid. Particle image velocimetry {{is used to}} determine the two-dimensional velocity fields in the vertical plane of the tube axis, in a range of driving amplitudes from 0. 8 to 2. 5 mm and of driving frequencies from 2. 0 to 11. 5 Hz.

40|$|A reduced {{description}} of exact coherent {{structures in the}} transition regime of plane <b>parallel</b> <b>shear</b> flows is developed, based on the Reynolds number scaling of streamwise-averaged (mean) and streamwise-varying (fluctuation) velocities observed in numerical simulations. The resulting system is characterized by an effective unit Reynolds number mean equation coupled to linear equations for the fluctuations, regularized by formally higher-order diffusion. Stationary coherent states are computed by solving the resulting equations simultaneously using a robust numerical algorithm developed for this purpose. The algorithm determines self-consistently the amplitude of the fluctuations for which the associated mean flow is just such that the fluctuations neither grow nor decay. The procedure is used to compute exact coherent states of a flow introduced by Drazin and Reid [Hydrodynamic Stability (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1981) ] and studied by Waleffe [Phys.

Previous work based on asymptotic expansions and predicting supercritical bifurcation at Prandtl number Pr 1 for the parallel base flow is confirmed numerically and through fully nonlinear temporal simulations. When applied to the non-parallel Ekman flow, weakly {{nonlinear analysis}} and fully nonlinear calculations confirm {{that the nature of}} the bifurcation is dominantly controlled by Pr, although a sharp threshold at Pr D 1 is not found. In both flows the underlying physical mechanism is that the mean flow adjusts so as to induce a viscous (respectively diffusive) flux of momentum (respectively buoyancy) that balances the vertical flux induced by the developing instability, leading to a weakening of the mean shear and mean stratification. The competition between the former nonlinear feedback, which tends to be stabilizing, and the latter, which is destabilizing and strongly amplified as Pr increases, determines the supercritical or subcritical character of the bifurcation.
