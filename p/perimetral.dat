40|$|Abstract. The meshing {{process has}} been automatized through several {{algorithms}} under various computational systems to attempt the increasing “push ” of meshing technology. In fact, human analysts expect to mesh complex domains constituted of thousands or even millions of elements with low level of interactions. In spite of high transparency, one difficulty arises: how to develop the necessary sensitivity to analyse {{the relationship between the}} mesh quality, in global sense, and the element quality, in local sense, with a minimum number of interactions? The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a new quality measure to evaluate and compare both unstructured 2 D-Meshes, in global sense, and their triangular elements, in local sense, called ‘perimetral ratio ’ (“Relação <b>Perimetral</b> – RP”). This concept introduces five propositions and a virtual element of comparison, called ‘equivalent ideal triangle’ (“Triângulo Ideal Equivalente – TIE”). Its functionality becomes clear through a simple and didactic two dimensional meshing web application, that permits the evaluation of a given mesh, or a set of meshes, offering a measure of global quality and a respective local metric for each one of the elements. The web application was designed in an object oriented fashion using Java Language, in order to increase the access and to facilitate the ability for meshing construction and analysis.

40|$|The β 2 {{auxiliary}} subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) {{appears at}} {{early stages of}} brain development. It is abundantly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system where it forms complexes with different channel isoforms, including Nav 1. 2. From the structural point of view, β 2 is a transmembrane protein: at its extracellular N-terminus an Ig-like type C 2 domain mediates the binding to the pore-forming alpha subunit with disulfide bonds and the interactions with the extracellular matrix. Given this structural versatility, β 2 has been suggested to play multiple functions ranging from channel targeting to the plasma membrane and gating modulation to control of cell adhesion. We report that, when expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO-K 1, the subunit accumulates at the <b>perimetral</b> region of adhesion and particularly in large lamellipodia-like membrane processes where it induces formation of filopodia-like structures. When overexpressed in developing embryonic rat hippocampal neurons in vitro, β 2 specifically promotes formation of filopodia-like processes in dendrites leading to expansion of the arborization tree, while axonal branching remains unaltered. In contrast to this striking and highly specific effect on dendritic morphology, the targeting of functional sodium channels to the plasma membrane, including the preferential localization of Nav 1. 2 at the axon, and their gating properties are only minimally affected. From these and previously reported observations {{it is suggested that}} β 2, among its multiple functions, may contribute to promote dendritic outgrowth and to regulate neuronal wiring at specific stages of neuronal development...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of building acoustics design, sound propagation between rooms {{is a major factor}} in determining the acoustic insulation levels. Acoustic waves can be directly transmitted through common <b>perimetral</b> surfaces or propagate through indirect transmission paths via the building’s structure. These indirect transmission paths are the reason why acoustic waves can travel between seemingly unconnected far regions of buildings. The amount of energy the acoustic wave loses when it propagates though a structural junction is quantified with the sound reduction index of that propagation path. In order to determine these indexes, the vibration reduction index of the path between two structural elements that are connected by a structural junction is required. This vibration reduction index is an energetic measure of how different the average displacement values of those two regions are when the structure is oscillating at a determined frequency. Current european regulations have expressions to estimate the vibration reduction index of geometrically simple three-dimensional junctions with extrusion symmetry. In reality, such structures are more complex. Structural junctions are usually delimited by other surfaces and elements that cannot be included in an extrusion symmetry. Existing tables and formulas do not take into account how the geometrical complexity of a 3 D environment will affect the vibration transmission between two of its parts. This project will analyse how this geometrical complexity modifies the vibration transmission indexes. A set of three-dimensional cases will be defined and simulated with finite element methods, obtaining the vibration reduction indexes for those specific scenarios. These will be compared with the vibration transmission index of the simplified (extrusion symmetry) version of those cases, which the codes can estimate, in order to analyse whether complete three-dimensional geometries entail {{a significant difference in the}} vibratory behaviour...|$|E

Foram obtidas medidas por meio de fotografias digitais dos corações e, posteriormente, utilizando-se software, foram analisados as distâncias e os perímetros da valva mitral e da valva aórtica, que foram comparadas por meio de testes estatísticos. Nos corações normais, a área da valva mitral foi de 5, 44 ± 0, 82 cm 2 e o perímetro de 8, 91 ± 0, 57 cm, e nos corações com CMD de etiologia isquêmica e idiopática, a área foi de, respectivamente, 7, 38 ± 1, 76 cm 2 e 7, 03 ± 1, 44 cm 2, e o perímetro foi de, respectivamente, 10, 41 ± 1, 37 cm e 9, 97 ± 1, 23 cm. O perímetro de inserção da cúspide {{anterior}} da valva mitral, nos corações normais, foi de 3, 68 ± 0, 52 cm e nos corações com CMD de etiologia isquêmica e idiopática foi de, respectivamente, 3, 99 ± 0, 86 cm e 3, 62 ± 0, 78 cm. A menor distância <b>perimetral</b> entre os trígonos fibrosos (porção fibrosa), nos corações normais, foi de 2, 06 ± 0, 26 cm e nos corações com CMD de etiologia isquêmica e idiopática foi de, respectivamente, 2, 64 ± 0, 37 cm e 2, 34 ± 0, 37 cm. Nos corações normais, a área da valva aórtica foi de 3, 46 ± 0, 66 cm 2 e o perímetro de 6, 83 ± 0, 66 cm. Nos corações com CMD de etiologia isquêmica e idiopática, a área da valva aórtica foi de, respectivamente, 5, 22 ± 1, 53 cm 2 e 3, 44 ± 1, 33 cm 2, e o perímetro de, respectivamente, 8, 26 ± 1, 24 cm e 6, 82 ± 1, 37 cm. Nos casos de CMD idiopática e isquêmica, a valva mitral apresentava-se aumentada, tanto na sua área e em seu perímetro, quanto na maior e na menor distância <b>perimetral</b> entre os trígonos fibrosos. Em relação à valva aórtica, apenas nos corações com CMD isquêmica houve aumento estatisticamente significante em sua área e em seu perímetro, enquanto que nos corações com CMD idiopática não houve diferença quando comparados aos corações normais. Há manutenção da proporcionalidade, dos corações normais para os com CMD idiopática e isquêmica, das distâncias entre os trígonos fibrosos. Há evidência de que o aumento da valva mitral e da valva aórtica, quando ocorrem na CMD, se dão de forma independente. The {{objective of}} this work was to study and to compare mitral valve as well as aortic valve in the ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD) {{in relation to the}} normal hearts, searching to identify variations that can assist in diagnostic for image and for the surgical treatment of the same ones. This study it analyzed 22 normal hearts, 15 dilated hearts of ischemic etiology and 15 dilated hearts of idiopathic etiology, fixed in formaldehyde 10 %. They had been gotten measured through digitalized photographs of the hearts, and, through software, the distances and perimeters of the mitral valve and of the aortic valve had been analyzed, that later they had been compared through statistical tests. In the normal hearts, the area the mitral valve was 5. 44 ± 0. 82 cm 2 and the perimeter of 8. 91 ± 0. 57 cm. In the hearts with ischemic and idiopathic CMD the area of the mitral valve were, respectively, 7. 38 ± 1. 76 cm 2 and 7. 03 ± 1. 44 cm 2, and to the perimeter it were, respectively, 10. 41 ± 1. 37 cm and 9. 97 ± 1. 23 cm. The perimeter of insertion of anterior cusp of mitral valve in the normal hearts was 3. 68 ± 0. 52 cm, in the hearts with ischemic and idiopathic CMD were, respectively, 3. 99 ± 0. 86 cm and 3. 62 ± 0. 78 cm. The lesser length enter the fibrous trigones (fibrous portion) in the normal hearts was 2. 06 ± 0. 26 cm and in the hearts with ischemic and idiopathic CMD were, respectively, 2. 64 ± 0. 37 cm and 2. 34 ± 0. 37 cm In the normal hearts the area of aortic valve was 3. 46 ± 0. 66 cm 2 and the perimeter of 6. 83 ± 0. 66 cm. In the hearts with ischemic and idiopathic CMD the area of aortic valve were, respectively, 5. 22 ± 1. 53 cm 2 and 3. 44 ± 1. 33 cm 2, and the perimeter of, respectively, 8. 26 ± 1. 24 cm and 6. 82 ± 1. 37 cm. In the cases of idiopathic and ischemic CMD, mitral valve is presented increased, as much in its area and its perimeter, how much in the greater and the lesser <b>perimetral</b> distance between the fibrous trigones. In relation to aortic valve, only in the hearts with Ischemic CMD it had significant statistic increase in its area and its perimeter, whereas in the hearts with Idiopathic CMD it did not have difference when compared with the normal hearts. It has maintenance of the proportionality, the normal hearts for the ones with idiopathic and ischemic CMD, of the distances between the fibrous trigones. It has evidence of that the increase of mitral valve and aortic valve, when they occur in the CMD, occurs of independent form...|$|E
30|$|An {{ultrasound}} (US) {{evaluation of}} the rectus femoris (RF) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscles was performed in all patients at day 0 (within 24  h from trauma), 5, 10, 15 and 20. We used an US device with a 5 - to 7.5 -MHz linear probe (Esaote MyLab). According to a previously described methodology [13, 16], skeletal muscles were evaluated by US scan, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. The transducer was placed perpendicular to the long axis of the muscle (i.e., perpendicular to the major axis of the limb), at 3 / 5 of {{the distance between the}} anterior superior iliac spine and the superior border of patella (i.e., about 15  cm from the patella) for the RF and 5  cm below the peroneal head for the AT muscle. The measurement points were marked with indelible ink to ensure day-to-day consistency and facilitate subsequent measurements. Visualization was consistently obtained, while the patients were supine with both legs in passive extension. Two measurements were taken for each muscle in each leg. In the presence of lower limb fractures, measurements were taken on the contralateral leg only. Excess contact gel was applied so to minimize underlying soft tissue distortion. One operator only (specifically trained in muscle ultrasonography) performed all measurements. US settings (depth, gain and focus) were standardized for both RF and AT examinations. After freezing the US image, quantitative parameters were recorded for both muscles: anterior–posterior diameter (AP diam); lateral–lateral diameter (LL diam); and cross-sectional area (CSA) (computed from the <b>perimetral</b> contour of the muscle section). The value of CSA is considered to be proportional to the total mass of the skeletal muscle [13, 16]. We also recorded one qualitative parameter—echogenicity—that was expressed according to the Heckmatt Scale [17]. Echogenicity of normal muscle is expected to be 1 on this scale. Increased echogenicity is usually regarded as an index of myofibers depletion [18].|$|E
