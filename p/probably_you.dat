Three of them—Steve Russell, then an employee at Harvard University and a former research assistant at MIT; Martin Graetz, a research assistant and former student at MIT; and Wayne Wiitanen, a research assistant at Harvard and former employee and student at MIT—referring to their collaboration as the [...] "Hingham Institute" [...] as Graetz and Wiitanen were living in a tenement building on Hingham Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{came up with the idea}} for Spacewar. [...] "We had this brand new PDP-1", Steve Russell told Rolling Stone in a 1972 interview. [...] "Marvin Minsky had built some little pattern-generating programs which made interesting patterns like a kaleidoscope. Not a very good demonstration. Here was this display that could do all sorts of good things! So we started talking about it, figuring what would be interesting displays. We decided that <b>probably</b> <b>you</b> could make a two-dimensional maneuvering sort of thing, and decided that naturally the obvious thing to do was spaceships." ...|$|E

Lovecraft {{held the}} book in very high regard (though {{he did not say}} whether it {{influenced}} any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to Fritz Leiber [...] "no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men ... <b>Probably</b> <b>you</b> have read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!", and in another 1936 letter to Leiber [...] "I'm glad to hear of your perusal of Last and First Men—a volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that Master Ackerman would denominate [...] "scientifiction". Its scope is dizzying—and despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. As you say, it has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity." [...] Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur Widner he said [...] "I don't care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There's no vitality in it—merely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But I do like the few real masterpieces in the field—certain of H. G. Wells's novels, S. Fowler Wright's The World Below, & that marvellous piece of imagination by W. Olaf Stapledon, Last & First Men." ...|$|E
