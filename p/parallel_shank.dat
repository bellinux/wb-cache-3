For bits thicker than a minimum size such as 1/8 inch, {{they are available}} in fixed lengths such as 6, 8, 12, or 18 inches rather than the progressive lengths of jobber drills. The image shows a long-series drill compared to its diametric equivalents, all are 11/32 in in diameter. The equivalent Morse taper drill shown in the middle is of the usual length for a taper-shank drill. The lower drill bit is the jobber or <b>parallel</b> <b>shank</b> equivalent.|$|E
