5|$|Gandhi also campaigned hard {{going from}} one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used {{terminology}} and <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E

5|$|Carolina wrens sing {{year round}} and {{at any point}} during the daytime, with the {{exception}} of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes, and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and túrtee-túrtee-túrtee and familiar names and <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|E

25|$|In morphosyntax, {{the use of}} the {{auxiliary}} verb kho 'to come' as opposed to wird 'will' in <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> leg di warm a, sunscht khunscht krank ('put on warm clothes, otherwise you will get sick') in Grisons-German is sometimes attributed to Romansh, as well as the lack of a distinction between the accusative and dative case in some Grisons-German dialects and the word order in <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> i tet froge jemand wu waiss ('I would ask someone who knows'). In addition, some words, neuter in most dialects of German, are masculine in Grisons-German. Examples include der Brot 'the bread' or der Gäld 'the money'. Common words of Romansh origin in Grisons-German include Schaffa (derived from Romansh scaffa 'cupboard'), Spus/Spüslig 'bridegroom' and Spus 'bride', Banitsch 'cart used for moving dung', and Pon 'container made of wood'. In areas where Romansh either is still spoken or has disappeared recently, Romansh words are even more common in the local dialects of German.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist {{independently}} of the perfect in sentences like I turned this offer down, creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives. To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from. This emphasizes that the resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the passive form. However, this analysis {{does not account for}} <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> I turned this offer down, which uses the active rather than the passive voice.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Jew lawyer or Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council, which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.|$|E

Those who survived were often left mutilated, suffering permanent disability, weakened bodies, and mental distress. On 19 August 1947, the doctors captured by Allied forces were put on trial in USA vs. Karl Brandt et al., commonly known as the Doctors' Trial. At the trial, several of the doctors argued in their defense that there was no international law regarding medical experimentation.|$|E

25|$|As each {{character}} represents {{a single word}} (or, more precisely, a morpheme), many logograms are required to write all the words of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, {{the ability to communicate}} across languages only works for the closely related varieties of Chinese, as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. Japanese uses Chinese logograms extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic Chinese grammar, though short and concise <b>phrases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend.|$|E
