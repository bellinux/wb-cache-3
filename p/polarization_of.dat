Bo's policies put him in opposition to the more liberal and reform-oriented faction, particularly Premier Wen Jiabao and Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, who favored the strengthening of rule of law and a continuation of political reform.

5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the <b>polarization</b> <b>of</b> the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E

For prompt production, we also take into account feeddown contributions from χ_cJ(J= 0, 1, 2) and decays.

40|$|Summary. This is the {{introduction}} {{to a series of}} papers analysing records from three-component seismometers immediately above a swarm of small earthquakes near the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey. The networks were set up to investigate the possibility of estimating dilatancy-induced adisotropy by monitoring shear-wave splitting in shear waves from local earthquakes as suggested by the hypothesis of extensive-dilatancy anisotropy (EDA). These networks were among the first closely-spaced digital three-component. seismometers to be deployed in the shear-wave window immediately over a seismic source zone, where the <b>polarizations</b> <b>of</b> incident shear waves can be recognized from surface recordings. Consequently, the seismograms display several new phenomena that have not been previously observed: (1) the <b>polarizations</b> <b>of</b> almost all shear waves arriving within the shear-wave window showed abrupt changes in direction characteristic of shear-wave splitting in synthetic seismograms modelling wave propagation through anisotropic rocks; (2) the <b>polarizations</b> <b>of</b> the faster split shear waves are in patterns characteristic of propagation through distributions of cracks aligned by the principal axes o...|$|R
