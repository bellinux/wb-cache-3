5000|$|The film {{tells of}} Bears and Suzie Kaufman and their newly born son, Raun. By {{the time he}} was {{eighteen}} months old, Raun was diagnosed with a <b>perpetual</b> <b>disability</b> known as classic autism—which, at the time, was classified as a form of childhood schizophrenia—and had mental retardation. Accordingly, [...] "although advised to institutionalize Raun, his parents...instead created an innovative home-based, child-centered program in an effort to reach him." [...] Subsequently, Raun became typical of neural development and earned his master's degree from Brown University. The film went on to receive the Humanitas Prize award.|$|E
5000|$|In the Avegnor case, the Louisiana Supreme Court {{held that}} {{there was such a}} privity between a person whose life estate had been {{condemned}} under the Act of July 17, 1862, and his heirs, that the latter were bound by a suit and decree to enforce a mortgage executed by their ancestor containing the pact de non alienando, to which the ancestor alone had been made a party defendant. It is sustained by Wallach v. Van Riswick, ubi supra, as will appear by the following passages from that Court's opinion:"If it be contended that the heirs of Charles S. Wallach," [...] the person whose property had been condemned,"cannot take by descent unless their father, at his death, was seized of an estate of inheritance, e.g., reversion or a remainder, it may be answered that even at common law it was not always necessary that the ancestor should be seized to enable the heir to take by descent. Shelley's Case is that where the ancestor might have taken and been seized, the heir shall inherit. Fortescue, J., in Thornby v. Fleetwood, 1 Str. 318.""If it were true that at common law the heirs could not take in any case where their ancestor was not seized at his death, the present case must be determined by the statute. Charles S. Wallach was seized of the entire fee of the land before its confiscation, and the act of Congress interposed to take from him that seizing for a limited time. That it was competent to do, attaching the limitation {{for the benefit of the}} heirs. It wrought no corruption of blood. In Lord de la Warre's Case, 11 Coke 1a, it was resolved by the justices""{{that there was}} a difference betwixt disability personal and temporary and a disability absolute and perpetual, as where one is attainted of treason and felony, that is an absolute and <b>perpetual</b> <b>disability,</b> by corruption of blood, for any of his posterity to claim any inheritance in fee simple, either as heir to him or any ancestor above him, but when one is disabled by Parliament (without any attainder) to claim the dignity for his life, it is a personal disability for his life only, and his heir, after his death, may claim as heir to him or to any ancestor above him.""There is a close analogy between that case and the present.""Without pursuing this discussion further, we repeat, that to hold that any estate or interest remained in Charles S. Wallach after the confiscation and sale of the land in controversy, would defeat the avowed purpose of the confiscation act and the only justification for its enactment, and to hold that the joint resolution was not intended for the benefit of his heirs exclusively, to enable them to take the inheritance after his death, would give preference to the guilty over the innocent. We cannot so hold." ...|$|E
