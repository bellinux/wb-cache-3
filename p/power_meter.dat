As the CO <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> is filled, the CO zone grows larger. When the meter is full, the CO can {{activate}} his power which has an effect on the whole battlefield, such as repairing allied units, damaging enemy units, or temporarily altering weather conditions. In addition, the offensive and defensive boosts that normally apply only in the CO zone, also applies to all allied units on the whole battlefield for the turn that the CO power is active. If the CO unit is destroyed, the CO meter empties and the CO returns to the HQ, able to be redeployed with another unit.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star <b>Power</b> <b>meter.</b> When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of the buttons on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star <b>Power</b> <b>meter</b> is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − Technical {{irregularities}} {{found in}} electrical <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> due to tampering, which {{are classified as}} fraud, {{are responsible for the}} most part of the energy loss experienced in the sector of electrical power distribution. The cost of energy theft is shared with all consumers in the form of non-technical losses. This work suits that context, by means of combating fraud in electric <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> in order to reduce losses due to the strengthening of effective punishment of cheaters. For that is proposed a systematization model of the process for verification of irregularities in electric <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> and the respective issuance of audit reports. The proposed systematization is based on a database containing standardized irregularities which were hierarchically arranged and also from information obtained from metrological calibration audits, thus ensuring the reliability of the results. The proposed model was tested in samples of tampered <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> provided by the electrical distribution utilities in southern Brazil. A main outcome of this research is a customized software that organizes the procedures of technical audit in a legally binding basis as applied to <b>power</b> <b>meters.</b> From the results of analysis conducted on sample <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> audited, it was possible to settle the software's report...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} {{dependence of}} human beings on technology has not only made ICT a growing power consumer, but also a rising contributor to the adverse effects of global climate change. In light of the growing power consumption by ICT, accurate measurement techniques are required since leaders cannot manage what cannot be measured. One of the emerging power measurement techniques is via the use of software <b>power</b> <b>meters,</b> which offer visibility of power consumption of computers {{without the need for}} external hardware, as was often the case in the past. Although different software <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> have begun to emerge on the market, studies have rarely compared their effectiveness as well as the accuracy of their readings. This work critically compares key software <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> presently available and contrasts their effectiveness with hardware <b>power</b> <b>meters,</b> before making recommendations on their future, based on identified limitations...|$|R

500|$|As in {{the first}} two arcade games of the series, players have a <b>power</b> <b>meter,</b> located {{on the bottom of the}} screen. The meter fills up as the player lands punches against the opponent, and it goes down as the player gets hit. When the <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> fills up completely, the player will be able to launch {{knockout}} punches such as uppercuts, hooks, and rapid punches. These punches have a slight delay in execution, but they cause more damage to the opponent. Players can also build power as the match progresses, as indicated by the background color behind the player's face on the upper left corner of the screen, which goes from blue to green to yellow to red. The player reaches [...] "Power-Up" [...] status when the background color reaches red. During this status, the player's punch speed and power increase. They lose their Power-Up status if they are knocked down.|$|E
500|$|Selected special {{segments}} of the song will have glowing notes outlined by stars: successfully hitting all notes in this series will fill the [...] "Star Power Meter". The Star <b>Power</b> <b>Meter</b> can also be filled by using the whammy bar during sustained notes within these segments. Once the Star <b>Power</b> <b>Meter</b> is at least half full, the player can activate [...] "Star Power" [...] by pressing the select button or momentarily lifting the guitar into a vertical position. When Star Power is activated, the scoring multiplier is doubled until Star Power is depleted. The Rock Meter also increases more dramatically when Star Power is activated, {{making it easier for}} the player to make the Rock Meter stay at a high level. Thus, Star Power can be used strategically to play difficult sections of a song that otherwise might cause the player to fail. In the earlier entries of the series (up until Guitar Hero: Aerosmith), activating Star Power meant that players could not accrue more Star Power until the Star <b>Power</b> <b>meter</b> was fully drained and the effect ended. Starting with Guitar Hero: World Tour, more Star Power can be collected even if the effect is active by completing more Star Power phrases, extending the Star Power's duration by doing so. When playing in cooperative play (with a bassist/rhythm guitarist in Guitar Hero II through Guitar Hero: Aerosmith or as a band in Guitar Hero: World Tour), Star Power is shared between all the players and activation of Star Power is dependent on all players simultaneously activating it.|$|E

500|$|The {{player is}} awarded points for {{correctly}} hitting notes, chords and sustains. The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing {{a series of}} consecutive notes successfully. A [...] "Rock Meter" [...] tracks the player's performance based on {{success or failure of}} hitting notes, and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player. The player can also earn [...] "Star Power" [...] by playing a series of glowing notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains. Once the Star <b>Power</b> <b>meter</b> is filled at least halfway, Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically, or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller. Activating Star Power will double the scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes.

[...] The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4 from the probe tip {{as shown in figure}} 3. [...] This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the quarter-wave impedance transformer effect. [...] Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line. [...] The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector. [...] Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.|$|E
