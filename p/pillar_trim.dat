25|$|To {{left and}} right of the central door are two {{permanently}} installed fields consisting of upright flat marble slabs inlaid with an unusual Intarsia technique, with geometric and floral motifs cut into the marble in relief. The pictures are from the Arab tradition and are supplemented by small birds, swastikas, flowers, palmettes and leaves. The wells of the reliefs were originally filled with a red, now darkened mass of wax and mastic. In the same technique, marble inlays are also mounted on the <b>pillar</b> <b>trim,</b> connecting panels and the door lintels. Two icons are also embedded above the lintels. On {{the left side of}} the door, the Panagia is depicted with the Child Jesus. To the right of the central door is the Christ Pantocrator with the right hand in a sign of blessing and the left holding a closed Evangelion. These two icons are modern creations which took the place of 17th century icons which were stolen in 1982.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rear door}} handles are {{installed}} on the [...] "C" [...] pillar as a Nissan design tradition started with the 1986 Nissan Pathfinder. When the four-door Pathfinder was introduced, Nissan chose to conceal the door handles {{as a part of}} the [...] "C" [...] <b>pillar</b> <b>trim</b> to visually make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with conventional door handles on the front doors.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the four}} door version was introduced, Nissan chose {{to conceal the}} door handles {{as a part of}} the [...] "C" [...] <b>pillar</b> <b>trim</b> to {{visually}} make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with the conventional door handles on the front doors. This design tradition is still used on all Nissan SUVs currently offered, including the Nissan Armada, Nissan Juke, Nissan Terrano II, and the Nissan Xterra. The front doors were slightly shortened to accommodate the rear doors.|$|E

The procedure here is the same as with exterior design (sketch, digital model and clay model).|$|R
50|$|The main hall of {{the synagogue}} was square. There were wings on each side that served as women's prayer areas. A women's prayer balcony was added above the {{vestibule}} in 1857.The synagogue had a two-tiered roof with dormer windows. The ceiling {{is thought to have}} been vaulted. The exterior featured a second story balcony and a pair of corner pavilions that contained stairs to the women's gallery. The exterior featured unusually elaborate railings, <b>pillars</b> and cornice <b>trim.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While {{derived from}} the 1100, the 1200 Granluce had an all-new, more modern greenhouse, {{featuring}} a wider widshield, ampler side windows and a rear panoramic window—hence the Granluce name, meaning [...] "grand light".At the rear the car adopted the fins and longer boot of the contemporary 1100 model 1958.Intended as a luxury model, the Granluce's bodywork was heavily decorated: there was a contrasting colour roof, a ribbed chrome panel on the C <b>pillar,</b> and bright <b>trim</b> on the bonnet, sides and boot lid.|$|R

50|$|A {{national}} {{competition was}} held to pick a design for a building to house both the public library and the public museum. Seventy-four entries were received, including one from Frank Lloyd Wright. The winning design submitted by Ferry & Clas of Milwaukee was for a building one block long and designed in a combination of French and Italian renaissance styles known as Neo-renaissance. The building was designed in a U-shape to provide a common entrance for the library and museum but to keep the facilities separate. Construction costs for the monumental building, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, were $780,000.In {{the entrance to the}} library, mosaic tile floors were hand-laid by master Italian craftsmen who had settled in Milwaukee. Tessera, the small squarish pieces of colored marble or tile, were used in the entrance and in the Art, Music and Recreation Department. The tessera in the entrance floor are smaller than normal, allowing for a more detailed design. The age of the building has buckled, settled, cracked and damaged the floor and columns. In 2008, a restoration of the mosaic tile floors was begun.Some of the materials used in the interior are yellow Sienna marble, brass and stained glass (lighting fixtures), hardwoods such as oak and mahogany, and scagliola (used for the <b>pillars).</b> The <b>trim</b> on top of the wainscoting in the corridor is called “egg and dart”, and is replicated in renovated areas throughout the library. The bay leaf garland design found above the doors in the corridor is actually made of painted plaster, not carved wood.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{almost all}} {{factories}} use robots {{to a certain}} extent. In particular, automated assembly operations are common in modern manufacturing firms. However, current industrial applications require a pre-knowledge of assembly parts, their locations {{as well as the}} paths that they should follow during the assembly process. This research introduces a remote assembly control system, which gives the operator access to the robot at any time and any location {{as long as there is}} an Internet access. In addition, the remote assembly control uses a user-friendly interface which is easy and quick to use. An operator does not need great knowledge before using the web portal for the remote assembly control. On the contrary, using robot programming software would require the operator spending more time to learn specific skills. The remote assembly is also useful in risky situations in which the operator must keep a distance from the work place of the robot. The main objective of this project is to design a web-based system that can provide the ability for remote operators to assemble objects in a robotic cell using 3 D models of those objects in a virtual environment. The system consists of an industrial robot and a network camera connected to an application server. Using the user interface and the camera, a remote operator can take some snapshots of the real objects in the robotic cell and the system will construct the 3 D models of these objects. Consequently, the operator can assemble the real objects using the equivalent 3 D models via an existing Wise-ShopFloor virtual environment. The scope of the project includes: Capturing the real objects with a camera mounted beside the gripper of the robot. The position of the camera gives the system more flexibility for taking the snapshots from different angles. Analysing the snapshots using different filters in order to identify the silhouettes of the objects. These silhouettes will be labelled to help distinguishing the different objects. Constructing 3 D models of the objects. This will be done by constructing pillars from the labelled silhouettes of the top view of the objects. These <b>pillars</b> will be <b>trimmed</b> with the silhouettes obtained from snapshots in different angles, until the pillars represent the objects with the needed accuracy. Integrating the models into the Wise-ShopFloor virtual environment. This environment can be executed in a web browser. Updating the objects in the virtual environment according to the assembly operations. Since assembly only needs picking and placing objects, the image processing and the 3 D modelling do not need as high quality as it would need for other tasks, such as welding. In addition, the operator may be anywhere as long as an Internet access is provided. The Internet connection does not need to be in broadband because the system consumes a limited bandwidth for receiving snapshots from the camera and sending assembly instructions to the robot. The results of this project will allow the operator to work away from dangerous environments, therefore helping to improve safety. This research can also help improving the adaptability of industry in ad-hoc assembly operations. Besides, the use of the web for the remote assembly can save cost and time in operator training and special-purpose software purchasing. Remote assembly is expected to become an important research area with unlimited application potentials in the future in distributed manufacturing...|$|R
