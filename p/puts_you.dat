5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
500|$|In practice, Fellini {{shot his}} films while playing taped music because, as he {{explained}} in a 1972 interview, [...] "it <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> in a strange dimension in which your fantasy stimulates you". For La Strada, Fellini used a variation by Arcangelo Corelli {{that he planned to}} use on the sound track. Rota, unhappy with that plan, wrote an original motif (with echoes of the [...] "Larghetto" [...] from Dvořák's Opus 22 Serenade for Strings in E major [...] ) with rhythmic lines matched to Corelli's piece that synchronize with Gelsomina's movements with the trumpet and Il Matto's with the violin.|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, Aditya Music {{released}} Eega on Blu-ray [...] with English subtitles and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround sound. The release {{also contained}} a two-hour DVD about {{the making of}} the film. J. Hurtado of Twitch Film reviewed the Blu-ray version, writing, [...] "The most egregious mangling of the film {{comes in the form of}} a severely fucked contrast scale, which leads to absurdly crushed black levels rendering nearly all shadow detail completely obliterated". Hurtado called the audio a [...] "thing of beauty, giving good separation and a booming low end that <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> in the middle of the Eega action in a way that even my theatrical experience couldn't do".|$|E

500|$|Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, stating that, [...] "Silence is a monumental work, and a {{punishing}} one. It <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> through hell with no promise of enlightenment, only a set of questions and propositions, sensations and experiences... This is {{not the sort of}} film you 'like' or 'don't like.' It's a film that you experience and then live with." [...] Richard Roeper awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, [...] "When Ferreira finally appears and we learn the truth about where he's been all this time, it further serves Scorsese's central theme about the conflict between adhering to one's sacred vows and traditional beliefs and doing the right thing, the prudent thing, the moral thing, on a very pragmatic level." ...|$|E
500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{was created}} by indie {{developer}} Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. [...] The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an [...] "artistic statement" [...] on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as creating something [...] "that makes you feel violated and {{makes you want to}} protect stuff that’s yours, and <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> in the process of securing what’s yours." [...] However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical—since they are invading others' homes as well—was partially intentional and an [...] "elegant" [...] idea.|$|E

[...] He concluded, [...] "I'd rather have 100 Al Capones in every city than alcohol sold in every grocery store." [...] Amondson made an appearance on The Daily Show with comedian Jon Stewart. He spoke with correspondent Ed Helms who joked with the candidate. During the segment, Amondson remarked, [...] "alcohol cuts the supply of oxygen to the brain and <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> {{in a kind of}} retarded state." [...] A short clip followed that showed Amondson in his Grim Reaper attire. Earl Dodge also appeared on the show in a separate interview with Helms.|$|E

GamePro stated the collection is [...] "two fantastic games on one disc for a low price; <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> in the right mindset for God of War 3." [...] PlayStation LifeStyle (5/5) said [...] "Those... familiar with Kratos will enjoy the extra polish the Collection brings {{to two of the}} best games from the PS2 era."

[...] Farrakhan made antisemitic comments during his May 16–17, 2013 visit to Detroit and in his weekly sermons titled [...] "The Time and What Must Be Done", begun during January 2013. In March 2015, Farrakhan accused Jews of involvement in the September 11 attacks.|$|E
2500|$|The seventh {{track on}} Odd Blood, [...] "Rome", {{features}} beats taken from Moroccan and Syrian dance music that Keating's wife {{had on her}} iPod, while for [...] "Strange Reunions", Yeasayer created a short song under three minutes by exploring unconventional time signatures in different parts {{in the style of}} fellow New York City band Dirty Projectors. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] follows and is an old song created by Keating using samplers plugged into a television set. Using four channels which showed programs like infomercials and soap operas, he recorded four banks of sound and structured a song by singing on top of the material. The last track, [...] "Grizelda", is, according to Tuton, [...] "a nice way to close an album.

2500|$|The best {{alternative}} to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. [...] The quality of a BATNA {{has the potential to}} improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. One of the best strategy while going into a negotiation is to ensure that you have a strong BATNA, and if not, have tools equipped that can help you made the other side's BATNA weak. One of the major mistakes made by new negotiators is to disclose their BATNA at first without having had any discussion with the other side. This can jeopardise your position in the negotiation, as your negotiation might have been weaker than the other sides, and such disclosure <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> at a weaker spot in the negotiation. The best strategy is to {{ask a lot of questions}} to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold called the film [...] "a wretched excess." [...] Jay Scott, {{in his review}} for the Globe and Mail, called the film [...] "a hell of an {{antidote}} to E.T." [...] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "Astonishingly, Carpenter blows it. There's {{a big difference between}} shock effects and suspense, and in sacrificing everything at the altar of gore, Carpenter sabotages the drama. The Thing is so single-mindedly determined to keep you awake that it almost <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> to sleep." [...] David Denby of New York magazine wrote that the original story may have influenced Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien, but a new adaptation seems derivative. [...] In his book Science Fiction (1984), Phil Hardy described the film as a [...] "surprising failure" [...] and [...] "Carpenter's most unsatisfying film to date." [...] The review noted that the narrative [...] "seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell's hero {{is no more than a}} cypher compared to Kenneth Tobey's rounded character in Howard Hawks' The Thing".|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Alex McClimens, whom Muller quoted above, also wrote, [...] "This {{magnificent}} {{essay in}} communication is compulsory reading {{for anyone with}} the slightest interest in autistic spectrum disorders. This book is also required reading for those who simply enjoy a fascinating story... we are offered a first person narrative to match anything by contemporary writers. Mark Haddon has created a true literary character and {{his handling of the}} teenage Asperger's heroic adventure is brilliantly crafted. He uses the literal mind-set of his hero to mask the true direction of the plot." [...] Reviewer Paul Moorehead calls the book [...] "a fairly ripping adventure story" [...] and writes, [...] "It's also quite a feat of writing. The actual use of language is somewhat austere—an unavoidable consequence of having a boy with autism as a narrator—but it has its own beauty, and it works. So persuasive and so effective is the construction of Christopher, not only is he a character you're rooting for, he's also the character in the story you understand the best. It's startling how believably and comfortably this story <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> into what you might have thought were likely to be some pretty alien shoes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film also {{received}} some mixed reactions from critics. Filmfare rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Guzaarish is unabashedly Sanjay Leela Bhansali. In a film where life {{itself is the}} villain everything is larger than life, no surprise there. The house is grand, the characters even more so, the laughter is magnificent, the pain operatic and the treatment {{of all of the}} above is colossal in a deafening, attention seeking way that leaves no room for subtext or imagination." [...] Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5 and believed that the film would be effective if the writing was more organic and the emotions felt more authentic but Bhansali never gives us a chance to invest in these people. Reuters trashed the movie for its over the top performances and stated that the lead actor Hrithik Roshan is the only saving grace of the movie where [...] "everything else, like Aishwarya Rai's make-up, seems fake and loud, and <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> off. The emotions, the set design, the dialogues, Hrithik Roshan's beard are all out of this world, residing in some alien planet that only Bhansali inhabits." [...] The Hindu reviewer Sudhish Kamath gave a negative review to the movie and heaped praises on the lead actor Hrithik Roshan saying that [...] "Hrithik Roshan gives one of the best performances of his career as a man trapped in a wheelchair/bad film, desperately craving for freedom.." [...] As a bottomline he said that Guzaarish is [...] "Highly pretentious, boring film with leftover craving-for-your-sympathy melodrama from Black and unused sets from Saawariya". The Times of India, which gave a 4.5 rating, mentioned that [...] "Guzaarish is an unusual film in many respects".|$|E
