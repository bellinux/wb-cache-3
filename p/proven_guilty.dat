25|$|Dead Beat, {{released}} on May 3, 2005, {{was the first}} hardback release in the series by Roc. The first printing of 15,000 copies sold out in three days, and the book was immediately reprinted.

25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until <b>proven</b> <b>guilty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Article 87 of the Basic Law and Article 11 of the Bill of Rights {{provides}} that anyone {{charged with a}} criminal offence shall {{have the right to}} be presumed innocent until <b>proven</b> <b>guilty</b> according to law. This presumption is well established under the common law; the much-celebrated case of Woolmington v DPP laid down the basic criminal law principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt subject to the defence of insanity and statutory exceptions. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant committed the criminal offence in question, the prosecution has not made out the case and the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.|$|E

25|$|On 8 June 2012 the General Elections Committee (GEC) {{refused to}} {{register}} Enkhbayar {{as a candidate}} for 2012 parliamentary elections in MPRP party list listed as number one. It stated that the official documents sent from the Prosecutor's Office and Sukhbaatar District Court of Ulaanbaatar required the rejection of Enkhbayar's application pending the case. However, Enkhbayar and his lawyers argue that the incumbent president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, who took office in 2009, engineered the corruption case to keep him from running in the coming elections. They claim that the court gave them insufficient time to review the prosecutors' evidence and witness statements. The election authorities' denial of Enkhbayar's candidacy on 6 June, they say, violates his constitutional right to be considered innocent until <b>proven</b> <b>guilty.</b> According to a US-based independent trial observer, the five charges levelled against Enkhbayar seem overblown and unsubstantiated. One accuses him of misappropriating TV equipment that was intended for a Buddhist monastery. Another alleges that he illegally shipped eight copies of his autobiography to South Korea on a government plane.|$|E
25|$|Partisanship, {{more than}} any other factor, appears to be the divider in the {{controversy}} surrounding Garcia Moreno’s legacy. Liberal opposition did and does continue to portray him as a tyrant by emphasizing the more authoritarian policies of his regime. Under Garcia Moreno’s presidency, his beliefs and goals alone directed government policies, an easily undermined structure for a stable government, and the legislature often was reduced to a rubber stamping body. Even when confronted with evidence of the good which was done under his presidency, most opponents then and now still would likely argue that the end does not justify the means, and further point out the morally ambiguous ways in which Garcia Moreno retained control: a secret police, the installation of political puppets, etc. In more modern times, particularly in modern republics, another complaint would be voiced as well, that being the establishment of a state religion, instead championing the individual's right to religious liberty. In Garcia Moreno’s defense, as conservative supporters point out, however, there are three factors which lessen this criticism. First, Garcia Moreno, unlike many rulers throughout history, made this move not for the sake of power, but rather in order to build a new moral identity for the nation; second, he believed, based on a career of watching warfare within Ecuador, that only a shared spiritual identity of Latin American-style Catholicism could bring peace to a land ravaged by strife between Liberals and Conservatives as well as former Spanish socioracial classes, and in many ways it worked during his regime; third, Article 10, the section of the 1869 constitution which restricted religious practice to Catholicism was, strictly speaking, a comparative continuity with the past, even though it is morally questionable, for Ecuador already was overwhelmingly Catholic {{with the exception of a}} Jewish minority and foreign Protestants living in the land. (Nevertheless, the liberal objector still could point out the ends do not justify the means and that Garcia Moreno simply could have appealed to the history of Ecuador, as separated from other former colonies in South America, for this goal.) Furthermore, the 1869 constitution also assured citizens’ right to innocence until <b>proven</b> <b>guilty,</b> prohibited arrests without warrants, and ensured the people’s rights to free speech and assembly (though one may question how well this was carried out), so long as it respected religion, morality and decency.|$|E

Not wanting to admit they were conned, Homer and Bart go along with Marge's theory. At the trial, the Blue Haired Lawyer leads Homer {{to say that it}} was Willie who stole the car. After Willie is <b>proven</b> <b>guilty,</b> he snatches Wiggum's gun and shoots Principal Skinner. At this point Homer finally confesses that he got conned but Marge and the townspeople themselves tell Homer and Bart that they set up the trial and the carjacking to teach them a lesson on conning people, revealing that Skinner was not really shot (it was a fake blood pack), the judge was Grampa wearing a latex mask, and the con man who stole their car was an actor called Devon Bradley. As Lisa is ready to explain why the town, media and police officials had [...] "nothing better to do" [...] than show them the consequences of their actions, Otto runs through the courtroom doors, shouting, 'Surf's Up!'.
