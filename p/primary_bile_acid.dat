A majority of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> in higher vertebrates have a 3 α-hydroxyl group.

This alteration causes death in 90 % of newborn mice and decreases the absorption of dietary cholesterol in surviving adults. Negative feedback regulation of <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis mediated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is disrupted in the mutant mice.

These two major bile acids are roughly equal in concentration in humans. Derivatives are made from cholyl-CoA, which exchanges its CoA with either glycine, or taurine, yielding glycocholic and taurocholic acid, respectively.|$|E

Variables were compared by unconditional logistic regression, controlling for gender. There were significant and positive associations between risk of adenoma and total fecal <b>primary</b> <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and serum cholesterol, with odds ratios for the third versus first tertile = 9. 4 (P for trend = 0. 03) and 8. 6 (P for trend = 0. 04), respectively.

The synthesis of bile acids in the liver is negatively regulated by the ileal hormone fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), and lower levels of this hormone result in overproduction of bile acids, which are more than the ileum can absorb.|$|E

Sixty-four percent of the DFA III intake had been assimilated on day 3 of ingestion, {{and almost all of}} the DFA III was assimilated {{at the end of the}} experiment. The DFA III-assimilating bacterium, Ruminococcus productus, in DFA III-fed rats was in the stationary state of the 8 th power of 10 – the 9 th power of 10 cells/g dry feces within a week from the 6 th power of 10 cells/g dry feces on day 1 of DFA III ingestion. The number of R. productus cells was associated with the amount of DFA III excreted in the feces. The acetic acid produced from DFA III by R. productus lowered the cecal pH to 5. 8. In control-fed rats and DFA III-fed rats, 94 % of secondary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and 94 % of <b>primary</b> <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively, were accounted for in the total <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> analyzed.
