6000|$|... "Well, {{where was}} I?" [...] This was {{another of the}} papa's tricks to gain time. Whenever he {{could not think of}} {{anything}} more, he always asked, [...] "Well, where was I?" [...] He now added: [...] "Oh yes! I remember! Well, once there were a Prince and a Princess, and their names were Butterflyflutterby and Flutterbybutterfly; and they were both twins, and both orphans; but they made their home with their fairy godmother {{as long as they were}} little, and they used to help her about the house for <b>part</b> <b>board,</b> and she helped them about their kingdom, and kept it in good order for them, and left them plenty of time to play and enjoy themselves. She was the greatest person for order there ever was; and if she found a speck of dust or dirt on the kingdom anywhere, she would have out the whole army and make them wash it up, and then sand-paper the place, and polish it with a coarse towel till it perfectly glistened. The father of the Prince and Princess had taken the precaution, before he died, to subdue all his enemies; and the consequence was that the longest kind of peace had set in, and the army had nothing to do but keep the kingdom clean. That was the reason why the fairy godmother had made the General-in-Chief take their guns away, and arm them with long feather-dusters. They marched with the poles on their shoulders, and carried the dusters in their belts, like bayonets; and whenever they came to a place that the fairy godmother said needed dusting--she always went along with them in a diamond chariot--she made the General halloo out: 'Fix dusters! Make ready! Aim! Dust!' And then the place would be cleaned up. But the General-in-Chief used to go out behind the church and cry, it mortified him so to have to give such orders, and it reminded him so painfully of the good old times when he would order his men to charge the enemy, and cover the field with gore and blood, instead of having it so awfully spick-and-span as it was now. Still he did what the fairy godmother told him, because he said it was his duty; and he kept his troops supplied with sudsine and dustene, to clean up with, and brushes and towels.

5000|$|When {{operated}} as {{a business}} where owners bring their horses to be boarded, they are known as livery yards (BrE) or boarding stables (AmE and Australian English). [...] There {{are a number of}} arrangements which horse owners can undertake with operators of these stables. The least expensive is when the horse owner doing all of the work involved in care of the horse, called Do-it-yourself (DIY) or self-board. In the middle range, the term [...] "full board" [...] is used in the USA to refer to several options, depending {{on the part of the}} country, from a facility that simply feeds the animals and possibly provides turnout, to one that handles all care of the horse, sometimes including exercise under saddle, but not training per se. At the top end, the facility operator manages the entire care of the horse, including riding and training. In the UK, this is called full livery (BrE). In the USA such settings may be called a [...] "training stable." [...] There are intermediate stages of care with parts of the care of the horse undertaken by each party, using terms such as part livery or <b>part</b> <b>board,</b> with the terms not universal, even within individual countries, and usually agreed between owner and operator.|$|E
