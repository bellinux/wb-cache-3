The synoptic characteristics of selected precipitation occurrences were investigated as causes for 1) rainfall events with effect of moisture convergence owing to low pressure passing through south sea on 19 JAN, 2) snowfall events due to moisture inflowing from yellow sea with propagation of Siberian high pressure after low <b>pressure</b> <b>passage</b> over middle northern region on 31 JAN, 3) rainfall event with effect of weak pressure trough in west low and east high pressure system on 25 FEB, 4) rainfall event due to moisture inflow according to low pressures over Bohai bay and south eastern sea on 5 MAR. However, it is identified that vertical structure of atmosphere had different characteristics with heavy rainfall system in summer. Firstly, depth of convection was narrow due to absence of moisture convergence and strong ascending air current in middle layer. Secondly...|$|E

40|$|The 1982 – 1983 {{surge of}} Variegated Glacier {{involved}} the development, growth and downglacier propagation of a velocity peak associated with rapid basal sliding facilitated by high subglacial water <b>pressures.</b> <b>Passage</b> of the velocity peak through the glacier {{was preceded by}} an episode of longitudinal shortening and followed by an episode of elongation. The deformation history of the glacier ice was dependent upon location relative to the surge nucleus and the final position reached by the propagating velocity peak. Ice above the surge nucleus experienced continuous and cumulative elongation; ice below the final position of the velocity peak experienced continuous and cumulative shortening; ice between these two points experienced shortening followed by elongation and low cumulative strain. The large-scale pattern of ice structure development reflects these deformation histories. Surging is equivalent to thrust sheet emplacement {{by a combination of}} gravity gliding over a weakened basal layer and ‘push from behind’, with the gravity-driven motion of the surging part of the glacier providing the push which allows the surge front to propagate. The relationships established between the deformation history of surging glaciers and the development of ice structures may facilitate the interpretation of structures in thrust sheets...|$|R

In this study, the pressure of flowing water throughout the blade passages were measured at four sections along the passages by using four mercury deflection manometers and conditions of the flowing water were recorded by using a stroboscope and camera.

40|$|A {{literature}} survey and a theoretical study {{were performed to}} characterize residential chimney conditions for flue gas flow measurements. The focus is on Pitot-static probes to give sufficient basis for the development and calibration of a velocity pressure averaging probe suitable for the continuous dynamic (i. e. non steady state) measurement of the low flow velocities present in residential chimneys. The flow conditions {{do not meet the}} requirements set in ISO 10780 and ISO 3966 for Pitot-static probe measurements, and the methods and their uncertainties are not valid. The flow velocities in residential chimneys from a heating boiler under normal operating condi-tions are shown to be so low that they in some conditions result in voiding the assumptions of non-viscous fluid justifying the use of the quadratic Bernoulli equation. A non-linear Reynolds number dependent calibration coefficient that is correcting for the viscous effects is needed to avoid significant measurement errors. The wide range of flow velocity during normal boiler operation also results in the flow type changing from laminar, across the laminar to turbulent transition region, to fully turbulent flow, resulting in significant changes of the velocity profile during dynamic measurements. In addition, the short duct lengths (and changes of flow direction and duct shape) used in practice are shown to result in that the measurements are done in the hydrodynamic entrance region where the flow velocity profiles most likely are neither symmetrical nor fully developed. A measurement method insensitive to velocity profile changes is thus needed, if the flow velocity profile cannot otherwise be determined or predicted with reasonable accuracy for the whole measurement range. Because of particulate matter and condensing fluids in the flue gas it is beneficial if the probe can be constructed so that it can easily be taken out for cleaning, and equipped with a locking mechanism to always ensure the same alignment in the duct without affecting the calibration. The literature implies {{that there may be a}} significant time lag in the measurements of low flow rates due to viscous effects in the internal impact <b>pressure</b> <b>passages</b> of Pitot probes, and the significance in the discussed application should be studied experimentally. The measured differential pressures from Pitot-static probes in residential chimney flows are so low that the calibration and given uncertainties of commercially available pressure transducers are not adequate. The pressure transducers should be calibrated specifically for the application, preferably in combination with the probe, and the significance of all different error sources should be investigated carefully. Care should be taken also with the temperature measurement, e. g. with averaging of several sensors, as significant temperature gradients may be present in flue gas ducts...|$|R
