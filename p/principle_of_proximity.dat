50|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> states that, {{all else}} being equal, {{perception}} tends to group stimuli that are close together {{as part of}} the same object, and stimuli that are far apart as two separate objects. The principle of similarity states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other {{as part of the}} same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their visual texture and resemblance. The principle of closure refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. The principle of good continuation makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. The principle of common fate groups stimuli together {{on the basis of their}} movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured. The principle of good form refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, color, etc. Later research has identified additional grouping principles.|$|E

In Turkish Private International Law, flexibility seems finding itself a broad place in contractual obligations with the entry into force of the new Turkish Law on Private International Law and International Civil Procedure (Milletlerarası Özel Hukuk ve Usul Hukuku Hakkında Kanun –MÖHUK).

50|$|The Salic law, {{practiced in}} France {{and in the}} Italian territories of the House of Savoy, stipulated that only men could inherit the crown. In most fiefs, {{in the event of}} the demise of all {{legitimate}} male members of the patrilineage, a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law). In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, jure uxoris. Spain today continues this model of succession law, in the form of cognatic primogeniture. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> and primogeniture battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.|$|R

It is seen as defining the questions to solve and the solutions required in every conceivable area of state intervention. Yet the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> is hardly anything new. Throughout history it has been rediscovered time and again, for the distance between governors and governed is essentially what characterizes political regimes (totalitarianism being the extreme form of overwhelming proximity). Nevertheless, over time the issues evolve and the subjects of debate change. The main issue {{is no longer the}} need for local democracy to transform a political-administrative system marked by limited debates on local issues, as it was thirty years ago; it is now the necessity for other modes of production of public policies, closer to the inhabitants of the territories concerned, with a view to increasing the effectiveness and transparency, and consequently the legitimacy, of public policies. That is why the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> is currently so successful. It encompasses everything from social action to security, health, transport, urban planning, consumption etc., as well as more recent and emblematic topics such as sustainable development or the social and solidarity economy. Since pragmatic solutions and transparent results have become the golden rules for good public management, the dominant discourse is the same everywhere: act in proximity...|$|E
