40|$|Background World Health Organization and EU hand hygiene {{guidelines}} {{state that}} if electric hand dryers are used, {{they should not}} aerosolize pathogens. Previous studies have investigated the dispersal by different hand-drying devices of chemical indicators, fungi and bacteria on the hands. This study assessed the aerosolization and dispersal of virus on the hands to determine any differences between hand-drying devices in their potential to contaminate other occupants of public washrooms and the washroom environment. Methods A suspension of MS 2, an Escherichia coli bacteriophage virus, was used to artificially contaminate the hands of participants prior to using three different hand-drying devices: jet air dryer, warm air dryer, <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> <b>dispenser.</b> Virus was detected by plaque formation on agar plates layered with the host bacterium. Vertical dispersal of virus was assessed at a fixed distance (0. 4 m) and over a range of different heights (0. 0 – 1. 8 m) from the floor. Horizontal dispersal was assessed at different distances of up to three metres from the hand-drying devices. Virus aerosolization and dispersal was also assessed at different times up to 15 minutes after use by means of air sampling at two distances (0. 1 and 1. 0 m) and at a distance behind and offset {{from each of the}} hand-drying devices. Results Over a range of heights, the jet air dryer was shown to produce over 60 times greater vertical dispersal of virus from the hands than a warm air dryer and over 1300 times greater than paper towels; the maximum being detected between 0. 6 and 1. 2 metres from the floor. Horizontal dispersal of virus by the jet air dryer was over 20 times greater than a warm air dryer and over 190 times greater than paper towels; virus being detected at distances of up to three metres. Air sampling at three different positions from the hand-drying devices 15 minutes after use showed that the jet air dryer produced over 50 -times greater viral contamination of the air than a warm air dryer and over 110 -times greater than paper towels. Conclusions Due to their high air speed, jet air dryers aerosolize and disperse more virus over a range of heights, greater distances, and for longer times than other hand drying devices. If hands are inadequately washed, they have a greater potential to contaminate other occupants of a public washroom and the washroom environment. Main messages: Jet air dryers with claimed air speeds of over 600 kph have a greater potential than warm air dryers or paper towels to aerosolize and disperse viruses on the hands of users. The choice of hand-drying device should be carefully considered. Jet air dryers may increase the risk of transmission of human viruses, such as norovirus, particularly if hand washing is inadequate...|$|E

40|$|A problem {{exists that}} many {{eco-friendly}} {{products on the}} market today are not widely accepted by consumers. Three pilot experiments were conducted to examine a few causes of poor eco-friendly product acceptance. The first two experiments involved the testing of alternative products to disposable plastic water bottles. Two hypotheses were developed- the attitude hypothesis and the user activity hypothesis. The attitude hypothesis states that a person with a positive environmental attitude will lead to better eco-friendly product recommendation and rating, greater product uses, and a greater chance of continued use. The user activity hypothesis states that a product with difficult set-up or cleaning will lead to a worse product recommendation and rating, fewer product uses, and a smaller chance of continued use. Participants took home a product to test for one week and then returned to complete two surveys- a demographics survey and a product evaluation survey. These surveys measured variables such as environmental attitude, product recommendation and rating, number of uses, continued use, and many others. The results of the experiments show a relation between environmental attitude and the participants? future usage with the eco-friendly product. In addition, the data shows that difficulty of product set-up and cleaning relate to the users? opinion of the product. Since this methodology of testing has not been documented before, the lessons learned from these pilot experiments will help to develop a framework for product testing with human ubjects. The third pilot experiment tests the design method of defaults, which may be a powerful tool when designing eco-friendly products. The theory behind the default option is that people typically choose the default setting on a product, regardless if it is the best option. This theory was tested with the use of automatic <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> <b>dispensers.</b> The lengths of the <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> that the machines dispensed were changed periodically and the <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> usage was measured. The results from this experiment indicate that users obey the rule of defaults, unless their needs are not being met at an extreme level...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis project {{started in}} September 2007 {{and has been}} {{performed}} {{in cooperation with the}} AFH (Away From Home) Tissue area of SCA (Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget) in Gothenburg. SCA is a global consumer goods and paper company. SCA works in four business areas: personal care, tissue, packaging and forest products. The brand for SCA:s products on the AFH Tissue market is Tork. The objective was to develop a concept for public washrooms that is more environmentally friendly than the present one. The whole concept consisting of dispensers combined with refill, such as paper and soap, was going to express environmental friendliness. One dispenser would be presented as a prototype. In the research phase a benchmarking was performed to look closer into the dispensing systems on the market and to discover new eco-trends. Theoretical information that could be useful to the project was gathered. This material contained information regarding sustainable designing methods, materials and recycling. To find the needs of customers and users several interviews and focus groups were performed in Sweden, United Kingdom and Germany. These meetings included questions regarding both eco- friendliness and dispensing system. In the interviews it emerged that customers think that recycling of materials is more interesting than biodegradable materials {{and that there is a}} need for dispensers which fit into different surroundings. An important thing from the focus groups is that the perceived eco-friendliness is almost the opposite of the perceived quality for <b>paper</b> hand <b>towels.</b> Another important thing, found both among customers and users, is that there is a need for information regarding how a washroom is eco-friendly. Five concepts were generated based on the research. After comparison one of the concepts went through to the detail design phase. The base in this concept is easiness of recycling and possibility to change the look of the dispensers by replacing their sliding fronts. To eliminate the waste from bin liners the waste bin works with a foldable insert. Finally two prototypes of the <b>paper</b> hand <b>towel</b> <b>dispenser</b> were produced. Both dispensers work with sliding acrylic fronts. A print was placed on the inside of the fronts to increase the feeling of eco-friendliness. One of the chassis was made in stainless steel and the other in birch. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Le, A J Macnab Objective—To {{investigate}} a local “epi-demic ” of incidents of strangulation by hanging from continuous cloth <b>towels</b> in <b>dispensers.</b> Method—The coroner’s oYce in all prov-inces and territories were contacted. Five cases of hanging from continuous cloth towels in Canadian schools {{were identified and}} reviewed. Results—There were four deaths, and one near-death, all males age 7 to 12. Two cases were attributed to a “choking game” that provides a sensation (impending loss of consciousness) described as “cool”. In three cases, the child was alone at the time. All deaths were due to strangulation from hanging and all occurred in school washrooms. One child (playing with two friends) recovered after admission to an intensive care unit. <b>Towel</b> <b>dispensers</b> {{were removed from the}} two index schools. In one province the Ministry of Education encouraged re-moval of <b>towel</b> <b>dispensers</b> from all schools and education of students of the dangers of “choking games”. Conclusions—Thrill seeking from partial asphyxiation appears to underlie these incidents. Awareness of such cases should prompt appropriate education strategies to highlight the serious consequences of this form of risk taking behavior in young males. In Canada, these incidents have resulted in changes in the design of, and legislation regarding, cloth towel dispens-ers...|$|R
