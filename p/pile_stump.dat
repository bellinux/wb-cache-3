Pine weevils are attracted by the smell of fresh stumps in clear-cut areas, and have been shown to cause serious damage to planted coniferous seedlings in European forests. This study was conducted to measure the incidence of pine weevil and damage caused to Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings in a field experiment including single stump pile plots (SSP), multiple stump pile plots (MSP) and control plots in North Karelia, Finland. Pine weevils were significantly more abundant in MSP stump plots (22 % higher) than in SSP plots, and are 23 % more abundant compared to the control plots. The extent of seedling damage was significantly lower in the SSP (by 67 %) and MSP plots (by 58 %) than in the controls. Seedlings damage increased significantly with the distance from the stump <b>pile.</b> <b>Stump</b> harvesting practices should be updated and, in particular, multiple stump piles should be avoided in the clearcut area. However, future studies will be required to explore the environmental and physical factors in the stump-removal area influencing pine weevil abundance...|$|E

40|$|Even though {{stumpwood}} {{may become}} {{a significant part of}} the future fuel mix for combined heat and power plants in Sweden, the harvesting of stumps after regeneration felling is still only performed on a trial basis. Results from time studies on two, 23 tonne, excavators fitted for stump lifting, together with follow-up data on stump lifting and forwarding, are presented. Lifting, splitting, and <b>piling</b> the <b>stumps</b> accounted for 17, 32, and 32 %, respectively, of the total productive work time. A predictive model was developed to estimate operational times and productivities when lifting pine and spruce stumps. Stump diameter, species, and terrain conditions contributed significantly to the fit of the model. The model predicts that productivity of stump lifting in spruce sites with easy terrain conditions and average stump diameters of 20 and 40 cm will be 1. 23 and 4. 19 oven-dry tonnes (ODT) per productive work hour, respectively. This is 43 % higher than in pine sites with difficult terrain conditions and the same diameters. In the follow-up data, the productivity in stump lifting varied from 1. 5 to 2. 9 ODT per productive work hour while the cost for lifting and extraction to roadside varied from 37. 8 to 59. 4 €/ODT...|$|R
60|$|The {{effect of}} the {{different}} causes we have here given was to dot the region described, though at long intervals, with spots of a semi- civilized appearance, {{in the midst of}} the vast--nay, almost boundless-- expanse of forest. Some of these early settlements had made considerable advances towards finish and comfort, ere the war of '76 drove their occupants to seek protection against the inroads of the savages; and long after the influx of immigration which succeeded the peace, the fruits, the meadows, and the tilled fields of these oases in the desert, rendered them conspicuous amidst the blackened <b>stumps,</b> <b>piled</b> logs, and smooty fallows of an active and bustling settlement. At even a much later day, they were to be distinguished by the smoother surfaces of their fields, the greater growth and more bountiful yield of their orchards, and by the general appearance of a more finished civilization, and of greater age. Here and there, a hamlet had sprung up; and isolated places, like Cherry Valley and Wyoming, were found, that have since become known to the general history of the country.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of tree stump extraction on the diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce Picea abies roots. I tested if the density of saproxylic beetles was {{the same in the}} interior layer of the <b>stump</b> storage <b>piles</b> as in the exterior layer. I also tested if the beetle density was as high or higher in piles as in remaining stumps at extraction clear-cuts and to test if they could be ecological traps. I tested if species at higher trophic level as well as red-listed species could be impacted negatively by stump extraction. A total of 110 root wood samples were collected from 6 clear-cuts and 6 extraction clear-cuts and 4 different piles in central Sweden near Uppsala, Lindesberg and Fågelfors. The clear-cuts were dominated by Norway spruce and were sampled 1 to 2 years after clear felling. Norway spruce is the most common tree species used in tree stump extraction. Insect were reared from the sampled roots in rearing boxes for 8 weeks. Insects were also sampled after the rearing box period by pealing the bark of the roots and putting the bark in Tullgren-funnels to sample the last insects inside the bark. The sampled Coleoptera were determined to species level. A total of 1379 beetles of 35 species were collected from the roots. Higher species richness was found inside the piles (PIN) than {{on the outside of the}} piles (POUT). Hardly any difference was found between the clear-cut (C) and extraction clear-cut (EC) in species-richness per root-sample, but a significant difference was found between the pile habitats. Common saproxylic species, like Dryocetes autographus and Hylastes cunicularius, showed increased abundance in C and EC but a decrease in the storage piles. The pest species Pityogenes chalcographus was only reared in PIN. Predatory species higher up in the trophic levels, like the staphylinid Nudobius lentus, were found in low abundance in C, EC and in POUT but not in PIN. This could mean that the piles can be an ecological trap to species at higher trophic levels as well as for some pest species. The results of this study indicates that tree stump extraction can cause a lower diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce roots and a decreased species richness if the <b>stump</b> <b>piles</b> constitutes an ecological trap. As a consequence, this can decrease the diversity and species richness in the surrounding area...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{witness to}} events of a less {{peaceful}} character. One day when I {{went out to}} my wood-pile, or rather my <b>pile</b> of <b>stumps,</b> I observed two large ants, the one red, the other much larger, nearly half an inch long, and black, fiercely contending with one another. Having once got hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the chips incessantly. Looking farther, I {{was surprised to find}} that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a duellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black. The legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my wood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying, both red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed, the only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging; internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and the black imperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged in deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast locked in each other's embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the chips, now at noonday prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life went out. The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversary's front, and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root, having already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of several of his members. They fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs. Neither manifested the least disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry was [...] "Conquer or die." [...] In the meanwhile there came along a single red ant on the hillside of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle; probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it. Or perchance he was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this unequal combat from afar--for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red--he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so there were three united for life, as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame. I should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their national airs the while, to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants. I was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the difference. And certainly there is not the fight recorded in Concord history, at least, if in the history of America, that will bear a moment's comparison with this, whether for the numbers engaged in it, or for the patriotism and heroism displayed. For numbers and for carnage it was an Austerlitz or Dresden. Concord Fight! Two killed on the patriots' side, and Luther Blanchard wounded! Why here every ant was a Buttrick--"Fire! for God's sake fire!"--and thousands shared the fate of Davis and Hosmer. There was not one hireling there. I have no doubt that it was a principle they fought for, as much as our ancestors, and not to avoid a three-penny tax on their tea; and the results of this battle will be as important and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the battle of Bunker Hill, at least.|$|R
