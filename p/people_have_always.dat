5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{been able to}} pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E
5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic {{perspective of the}} socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of Indus Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E
25|$|As for the Chinese, I {{have the}} highest opinion {{not only of the}} Chinese character, but of the Chinese fitness for self-government. I think they are eminently fitted to make a {{republic}} successful. China, for instance, is infinitely better fitted than is Russia for development along republican lines. In fact, China has always been practically a republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, but the political unit of China has always been the village. The village <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> had their influence upon the Government. What is more, the average Chinaman is intelligent.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of baking Easter breads, {{also known as}} hot cross buns, have been documented to exist {{at least since the}} 1500s. Two cross-marked buns have also been found in the Roman city of Herculaneum in modern-day Italy dating back as early as 79 CE.

Speaking to Digital Spy, Batley said Sarah and Zoe always been close. Zoe is the best friend she has ever had because in her life <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> let her down, whereas Zoe has been [...] "her rock"; despite their fall outs. Batley felt this to be the reason why they share a mutual friendly love for one another. In comparison, Sarah's feeling intensified and Batley commented: [...] "For Sarah it's something more - she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." [...] Whilst filming the raunchy scenes, there was a nervous atmosphere on set.|$|E

Ortved said, [...] "While the Simpsons <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> claimed evenhandedness in their satire, the show is, after all, hardly right-leaning, {{and it is}} hard to miss how gleefully the former President is mocked here." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, wrote: [...] "Very strange, this episode takes The Simpsons into a whole new dimension of political satire. The lampooning of a single public figure is a startling move. Works much better for Americans, we're told." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1976, {{speaking}} as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and [...] "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that {{expressed support for}} fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: [...] "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." [...] He was also quoted as saying: [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of the}} first rock stars" [...] and [...] "You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up." [...] Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: [...] "I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed." ...|$|E
500|$|Cuba's burgeoning tourist {{industry}} {{of the late}} 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, [...] "In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's {{as if you were}} to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner." [...] The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> performed them in the street. Despite the appeal of the [...] "Buena Vista" [...] ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the [...] "Buena Vista Social Club" [...] than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island, such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos, the creator of the genre. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.|$|E

2500|$|As Japan is {{an island}} nation {{surrounded}} by an ocean, its <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{taken advantage of the}} abundant seafood supply.

The eating of [...] was spoken of as taboo, unclean or something to be avoided by personal choice through the Edo period. The consumption of whale and terrapin meat were not forbidden under this definition. Despite this, the consumption of red meat did not completely disappear in Japan.

The news filled them with a sense of ecstasy and excitement. The team was flown to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, in March 1984, and from there the team moved onwards. Recalling her first glimpse of the Mount Everest, Bachendri once reminisced: [...] "We the hill <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> worshiped the mountains…my overpowering emotion at this awe-inspiring spectacle was, therefore, devotional". The team commenced its ascent in May 1984. Her team almost met disaster when an avalanche buried its camp, and more than half the group abandoned the ascent because of injury or fatigue. Bachendri Pal and the remainder of the team pressed on to reach the summit. Bachendri Pal recalls this accident: [...] "I was sleeping in one of the tents with my teammates at Camp III at an altitude of [...] On the night of 15–16 May 1984, at around 00:30hours IST, I was jolted awake; something had hit me hard; I also heard a deafening sound and soon after I found myself being enveloped within a very cold mass of material".|$|E
