40|$|Felony disfranchisement is the {{practice}} of denying <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>felony</b> convictions the right to vote. The American tradition of states determining their own election laws {{has led to a}} national patchwork of policies and practices that result in de jure and de facto denial of the vote based on felony conviction status Currently, most states impose some voting restrictions on <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>felony</b> convictions, ranging from a prohibition from voting while incarcerated to a virtual lifetime ban. In 2004, these laws were responsible for directly denying 5. 3 million Americans their right to vote, with millions more disfranchised due to a variety of procedures that leave even eligible voters misinformed about their voting rights. No other Western democracy disfranchises so many of its citizens. Furthermore, the United States is the only democracy in the world that takes the vote away from citizens who have completed their sentences. Compounding the problem, state corrections authorities and elections officials rarely advise <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>felony</b> convictions about their voting rights, and when they do, they often distribute unclear and inaccurate information. As the November 2006 election approaches, with so many known problems and new concerns about the health of our election system, this is a pivotal time to examine the state of our democracy...|$|R

40|$|In this article-based dissertation, I {{investigate}} how Black women navigate the everyday challenges {{that emerge from}} state surveillance and criminalization after incarceration. I use 18 months of ethnographic observations and participatory-action methods to {{investigate how}} Black women navigate their everyday lives after prison or jail. This project reveals what carceral ideologies and practices often conceal: the intersectional lives of women whose experiences are mediated through {{the criminal justice system}} and the urban spaces they reenter after months or years behind bars. Through the everyday lives of formerly incarcerated Black women, I illustrate how reentry institutions mobilize ideologies about the criminally deviant Black female subject to justify invasive practices of surveillance and punishment. I capture how the criminal rehabilitation of formerly incarcerated Black women is framed as a moral imperative to achieve independence from the state, yet at the same time, punitive state practices—like finding women in violation of post-release supervision requirements for failing to acquire full-time employment within months of release, despite employment discrimination experienced by <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>felony</b> histories— tie these women to the state in perpetuity. Across articles on mothering, the labor market, and citizenship, I demonstrate how reentry institutions produce carceral crises across the dimensions of formerly incarcerated Black women’s lives. I also reveal how these women resist state intrusions and frame their navigation of carcerality as evidence of Black female ingenuity and strength...|$|R
