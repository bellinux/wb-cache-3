50|$|In late 1943, Pyke {{submitted}} to Mountbatten a memorandum, nearly fifty pages long, explaining his ideas {{for a solution}} to the problem of unloading stores from ships where no proper port facilities are available and few roads inland. This circumstance was common in the Pacific war theatre and fundamental to the 1943 decision to invade France by landing on the beaches of Normandy, with no harbours and a 24-foot tide. Pyke's idea was to use pipes of the type that were used to transport fuel from ship to shore, to move sealed containers that would contain any type of sufficiently small material objects. Pyke suggested that 4 or 6 in pipes would handle smaller equipment and larger objects could be passed through two-foot pipes. Furthermore, there was no reason why the pipes should stop at the shore, they could be extended inland as required. Bernal gave a cautious endorsement to the idea, adding that it would require a great deal of investigation. Pyke's idea was similar to the cleaning brushes that are sometimes forced along pipes by the pressure of the fluid and to the <b>pipeline</b> <b>pigs</b> which today are used for cleaning and telemetry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Pipeline {{infrastructures}} normally represent {{high cost}} of investment and the pipeline must be free from risks that could cause environmental hazard and potential threats to personnel safety. Pipeline integrity such monitoring and management become very crucial to provide unimpeded transportation and avoiding unnecessary production deferment. Thus proper cleaning and inspection {{is the key to}} safe and reliable pipeline operation and {{plays an important role in}} pipeline integrity management program and has become a standard industry procedure. In view of this, understanding the motion (dynamic behavior), prediction and control of the PIG speed is important in executing pigging operation as it offers significant benefits, such as estimating PIG arrival time at receiving station, planning for suitable pigging operation, and improves efficiency of pigging tasks. The objective of this paper is to review recent developments in speed control system of <b>pipeline</b> <b>PIGs.</b> The review carried out would serve as an industrial application in a form of quick reference of recent developments in pipeline PIG speed control system, and further initiate others to add-in/update the list in the future leading to knowledge based data, and would attract active interest of others to share their view points...|$|E

Intensive {{study on}} flowing properties of two-phase fluid {{of gas and}} liquid during <b>pipeline</b> <b>pigging</b> helps to improve the safety operation of rich gas pipeline. Therefore, based on the multiphase fluid transient simulation software, a two-fluid model is employed to study the flowing regulation of gas and liquid in practical operation of natural gas pipeline pigging，especially the change rule of velocity，flow pattern, pressure, liquid holdup ratio, and liquid slug in the passing ball process. The results reveal that three flow patterns appeared in <b>pipeline</b> <b>pigging.</b> They are stratified flow, slug flow and bubble flow. The place where the particular flow pattern appears {{is related to the}} terrain. The biggest pressure is found at the entrance, then pressure comes down along the pipeline, and fluctuate according to the fluid amount and terrain; the transient velocity of pig is coherent with the terrain and liquid holdup ratio; small slug flows are easy to gather and form into a longer one. The research can somehow guide to the safety operation of natural gas <b>pipeline</b> <b>pigging...</b>|$|R

Yet, the so-called "smart pigs" used for this purpose are expensive and delicate and the risk related to their possible blocking inside the pipeline is non-negligible, hence their deployment is rather infrequent (generally, just once in several years). In this paper, we present a new, low-cost and low-risk foam pig with inspection capabilities similar to those of a multi-channel caliper pig (i. e. able to detect, locate and size inner diameter changes and deformations) together with additional features that allow to detect internal roughness changes (e. g. due to corrosion) and perform some pH/salinity determinations, also useful for corrosion assessment purposes. One implementation of the new tool makes use of a foam pig "carrier", providing the required push with a good capability to surpass restrictions, equipped with specialized sensors and modules for data acquisition and storage. Another implementation, called "skeleton caliper pig" and suitable to prevent the massive displacement of condensates from gas lines, deploys the light plastic system without any foam pig carrier, pushed by the gas velocity alone.

40|$|Water {{injection}} {{or water}} flooding {{is widely used}} as a secondary recovery method to increase the production of oil usually from mature oil wells. It requires the injection of water into the reservoir, typically using carbon steel pipelines. Their corrosion is a major issue for {{the oil and gas}} industry, involving high costs of periodic chemical treatment, including biocides, oxygen scavengers, corrosion and scale inhibitors, and <b>pipeline</b> <b>pigging.</b> There is also the high potential cost of premature failure of the pipelines relative to life-time predictions, and the associated potential for unpredicted costs and major environmental implications should the pipeline fail. The present paper presents a review of a pilot study supported by the oil industry and the European Community that aimed to improve understanding of the corrosion behaviour of these pipelines. It draws on data and observations for the long-term corrosion, water quality, intelligent pigging records and microbiological testing {{to gain a better understanding}} why some pipelines suffer mild corrosion yet others, apparently similar, are prone to highly aggressive channelling corrosion. Herein the documented experience of several pipelines is reviewed. Observation data taken into consideration include pigging operation information, composition of corrosion products and their amount, corrosion rates and pipe geometry, identified biological consortia, water chemistry and process parameters. Also, the distribution of corrosion along the pipeline as well as the localization of corrosion attack is noted.

40|$|A pig is a {{maintenance}} tool {{used in the}} Oil and Gas Industry, chiefly to remove solids or liquids from pipelines. It is in essence a sliding seal, which moves due to {{the action of the}} fluid pushing it. The aim of this work is to describe the steady state motion of the <b>pipeline</b> <b>pig</b> in terms of several key characteristics. An analytical model of the pig motion has bey prepared to calculate these parameters. The model also shows how these characteristics vary with velocity and distance due to wear. All assumptions and limitations are listed. The model has been verified by tests performed on a 10 " carbon steel pipeline. The model works by f rstly calculating the force exerted by the pig seal on the pipe wall. A generalisation of the seal shape allows calculation of the contact parameters. A simplified lubrication analysis ensues, enabling calculation of the seal film profile. Knowledge of film thickness allows estimation of friction, differential pressure and leakage rates. Varying pig velocity affects the film shape and thickness, which in turn affects seal friction and therefore alters the program output. Changes in pig characteristics due to abrasive wear are accounted for using a wear coefficient and estimating the volume of material removed over successive distance increments. The model compares well with the experimental remits for characteristics such as differential pressure and friction For this reason the wall force, contact and surface roughness models (i. e. the mechanical We of the problem) are considered to be accurate. However, agreement between leakage test results and the model was less well defined and it is apparent that the hydrodynamic analysis requires further study...|$|R

The load condition is obtained applying the probabilistic transformation method (PTM) and the resistance condition is obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. Using inspection data collected on a gas <b>pipeline</b> segment <b>pigged</b> two times, results of the suggested methodology are compared with those obtained by a classical approach based on a Gaussian distribution.

40|$|<b>Pipeline</b> <b>pigging</b> enhances {{flow rate}} and {{corrosion}} control. Pigging {{is made possible}} by the sealing element of the pig, of which polyurethane is the chief material used. Polyurethane raw materials are; polyols, isocyanates, water, methylene chloride, catalyst, chain extenders, colourants, air and additives. These raw materials are combined on 'systems' rather than a straight-forward formula, and are formulated to achieve predetermined properties in order to suit end applications. The main aim of this thesis is to develop a deeper understanding of keeping pipeline as much as possible to the as-built condition, as efficient and predictable seal discs facilitate safe and efficient pigging. Keeping maximum continuous flow reduces cost and also increase the life span of the pipeline. This is achieved by the understanding precisely shore grade 65, 75 and 85 used for pigging operations. The structure of this thesis is divided into four parts. The first part involves the determination of the material properties of shore grade 65, 75 and 85 at temperatures of 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C. The material properties of shore grade 65, 75 and 85 are achieved from the stress-strain curve of the polyurethane at the different temperature using tensile test machine. Shore grades are heat treated to the required temperature of minimum of 12 hours in an oven or refrigerator before the tensile test. The second part of the thesis is using the stress - strain data as an input into finite element material database, hence finite element model of the seal discs geometry is created to determine resulting deflection, static reacting forces on the wall. This was achieved by the application of step incremental displacement on the pig discs into the 8 ’’ pipeline in order to generate the static behavior of pig of shore grade 65, 75, & 85 at different temperature. The third part of the thesis involves the use of stress-strain data to perform transient dynamic analysis of seal discs with shore grade 65, 75 and 85 at 20 °C. This is to determine resulting deflection, and “kinetic reacting forces on the wall”. This was achieved by the application of differential pressure on the pig so as to drive it into the 8 ’’ pipeline in order to generate the dynamic behavior of pig (shore 65, 75, & 85) at 20 °C.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of paraffin wax solids in pipelines and risers represents a continuing challenge to flow assurance in offshore installations. Wax deposits reduce product throughput, requiring increased energy expenditure to re-establish flow levels. In severe cases, wax deposits can completely block a pipeline. Preventative {{solutions to the}} problem such as pipeline insulation, active heating of pipes or chemical dosing with wax inhibitors are not always economically viable, so mechanical removal using a device known as a 'pig' remains an economical {{solution to the problem of}} wax removal. A pig is a cylindrical tool that is driven through the pipe by the flow of product, scraping deposits from the pipe wall as it travels. Despite the importance of <b>pipeline</b> <b>pigging</b> to the oil and gas industry, the effectiveness of pigs in removing wax is poorly understood and it is this problem that is addressed by this thesis. One of the first necessities in undertaking this work has been to define the mechanical properties of wax deposits. This has required critical analysis of published material on the subject of wax deposition along with practical experimentation to create representative models of wax deposits that require mechanical removal from pipelines. Previously, studies of wax removal using pigs have assumed the mechanics of the process to be adequately represented by uniaxial compression or simple shear load models. In this work wax removal is analysed using the orthogonal cutting model. This provides a more accurate description of the process as it includes the effect of material after yielding (the chip) on the net wax removal force. Experiments were designed to allow testing of the validity of the orthogonal cutting theory to the pigging process under a variety of conditions. An original contribution from this work is through experimental and theoretical results that are given context through comparison with established metal cutting theory. Through experimentation a specific cutting energy is obtained for wax removal. The results of the wax cutting experiments have identified particular differences between wax cutting and metal cutting regarding the homogeneity of chip formation. These observations have important implications in predicting wax removal forces using mechanical removal tools. Although the affect of removed wax chips on pigging forces has been neglected in theory, it is well known in practice. The fluid used to drive cleaning pigs is often used to produce a jet radiating centrally from the front of the pig intended to blast wax chips away from the pig body, avoiding formation of a 'plug' of wax ahead of the pig. In this study a novel variation of this process in the form of an annular bypass jet is experimentally studied. A semi-empirical model of wax removal using an annular bypass jet has been developed and empirical constants obtained to allow prediction of removal rates for different waxes under various conditions. The new model introduced here allows balancing of pig velocity with wax removal velocity so that a non-contacting wax removal system is obtainable. The bypass-jetting model has been validated using a full-scale trial of the process by industrial sponsors. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
