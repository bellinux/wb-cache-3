40|$|In this {{document}} we present an investigation on automatically generating levels for platform videogames. Common approaches for this problem are rhythm based, where input patterns are transformed in a valid geometry, and chunk based, where samples are humanly created and automatically assembled like a puzzle. The <b>proposal</b> <b>hereby</b> <b>presented</b> {{is to explore}} this challenge with the usage of Genetic Algorithms, facing it as a search problem, {{in order to achieve}} higher expressivity and less linearity than in rhythm based approach and without requiring human creation as it happens with the chunk based approach. With simple heuristics the system is able to generate playable levels in a small amount of time (one level is created in less than a minute) and with considerable diversity, as our results show...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the cultural dimension of foreign language education, and teachers today are expected to promote the acquisition of intercultural competence in their learners. The present study aims to investigate the role of culture in the teaching of foreign languages and particularly the interrelationship of language and culture in the process of learning/teaching English as a foreign language in an increasingly multicultural society like that of the Canary Islands, Spain. It also proposes to delve into the opinions and attitudes of secondary school Spanish teachers of English and their pupils on intercultural competence and to see how and to what extent these opinions and attitudes are reflected in their classroom applications. In order to give the most complete vision possible of this intercultural approach, of its use in the classroom, of its precedents, of its current situation and of the methodological <b>proposals,</b> we <b>hereby</b> <b>present</b> the way we have drawn up two questionnaires in a parallel way to investigate how both students and EFL teachers in upper secondary education in the Canary Islands perceive the importance of the intercultural component in the language class...|$|R

40|$|The work <b>hereby</b> <b>presented</b> {{is part of}} {{a project}} {{currently}} underway at the Energy Technology section, TU Delft, aimed at the experimental proof of nonclassical gasdynamic effects in BZT fluids. One of the ideas under scrutiny is to employ a recently developed experimental technique to generate and visualize spherical compression waves in a BZT gas. Flow simulations were performed to evaluate the potential of using this experimental arrangement to investigate the formation and propagation of nonclassical waves. Results of D 6 (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane) flow field computations generated by point explosions are <b>hereby</b> <b>presented</b> and show that the spreading of the nonclassical compression can be hardly detected by means of optical measurements. An alternative experimental technique, i. e. total pressure measurements at different locations, is briefly discussed...|$|R
