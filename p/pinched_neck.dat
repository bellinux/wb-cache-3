40|$|Dry etching {{of silicon}} is an {{important}} process in the manufacturing of integrated circuits and micromachined devices. Traditionally, the etch rate limiting step for an isotropic silicon etching process {{is considered to be}} the arrival of fluorine atoms directly from the gas phase onto the silicon surface, and the mechanism to promote anisotropy is the prevention of lateral etching by the formation of an inhibiting layer on the vertical walls. Furthermore, isotropic dry etching is considered to etch features {{in the same way as}} isotropic wet etching. Conventional mechanisms cannot explain, however, the perfect anisotropic etching of silicon with pure SF 6, when no polymer is formed. Neither can it be understood how a deep (> 50 µm), isotropic, dry etching process applied to silicon can result in structures with a <b>pinched</b> <b>neck</b> and sharp ridges, in contrast with a wet etching process, where the corners are rounded and no pinching of the neck is observed. It is proposed that long-range diffusion of fluorine atoms can precede the eventual binding to a silicon atom. The rate of binding increases if the silicon is bombarded with high energy ions. Tests were performed to corroborate this model which is also consistent with the findings of others...|$|E

40|$|A {{new regime}} of droplet {{ejection}} following the slow deposition of drops onto a near-complete wetting solid substrate is identified in experiments and direct numerical simulations; a coalescence cascade subsequent to pinch-off is also observed {{for the first}} time. Results of numerical simulations indicate that the propagation of capillary waves that lead to pinch-off {{is closely related to}} the self-similar behaviour observed in the inviscid recoil of droplets, and that motions of the crests and troughs of capillary waves along the interface do not depend on the wettability and surface tension (or Ohnesorge number). The simulations also show that a self-similar theory for universal pinch-off can be used for the time evolution of the <b>pinching</b> <b>neck.</b> However, although good agreement is also found with the double-cone shape of the <b>pinching</b> <b>neck</b> for droplet ejection in drop deposition on a pool of the same liquid, substantial deviations are observed in such a comparison for droplet ejection in rapid drop spreading (including the newly identified regime). This deviation is shown to result from interference by the solid substrate, a rapid downwards acceleration of the top of the drop surface and the rapid spreading process. The experiments also confirm non-monotonic spreading behaviour observed previously only in numerical simulations, and suggest substantial inertial effects on the relation between an apparent contact angle and the dimensionless contact-line speed. © 2012 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} Type- 1 <b>neck</b> <b>pinch</b> {{singularity}} in simplicial Ricci flow (SRF) for an axisymmetric piecewise flat 3 -dimensional geometry with 3 -sphere topology. SRF was recently introduced as an unstructured mesh formulation of Hamilton's Ricci flow (RF). It describes the RF of a piecewise-flat simplicial geometry. In this paper, we apply the SRF equations to a representative double-lobed axisymmetric piecewise flat geometry with mirror symmetry {{at the neck}} similar to the geometry studied by Angenent and Knopf (A-K). We choose a specific radial profile and compare the SRF equations with the corresponding finite-difference solution of the continuum A-K RF equations. The piecewise-flat 3 -geometries considered here are built of isosceles-triangle-based frustum blocks. The axial symmetry of this model allows us to use frustum blocks instead of tetrahedra. The 2 -sphere cross-sectional geometries in our model are regular icosahedra. We demonstrate that, under a suitably-pinched initial geometry, the SRF equations for this relatively low-resolution discrete geometry yield the canonical Type- 1 <b>neck</b> <b>pinch</b> singularity found in the corresponding continuum solution. We adaptively remesh during the evolution to keep the circumcentric dual lattice well-centered. Without such remeshing, we cannot evolve the discrete geometry to <b>neck</b> <b>pinch.</b> We conclude {{with a discussion of}} future generalizations and tests of this SRF model.

40|$|In earlier work, {{carrying}} out numerical simulations of the Ricci flow of families of rotationally symmetric geometries on $S 3 $, {{we have found}} {{strong support for the}} contention that (at least in the rotationally symmetric case) the Ricci flow for a ``critical'' initial geometry - one which is at the transition point between initial geometries (on $S^ 3 $) whose volume-normalized Ricci flows develop a singular <b>neck</b> <b>pinch,</b> and other initial geometries whose volume normalized Ricci flows converge to a round sphere - evolves into a ``degenerate <b>neck</b> <b>pinch.</b> '' That is, we have seen in this earlier work that the Ricci flows for the critical geometries become locally cylindrical in a neighborhood of the initial pinching, and have the maximum amount of curvature at {{one or both of the}} poles.

Loosely speaking, our results justify the naive picture of mean curvature flow where the only singularities are <b>neck</b> <b>pinches,</b> and components which collapse to asymptotically round spheres. In this note we announce results on the mean curvature flow of mean convex sets; all the statements below have natural generalizations to the setting of Riemannian 3 -manifolds, but {{for the sake of}} simplicity we will primarily discuss subsets of R 3 here. Loosely speaking, our results justify the naive picture of mean curvature flow where the only singularities are <b>neck</b> <b>pinches,</b> and components which collapse to asymptotically round spheres. Recall that a one-parameter family of smooth hypersurfaces {Mt} ⊂ R n+ 1 flows by mean curvature if (1) zt = H(z) = ∆Mtz, where z = (z 1, [...] .,zn+ 1) are coordinates on Rn+ 1 and H = −Hn is the mean curvature vector. The papers [ES 91] and [CGG 91] defined a level set flow for any closed subset K of Rn. This is a 1 -parameter family of closed sets Kt ⊂ Rn with K 0 = K (when K is a domain bounded by a smooth compact hypersurface then the evolution of ∂K for a short time interval coincides with the classical mean curvature evolution). Following [Whi 00], we say that a compact subset K ⊂ Rn is mean convex if Kt ⊂ Int(K) for all t> 0. In this case there is also an associated Brakke flow M: t ↦ → Mt of rectifiable varifolds [Bra 78, Ilm 94, Whi 00], and the pair (M, K), where K: = ⋃ Kt × {t} ⊂ R n × R t≥ 0 is called a mean-convex flow, [Whi 03]. The fundamental papers [Whi 00, Whi 03] developed a far-reaching partial regularity theory for mean curvature flow of mean convex subsets of R n. Our results build on [Whi 00, Whi 03], giving finer understanding of the singularities in the 3 -dimensional case.

More recently, this system of discrete Ricci flow (DRF) equations was further simplified by explicitly constructing the Forman-Ricci tensor associated to each edge, thereby diagonalizing the first-order differential operator and avoiding the need to invert large sparse matrices at each time step. We recently showed analytically and numerically that these equations converge for axisymmetric 3 -geometries to the corresponding continuum RF equations. We demonstrate here that these DRF equations yield an explicit numerical realization of Thurston's geometrization procedure for a discrete 3 D axially-symmetric neckpinch geometry by using surgery to explicitly integrate through its Type- 1 <b>neck</b> <b>pinch</b> singularity. A cubic-spline-based adaptive mesh was required to complete the evolution.

Previous theories show that just before an air bubble <b>pinches</b> off, the <b>neck</b> looks like a cylinder at its very smallest point.

We find that the asymmetry is transient: the neck quickly shifts vertically to become up [...] down symmetric. Importantly, we find that the resulting symmetric singularity is a blend of the initial top and bottom sides, with a weighting factor that is tunable by adjusting the airflow through the neck.
