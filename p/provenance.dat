40|$|Summary: Shoot {{growth was}} studied in 2 to 3 year old {{seedlings}} of 56 <b>provenances</b> of black, mountain, red, and silver beech. Differences between <b>provenances</b> within species groups were smaller than differences between species. Latitudinal variations {{occurred in the}} growth of silver beech <b>provenances,</b> but the altitudinal variation in mountain beech <b>provenances</b> reported earlier for younger seedlings was found not to be significant here. Genetic differences detectable between <b>provenances</b> in younger plants may become obscured by the later influence of local environmental factors as plants mature. Temperature but not rainfall was positively correlated with the rate of shoot growth. Red and silver beech <b>provenances</b> were the most susceptible to frost and mountain beech to grass grub beetle attacks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Seedling growth {{traits of}} 24 <b>provenances</b> of Larix principis-rupprechtii were {{analyzed}} to select superior <b>provenances.</b> Variance and correlation on height, basal diameter, root length, root and stem fresh weight of 1 -year old and 2 -year old seedlings of those <b>provenances</b> were analyzed. Then correlation coefficients between these growth traits and membership value of height and basal diameter of 24 <b>provenances</b> were carried on. Results showed that variance on growth traits of 1 -year old seedlings among 24 <b>provenances</b> were only significant for height, but for basal diameter, height, root and stem fresh weight of 2 -year old seedlings.

Our observations suggest that Sidei and Daintree might be more appropriate <b>provenances</b> among those examined for the Acacia mangium tree-breeding programs in Indonesia that are aimed at improving wood quality, because these <b>provenances</b> are associated with longer initial wood fibers and narrower juvenile areas than the other <b>provenances</b> studied.|$|R

30|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of juvenile wood are poorer {{than those of}} mature wood [22 – 25]. Therefore, {{the site of the}} border between juvenile and mature wood is an important determinant of wood quality. For tree-breeding programs focused on timber or saw logs from Acacia mangium, the selection of trees with minimized juvenile wood is essential. The distance from the pith of the boundary between juvenile and mature wood differed significantly among <b>provenances</b> (P =  0.016). The Daintree and Sidei <b>provenances</b> had narrower juvenile regions than the Ellerbeck Rd. Cardwell, West of Morehead and El Arish <b>provenances.</b> Therefore, these seed <b>provenances</b> might be good candidates for Acacia mangium tree-breeding programs. By contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in terms of DBH (P =  0.733), tree height (P =  0.093), height of free bole (P =  0.932) and proportion of mature wood area (P =  0.985) among <b>provenances</b> (Tables  1, 2).|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{estimating}} genetic parameters and variability among and within <b>provenances</b> for silvicultural traits of Handroanthus vellosoi (Toledo) Mattos, in <b>provenances</b> and progenies test stands, {{located at the}} Luiz Antônio Experimental Station (São Paulo State, Brazil). The test {{was established in the}} compact family block design, with two <b>provenances</b> (allocated in the plots), six replicates and sub-linear plots of five plants, totalizing 35 progenies.

Significant differences among the <b>provenances</b> were observed only to the trait stem form. The analysis of deviance showed significant differences among progenies for the joint analysis of the <b>provenances</b> (experimental population), suggesting that the population has high genetic variation and indicating the possibility of genetic improvement by selection of the best progenies. Heritability estimates in individual and family level ranged from low to moderate (26 % for DBH, 32 % for plant height, 24 % for cylindrical volume, 27 % for form and 36 % for survival), confirming the possibility of genetic improvement by selection and that the <b>provenances</b> have potential to respond to the pressure of natural selection...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{differentiation}} among plant {{populations and}} adaptation to local environmental conditions are well documented. However, {{few studies have}} examined the potential contribution of plant antagonists, such as insect herbivores and pathogens, to the pattern of local adaptation. • Here, a reciprocal transplant experiment was set up at three sites across Europe using two common plant species, Holcus lanatus and Plantago lanceolata. The amount of damage by the main above-ground plant antagonists was measured: a rust fungus infecting Holcus and a specialist beetle feeding on Plantago, both in low-density monoculture plots and in competition with interspecific neighbours. • Strong genetic differentiation among <b>provenances</b> in the amount of damage by antagonists in both species was found. Local <b>provenances</b> of Holcus had significantly higher amounts of rust infection than foreign <b>provenances,</b> whereas local <b>provenances</b> of Plantago were significantly less damaged by the specialist beetle than the foreign <b>provenances.</b> The presence of surrounding vegetation affected the amount of damage but had little influence on the ranking of plant <b>provenances.</b> • The opposite pattern of population differentiation in resistance to local antagonists in the two species suggests that {{it will be difficult to}} predict the consequences of plant translocations for interactions with organisms of higher trophic levels...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Fuchsia (Fuchsia excorticata) {{has been}} heavily browsed and often killed by brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in many New Zealand {{indigenous}} forests, but remains healthy at some sites despite long histories of possum occupation. To determine whether fuchsia varied genetically in its palatability to possums, material from six widely dispersed stands (<b>provenances)</b> was propagated, and leaf chemistry, leaf morphology, growth rate, and palatability to captive possums was compared. Leaf specific gravity, nitrogen, and phosphorous levels in field-collected foliage varied between palatable and apparently unpalatable <b>provenances</b> of fuchsia. However, these variables, and palatability to captive possums, {{were similar in}} propagated material from all <b>provenances.</b> To test the hypothesis that selective browsing had eliminated the more palatable or susceptible genotypes at sites where possums have been present for long periods, we tested the relationship between variation within <b>provenances</b> of measured variables and length of possum occupation at each site, but no significant relationships were found. These results suggest that phenotypic or situational differences rather than genetic variation between the six <b>provenances</b> may help explain observed regional differences in fuchsia health...|$|R

On the other hand, in certain <b>provenances</b> only, through an examination of the character of the bark-tissues.

The results of trapping (table 2) and counting (see in text 3. 22.) suggest that the immunity of the Cuenca and Tamjoute <b>provenances</b> seems {{to be related to the}} impossibility for Matsucoccus to multiply to important and injurious levels on these <b>provenances.</b> The observations, on the bark, and other previous observations (CARLE 1973;Riom, 1980) suggest different hypotheses for the mechanisms which might govern these differences. - Mechanical factors, such as the structure of the bark which seems to constitue an obstacle for the settlement of the crawlers.
