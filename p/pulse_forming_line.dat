40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{dielectric}} wall accelerator (DWA) {{is a new}} accelerator concept particularly {{suited for}} short pulse ( 1 kA) [1].

The maximum gradient of this accelerator is defined by the dielectric strength of the wall dielectrics and the maximum surface flashover electric field capability of the interior vacuum interface in the acceleration region. Solid insulator materials can typically meet the 20 - 30 MV/m requirement; the interface at the vacuum wall typically cannot. High electric fields are possible with properly angled insulators. These insulators, however, are generally unipolar and are not optimum in the simplest configuration of the DWA (i. e., Fig. 1, where the electric field in the dielectric is always applied to the insulators).

40|$|The Blumlein {{generator}} {{has been}} one of the most popular pulsed-power circuits. The <b>pulse</b> <b>forming</b> <b>lines</b> are charged simultaneously, and then discharged via a single switch, such as a spark gap.

In this article, we propose a novel Blumlein circuit topology based on multiple switches. The pulsed <b>forming</b> <b>lines</b> are charged in parallel and then are synchronously commutated via multiple switches. No special synchronization trigger circuit is needed for the proposed circuit topology; this robust circuit topology is simple and very reliable.

The challenging accelerator design requirements for the IVA approach include: {ge} 12 -MeV beam energy; {approximately} 60 -ns electrical pulse width; {le} 40 -kA electron beam current; {approximately} 1 -mm diameter e-beam; four pulses on the same axis or {{as close as possible to}} that axis; and an architecture that fits within the existing building envelope.

40|$|We {{describe}} a high voltage pulser for supplying of kickers of the collider VEPP- 2000 injection system. The high voltage <b>pulse</b> is <b>formed</b> {{as a result}} of a sharp break of a high current, accumulated previously in storage elements, by means SOS-diode. <b>Pulse</b> <b>forming</b> <b>lines</b> or inductances could be used as the storage elements. The generators <b>form</b> the quasi-rectangular <b>pulses</b> on the 50 -Ohm load. We investigated the SOS-diodes characteristics in wide regime region. The generator scheme is described also. 1 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION Generators are designed for a kicker system feeding of injection electrons and positrons in the collider VEPP- 2000 in Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, SB RAS. The injection system kickers are elements of the accelerator itself and are placed together with it in a radiation-protected hall. Structurally kickers are executed as asymmetrical strip lines and operate in the matched mode on a counter traveling wave (in relation to a particles movement direction). The feeding pulse is supply to one end of a plate of the kicker; the matched load is connected to another end. Kicker's plates have length of about 1. 5 m, are placed directly in the vacuum chamber of the storage ring VEPP- 2000. The plates fasten on the ends of feed-throughs [1]. The injection system includes two kickers, and both of them are used alternatively for injection and storage of electrons and positrons. As the kickers operate in the counter traveling wave mode, at changeover from a electrons storage mode to a positrons storage mode and back it is necessary to change both polarity of the pulses, and the wave direction. Such switching is carried out operatively from a complex main control panel by electromechanical devices. The kickers have a 50 -Ohm wave resistance; designed pulse amplitude on kicker inputs is 50 kV.

The output voltage waveform determines the quality and characteristics of the output beam current of the IEBA. Comparing with the conventional BPFL, an IEBA based on a helical type BPFL can increase the duration of the output voltage in the same geometrical volume. However, for the helical type BPFL, the voltage waveform on a matched load may be distorted which influences the electron-beam quality. In this paper, an IEBA based on helical type BPFL is studied theoretically. Based on telegrapher equations of the BPFL, a formula for the output voltage of IEBA is obtained when the transition section is taken into account, where the transition section is between the middle cylinder of BPFL and the load. From the theoretical analysis, it is found that the wave impedance and transit time of the transition section influence considerably the main pulse voltage waveform at the load, a step is formed in front of the main pulse, and a sharp spike is also formed {{at the end of the}} main pulse. In order to get a well-shaped square waveform at the load and to improve the electron-beam quality of such an accelerator, the wave impedance of the transition section should be equal to that of the inner PFL of helical type BPFL and the transit time of the transition section should be designed as short as possible. Experiments performed on an IEBA with the helical type BPFL show reasonable agreement with theoretical analysis...|$|E
