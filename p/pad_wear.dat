25|$|When {{braking force}} is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and brake <b>pad</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|E

Remote key entry, driver seat warning, door open warning and display, ultrasonic reverse parking sensors for parking in tight spaces, brake <b>pad</b> <b>wear</b> warning along with central looking are other safety features. The SX variant comes with option of ABS and the LX variant comes with ABS and 4-wheel drive system as standard.|$|E

50|$|The car used {{disc brakes}} at the front, and either disc brakes or drum brakes at the rear, {{depending}} on the model. Brake <b>pad</b> <b>wear</b> warning via an instrument panel indicator light was a notable innovation. The steering was a rack and pinion system.

Engines were of the Indenor design and included 1948 cc, 2112 cc, and a 2304 cc.

25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake <b>pads</b> <b>wear</b> {{down and}} have to be replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they <b>wear,</b> causing the <b>pads</b> to <b>wear</b> unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A brake <b>pad</b> <b>wear</b> control {{algorithm}} used under uncritical braking conditions is proposed {{to reduce the}} difference in brake <b>pad</b> <b>wear</b> between {{the front and rear}} axles caused by the difference in braking force and the type of brake. The algorithm regulates the distribution of braking force within the limits of certain braking regulations according to the wear conditions of the brake pads while deceleration control still functions properly. Computer co-simulations of braking with Trucksim and Matlab/Simulink was performed in which vehicle models with equal brake <b>pad</b> <b>wear,</b> greater wear on the front axle and greater wear on the rear axle were used. The results show that the difference in brake <b>pad</b> <b>wear</b> between the front and rear axles can be reduced by distributing the braking force according to the wear conditions of the brakes when braking uncritically to reduce the time and cost needed in repair and maintenance...|$|E
