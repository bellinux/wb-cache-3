Our study focuses on ideas and arguments that influence the policy of <b>parental</b> <b>benefit.</b> The study assumes, with basis in the theories of feminism and historical institutionalism, that a policy like <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> is slow-moving and that path dependency has lead to a slow development of gender equality...|$|E

40|$|On January 1, 2017, the <b>parental</b> leave <b>benefit</b> will {{be celebrating}} its tenth anniversary. Although its {{implementation}} was fervidly debated, {{it has become}} a widely accepted family policy measure. Its impact on parental labor supply, the division oflabor between parents, fertility, and indicators that reflect the well-being of parents and children have been examined from a variety of perspectives. A global evaluation of relevant economic studies shows that on average, when young familiesreceive the <b>parental</b> leave <b>benefit</b> as an earnings replacement benefit, their economic stability in the first year after childbirth increases. As a result of the <b>parental</b> leave <b>benefit,</b> the employment rate of mothers decreased in the first year after childbirth, while it increased in the second year. The share of fathers who take parental leave has clearly increased, while the effects on the division of labor within the family are inconclusive. Some evidence suggests that the <b>parental</b> leave <b>benefit</b> can even have an effect on fertility. Little is known about its impact on child development. Overall, although the <b>parental</b> leave <b>benefit</b> family policy measure has been successful in many areas, its targeted effects could be augmented by additional family policy reforms...|$|R
40|$|<b>Parental</b> <b>Benefit</b> is {{the type}} of an {{allowance}} for families provided by the system of the social support in the Czech Republic. The purpose of the benefit payment is financial help coming from the state towards families with a child in times when a parent stays at home caring 24 hours for the child after the birth. <b>Parental</b> <b>Benefit</b> has been the most often amended benefit of all during its history. There were gradually introduced many changes in the length of payment, financial amount, also were introduced permissions to work while being paid benefits and the possibility to place a child in some kind of day-care institution for limited time period. The last one and the most complete amendment, which has been valid since 2008, introduced several ways of using the benefit: up to two years, three years, and four years of the child?s age. The Bachelor Work is focused on the importance of <b>Parental</b> <b>Benefit</b> as the financial support for families. There were set two goals: The first one was {{to find out if the}} current system with more time-period payments is comfortable for clients registered at the Job Center in Strakonice. The second goal was to find out if the clients make use of provisions that allow them to work together with being paid benefits. There was set a sample research group consisting of clients registered at the Job Center in Strakonice who applied for Parental Benefits. To reach the goal, there was chosen the strategy of quantitative research, requesting method, and the questionnaire. There were set two hypotheses: Hypothesis H 1 : "Most of clients registered at the Job Center in Strakonice choose the basic form of <b>Parental</b> <b>Benefit</b> lasting up to three years of the child?s age". Hypothesis H 2 : "Most of clients registered at the Job Center in Strakonice use the possibility of working while being paid Parental Benefits". H 1 was confirmed. H 2 was not confirmed. The work was aimed to follow <b>Parental</b> <b>Benefit</b> from the view of parents who receive the benefit and to increase public awareness of using more versions of Parental Benefits. The outcome of the work is our finding that the most of clients prefer the version lasting three years. The clients who are not allowed to choose themselves one of the mentioned options are not satisfied with the slow version lasting up to the fourth year of the child?s age.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that incentives matter for people's decisions. This paper investigates whether this also holds for less self-evident areas of life such as the timing of births. We make use of a nautral experiment when the German government changed its <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> system January 1, 2007. The policy changes strongly increased economic incentives for women to postpone delivery to the new year provided that they were employed. The incentives for women not employed were not the same, they could gain slightly from giving birth before the policy change. Applying a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach, we find very strong evidence that women with an employment history near {{to the end of}} their term indeed succeeded to shift births and became subject to the new and more generous <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> system.

40|$|Increasing mothers labor {{supply is}} a key policy {{challenge}} in many OECD countries. Germany recently introduced a generous <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> that allows for strong consumption smooth- ing after childbirth and, by taking into account opportunity costs of childbearing, incentivizes working women to become mothers {{and return to the}} labor force rapidly. Using a sharp regression discontinuity design, we estimate policy impacts for the short-run (first two years after childbirth) {{as well as for the}} medium-run (i. e. 3 - 5 years after childbirth) and find significant and striking patterns: First, medium-run effects on mothers employment probability are positive, significant and large, for some subgroups ranging up to 10 per cent. The effects are driven by gains in part-time but not full-time employment. We also find significant increases in working hours. Second, the probability of job continuity rises significantly, i. e. mothers return to their pre-childbirth employer at higher rates. Third, employers reward this return to work by raising job quality significantly and substantially. We argue that these findings are related to an anchor effect: the new <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> defines a societally preferred point in time at which mothers return to work after childbirth...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give an {{overview}} of labour supply incentives present in the Estonian income support system and how changes during {{the last ten years}} in the Estonian benefit system have influenced the incentives. As Estonia belongs to the group of EU countries where both taxes and social expenditures are relatively low, they generate high motivation to actively participate in the labour market, in general. Also the gradual introduction of contribution based and earnings related benefits, such as unemployment insurance <b>benefits,</b> <b>parental</b> <b>benefits,</b> a fully funded pension scheme together with earnings-related public pension scheme have all significantly increased rewards from employment and are often associated with increased labour supply as well as a reduction in undeclared work. The increase of the statutory retirement ages for men and women have increased average employment rates of the elderly, but also retirement through alternative schemes, most notably disability pensions and early retirement pensions. In a few cases, the Estonian benefit schemes generate disincentives to seek for a job or increase labour effort, affecting people both with low and high earnings. In case of unemployment benefits and early retirement benefits, even marginal income from labour leads to loss of all benefits, thus discouraging part time work. Also there are very high effective marginal tax rates when increasing work effort when receiving subsistence <b>benefits</b> and <b>parental</b> <b>benefits,</b> in certain cases. These disincentives become even more significant in this economic crisis when people are faced with long-term unemployment and it is vital that they are encouraged to return to the labour market.

40|$|Variations in {{fertility}} {{have caused}} a problematic situation in Sweden among other European countries. According to the Council of Europe we are facing an economic and demographic challenge, when the baby boomers of the 1940 ’s are retiring.

This connection is again of current interest 2008, when a financial bubble bursts {{at the same time as}} a baby boom occurs. A similar event happened in 1992 when the latest baby boom occurred at the same time as a financial bubble.   This study investigates the correlation between real disposable income, employment among women, the price development of small houses, family policies and fertility during the period 1960 - 2008. The conclusions are reached by studies of earlier research and literature on economic theory of fertility. In the analysis theories and the results of earlier research are compared to empiric macro data taken from the Swedish Statistical Agency.   The conclusions are that a causal relation between economic factors and fertility exists, but it is not obvious; is fertility affected by variations in economic factors or the opposite? Employment affects both women’s income and their entitlement to <b>parental</b> <b>benefit,</b> which means that fertility and female employment are closely connected. Both financial bubbles and baby booms arise from the same psychological factors, which are rarely explained in economic models. When the Swedish <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> was introduced it had two effects; first it made the average age of women having their first baby increase, and secondly fertility became more closely connected to business cycles. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis examines the Swedish <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> {{in relation to}} the EU principles on free movement, namely the Treaty provisions on free movement for workers and Union citizens, and more specifically, the legislation on coordination of social security benefits – Regulation 1408 / 71 and its successor Regulation 883 / 2004. The rights enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and further developed in secondary legislation, mean that there shall be no obstacles for persons making use of their right to free movement. An important aspect is that the movement shall not result in loss of social security benefits, such as benefits relating to childbirth and family costs. Problems in applying the EU rules {{in relation to the}} Swedish <b>parental</b> <b>benefit</b> may however occur in several situations, as regards families moving to Sweden during parental leave, families moving from Sweden during parental leave, and families working and living in different states, one of which is Sweden.

This study provides a legal dogmatic and normative analysis of this field of law and raises questions about how the EU rules are applied in relation to families making use of their right to free movement and how the legislation represents different normative patterns, which may explain some of the problems in applying EU law in the Swedish context. A thorough survey of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union provides the basis for general conclusions on the issue of free movement and social benefits...|$|E

Specifically, states offering parental coverage have greater program participation (on the order of 10 % points) among children even after controlling for observable demographic characteristics and the household's position in the income distribution. Thus, extending coverage to the parents of SCHIP-eligible children appears to be an effective strategy to reduce uninsurance rates among children. ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter compares Canadian {{policies}} {{for families with}} {{children under the age}} of three with policies available in eight other affluent countries (Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US), three from each of Esping-Andersen's 'three worlds' of welfare capitalism. Within Canada, the province of Quebec has recently introduced its own system of maternity and parental benefits; these are also discussed. For families with very young children, cash maternity and/or <b>parental</b> <b>benefits</b> are particularly important and are thus the focus of the analysis. The first section of the chapter provides an overview of what is available in each of the countries studied; the second section calculates maternity/parental benefit entitlements for five 'sample' new parents; the third uses LIS microdata to compare over-all financial well-being of families with very young children. The chapter concludes that the duration of Canadian maternity and <b>parental</b> <b>benefits</b> compares quite favorably with what is available elsewhere, but the level of benefits offered is rather low. Ceilings on maternity/parental benefits in some countries, including Canada, mean that the effective replacement rate is lower than the nominal replacement rate. Since male earnings are typically higher than female earnings, this may discourage fathers from taking up benefits. Some countries have implemented inducements for men to take parental leaves (e. g., by allocating part of the leave for men only in Sweden, Norway or Quebec). Scandinavian countries are particularly flexible about allowing parents to extend benefit periods by returning to work part-time while collecting partial benefits; Canada might consider moving in this direction to allow families greater freedom in how to use their entitlements.
