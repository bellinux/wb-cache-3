40|$|Preventive {{maintenance}} practices {{are listed in}} the manufacturers' instruction books. In general, equipment that requires frequent and extensive preventive maintenance is generally the most costly. The manpower spent on these frequent trips to remote areas is such that it is usually better to invest in a more costly system which requires little preventive maintenance. The best preventive maintenance for the system is a good installation. 7. 2 Preventive Maintenance and Inspections With any system, periodic inspection is required because of the corrosive atmosphere and adverse conditions that exist in underground mines. These inspections can spot potential trouble in the system. Repair or replacement at that time averts the possibility of losing effectiveness of {{all or part of the}} system. 7. 2. 1 Cables Approximately once per month all cables in the communications system should be inspected for kinking, chafing, cracking, wear, stretching, or other signs of physical abuse. Particular attention should be paid to cable glands at the entry or exit points to the various units in the system, where the cable goes around sharp corners, in the vicinity of holding cleats which may be clamping the cable too tightly causing potential damage, and across the areas where the cable is exposed to physical damage from outside sources, such as equipment or falling objects. If a cable is damaged, it should be replaced as soon as possible. It is mandatory that the ground leads and connections to carrier current phones be thoroughly inspected and maintained in good condition, since considerable hazard may exist to the operator or equipment if a ground connection is broken. 7. 2. 2 Pager Phones The most readily available test set to determine if a pager telephone is operating correctly is the pager phone itself. The following physical check of the system can be performed at any phone station. 7. 2. 2 a Listen Circuit Remove the handset from its cradle and listen to determine if the circuit is functional, as indicated by the presence of noise or conversation on the line. If no noise or voice signals are present at the handset receiver, take the following corrective action: 1. Operate the handset <b>press-to-talk</b> <b>switch</b> several times. Any corrosion on the contacts of this switch may cause a receiver to be temporarily inoperative. Repeated operation may clear the condition. 2. Open the cabinet and see if the battery cables are properly connected and are making firm contact. Check the handset cable and its connections in the cabinet of the pager phone, and see if there is any evidence of a break in the cable, corroded contacts, or poor connections. 3. Remove the handset receiver earpiece by unscrewing it counterclockwise (to the left), and remove the receiver from the socket. Examine the handset cavity; in some units, a patch of cotton batting or floss is used as a barrier to reduce acoustic feedback in the handset. If the cotton patch has absorbed moisture, remove it and replace with a crumpled ball of soft rubber, stuffed just far enough into the handset so it will not touch the receiver or switch terminals. 7. 2. 2 b Page Circuit and Talk Circuit Push the page switch, squeeze the handset <b>press-to-talk</b> <b>switch,</b> and call any other phone.
