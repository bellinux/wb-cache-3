Unlike many other competition agencies (such as the Commission), the CCPC does not, and may not, have the power to impose fines; this is due to the Irish Constitution which limits the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>penalties</b> and sanctions to the judicial system (i.e., the courts); some would argue that Irish {{competition law}} is a better system for having the filter of the CCPC having to make its case to the police (the Garda Siochana) and the Director of Public Prosecutions before cases are instituted with the extra protection of the judges and, in criminal cases, juries acting as a filter to ensure robust cases are taken.|$|E

50|$|Due's {{membership}} of the Court coincided with vast changes in that Institution's life. First, the accessions of Greece in 1981, Spain and Portugal in 1986 enlarged the {{membership of}} the Court. Second, the impetus given to the Community through the Single European Act and the Delors Presidency in general saw a vast growth in the work-load of the Court. This led to the establishment in 1989 of the European Court of First Instance during the Due Presidency aimed at transferring part of the workload of the European Court of Justice. In the period 1979 to 1994, the Court also became a far more exposed institution, whose real powers were gradually recognised. This culminated in the attribution to the Court the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> monetary <b>penalties</b> on Member States for their failure to obey Community law, introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht.|$|R

Burger contended that a court with the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> this <b>penalty</b> should be subjected to judicial scrutiny. However, the Kentucky arrangement for dealing with less serious offenses had not been shown to disadvantage the defendant any {{more or less than}} trials conducted in a court of general jurisdiction in the first instance, as long as the later was always available.

25|$|The {{punishment}} {{imposed by}} the Act is expressly made subject to sections 325(1) and 330(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which prohibit a caning sentence from being imposed on women, men considered by the court {{to be more than}} 50 years old, and men sentenced to death. Caning sentences may be imposed on juveniles above the age of seven years and under 16 years, as the Children and Young Persons Act specifically states that, notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, no child or young person shall be sentenced by any court other than the High Court to corporal punishment. Despite the express words reserving to the High Court the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the <b>penalty,</b> the Court has held that caning may be imposed on a child or young person by a subordinate court as the Vandalism Act takes precedence over the Children and Young Persons Act.|$|R

50|$|Part 4 {{also makes}} {{changes to the}} {{operation}} and management of Ofqual, the government's qualifications regulator.

Provisions are also made about how Chairman and Chief Regulator will be appointed, the length of their terms of office, their salaries and pensions. Section 22 provides a definition of what Ofqual's objectives are in relation to the standard of qualifications offered. Section 23 gives Ofqual the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> financial <b>penalties</b> on qualification awarding bodies if they have failed to comply with a condition of their recognition, and sets out detailed conditions as to how such penalties are to be administered, whilst Section 24 provides Welsh Ministers with similar <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> those granted to Ofqual through Section 23.|$|R
50|$|Article 114 {{entails a}} civil right: the {{prohibition}} of the death penalty, included by the constitutional revision of 1983 after the death penalty itself had already been abolished in 1870. The article is not a guarantee, as doctrine holds that {{in a state of}} emergency any right might be suspended by unwritten constitutional emergency law; also in principle some treaty might oblige the judge <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty.</b> However, in fact the Netherlands has ratified the Sixth Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, also containing a prohibition and having precedence over any other treaty. Therefore, since 1986 no Dutch judge has any formal competence <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty.</b> Nevertheless, the Dutch government might by treaty be obligated to cooperate with some international tribunal with the <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty,</b> such as the International Military Tribunal once was.|$|R
50|$|His {{judgement}} in Application of Childers is {{a striking}} contrast. Robert Erskine Childers, {{one of the leaders}} of the Anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, was captured by Government forces, court-martialled and sentenced to death. O'Connor refused to interfere, finding that the new Irish Free State, unlike General Macready, did have <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty.</b> While O'Connor was universally regarded as a man of integrity, who would never consciously bend the law, it is possible that his attitude had hardened since Egan; certainly it cannot have helped Childers that his allies had destroyed the Four Courts, a fact to which O'Connor drew attention in stressing the magnitude of the problems which the new Government faced. Childers was executed three days later.|$|R

On the face of it therefore it is hard to understand why Lynch fled the country, to die in Brest in 1691. Ball believed the explanation was the discovery of a letter in which Lynch reportedly admitted that in any criminal trial where he had <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty</b> he would always drive for the execution of an accused Protestant, whether they were innocent or guilty.|$|R
50|$|The Statute of the Special Court for Sierra Leone {{outlines}} {{four different}} types of crimes with which the Court can charge individuals.

50|$|On June 9, {{the other}} {{two members of the}} junta were forced to resign, leaving Ríos Montt as the sole leader, head of the armed forces, and {{minister}} of defense. Violence escalated in the countryside under the Guatemalan military's Plan Victoria 82, which included a rural pacification strategy known as frijoles y fusiles (beans and guns). This was an attempt by Ríos Montt to win over the large insurgent groups to his version of the rule of the law, unleashing a scorched earth campaign on the nation's Maya population, particularly in the departments of Quiché and Huehuetenango, that, according to the 1999 United Nations truth commission, resulted in the annihilation of nearly 600 villages. One example was the Plan de Sánchez massacre in Rabinal, Baja Verapaz, in July 1982, which saw over 250 people killed. The administration established special military courts that had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> death <b>penalties</b> against criminals and suspected guerrillas. Tens of thousands of peasant farmers fled over the border into southern Mexico. Meanwhile, urban areas saw a period of relative calm. The June 1982 amnesty for political prisoners was replaced by a state of siege in the following month that limited the activities of political parties and labor unions under the threat of death by firing squad.|$|R
40|$|Gary Lawson 2 ̆ 6 David Kopel 2 ̆ 7 s Bad News for Professor Koppelman: The Incidental Unconstitutionality of the Individual Mandate argues, on {{the basis}} of recent research, that the Necessary and Proper Clause {{incorporates}} norms from eighteenth-century agency law, administrative law, and corporate law, and that the mandate (and perhaps much else in the U. S. Code, though they are coy about this) violates those norms. The Necessary and Proper Clause, as they understand it, tightly limits the scope of implied powers. These claims are obscure even on their own terms.

Their logic implies the greatest revolution in federal power in American history. (And this would decidedly be a revolution from above.)

50|$|Although his {{training}} {{had been in}} Chancery, O'Connor is best remembered for two notable judgements {{in the field of}} habeas corpus, both a product of the political turmoil of the period 1919-1923. In R. (Egan) v. Macready he found that the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> declare martial law imposed by the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 did not confer a <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty,</b> and ordered the release of the applicant Egan, who was under sentence of death. When Nevil Macready, the Commander in Chief refused to comply, O'Connor caused a sensation by ordering his attachment for contempt of court. Egan was then released. The judgement was extremely influential, although one crucial finding- that there is no limit to the number of habeas corpus applications which can be made by a single applicant- has been much debated, and in Ireland itself was modified by the Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland.|$|R

In November 2008, the TPA was amended again to make clear the circumstances when corporations had 'taken advantage' of their market power.

40|$|The Australian Imperial Force in the First World War had a {{deserved}} {{reputation as}} an effective fighting force, {{and at the same}} had the worst disciplinary record away from the frontline when compared with other Dominion forces {{and the rest of the}} British Army. Australian indiscipline is a subject that has been largely ignored, or when dealt with as in the Official History by C. E. W. Bean, has had to pass through the filter of the Australian Legend. This study examines the link between Australian indiscipline and the privileged position they held of being the only force immune from the death penalty, except for mutiny, desertion to the enemy and traitorous activity. This simple fact would have a major influence on the relatively high numbers of absentees and desertions within Australian ranks. General Headquarters in France (GHQ) saw these high levels of indiscipline as a direct result of Australian authorities not allowing their soldiers to be placed under the Army Act in full. Further differences surfaced between the British and Australians when it came to punishment, with Australian courts criticised by British Army authorities for not using the <b>powers</b> they possessed <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>penalties</b> that would act as a deterrent, as well as their reluctance <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> Field Punishment No. 1. This study examines these general differences as well as dealing with a specific case of an Australian soldier charged with the murder of a French civilian, a case that attracted the attention of senior political and military figures when it transpired Australians were immune from the death penalty for murder. Maintaining discipline was a constant struggle for the authorities when faced with those determined to avoid frontline duty either by committing military crime or through self-maiming. In this context the high venereal disease rate is discussed and evidence presented that this could be considered as a self-inflicted wound. The mutiny in the 1 st Battalion of September 1918 is examined as well as a mutiny in a military prison in France in 1919. It is not the purpose of this study to tarnish the reputation of the many thousands of brave men who fought in the AIF, rather it is an attempt to understand the high levels of indiscipline within the context of the war on the Western Front and the disciplinary code under which they operated...|$|R

50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the village}} of Bruschied belonged to a great landhold of Saint Maximin’s Abbey near Trier, which comprised, besides Bruschied itself, also Hausen near Rhaunen, Woppenroth, Blickersau, Kaffeld (two now {{vanished}} villages that once lay within Woppenroth’s limits), Bundenbach and Schneppenbach, and was presumably subject to the Hof Hausen (the manor). Bruschied formed together with Schneppenbach a single municipal area and had its first documentary mention in 1023 under the name Prubesdervot in the directories of holdings. In 1282 it was called Probsterade and in 1426 Proistrot. Placename researchers interpret the name as meaning “clearing (—rade, —rot) laid out on a provost’s estate”. The two villages’ municipal area was {{at the same time}} in the Middle Ages a “court region”, where the Schultheiß and Schöffen (roughly “lay jurists”) exercised low jurisdiction (that is, they did not have the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> the death <b>penalty)</b> within this Ingericht. The Ingericht was itself part of the high court region of Rhaunen, which was originally under the Waldgraves’ ownership, and unlike the lower court, it could sentence wrongdoers to death. After the permanent transfer of Castle Schmidtburg to the Prince-Archbishop-Elector of Trier, Bruschied and Schneppenbach belonged, beginning in the mid 14th century to the lordship of Schmidtburg, which later formed the Amt of Schmidtburg, which itself existed until the late 18th century. The lordship over both Bruschied and Schneppenbach was held in equal shares by the Electorate of Trier and the Lords of Wiltberg. In 1563, there were ten families living in Bruschied, of whom six were subject to taxes and service demanded by the Elector and the other four were likewise subject to the Lords of Wiltberg. Ecclesiastically, Bruschied and Schneppenbach belonged to the parish of Hausen, where about 1555, the Reformation was introduced. Since the Electora-Trier Amtmann Nikolaus Schenk von Schmidtburg converted to the new belief, all the villagers in Bruschied, too, had to adopt Protestantism. After various denominational changes, back and forth, during the Thirty Years' War, the villages of Bruschied, Schneppenbach and Bundenbach ended up in the course of the Counter-Reformation becoming Catholic again. After the French Revolutionary territorial and administrative reform in 1798, Bruschied was grouped into the newly formed mairie de Kirn (mayoralty), to which it belonged until the end of the Napoleonic occupation in 1814. The village, however, remained in this municipal grouping on into Prussian times, although in 1815, it became known by the more German name Bürgermeisterei Kirn, also meaning “mayoralty”. After this entity had for a while belonged to the Simmern and Oberstein districts, Bruschied was in 1817 made part of the Bürgermeisterei of Gemünden, itself belonging to the Simmern district, which was later known as Amt, and eventually Verbandsgemeinde. In the latest round of territorial and administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate, the Verbandsgemeinde of Gemünden was dissolved on 8 November 1970 and Bruschied, along with the municipalities of Kellenbach, Königsau, Schneppenbach and Schwarzerden, was grouped into the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land in the Bad Kreuznach district.|$|R
