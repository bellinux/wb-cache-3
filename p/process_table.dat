5000|$|A {{process may}} be terminated, {{either from the}} [...] "running" [...] state by {{completing}} its execution or by explicitly being killed. In either of these cases, the process moves to the [...] "terminated" [...] state. The underlying program is no longer executing, but the process remains in the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> as a zombie process until its parent process calls the [...] system call to read its exit status, {{at which point the}} process is removed from the <b>process</b> <b>table,</b> finally ending the process's lifetime. If the parent fails to call , this continues to consume the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> entry (concretely the process identifier or PID), and causes a resource leak.|$|E
5000|$|When a child process terminates, {{it becomes}} a zombie process, and {{continues}} to exist as an entry in the system <b>process</b> <b>table</b> {{even though it is}} no longer an actively executing program. Under normal operation it will typically be immediately waited on by its parent, and then reaped by the system, reclaiming the resource (the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> entry). If a child is not waited on by its parent, it continues to consume this resource indefinitely, and thus is a resource leak. Such situations are typically handled with a special [...] "reaper" [...] process that locates zombies and retrieves their exit status, allowing the operating system to then deallocate their resources.|$|E

50|$|Just as {{the early}} {{programming}} languages were designed to generate spreadsheet printouts, programming techniques themselves have evolved to <b>process</b> <b>tables</b> (also known as spreadsheets or matrices) of data more efficiently in the computer itself.|$|R
50|$|Zombie {{processes}} might pose {{problems on}} systems with limited resources or that have limited-size <b>process</b> <b>tables,</b> as {{the creation of}} new, active processes might be prevented {{by the lack of}} resources still used by long lasting zombies.|$|R
5000|$|Process Control Block (PCB, {{also called}} Task Controlling Block, Entry of the <b>Process</b> <b>Table,</b> Task Struct, or Switchframe) is a data {{structure}} in the operating system kernel containing the information needed to manage a particular process. The PCB is [...] "the manifestation of a process in an operating system." ...|$|E
50|$|By default, {{the system}} {{assumes that the}} parent process is indeed {{interested}} in such information {{at the time of}} the child's termination, and thus sends the parent the signal SIGCHLD to alert that there is some data about a child to be collected. Such collection is done by calling a function of the wait family (either wait itself or one of its relatives, such as waitpid, waitid or wait4). As soon as this collection is made, the system releases those last bits of information about the child process and removes its pid from the <b>process</b> <b>table.</b> However, if the parent process lingers in collecting the child's data (or fails to do it at all), the system has no option but keep the child's pid and termination data in the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> indefinitely.|$|E
5000|$|After the zombie is removed, its process {{identifier}} (PID) and {{entry in}} the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> can then be reused. However, if a parent fails to call , the zombie will {{be left in the}} <b>process</b> <b>table,</b> causing a resource leak. In some situations this may be desirable - the parent process wishes to continue holding this resource - for example if the parent creates another child process it ensures that it will not be allocated the same PID. On modern UNIX-like systems (that comply with SUSv3 specification in this respect), the following special case applies: if the parent explicitly ignores SIGCHLD by setting its handler to [...] (rather than simply ignoring the signal by default) or has the [...] flag set, all child exit status information will be discarded and no zombie processes will be left.|$|E
50|$|File tables provide info about {{location}} {{and status of}} files. Finally, <b>process</b> <b>tables</b> store the data the OS needs to manage processes. At {{least part of the}} process control data structure is always maintained in main memory, though its exact {{location and}} configuration varies with the OS and the memory management technique it uses.|$|R
50|$|A rootkit is {{a program}} that uses low-level, hard-to-detect methods to subvert control of an {{operating}} system from its legitimate operators. Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security. They may include replacements for system binaries, making it virtually {{impossible for them to}} be detected by checking <b>process</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Process</b> Form: <b>table</b> within OIM {{database}} to hold data {{for a given}} resource object.|$|R
50|$|A {{very common}} example is failing to close files {{that have been}} opened, which leaks a file handle; this also occurs with pipes. Another common example is a parent process failing to call wait on a child process, which leaves the {{completed}} child process as a zombie process, leaking a <b>process</b> <b>table</b> entry.|$|E
5000|$|Zombies can be {{identified}} in the output from the Unix [...] command {{by the presence of}} a [...] "" [...] in the [...] "STAT" [...] column. Zombies that exist for more than {{a short period of time}} typically indicate a bug in the parent program, or just an uncommon decision to not reap children (see example). If the parent program is no longer running, zombie processes typically indicate a bug in the operating system. As with other resource leaks, the presence of a few zombies is not worrisome in itself, but may indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads. Since there is no memory allocated to zombie processes - the only system memory usage is for the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> entry itself - the primary concern with many zombies is not running out of memory, but rather running out of <b>process</b> <b>table</b> entries, concretely process ID numbers.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a process}} ends via , {{all of the}} memory and {{resources}} associated with it are deallocated {{so they can be}} used by other processes. However, the process's entry in the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> remains. The parent can read the child's exit status by executing the [...] system call, whereupon the zombie is removed. The [...] call may be executed in sequential code, but it is commonly executed in a handler for the SIGCHLD signal, which the parent receives whenever a child has died.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the problems mentioned above, process based operating systems usually maintain a variety of tables and states for running processes. There is no simple way to retrieve all administrative information about a process in a simple sequence of copy operations. Depending on {{the execution of the}} <b>process,</b> <b>tables</b> need to be searched, copied, altered and re-established on the destination system. Thus, process state replication is no simple task.|$|R

50|$|KDE System Guard, {{also known}} as KSysGuard, is the task manager and {{performance}} monitor for the KDE platform on Unix-like systems. It can monitor both local and remote hosts, accomplished via running ksysguardd on the remote host, and having the GUI (ksysguard) connect to the remote instance. It can retrieve simple values or complex data such as tables and display this information {{in a variety of}} graphical displays. Displays can then be organized in work sheets. It also provides a detailed top-like <b>process</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{resources}} available in limited numbers {{to the operating}} system include internet sockets, file handles, <b>process</b> <b>table</b> entries, and process identifiers (PIDs). Resource leaks are often a minor problem, causing at most minor slowdown and being recovered from after processes terminate. In other cases resource leaks can be a major problem, causing resource starvation and severe system slowdown or instability, crashing the leaking process, other processes, or even the system. Resource leaks often go unnoticed under light load and short runtimes, and these problems only manifest themselves under heavy system load or systems that remain running {{for long periods of}} time.|$|E
50|$|R. Kevin Oberman (from DOE) and John McMahon (from NASA) wrote {{separate}} {{versions of}} an anti-WANK procedure and deployed {{them into their}} respective networks. It exploited the fact that before infecting a system, WANK would check for NETW_(random number), that is a copy of its own, in the <b>process</b> <b>table.</b> If one was found, the worm would destroy itself. When anti-WANK was run on a non-infected system, it would create a process named NETW_(random number) and just sit there. anti-WANK only worked against the earlier version of the worm, though, because the process name of the worm in a later version was changed to OILZ.|$|E

50|$|Some {{operating}} systems handle a child process whose parent process has terminated {{in a special}} manner. Such an orphan process becomes a child of a special root process, which then waits for the child process to terminate. Likewise, a similar strategy is used {{to deal with a}} zombie process, which is a child process that has terminated but whose exit status is ignored by its parent process. Such a process becomes the child of a special parent process, which retrieves the child's exit status and allows the operating system to complete the termination of the dead process. Dealing with these special cases keeps the system <b>process</b> <b>table</b> in a consistent state.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{database}} systems which store rows of a database table {{in one place}} (row-oriented architecture) Metakit stores individual columns separately (column-oriented architecture). For many years only linear access to the tables was possible (with complexity O(1) for access and O(N) for search), later hash structures and B-tree like structures were added (reducing typical search complexity to O(1)). Relational operations (like group-by and joins) were also added over years. It is possible to combine and <b>process</b> <b>table</b> data via flexible mechanisms called views. The database data are portable among platforms. Disk space overhead of Metakit is very low — several techniques are employed automatically to reduce {{it as much as}} possible. Viewer of Metakit database structures (named Kitview) is provided.|$|E
5000|$|On Unix and Unix-like {{computer}} operating systems, {{a zombie}} process or defunct {{process is a}} process that has completed execution (via the [...] system call) but still has an entry in the process table: it is a process in the [...] "Terminated state". This occurs for child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status: once the exit status is read via the [...] system call, the zombie's entry is removed from the <b>process</b> <b>table</b> and it is said to be [...] "reaped". A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the resource table. In most cases, under normal system operation zombies are immediately waited on by their parent and then reaped by the system - processes that stay zombies for a long time are generally an error and cause a resource leak.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 70) The UNIX* process scheduler uses a prioritized {{round robin}} scheduling algorithm. Priorities are adjusted periodically: priorities of processes {{waiting in the}} ready queue are incremented; priorities of processes that just used CPU resources are decreased according {{to the amount of}} resources used. This feedback ensures good response time for interactive processes and prevents starvation for processes with low initial priorities. This computer-assisted lesson graphically simulates the scheduling of processes by the standard UNIX process scheduler. A number of processes are initially in the system.

40|$|Aims: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate whether some midseason table grape cultivars and types can be used as minimally processed produce and to investigate the negative effects of minimal processing {{on the quality of the}} table grapes. Methods and results: Changes in quality losses as defects, weight loss, soluble solids, titratable acidity and pH by minimally processed 13 cultivars and 4 types were recorded during a 10 -day storage period at 4 °C. Browning on the stem end was the major defect followed by collapse on the stem end, decay both on the stem end and on the berry surface, and splitting on the berry surface. Big Perlon, Hatun Parmagi and Ribol among the cultivars/types were found be less prone to defects after minimal processing and storing at 4 °C. Conclusion: The defects or problems which minimally <b>processed</b> <b>table</b> grapes most likely to face are collapse, browning and decay on the stem end, and splitting and decay on the berry surface. The quality losses in Big Perlon, Hatun Parmagi and Ribol cultivars with a very large berry size were lower than other 14 cultivars/types after 10 days, suggesting that berry size is very important attribute for choosing table grape cultivars as minimally processed produce. Significance and impact of study: The study involving 13 cultivars and 4 types with different colored skin, berry sizes and types presents reliable information of suitability of the grapes for fresh-cut produce. Furthermore, the quality assessment used for this study provides a very detailed clarification what kind of problems minimally <b>processed</b> <b>table</b> grapes might face...|$|R
