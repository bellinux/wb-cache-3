5|$|Toothache may {{be caused}} by dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or <b>periodontium),</b> or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or angina pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast majority of}} toothache is dental in origin.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the <b>periodontium</b> must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline may {{be given}} {{alongside}} the primary therapy of scaling (see § initial therapy). Doxycycline {{has been shown to}} improve indicators of disease progression (namely probing depth and attachment level). Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (such as collagenase), which degrade the teeth's supporting tissues (<b>periodontium)</b> under inflammatory conditions. To avoid killing beneficial oral microbes, only small doses of doxycycline (20mg) are used.|$|E
25|$|Bruxism {{is usually}} {{detected}} {{because of the}} effects of the process (most commonly tooth wear and pain), rather than the process itself. The large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system, namely the teeth, the <b>periodontium</b> and the articulation of the mandible with the skull (the temporomandibular joints). The muscles of mastication that act to move the jaw can also be affected since they are being utilized over and above of normal function.|$|E
25|$|The {{large amount}} of mineral in enamel {{accounts}} {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Tooth enamel ranks 5 on Mohs hardness scale and has a Young's modulus of 83 GPa. Dentin, less mineralized and less brittle, 3–4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. On radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the tooth and surrounding <b>periodontium</b> can be noted; enamel appears lighter than dentin or pulp since it is denser than both and more radiopaque.|$|E
25|$|The {{first signs}} of an {{arrangement}} of cells in the tooth bud occur in the cap stage. A small group of ectomesenchymal cells stops producing extracellular substances, which results in an aggregation of these cells called the dental papilla. At this point, the tooth bud grows around the ectomesenchymal aggregation, taking on {{the appearance of a}} cap, and becomes the enamel (or dental) organ covering the dental papilla. A condensation of ectomesenchymal cells called the dental sac or follicle surrounds the enamel organ and limits the dental papilla. Eventually, the enamel organ will produce enamel, the dental papilla will produce dentin and pulp, and the dental sac will produce all the supporting structures of a tooth, the <b>periodontium.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an actinomyces dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of gingivitis, which represents inflammation confined to the soft tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the gingivitis level for a long period and will not progress to periodontitis, unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. micros, P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic periodontitis is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for this pathogen. This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the <b>periodontium.</b> Prolonged inflammation in the <b>periodontium</b> leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated periodontitis progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E
500|$|The <b>periodontium</b> is the {{supporting}} {{structure of a}} tooth, helping to attach the tooth to surrounding tissues and to allow sensations of touch and pressure. It consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, alveolar bone, and gingiva. Of these, cementum {{is the only one}} that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an alveolus, or [...] "socket". Lying over the bone is the gingiva or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of the periodontal disease gingivitis is done by a dentist. [...] The diagnosis is based on clinical assessment data acquired during a comprehensive periodontal exam. [...] Either a registered dental hygienist or a dentist may perform the comprehensive periodontal exam but the data interpretation and diagnosis are done by the dentist. [...] The comprehensive periodontal exam consists of a visual exam, a series of radiographs, probing of the gingiva, determining the extent of current or past damage to the <b>periodontium</b> and {{a comprehensive review of}} the medical and dental histories.|$|E

50|$|Dental trauma {{refers to}} trauma (injury) {{to the teeth}} and/or <b>periodontium</b> (gums, {{periodontal}} ligament, alveolar bone), and nearby soft tissues such as the lips, tongue, etc. The study of dental trauma is called dental traumatology.|$|E
5000|$|A {{periodontal}} abscess (also termed lateral abscess, or parietal abscess), is a localized {{collection of}} pus (i.e. an abscess) within the tissues of the <b>periodontium.</b> It {{is a type}} of dental abscess. A periodontal abscess occurs alongside a tooth, and is different from the more common periapical abscess, which represents the spread of infection from a dead tooth (i.e. which has undergone pulpal necrosis). To reflect this, sometimes the term [...] "lateral (periodontal) abscess" [...] is used. In contrast to a periapical abscess, periodontal abscesses are usually associated with a vital (living) tooth. Abscesses of the <b>periodontium</b> are acute bacterial infections classified primarily by location.|$|E
50|$|LGE {{is limited}} to the soft tissue of the <b>periodontium,</b> {{appearing}} as a red line 2-3 mm in width adjacent to the free gingival margin. Unlike conventional periodontal disease, though, LGE is not significantly associated with increased levels of dental plaque.|$|E

5000|$|The PDL also {{undergoes}} {{drastic changes}} with chronic periodontal disease {{that involves the}} deeper structures of the <b>periodontium</b> with periodontitis. The fibers of the PDL become disorganized, and their attachments to either the alveolar bone proper or cementum through Sharpey fibers are lost because of the resorption of these two hard dental tissue.|$|E
50|$|The dental {{follicle}} is a sac {{containing the}} developing tooth and its odontogenic organ. The dental follicle (DF) differentiates into the periodontal ligament. In addition, {{it may be}} the precursor of other cells of the <b>periodontium,</b> including osteoblasts, cementoblasts and fibroblasts. They develop into the alveolar bone, the cementum with Sharpey's fibers and the periodontal ligament fibers respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament {{depends on}} stimulation provided by function {{to preserve its}} structure. Within physiologic limits the PDL can accommodate increased function with increase in its width. Forces that exceed the adaptive capacity of the <b>periodontium</b> produce injury called trauma from occlusion. When occlusal forces are reduced the PDL atrophies, appearing thinned. This phenomenon is called disuse atrophy.|$|E
