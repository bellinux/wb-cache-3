50|$|In 1919, {{during the}} early stages of the Polish-Bolshevik War, the area was handed over to Poland by local Ober-Ost commander. The <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation</b> of the forest was put to an end and all German-built {{factories}} in the area became nationalised. After the war, some of them were rented by the Polish government under a contract to the British company The Century European Timber Corporation. However, in the late 1920s the contract was canceled and the wood processing plants came back under state control, while the Terbenthen factory was sold to a private owner. Since then, the economic growth started and the village started to grow too. Hard work, but also decent salaries in wood processing plants attracted many settlers from various parts of Poland. The initial conglomerate of wooden huts, barracks, tents and narrow, wood-paved streets turned into a town.|$|E
50|$|Seven new {{national}} forests {{were created in}} the Amazon by presidential decree of Fernando Henrique Cardoso on 2 February 1998.According to the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA) this did not increase the protected area of the Amazon since the forests had previously been military areas protected from <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation,</b> or {{the perimeter of the}} Carajás Project, the mining area of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD).However, the decrees did let the government claim that 10% of the Amazon forests were protected.According to Paulo Benincá of IBAMA the chosen areas had high potential for logging and were close to major rivers to transport.The goal was to create 40000000 ha of national forest, which would be sufficient to meet domestic and foreign demand for wood products.The 700000 ha Carajás National Forest around the Carajás project would ensure financial partnership with CVRD for environmental projects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{discusses}} {{the current status}} of outsourcing in Brazil, with new regulation underway featuring a bill of law under review by the National Congress, aimed at allowing outsourcing for all activities. The authors argue that outsourcing and precarization of work are inseparable phenomena, {{based on the results of}} 20 years of research in Brazil that reveals the more precarious working conditions of outsourced workers in different occupational categories. They focus particularly on workers' health: outsourcing of risks has led to more fatal work accidents, invariably at higher rates in outsourced workers. Finally, the article contends that to remove restraints on outsourcing in Brazil amounts to legalizing and legitimizing <b>predatory</b> workforce <b>exploitation,</b> disregarding workers' physical limits, exposing them to risk of fatal accidents, and reverting to forms of work that violate the human condition...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, natural {{resources}} have proven an adequate replacement for external funding of armed conflicts. The prospects for parties to an armed conflict to gain ‘easy’ profits from resource exploitation encourage these parties to engage in predatory practices that are highly detrimental to environmental conservation. The environmental degradation caused by <b>predatory</b> resource <b>exploitation</b> by parties to an armed conflict also severely hampers efforts towards the post-conflict reconstruction of a State. Environmental degradation of land may spark new tensions in the fragile phase of post-conflict reconstruction. In addition, {{natural resources}} are an important engine to restart the economy of a war-torn State after the conflict has come to an end. If the resources are severely degraded or even exhausted as a consequence of their exploitation during armed conflict, it becomes even more difficult to kick-start the economy of a State emerging from conflict. This article argues that current international law is not sufficiently equipped to deal with these challenges. The existing regulatory framework is fragmented and imprecise. It is only through case specific responses under Security Council sanctions regimes that the challenges are currently addressed...|$|R
40|$|Relationships between {{retailing}} and socio-economic deprivation {{have attracted}} academic and policy interest, notably focusing {{on health and}} diet (including 'food deserts') and retail-led regeneration. Recently, particularly after the economic downturn, declining high streets have been a concern. Yet as shop vacancies rose, especially in poorer neighbourhoods, expansion of certain trades perceived by some as anti-social became a concern: notably high-interest lenders and bookmakers operating high stakes gambling machines. Some suggest <b>predatory</b> motives and <b>exploitation</b> of the disadvantaged here, but with little evidence. This paper analyses locations of 'problematic' trades together with other businesses to establish {{the extent to which}} concentrations in deprived areas (defined by the English Index of Multiple Deprivation) exist. Several 'problematic' trades do appear concentrated in deprived areas, but so equally do conventional value retailers and poundshops.

40|$|Heart-of-palm (Euterpe edulis Mart.) is a wild palm {{with a wide}} {{distribution}} throughout the Atlantic Rainforest. Populations of E. edulis represent important renewable natural resources but are currently under threat from <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Furthermore, because the species is indigenous to the Atlantic Rainforest, which {{is located in the}} most economically developed and populated region of Brazil, social and economic pressures have devastated heart-of-palm forests. In order to estimate the partitioning of genetic variation of endangered E. edulis populations, 429 AFLP markers were used to analyse 150 plants representing 11 populations of the species distribution range. Analysis of the genetic structure of populations carried out using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed moderate genetic variation within populations (57. 4 %). Genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST = 0. 426) was positively correlated with geographical distance. These results could be explained by the historical fragmentation of the Atlantic coastal region, together with the life cycle and mating system The data obtained in this work should have important implications for conservation and future breeding programmes of E. edulis.

40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the “fringe economy”—check-cashers, payday lenders, buy-here-pay-here auto sales, refund {{anticipation}} loans, rent-to-own furniture and appliances, auto title loans, and pawnshops—has precipitated a volatile debate about whether such financial services represent an adaptive response to the credit needs of low- and moderate-income families or <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation</b> of economically hard-pressed consumers. A review of this sector’s growth and its various financial service offerings suggests that the fringe economy addresses the {{lack of access to}} financial services for many poor and working class families; however, their expansion has broader implications not only for income and wealth inequality, but for the provision of social welfare benefits and thus the integrity of the welfare state. These tensions have been particularly exposed during the Great Recession and its aftermath, leading to debates over how policy should help meet the financial service needs of families with lower incomes and fewer resources as well as how to regulate this new market of financial services. The formation of an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the recent Dodd-Frank financial reform bill creates an immediate regulatory vehicle for intervening in this market and protecting low-income households from exploitive financial products.

40|$|The worst global {{financial}} crisis since the Great Depression has drawn worldwide attention to America's subprime mortgage sector and its linkages with <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation</b> in working-class and racially marginalized communities. During {{nearly two decades}} of expansion, agents of subprime capital fought regulation and reform by (1) using the doctrine of risk-based pricing to equate financial innovation with democratized access to capital, (2) appealing to the cultural myths of the 'American Dream' of homeownership, and (3) dismissing well-documented cases of racial discrimination and predatory abuse as anecdotal evidence of rare problems confined to a few lost-cause places in what is otherwise a benevolent free-market landscape. In this article, we challenge these three tactics.

During {{nearly two decades}} of stealth expansion, agents of subprime capital fought regulation and reform by a) using the doctrine of risk-based pricing to equate financial innovation with democratized access to capital, b) appealing to the cultural myths of the ‘American Dream ’ of homeownership, and c) dismissing well-documented cases of racial discrimination and predatory abuse as anecdotal evidence of rare problems confined to a few lost-cause places in what is otherwise a benevolent free-market landscape.

These, and other portentous developments, are set to impact heavily {{on the future of}} Africa. This paper looks to that future in a very specific way. Offering the limited insights of the outsider, I argue that the new Blair initiative, along with a swathe of other rich country anti-corruption interventions, will continue to succumb to failure unless the conventional wisdom about African “corruption ” is abandoned. The central proposition of the paper is that these policies have been on a failure trajectory for some time because they give precedence to Western, not African interests. 1 The paper is set in a context of stabilised, if not escalating neo-colonialism in Africa. The initial stage of <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation</b> of African resources (human and natural) is being superseded by the less showy but nevertheless more consequential transference of core Western orthodoxies, specifically democracy and trade liberalisation, into African economies and social fabrics. This in turn has required the West to confront African “corruption”.

Root-associated bacteria from A. angustifolia were isolated, selected and characterized for their biotechnological potential of growth promotion and biocontrol of plant pathogenic fungi. Ninety-seven strains were isolated and subjected to chemical tests. All isolates presented at least one positive feature, characterizing them as potential PGPR. Eighteen isolates produced indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), 27 were able to solubilize inorganic phosphate, 21 isolates were presumable diazotrophs, with pellicle formation in nitrogen-free culture medium, 83 were phosphatases producers, 37 were positive for siderophores and 45 endospore-forming isolates were antagonistic to Fusarium oxysporum, a pathogen of conifers. We also observed the presence of bacterial strains with multiple beneficial mechanisms of action. Analyzing the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and partial sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene of these isolates, {{it was possible to}} characterize the most effective isolates as belonging to Bacillaceae (9 isolates), Enterobacteriaceae (11) and Pseudomonadaceae (1).

Because of this, this study aimed to map the deforestation in riverine forests in Canarana - MT, Brazil, using geoprocessing techniques. Canarana has 17, 183 inhabitants with 13, 059 living in urban areas and 4, 124 living in rural areas. The economy of the municipality is basically the livestock, agriculture (soybean, corn and rice) and agro-industry. We considered the deforestation occurred in riverine forests in Canarana, over the years 2000, 2003 and 2005. The mapping was based on images of Landsat 5 and CBERS 2 satellites, using SPRING software to create the supervised classification of land in the interest areas. We also worked on the ground, using a GPS set, to check the results produced by the software. Toward set all database and delineate the riverine forests, we used ArcGis 9. 2 software. The riverine forests in Canarana comprise 130. 234 ha and we could identify five different classes of uses: clouds, water, deforestation, forest and altered areas. The deforestation increased from 24, 540 to 32, 420 ha. The main reason for that is the increase of agriculture.

40|$|Article consultable sur : [URL] audienceVeblen’s {{contribution}} to economic theory has received renewed interest (see, among others, Tilman, 2003), with particular reference to two distinct aspects. First, {{his approach to}} institutions – defined as a “special method of life and of human relations” (Veblen, [1889] 1975, 188) – has been re-proposed within the so-called new Institutionalism, {{with the aim of}} presenting a theory of economic behaviour (where instincts, habits, customs and transaction costs play a pivotal role) opposed to the mainstream “rational choice” view (see Hodgson, 1988). Second, attention has been devoted to his arguments on “conspicuous consumption” and emulation as well as the relation between consumption by the “leisure class” and the process of income distribution (see, among others, Bowles and Park, 2007). There is no doubt that Veblen provides significant economic and sociological categories which can also be useful in interpreting current macroeconomic dynamics, and that his theories on the functioning of the firm and on the path of income distribution are still relevant in the current context of global crisis. This special issue collects contributions of historians of economic thought, economists and sociologists specifically inte rested in using Veblen’s theories to interpret current phenomena. Marc-André Gagnon and Dimitri della Faille in “Thorstein Veblen, économiste iconoclaste” discuss the complexity of Veblenian thought, finding connections between biographical aspects of the American economist and the theoretical elements that characterize his works. In {{the central part of the}} article the authors analyze the theory of society’s socio-economic evolution and Veblen’s institutional theory highlighting the complex relationship that his thought has with the theory of evolution of C. Darwin and of H. Spencer. The article concludes with the lines of research that Veblen’s thought has left in inheritance to contemporary scholars. The contribution of John F. Henry sheds light on Thorstein Veblen’s political orientation. In the first section of “The political orientation of Thorstein Veblen” Henry provides a reconstruction of the Veblenian view on the functioning of a capitalist system, based on <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation</b> by a ruling class over the working class, with selfless public welfare being interpreted as a political position close to Marx. In the second and final section of the article, the author shows that although Veblen did not consider himself Marxist and never openly declared his political position, he sympathized with the Bolshevik revolution and specifically observed the role of the soviet technician as a possible tool to overcome the inefficiency, waste and parasitism of the capitalist system. In conclusion the author points out the “marked similarity between the general theory of Marx and Veblen. ...|$|E
40|$|The dynastic {{ascendancy}} by Chandragupta Maurya - {{with political}} guidance from the legendary Chanakya Kautilya - to the Magadhan empire of northern India around 324 BC denotes an early milestone {{in the two}} millennia period of Lal’s (1988) “Hindu Equilibrium”, extending from about 400 BC to 1600 AD. During this epoch, despite an anarchic state system, the decentralised, stratified, resilient Hindu social system of autarkic villages, the caste system and joint family was apparently able in reliance upon a technically advanced pan-Indian agrarian system and by delimiting external economic, political and cultural shocks, to both securely underpin its biosocial reproduction and keep its core cultural values and practices relatively stable and intact. Lal’s (1988, pp. 31, 64) assertions: (i) that the caste system was not economically dysfunctional; and (ii) that the structure of this socio-economic system based on the village was, ‘a second-best Pareto efficient adaption to the environmental and political constraints faced by earlier Aryans’, provide a convenient {{point of departure for}} this exploratory essay. North’s (1981) analytical approach to the structure and performance of economies over time is employed in conjunction with various compatible models and accounts of state formation and building, sources of social power and contract theory versus <b>predatory,</b> <b>exploitation</b> theories of the state. Their application to the posited composite Kautilya-Mauryan state/empire yields the adverse conclusion that in this early phase, the Hindu Equilibrium provided little more than a subsistence level existence {{for the vast majority of}} the rural populace. It was therefore a comparative failure given: (i) the abundance of natural resources and low population density; (ii) that society is not in any event a ‘suicide club’ (Hart 1961) but rather, is concerned with promoting its welfare as explicitly recognised by the Arthasastra, which can ‘be regarded as the sastra concerned with general well-being on earth’ (Kangle 2000 Part II, p. 2); and (iii) that, as Aristotle (1952, p. 445) observed, since all communities aim at some good, ‘the state or political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a greater degree than all the others, and at the highest good. ' This conclusion coheres with Lonergan’s (1978, p. 226) exegesis of the adverse consequences of ‘the distorted dialectic of community’ and North’s (1981, pp. 6 - 7) commonsense observations that throughout history, stagnation and decline have been the rule with growth the exception and that, 'in a world of non-market decision making, inefficient forms of political structure do persist for long periods of time. ...|$|E

Percebe-se, assim, que o anseio pela viagem e a busca de comodidades fora do habitat tem gerado o fortalecimento da indÃstria turÃstica no mundo. Com isso, deve-se atentar para o fato de que o turismo pode ser uma ferramenta capaz de gerar ganhos coletivos desde que seja desenvolvido de forma sustentÃvel. Como exemplo de um espaÃo turÃstico cujas relaÃÃes de uso e ocupaÃÃo se tornaram insustentÃvel estÃ o caso da Praia de Iracema, na cidade de Fortaleza.

40|$|The South {{of the old}} Russia, {{especially}} the Ukraine, has for generations been known as a granary. This statement is based on one hand on reports about the earth’s fertility, {{and on the other}} hand on formerly important exports of cereals; what is mostly neglected in corresponding discussions is the cereal economy’s dependence on the natural conditions and their changeability. Despite unfavourable economic circumstances as a whole, Russia still exported 10. 6 million tons of cereals in 1904, for example. Since then, economic conditions have changed several times and there has been a clear increase in population. During the past decades, the cereal production of the Ukraine was sometimes nota in a position to meet the existing need. Owing to the natural geography of the Ukraine, the largest part of the agriculturally useful areas are situated within the natural vegetation zones of the forested steppe and of the prairie as well as in the region of continental and warmtemperate climate. This means that black earths and forest soils exist in large parts of the country, but at the same time, two thirds of the country surface receives too little precipitation and too much heat. Owing to the associated winter and summer conditions, several million hectares of winter wheat are year by year threatened both by freezing and by drought. Winter wheat has for a long time been the most cultivated crop plant. Its share is especially high in the Oblast Odessa district and in the north-south strip extending from Kharkov to the mouth of the Dnieper river and to the Azov Sea. In respect of area share, winter wheat is followed by spring barley, maïze, pulses and oats; their regional distribution is shown in table 2. The economic repurcussions following the seperation of the Ukraine from the Soviet Union in 1990 / 91 have remained moderate for cereal production. More important are the consequences resulting from inappropriate agricultural development over the preceding 20 years. Since in 1995, after half a century of directive agriculture in State farms and agricultural cooperatives, privatisation is still in the very first phases, new steps are only taken very hesitantly and the forces of the market economy are only slowly taking effect, directives on economic management are still necessary. But in addition to this, a new purchase price mechanism is being linked with the appeal to adapt the regional crop planning structures to the natural conditions and to the human need and the need of animals. A tax-in-kind was introduced by the State in order to ensure an approximately evenly distributed basic supply to the population. In order to avoid continuing large harvest losses, efforts are being taken to renew and to complete grain storage and milling capacities as well as to improve the trafic connections of the villages and public transport. Of continuing importance is foreplanning in arable farming since the previous <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation</b> of the soil, i. e. discontinuance of crop rotation, incorrect cultivation, inappropriate irrigation, erosion-causing soil management weakened agriculture. Ukraine can again become a granary in the real sense of the word. To achieve this objective, agronomy and economy must once again be meaningfully linked and the farmer must once again play an active role...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. The article defines {{its main}} goal as the {{assessment}} of the resource potential of agricultural sector of Ukraine and description the opportunities of its usage in achieving competitive advantages of the state on foreign markets. The results of the analysis. During the research it was established that the resource potential of agricultural sector of Ukraine provides conditions for formation of powerful competitive advantages in world markets. In the period of exacerbation of the global food crisis the prospects of Ukraine become apparent. However, it has been found out that the state does not use its opportunities and, moreover, turns into an import-dependent country. Transformation processes that began in the village after gaining Ukraine’s independence, had to withdraw the agrarian economy to a qualitatively new level of development, however, led to the decline of the industry. Land as the main national wealth turned out to {{be in the hands of}} those who were unable to take care of it, and is rapidly losing its value. Most newly formed agricultural farms work on short-term lease that does not induce them to make efforts for the implementation of land improvements, but only provokes <b>predatory</b> <b>exploitation</b> of the soil. The problem is exacerbated due to lack of effective legal base and state control over business activities in rural areas. At the same time, there is no sense to speak about the state support, which is missing for small structures are at the disposal to close to power managers of agricultural holdings, which puts the market participants in unequal conditions of competition. The results of investigation confirmed that several of agricultural holdings, which operate in the state procure more than half of the equipment and, thus, have a higher level of productivity. Small companies have no funds for it, and this undermines their competitive position, and gives them neither the access to world markets, nor the opportunity but further development. Conclusions and directions of further researches. The analysis gives reasons for the conclusion about the ineffective usage of the resource potential of Ukraine’s agrarian sector, its actual neglect which is the consequence of unsystematic character and incoherence of define stages of agrarian reforms and can lead to a serious social, economic and ecological crisis. The awareness of this predetermines the necessity of searching the ways of urgent solution of the problems. The first steps in this direction are the following: the improvement of the legal field of agrarian reforms, simplification of administrative procedures of running business, fighting corruption and building a qualitatively new system of state regulation of distribution and use of productive resources of the agrarian sector. It has been indicated that the main task of the current stage of reforms should be the creation of optimal conditions for a substantial increase in social investment and productive capacity of the earth, its transformation into an independent factor of economic growth. The fulfillment of this task must be insured by the comprehensive application of instrument of economic and administrative methods of management that should be implemented as a part of general economic reform, and in searching the balance between which there are prospects for further research.
