5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, {{and it was one}} of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.|$|E

25|$|Then, the Pomeranian dukes {{entered the}} {{assembly}} with their entourage carrying the flags of Pomerania, Stettin, Kashubia, Wenden, Barth, Rügen, Wolgast, Usedom and Buckow, presented the flags to the emperor, {{and on their}} knees gave him the oath of allegiance. Elector Joachim I Nestor renewed his protest, and when the Pomeranian dukes received their flags from the emperor, he stepped forward and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on each of them. This formalized procedure was thence repeated at every new investiture.|$|E
25|$|According {{to ancient}} sources, the {{earliest}} reference to Tarasis {{dates back to}} 464, when he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on some letters written by Aspar's son, Ardabur, which proved that {{the son of the}} magister militum had incited the Sassanid King to invade Roman territory, promising to support the invasion. Through these letters, which Tarasis gave to Leo, the Emperor could dismiss Ardabur, who at the time was magister militum per Orientem and patricius, thus reducing Aspar's influence and ambition. As reward for his loyalty, which Leo praised with Daniel the Stylite, Tarasis was appointed comes domesticorum, an office of great influence and prestige. This appointment could mean that Tarasis had been a protector domesticus, either at Leo's court in Constantinople, or attached at Ardabur's staff in Antioch.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} finally improved but {{the result}} stayed the same when Middlesbrough went to Old Trafford, where Matthew Bates started a Middlesbrough game {{for the first time}} since the end of the 2005–06 season. Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson had spoken before the game, hoping to banish the rift that existed between the two clubs. Things probably weren't helped when Pogatetz, defending a corner, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> around the back of Cristiano Ronaldo's neck a corner and the United player went down, claiming a penalty. The spat continued when the players walked off the pitch for half time. Dimitar Berbatov's goal was the decisive moment in the game when he fired home to give his side a 1–0 victory, and left Middlesbrough hovering above the relegation zone on goal difference and without a win in eight games.|$|E

25|$|Mătăsăreanu's {{vehicle was}} {{rendered}} inoperable after {{two of its}} tires were shot out and the windshield covered in bullet holes. At 9:56 am, he attempted to carjack a yellow 1963 Jeep Gladiator on Archwood by shooting at the driver who fled on foot, three blocks east of where Phillips died. He quickly transferred all of his weapons and ammunition from the getaway car, {{but was unable to}} operate the Jeep due to him being unfamiliar with the stick-shift vehicle. As KCBS and KCAL helicopters hovered overhead, a patrol car driven by SWAT officers quickly arrived and stopped {{on the opposite side of}} the truck to where the Chevrolet was stopped. Mătăsăreanu left the truck, took cover behind the original getaway car, and engaged them for two-and-a-half minutes of almost uninterrupted gunfire. Mătăsăreanu's chest armor deflected a double tap from one of the SWAT officers, which briefly winded him before he continued firing. At least one SWAT officer fired his AR-15 below the cars and wounded Mătăsăreanu in his unprotected lower legs; he was soon unable to continue and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> up to show surrender.|$|E
25|$|On the June 17 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hogan's {{alliance}} with Abyss {{came to an}} abrupt end when Abyss became a villain. Abyss later claimed that he was controlled by some entity, that was coming to TNA. The next month, Hogan worked with Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe against Sting and Kevin Nash, who claimed that they knew that Hogan and Bischoff were up to something. During this time, Abyss went on a rampage, attacking Rob Van Dam to the point that he was forced to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and eventually <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on TNA president Dixie Carter, which led to her signing the paperwork, presented by Bischoff, that would have Abyss fired from TNA following his match with Van Dam at Bound for Glory. Hogan was set to wrestle with Jarrett and Joe against Sting, Nash and D'Angelo Dinero at Bound for Glory, but was forced to miss the event due to a back surgery. However, he would make an appearance {{at the end of the}} event, turning villain for the first time since 2002, helping Jeff Hardy win the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship and aligning himself with Hardy, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett. On the following episode of Impact!, it was revealed that Bischoff had tricked Carter and the paperwork she had signed a week earlier, were not to release Abyss, but to turn the company over to him and Hogan. Meanwhile, Bischoff's and Hogan's new stable, now known as Immortal, formed an alliance with Ric Flair's Fortune. Dixie Carter returned on the November 25 episode of Reaction, informing Hogan and Bischoff that a judge had filed an injunction against the two on her behalf over not having signatory authority, indefinitely suspending Hogan from TNA. During his absence, Hogan underwent a potentially career–ending spinal fusion surgery on December 21, 2010.|$|E
500|$|John de Lancie {{deliberately}} {{missed his}} first audition for Q {{as he was}} appearing as a lead in a play at the time.

He later said that after he auditioned, [...] "a big guy walked out, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on my shoulder, and said, 'You make my words sound better than they are.' I said, 'Well, you must be the writer.' And he said, 'I'm Gene Roddenberry.' I had absolutely no idea who that was." ...|$|E

I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on." [...] Once the duo felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians.|$|E
500|$|The {{court found}} that Gordon had first <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> around Carol's neck to {{strangle}} her, but that she had struggled. He then grabbed his ice axe, and brought it down with what was described as [...] "considerable" [...] force on Carol's face, and smashed the front right-hand side of her face, splitting open her head and smashing her teeth. He then did this again [...] the attack was described as consisting of [...] "two big heavy, crushing blows" [...] by pathologist Dr. Edwin Tapp. After this, Gordon dumped his wife's body in the lake, {{and went back to}} his day-to-day life. During the trial, the prosecution speculated that Gordon had [...] "drugged his wife, possibly on or around the 17 July, tied her up and stored her body in a chest freezer before dumping it in Coniston Water".|$|E
500|$|Fitzsimmons went {{to court}} to {{overturn}} Earp's decision. Newspaper accounts and testimony {{over the next two}} weeks revealed a conspiracy among the boxing promoters to fix the fight's outcome. Newspapers across the United States republished the stories from the San Francisco papers and looked for local angles. On December 14, 1896, the San Francisco Call quoted a story from the New York Journal by Alfred H. Lewis, [...] "who knew the 'bad men' in Arizona. He said that the Earps in Tombstone were [...] "stage robbers" [...] who [...] "stood up stages and plundered express companies for a livelihood... The Earps, Wyatt, Virgil, Warren and Julian, had treated themselves to many a killing... Warren Earp, who was a stage-company guard, meekly <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over his head... it was from all standpoints a family affair {{on the part of the}} Earps. Often they got as high as $25,000... Virgil, as marshal, would enlist Wyatt, Warren and Julian, together with Curly Bill, their cousin, and hunt the hold-ups." [...] Earp was parodied in editorial cartoon caricatures by newspapers across the United States.|$|E

500|$|Australia {{had been}} scoring slowly, {{as they would}} {{throughout}} the day, [...] and following Hassett's entrance, the Australians slowed further as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once. Hassett almost holed out early when he knocked a ball from Alec Bedser {{up in the air}} and it just evaded the grasp of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. Yardley continued to employ leg theory, as he and Charlie Barnett bowled outside leg stump; this tactic stifled the Australian scoring but also limited wicket-taking opportunities. During one over, Bradman did not attempt to hit a single ball and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on his hips to express his displeasure at England’s tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian skipper did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. In the last session, Bradman brought up one of his slowest ever centuries, as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking Australian wickets. Bradman reached stumps on 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30. Australia closed the second day at 4/293 to lead by 128, with Hassett on 41, having combined for an unbroken stand of 108 with Bradman.|$|E
500|$|Two tabloid {{television}} shows accepted confidential leaked {{documents from the}} Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services for $20,000. A number of Jackson's former employees—most of whom had worked at his ranch—sold stories to the tabloids of alleged prior sexual misconduct on Jackson's part, instead of reporting their claims to police. One couple initially asked for $100,000 claiming that Jackson sexually caressed Macaulay Culkin. They were prepared to expand upon this allegation for a fee of $500,000, whereby they would allege that Jackson <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> down Culkin's pants. When the story broke, Culkin strongly denied the allegation, and did so again in court during the 2003 trial of Michael Jackson. A former security guard made various allegations about Jackson, saying he was fired because he [...] "knew too much", and alleged that he was ordered by Jackson to destroy {{a photo of a}} naked boy. Instead of reporting this to police, Hard Copy accepted the story in return for $150,000. Afterwards, Jackson's maid, Branca Francia, alleged that she [...] "quit in disgust" [...] after seeing Jackson in a shower with a child, but did not inform the police. It later emerged that Francia was actually fired in 1991, but nevertheless sold her story to Hard Copy for $20,000.|$|E
500|$|While Weinberg did {{not forget}} the breakup and long separation, he viewed it as [...] "at {{the same time the}} most horrifying {{experience}} I've ever been through and the most liberating." [...] In any case, he immediately felt comfortable playing with Springsteen once more: [...] "Right from the first downbeat of the first rehearsal, it was there again." [...] His drumming for the E Street Band was more relaxed and mature than before, showing more confidence and finesse, and his hands and fingers were in better shape for having done the daily Late Night work. When the tour concluded with ten shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, on several days Weinberg taped the Conan show at Rockefeller Center in the late afternoon, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in ice and changed from his suit into jeans and a vest, and played with Springsteen at night. The experience of doing both left him [...] "professionally speaking, as alive as I've ever felt." [...] Of his position on the drum platform behind Springsteen, he says, [...] "I have the best seat in the house." [...] His energy level was no less, as he could be seen jumping a foot off his seat during some songs. His daughter Ali joined the band on keyboards several times during the tour.|$|E

500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E

Several witnesses say Mehserle said [...] "Oh my God!" [...] several times after the shooting. Many said they saw him <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to his head.|$|E
