40|$|Simulations are {{becoming}} increasingly important for the optimization of various processes. However, {{in the case of}} biomass processing the natural variability of the biological material adds an extra challenge. As the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stems is governed by the discrete interactions between the particles and the machine components, bulk models are inadequate to properly describe the crop-machine interaction for low and moderate particle densities. Discrete element modeling (DEM) has been proposed as a better way to model the behavior of particulate systems (Tijskens et al., 2003). Recently, its usefulness for simulating the flow of flexible stems has been demonstrated (Lenaerts et al., 2014). Leblicq et al. (2015) developed data based models which describe the buckling behavior of crop stems during bending and compression in DEM simulations. In this way, the decrease in deformation resistance with increasing damage was also taken into account. Using data based models, virtual bendable crop stems, with realistic geometries, could be created in the MPACTS software. Biological variability was introduced in the simulations by measuring different stems and using the corresponding calibrated deformation models. To do this in a correct and efficient manner multivariate statistical methods were applied. The virtual stems were used to simulate the compression of wheat straw in a compression box. The simulations were validated with bulk measurements. This calibrated DEM model {{can also be used to}} simulate the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stems by harvest and post-harvest machinery.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} is the disagreement of statistical and literature data about potential quantities of biomass in Serbia. This difference is mainly caused by changed status in practice due to several reasons: changes in ownership caused by transition, different application of technologies in practices, organization of work and economic reasons. The main aim is to precisely establish sorts and amounts of organic biomass in Serbia that can be transformed into heat and electricity. So far, data about the quantities of biomass residues in agriculture, forestry and communal services have been collected and published. Data collection methods are different and generally based on statistical data. The paper explains in detail methods of data collection and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> production, fruit growing and viticulture, livestock, forestry and communal services. On the basis of precise data collection, it has been established that there are 26. 3 million tons of biomass residue in Serbia every year.

We assessed onion canopies {{with a range of}} sensors and sought correlations with yield data. We report results from satellite NDVI and smartphone app percentage canopy cover. Methods: Mid-season World View 2 imagery at about 5 – 7 leaf stage was processed and paddock NDVI maps prepared. Areas of high, medium and low canopy were identified and relative yields determined at commercial maturity in February. NDVI and yield were compared. The smartphone app was used to survey a 1 ha crop and canopy cover maps prepared. In parallel, 1 m 2 plots were photographed at 3, 5, 7 leaf and bulbing, images processed to determine canopy cover. Percentage cover was compared to destructive leaf area and fresh mass measurements. Results: Strong correlations were found between NDVI and yield which enabled the retrospective creation yield and profit maps, useful for review but not current season management. Very strong relationships were found between processed smartphone images and measurements of fresh mass and leaf area index. Discussion: Satellite imagery is expensive at paddock scale, hard to obtain and slow to become available to the manager. However {{there does seem to be}} a relationship between early season canopy and harvest yield. Smartphone imagery can be cheaply gathered and immediately available. The relationship between ground cover and leaf area index suggests potential to create predictive yield maps that may inform current season management such as variable rate fertiliser.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} world population, the {{agricultural}} sector needs more productive and more energy-efficient agricultural machinery in order to adequately address the growing demand for food and biomass. Therefore, the sector significantly invests in the optimization of agricultural machinery. Historically, the optimization of agricultural machinery was done by trial and error. Design improvements of agricultural machinery are still often based on the experience and the insights of engineers and farmers. To test whether an adjustment has a positive effect, a prototype is developed and validated during field tests. This optimization method, however, has some disadvantages. Developing and constructing a prototype is costly. Moreover, prototypes can only be validated in field conditions during the growing season. These two factors oblige agricultural machinery manufacturers to opt for small adaptations with a high success rate. The current generation of agricultural machinery is, therefore, the result of decades of evolution. Now that computing power increases, another opportunity to improve the design of agricultural machinery presents itself. Models and simulations facilitate the optimization of machines. However, an accurate virtual crop model is missing. A simulation model that accurately describes the interactions between individual crop stems and the interactions between crop stems and machine components {{could be used to}} improve the design of stem processing agricultural machinery. In this thesis, such a simulation model was developed for the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stems in a baler. It has previously been shown that the Discrete Element Method (DEM) can be used to simulate and optimize particulate processes. For this, two requirements need to be met. Realistic particle geometries and realistic deformation models are required to obtain accurate simulation results. The virtual crop stems, therefore, need to be compressible and bendable. Also the frictional and tensional properties need to be realistic. A first step {{in the development of the}} DEM simulation model included an analysis of the bending behaviour of crop stems. It was observed that there are two phases during bending: ovalisation and buckling. The forces that occur during ovalisation result in a flattening of the cross-section of the stem and this reduces the bending resistance. This process continues until the maximum force has been reached and the stem buckles. Buckling is associated with a strong reduction of the resistance to bending. The influence of the stem diameter, the thickness of the stem wall and the presence of a core-rind structure were examined for wheat and barley stems. All were found to affect the bending behaviour significantly. The acquired knowledge was used to develop a data based bending model for flexible particles (i. e. crop stems) in DEM. The influences of the stem length, the support distance and the number of segments which make up the virtual stem, were examined. The same data based method was also used for developing a compression model for virtual stems in DEM. For this purpose, the interactions between individual stems and the interaction between a stem and a plate were studied and modelled. The models were successfully validated by comparing bulk compression simulations and measurements. For this purpose 250 stems were compressed in a box by the movement of a plunger. To study the influence of friction on the processing of stems, measurements were performed on the stem level. The measured coefficients of friction were significantly lower than those found in the literature, which have been measured on a bulk level. The influence of friction on bulk compression was evaluated and it was found that a small change in the coefficient of friction at stem level has a significant effect on the bulk behaviour. The last stem parameter that was studied was the tensional stiffness. Stem measurements were again performed for this purpose. The force was found to increase linearly with increasing deformation up to the point where the stem broke. A linear tensional model was therefore implemented in DEM. Afterwards, the influence of the tensional resistance on the bulk deformation behaviour was examined. The effects of the tensional model parameters were found to be very limited. Therefore, the model parameters of the tensional model were selected in such a way that the computation time was minimized. The effect of strain rate on the force-deformation behaviour at the stem level was studied using a pendulum device. However, no significant effects could be observed for the tests at low and high speed with the used set-up. When the stem properties were measured and after they were modelled in DEM, the influence of the stem variability (e. g. the variability in physical and mechanical properties) on the bulk deformation behaviour was determined. To this end, simulations were performed with different degrees of variability. As a validation, bulk compression tests were performed. It was observed that a limited number of stem measurements can be sufficient to obtain accurate DEM simulations. As more stems are measured and as the stem database becomes larger, the accuracy of the simulations increases. However, the accuracy gained by measuring additional stems decreases with an increasing crop database. A statistical method was therefore presented to determine the minimum number of stem measurements needed to obtain accurate DEM simulations. When the behaviour of crop stems was fully characterized and modelled and after insights were obtained on the influence of stem variability, DEM simulations were performed regarding the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> stems by the rotor of a large square baler. First, a method was developed to create virtual swaths. Scalability was demonstrated with these swaths. This reduced the computation time of thesimulations. Again, friction was found to have a significant impact on the crop processing as a higher coefficient of friction led to a higher energy consumption. When stems are damaged, less energy is required for their processing. Also, the feed rate was found to have an influence. The energy demand increased as more stems were processed simultaneously. Finally, the shape of the swath was also found to have a major impact on the required torque. An evenly filled swath was found to require less processing energy than an unevenly filled swath. In a final step, the filling of the pre-compression chamber was also simulated and successfully validated with stationary measurements. An increasing swath mass, the presence of the trip sensors (determining when the the pre-compression chamber is full) and a reduced rotor speed were found to have a negative impact on the required energy. The crop flow in the simulations was visually compared to the crop flow in the measurements. A high-speed camera was used for this purpose. The crop flows were found to be similar. However, a quantitative analysis should be performed to confirm this. The simulation model is now ready for the optimization of the design of the pick-up and feeding sections of the agricultural baler. The knowledge that was gained in this dissertation is more broadly applicable and could, for example, also be used for optimizing sections of the combine and the forage harvester. However, more research is required to accurately simulate nodes, leafs and ears. The influence of the strain rate and the number of stem measurements required to obtain accurate DEM simulations of crops should also be studied in more detail. Modelling the cutting and breaking of stems would have a positive effect on the accuracy and the applicability of the simulations. Since in many processes air currents have a major impact, a coupling with a CFD software is also necessary. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|E

In SSA, environmental disasters (e.g., droughts, floods), forest destruction for agriculture, decreasing soil fertility, and crop failure due to diseases are important threats to traditional foods (Dossou-Aminon et al. 2014). At the heart of economic reasons is the second food regime, which is also present in SSA because <b>of</b> changing <b>cropping</b> and food systems where farmers are abandoning traditional foods for a few selected food and cash crops demanded by multinational food and fiber industries. Indeed, the diversion of farm labor to the production and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> most demanded by Western countries’ markets is also a reason of the disappearance of traditional foods. The increasing dependence of newly independent post-colonial states on imported food grains, such as wheat, from developed countries to feed their burgeoning populations was—and is still being—paid for by the greater production <b>of</b> industrial <b>crops</b> (e.g., cotton) and high-value tropical and temperate food crops, with damaging consequences for traditional, subsistence-oriented agricultural systems (Atkins and Bowler 2001, p. 27). In general, weak food distribution system and decreasing income or growing poverty are the main drivers of perverse food substitution, unbalanced diets, and malnutrition in those countries (Atkins and Bowler, 2001, p. 118; UNDP-Benin 2011, p. 66 & 73).|$|R
40|$|For timely <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crop,</b> sugar {{factories}} need boiler stations that can reliably produce steam when fired with fuel of variable quality. The control systems installed on most sugar factory boilers have changed {{little in the}} last thirty years and in some cases the default control system response to changes in fuel and/or fuel quality is not correct and operator intervention is required to prevent factory stoppages or reductions in crushing rate caused by poor combustion. Some factories have recently modified their boiler control systems for improved combustion performance and reduced maintenance costs. This paper describes testing carried out to evaluate some of these control system modifications and identifies boiler control system changes that can be applied more widely in the sugar industry. ...|$|R
50|$|The tea {{produced}} at this tea estate is auctioned at the Kolkata Tea Auction Centre {{and has been}} able to garner one of the highest bids for its tea. Its export potential is gradually increasing and the Tea Board of the estate is making efforts to have direct link with international markets. In an effort to increase the production of tea in Sikkim, the Industry Department of Sikkim has given an open invitation to entrepreneurs to establish more tea gardens in Sikkim. The state Government, under the Tenth Five Year Development Plan, has identified tea under the long term strategy “raising and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> plantation <b>crops</b> i.e. tea, oranges and cardamom” as one of the thrust areas for industrial development of Sikkim.|$|R
40|$|The {{livelihood}} {{of humanity}} depends crucially {{on the growing}} and harvesting <b>of</b> <b>crops,</b> the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> to produce the various foods that are eaten {{and the distribution of}} the resulting products and produce to the various consumers. The underlying biological foundation on which the success of this complex industrial hierarchy of activity rests is the success of the ongoing process of plant breeding. Not only must plants be bred to ensure that the planned end-products, such as bread, cakes, pasta and noodles, are of acceptable quality, they must, in order to minimize crop failure and thereby ensure food security and supply, also be insect and/or disease resistant. The success of such endeavours rests {{on the quality of the}} underlying science, which has become highly sophisticated in recent years. Its utilization, in terms of the modern understanding of the genetics of plant growth and the increasing sophistication of experimentation and instrumentation, has greatly improved the speed and quality of plant breeding. The associated implementation of these new plant breeding protocols is generating a need for improved quantification through the utilization of mathematical modelling. In order to illustrate the diverse range of mathematics required to support such quantification, this paper discusses some illustrative aspects connected with the recent modelling of the flow and deformation of wheat-flour dough, information recovery from spectroscopic data (e. g. such as the determination of the protein content in wheat), antiviral resistance in plants and pattern formation in plants. Various aspects of the mathematics involved are highlighted from a mathematical modelling perspective, with a key secondary goal, using the discussion about these examples, of illustrating how applications impact on mathematics with the resulting mathematical developments in turn contributing to the solution of other applications with the process starting all over again...|$|R
