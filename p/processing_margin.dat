40|$|The New Zealand export meat {{industry}} has been through {{a considerable number of}} changes in the 1980 s. The deregulation of export slaughter facilities, Supplementary Minimum Prices, Producer Board intervention, declining livestock numbers and domestic cost pressures have all affected the performance of the domestically based processing sector. Major changes in market access and demand have influenced off-shore marketing operations, particularly for sheepmeats. Additionally, there has been a change in the type of meat exported with a greater proportion of further processed product shipped in recent years. As an example of the impact of these developments on livestock producers, the producer share of the United Kingdom wholesale market return for a representative prime lamb carcase has fallen from 40 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1988. In this article the pattern of intervention in the New Zealand pastoral meat industries from the mid- 1960 s is detailed, emphasising the different environments of the beef and sheepmeat enterprises.

40|$|Debate on Indonesia's {{palm oil}} policy was stimulated by a sharp {{increase}} in cooking oil prices in 1994 - 95 and a resulting increase in the export tax rate on crude palm oil. Palm oil {{has been one of the}} fastest growing subsectors in Indonesia. Using a quantitative model, the author analyzes the effect of government policies, including the export tax, buffer stock operations by the BULOG (the national logistics agency), and directed sales from public estates. The author acknowledges the export tax's effectiveness in lowering domestic prices, but observes that its impact on inflation and consumer welfare is minimal. The tax has also had the unintended effect of transferring income from oil palm growers located primarily off Java. The structure of the tax discourages local processing by squeezing <b>processing</b> <b>margins.</b> And determining tax rates on palm oil products independent from the underlying crude palm oil price creates uncertainty about marketing margins for processors. The author recommends repealing the tax and discontinuing buffer stock operations and directed sales from public estates. The author concludes with recommendations on investment policy. Direct incentives to private investors have been used to overcome investment risks and uncertainties, but investors should no longer need those incentives. Instead, Indonesia's government should focus more on alleviating obstacles to private investment. The Bank might be of assistance in this area.

JORDMOD II is recursive-dynamic Multi-Commodity model for Norway which fixed international prices, regionalized at the level of 18 NUTS III regions. Interregional trade flows and related price formation is based on the Spatial Equilibrium approach. The about twenty agricultural netputs covered by the model are simulated based on a Normalized Qudratic Profit function in conjunction with a partial adjustment approach, driven by expected prices which are a linear combination of last and current’s year prices. Primary factor prices enter as well the long-run profit function. They can be either fixed or driven by market clearing equations linked to regional factor supply functions. The dairy sector covers seven dairy products and is as well depicted by a Normalized Quadratic Profit function, driven by <b>processing</b> <b>margins</b> for raw milk and dairy outputs which capture the difference between market prices and the value of milk fat and protein per unit of netput. The milk fat and protein prices are determined by market balances. Final demand is depicted by a Generalized Leontief expenditure system. Consumer prices differ from market prices by additive consumer price margins which capture all costs to convert agricultural raw products to final demand products. The behavioral functions are parameterized using Highest Posterior Density estimators which use a priori information on elasticities in conjunction with constraints which ensure globally regularity conditions. JORDMID II is encoded in GAMS and hosted on a Software Versioning System. It is steered by a Graphical User Interface implemented in GGIG (GAMS Graphical Interface Generator).

40|$|This study {{examines}} strategies for hedging processing operations generally and uses soybean processing {{as a specific}} example. The approach assumes a mean-variance utility function {{but because of the}} focus on hedging, the analysis concentrates on risk minimization with risk defined as the variance of the <b>processing</b> <b>margin</b> from its currently expected level. We find that risk so defined contains three components. These are (1) the risk of input/output cash price misalignment at the time of transactions, (2) the risk resulting from the firm's inability to utilize inputs and produce outputs in proportion to the mix that minimizes risk in cash market transactions, and (3) the risk of price change during the time between the purchase of inputs and the sale of outputs. The first two risk components are transformation risk while the third is inventory risk. The relationships between inventory and transformation risks were examined using daily price data from January 1, 1990 through March 23, 2000. Our analysis indicates that inventory risk is the largest of the three components, it increases in a roughly linear relationship with the temporal separation between pricing of inputs and outputs, it is the risk that is hedged with usual hedging models, and that hedging reduces this risk by a proportion of its amount. Consequently, even when hedged, processors face risks that increase with the time that separates the pricing of inputs and outputs and this risk is far larger than the risk of product transformation. In soybean processing, the proportion of risk eliminated through hedging reaches a peak for process lengths of one week with gradual declines thereafter. We also find that the risk-minimizing hedge ratios for soybean meal and soybean oil depend on the length of the anticipated hedging period. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|Preferences of {{the firm}} for stable or varying flows of raw {{products}} are considered. A decision model involving rate and hours of plant operation is developed to measure the. impact of supply variations on plant costs and profits. Situations in which the firm can and cannot pre-dict raw material receipts with certainty are simulated. Varying supplies were found to raise costs of slaughter, but plants with stable supplies lose profits as long as product and input prices vary. Therefore individual firms, especially those that can forecast {{with a high degree}} of success, are unlikely to prefer stable to varying supplies. I NSTABILITY in agricultural processing in-dustries often results from variations in thesupplies of farm products available to pro-cessing plants. To be sure, the processing firm is also likely to be uncertain about other vari-ables; prices of other inputs, qualities of raw-material supplies, and demand conditions for the processed products each may vary and none be subject to prediction with certainty. Variation in raw-product supplies alone does not imply uncertainty, however, for although raw-material supplies may vary the firm may be able to predict the variation. Moreover, quality variations at the firm level should not be viewed separately from fluctuations in raw-product and processed-product prices. Optimal firm output for each production period is a func-tion of the <b>processing</b> <b>margin</b> and other decision variables and will vary from period to period in response to anticipated or actual changes in them. Previous studies usually have been concerned with the effects on annual plant costs of short-term (month-to-month or week-to-week) varia-tions in rates of operation.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the development of}} the U. S. ethanol industry, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) launched the ethanol futures contract in March 2005. This contract is promoted by the CBOT as allowing ethanol producers to hedge corn crushing using strategies similar to those used in soybean crushing. The similarities end, however, when the lack of short-term correlation between corn and ethanol prices is compared to the strong correlation between soybean and soy product prices. This contrast motivates the examination of the price risk management capabilities of the CBOT’s ethanol futures contract. Standard hedging methodology is applied to weekly cash and futures price data from March 23, 2005 through March 7, 2007. Findings include (1) for two- to eight-week hedging horizons, the ethanol futures contract effectively hedges ethanol inventory price risk. The effectiveness of the hedge increases with the hedging horizon. Thus, ethanol producers and brokers can use the ethanol futures market to reduce the price risk of holding ethanol inventories. (2) Contrary to anecdotal evidence, ethanol futures are not significantly inferior to gasoline futures for hedging ethanol price risk and for a four-week hedge they are significantly superior to gasoline futures. Thus, ethanol producers and brokers get greater price risk protection from hedging with ethanol futures than with gasoline futures. (3) The corn crushing hedge, utilizing corn and ethanol futures contracts, is an effective means to “lock in” a <b>processing</b> <b>margin.</b> The effectiveness of this hedge increases as the hedging horizon increases. Finally, to understand the processing hedge, the corn crush hedge and the soybean crush hedge were compared. I found that (4) the price risk of corn crushing is greater than that of soybean crushing and the effectiveness of corn crush hedging exceeds that of soybean crush hedging. This difference is explained by the high correlations in the soybean complex. ethanol futures, hedging, cross hedging, corn crushing, processing hedge,...|$|E

40|$|Executive summary 1. This study 1 of {{co-ordination}} of the hog/pork {{industry in}} Denmark {{is part of}} a project including the industries in Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands and the United States. The Danish hog/pork industry is export driven, and Denmark is one of the world’s largest pork exporters with over 75 % of its output going to some 100 countries. 2. The Danish hog/pork system is a vertically integrated system with integration from the primary producer to the processing companies. The strength of the Danish industry can mainly be attributed to its co-operative nature, that it is centrally organised, and controlled and owned by the industry itself, namely the pig producers. 3. During the last five years, the Danish pork industry has changed, slaughtering is now concentrated in the four largest firms accounting for 95 % of capacity. Processing (beyond primal cuts) is also concentrated and is integrated with slaughtering operations. The four slaughtering firms are all farmer-owned co-operatives. 4. To ensure greater stability in the market and {{to make it easier for}} farmers and abattoirs in their management activity, prices are set by a committee each week and are based on market conditions on export markets. Using a predetermined <b>processing</b> <b>margin</b> the price to be paid to pig farmers is then set; consequently each producer receives the same price for a given specification. This saves on transportation costs as there is no price incentive for producers to send live pigs over long distances and it eliminates marketing costs such as the need for markets, middlemen or a network of buyers employed by the abattoir. 5. Bonuses will vary from co-operative to co-operative depending on its cost structure and selling activity. A poor performance by one co-operative with a consequent lower bonus will result in producers switching to another co-operative, for large producers the bonus payment represents a significant source of income. It is this factor that ensures the competitiveness of the individual pig abattoir co-operative. 6. The development in the Danish pork industry is characterised by changes in demand, consumption and demographics towards more attention to soft product quality traits such as animal welfare, “ethical products” and product origin. The habits of today’s consumer are changing towards convenience products and foreign eating habits, which among other things has led to an increasing catering industry. Especially in the areas productivity and technology there has been an increasing focus on specialisation in production and other production aspects such as monitoring technology and biotechnology. Over the years, pork production has become more knowledge intensive, which creates a demand for a skilled and flexible workforce. There is also a pressure on the industry to adopt the latest technology to remain cost and product competitive. 7. In order to meet this pressure attention must be paid to increased product development, larger market flexibility and improved responsiveness. Optimisation of the full chain rather than focus on costs at each stage is also required to meet the pressure. At the same time the system management, among other things, has to be focused on meeting the consumer need for information and increasing the quality of farm management.

40|$|Saskatchewan’s lentil {{producers}} are positively impacted when their temporary competitive {{advantage in the}} industry, which in part is derived from high yielding Saskatchewan-bred lentil varieties, is eroded though ineffective intellectual property (IP) protection. The ineffective IP protection occurs due to the inconsistency in the enforcement of policies and laws across countries, {{making it difficult to}} protect IP when exporting products. Additionally, intellectual property protection of lentils is inefficient is when viable seeds are obtained by other countries through the export of whole seeds. This is because lentils are an open pollinated crop and intellectual property cannot be protected through hybrid seed technology. This is an issue because the Canadian red lentil (CRL) varieties have been bred for the Saskatchewan climate, but are well suited to grow in countries that have similar climates, and therefore are well adapted to large regions of Russia and Kazakhstan. The similarity in growing conditions, coupled with the lack of IP protection for the CRL varieties makes it possible for Russia and Kazakhstan to use imported Saskatchewan bred lentil varieties to grow in their lentil industry. When Russia and Kazakhstan grow the CRL varieties it directly competes with Saskatchewan’s production in the world market, eroding the producer surplus of Saskatchewan producers. This thesis estimates the economic benefit to Canadian growers of restricting access to Canadian varieties through a value chain that genetically protects the CRL varieties by exporting only de-hulled red lentils. A dynamic, multi-country, partial equilibrium model is used to estimate the effects de-hulling CRL varieties before export will have on the Canadian lentil industry. This model determines the effects that de-hulling CRL's will have on Canadian lentil producer's welfare by comparing the results from when there is genetic protection (GP) for the CRL varieties before they are export and then there is no genetic protection (noGP) for the CRL varieties. In my thesis, I examine four potential scenarios for the future lentil production in Russia and Kazakhstan over the next twenty years. The four growth scenarios that are examined for Russia and Kazakhstan’s lentil industries range from no convergence to full convergence. No convergence is when Russia and Kazakhstan continue producing lentils with their 2011 lentil hectares until 2034. Full convergence is when both countries converge to the Canadian lentil industry’s ratio of lentil hectares to spring wheat hectares. The empirical model results show that producer surplus gained by Canadian lentil {{producers are}} increased when Canadian firms use GP to protect the intellectual property rights (IPR) of new CRL varieties. My results show that lentil prices in the global market will be modestly higher when there is GP for lentils versus when there is noGP for lentils over the next twenty years. The difference in the prices of the noGP case and the GP case gets larger as Russia and Kazakhstan go from no convergence to full convergence. The price impacts of GP in 2034 range from a $ 0. 52 per tonne increase with no convergence to a $ 5. 92 per tonne increase with full convergence. If the net <b>processing</b> <b>margin</b> is not increased, GP will produce a 2012 discounted price of $ 2. 41 billion over the 2014 - 2034 period, suggesting only modest returns from GP. When all four convergence scenarios are evaluated and weighted by expected probabilities of occurrence, the estimated overall economic impact for Canadian lentil producers from 2014 to 2034 will be $ 47. 12 million in additional producer surplus (PS), which is equal to an increased price of $ 3. 41 per tonne. For this to be feasible the cost of de-hulling the lentils must be profitable to the processors at $ 3. 41 per tonne or less...|$|E

The meat marketing chains in Slovenia are characterised by relatively large <b>processing</b> and marketing <b>margins,</b> which are expected to decline with market deregulation and integration into the international markets. As results of the economic restructuring and policy reforms, competitive market pressures in a marketing margin determination have increased, inducing pressures for efficiency improvements in the vertical market integration from the farm to the retail stage in the Slovenian meat sector. Co-integration models are applied to estimate vertical market integration and to assess the degree of price competition in the Slovenian beef and pork marketing chains. The tested econometric models confirmed the existence of the long run market integration in the meat chain and the speed of adjustment of price changes. Farm-gate meat prices are identified as weakly exogenous, indicating the crucial role of supply side processing and marketing factors in the retail meat price determination. The results of structural tests suggest a long-run mark-up price strategy in the beef, and a competitive price strategy in the pork, chain as the outcome of policy reforms. The increased competitive market pressures are very likely to increase efficiency in the beef markets. Efficiency improvements in the Slovenian food markets are needed in the increased competitive market pressures of the enlarged European Union markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Andesite {{petrogenesis}} {{is inextricably}} linked to plate <b>processing</b> at convergent <b>margins.</b> The details of andesite formation, however, remain poorly understood because the signatures of the initial arc mantle melts are often modified in the overlying crust. To distinguish initial mantle from crustal signatures in arc magmas, we studied two compositionally zoned Holocene monogenetic volcanoes, Texcal Flow and Volcan Chichinautzin, in the central Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB). Texcal Flow and V. Chichinautzin erupt ‘ocean island basalt (OIB) -type’, high-Nb (17 – 36 ppm), olivine-phyric basalts to basaltic andesites (49 · 4 – 57 · 3 wt % SiO 2; Mg# = 68 – 50) that show an arc affinity in their major element oxides. At both volcanoes melt SiO 2 increases with time. However, systematic changes of melt SiO 2 with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, the overall low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0 · 70305 – 0 · 70453 and high 143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0 · 51273 – 0 · 51299 relative to continental crust, and the high 3 He/ 4 He = 7 – 8 Ra of olivine phenocrysts preclude melt silica enrichment by crustal assimilation and fractional crystallization. Instead, the data require the existence of silicic initial mantle melts. The high Ni abundances of olivines suggest that the silicic melts originate from segregations of ‘reaction pyroxenites’ that formed in the peridotite mantle wedge following multiple infiltrations of silicic slab components. Sequential melting of zoned silica-deficient to silica-excess pyroxenites can reproduce the time-progressive evolution of melt silica content at Texcal Flow and V. Chichinautzin. As initial melts always have high Mg# > 70 regardless of their SiO 2 content, the low-Mg# values of the magmas erupted must reflect loss of moderate amounts (&# 60; 15 %) of olivine and possibly pyroxenes at crustal levels. Fractional crystallization and recharge mixing nearly erase all mantle signatures in the most silicic V. Chichinautzin magmas, so that their origin can only be inferred from their association with the more mafic precursory melts. The pyroxenite model implies that ∼ 15 – 18 wt % of the erupted melt mass, and possibly more, is slab-derived. We infer that the elements Fe, Mg, Ca and Ti are principally mantle-derived, whereas significant amounts of the elements Si, K, Na, P and possibly Al may be contributed from slab. As blends of mantle and slab materials, the OIB-type Texcal Flow and V. Chichinautzin magmas provide limited indication of {{the composition of the}} sub-arc mantle prior to subduction modification, which is inferred to be similar to primitive mantle, but less enriched than the sources of the intraplate magmas behind the MVB volcanic front...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Adam Smith, markets have been {{considered}} an efficient tool for co-ordinating the behaviour of economic agents. The basic characteristic of a market economy is that the complex system of interaction among individuals is not centrally coordinated. Under the assumption of profit and utility maximisation (and {{a whole set of}} assumptions about the institutional framework), relative prices and their change over time provide the signals that guide, like an invisible hand, the allocation of resources, i. e., the structure of production and the intensity of input use in the various production processes. They do this by co-ordinating the activities of economic agents, i. e., of resource owners, producers, intermediaries, traders, and consumers. After system change in the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) central economic planning had to be replaced by other forms of co-ordination. The general direction in all transition countries was towards a market economy, but the speed and depth of reforms towards an environment in which markets can evolve differed largely between countries, sectors and between different phases during the past 15 years. IAMO Forum 2005 focuses on this development and discusses the functioning of markets, the requirements for this, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} other co-ordination mechanisms under different environments in the agricultural and food sectors in Central and Eastern Europe. CEE agri-food markets deserve researchers' and policy makers' attention for several reasons. Two of them regard the high demand for support to policy decisions that aim to stimulate economic and social development in the region. In most CEE countries, the significance of the agricultural and food sector is relatively high with respect to income and employment. In particular, rural areas can benefit from the development of this branch of the economy. Also, there is marked indication that agri-food markets in CEE are not ensuring exchange as frictionless as possible. This means that large benefits can be expected if potential improvements of the economic environment are implemented and if individual agents adapt optimally to that environment. Another motivation for economic research on transition countries is that we are looking at a huge region that started almost as a vacuum with regard to institutional settings. This means that a wide range of substantially different settings were introduced in the respective countries, and were only weakly confined by political rigidities or path dependencies. From a distant perspective, the repeated fundamental shifts in recent economic policies almost evoke the impression of a trial and error approach. The consequences of distinctively different options (across countries and periods) can be observed in a way almost similar to a laboratory situation. Such unique opportunity has attracted economists, particularly those interested in institutional economics, to conduct research on CEE. However, this also means that the experiences made in CEEC can enhance the general understanding of what markets can do and what the limitations of market coordination are. This volume contains selected contributions presented at IAMO Forum 2005 and gives an overview of the major topics discussed there. Partial analyses of specific economic problems usually abstract from the general economic framework which is assumed to be more or less constant as expressed in ceteris paribus clauses. Oftentimes, the set of institutional conditions is even assumed to be sufficiently well-described by the framework used in neoclassical models. Particularly for transition countries, this has frequently led to spurious results because crucial aspects of the framework actually in place were not considered, and sometimes were not even thought of. An extreme and very obvious example is the neglect of the effects of the replacement of monetary by nonmonetary exchange in phases of a barter economy. There is no generic approach to avoid unintended omission of crucial framework conditions, but it must generally be emphasised that a broad look at the various interdependent markets and at the entire socioeconomic context of a country is needed before going into detail. Descriptive analyses of the situation in various markets form part of such a broad look. The contributions of POPP, FERTÃ et al., WILKIN et al., and HEIN in the chapter Selected analyses from CEEC provide excellent examples, and focus on market developments in new EU member countries. On the one hand, the papers show the heterogeneity of problems e. g. due to largely differing farm structures. On the other hand, several common patterns can be observed: The market shares and power of large processors and retailers (hypermarkets, etc.) are increasing. Also, international (especially intra-EU) trade in commodities has increased in response to CAP-induced price harmonisation. Both tendencies weaken the market position of farmers, particularly small entities which cannot supply in volumes sufficient for large processing and trade firms. Within the food industry concentration increased as many smaller firms could not comply with EU processing standards and had to quit the market. The increased size and specialization of large producers, as well as of large processors, made many of those firms co-ordinate business with each other through long-term contractual agreements rather than by relying on spot markets. This tendency is very distinct in the fruit and vegetable sector, as WILKINâs contribution describes. Two contributions draw attention to the institutional framework itself, mainly by looking at circumstances which prevent market allocation from leading to an optimal outcome. HOBBS describes factors that impede investment and growth by drawing on transaction cost economics. Situations typical for transition countries are highlighted where e. g. transparency is not sufficient or the existence and reliable enforcement of contract or corporate law are not guaranteed. NUPPENAU stresses the need for the appropriate and precise formulation of land property rights, which should evoke a balance between governance and exclusion. The importance of appropriate and reliable institutions to avoid flaws is emphasised. But even with suitable institutions, transaction costs cannot be reduced to zero. The main reason for this is that since agents may gain form a head start of information, incentives to reveal their knowledge are quite restricted. Furthermore, some of the information required to make correct decisions is not available. This especially concerns information regarding all future contingencies. An uncertain future and the asymmetric distribution of information impose special problems when decisions have long-term effects and agents are linked together through investment decisions. This offers possibilities for opportunistic behaviour, i. e., when an agent behaves in a way that allows him to extract rents from the partners' activities. The friction induced in such situations may result in a market outcome that is biased by transaction costs. Mitigating this bias should be a goal of public policy but it is also in the interest of (at least some of the) private agents involved. This issue is discussed in more detail in the papers dealing with alternative governance structures. A number of contributions to IAMO Forum highlight approaches for measuring the well-functioning of markets. While studies that aim to directly measure transaction costs are very rare and are necessarily limited to comparing only very specific portions of transaction costs, most studies focus on indirect indicators. These usually start from the idea that in a well-functioning, competitive market any supply or demand shocks are reflected in price changes, not only in the particular market where the shock occurs but also in other, related markets, i. e., in different locations or at different stages of the production and marketing chain. Consequently, an approach for assessing the functioning of markets is to compare price differentials with processing-, marketing- or transfer-costs, or â since these costs are usually difficult to quantify â to observe price differentials over time. Accepting the assumption that the costs reflected by price differentials are more or less constant (or stationary) over the observed time span, any additional price changes or a lack of price co-movement is interpreted as an indication for insufficiently connected or insufficiently functioning markets. Three contributions in the chapter Analytical approaches for measuring market efficiency describe analyses which mainly focus on the vertical dimension, i. e., between market stages. BOJNEC, in his descriptive price analysis for several agricultural products in Slovenia since 1991, finds a heterogeneous development of the farm gate/consumer price spread: The <b>processing</b> and marketing <b>margins</b> increased for wheat and beef while they declined for grapes (processed to wine), sugar and poultry. BRÃMMER and ZORYA, as well as BAKUCS and FERTÃ, use cointegration analysis to describe the degree and nature of vertical price integration in the Ukrainian wheat market and the Hungarian pork market, respectively. Both studies find that price changes are transmitted vertically, that there is a tendency to "correct" any deviations from some underlying equilibrium price-relationship. However, such error correction mechanisms are found not to be a constant, universal force. In the Hungarian paper, it could only be found for a sub-period of the observed time span, excluding the highly volatile early 1990 s. Also, equilibrium was found to be achieved by adjustment of farm gate prices only while the retail prices were found to be exogenous, i. e., not responding to any disequilibrium. The paper on Ukraine shows that adjustment processes between wheat and wheat flour prices cannot be|$|R
