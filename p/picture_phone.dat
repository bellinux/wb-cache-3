This {{was similar to}} precursors at previous World's Fairs, though those were simply homes furnished with modern conveniences and aimed at housewives. Disneyland's attraction displayed conveniences such as <b>picture</b> <b>phones</b> and television remote controls, and it introduced many people to their first microwave oven. The Viewliner also opened where guests could ride in [...] "the fastest miniature train in the world." [...] It closed the next year making it the shortest lived Disney attraction ever.|$|R

5000|$|CEO Harple saw a {{potential}} market for InSoft's {{products in the}} early Internet, which was a low-bandwidth, copper wire-based technology at the time. Despite his board's warnings that developing Internet applications would [...] "kill our direct sales", Harple set up an internal company skunk works team to create a low cost, mass market version of InSoft's software that would run over the lower bit-rate Internet. This involved the invention of lower bit rate compression algorithms for audio and video signals and synchronization. When the resulting new Internet product was nearing completion, word of [...] "a possible <b>picture</b> <b>phone</b> for the Internet" [...] reached Netscape founder James H. Clark, and he traveled to InSoft headquarters for a demonstration. He was so impressed that he promptly proposed a merger with Netscape.|$|E
5000|$|One futuristic device {{shown in}} the film already under {{development}} when the film was released in 1968 was voice-print identification; the first prototype was released in 1976. A credible prototype of a chess-playing computer already existed in 1968, even though it could be defeated by experts; computers did not defeat champions until the late 1980s. While 10-digit phone numbers for long-distance national dialing originated in 1951, longer phone numbers for international dialing became a reality in 1970. Installation of personal in-flight entertainment displays by major airlines began in the early-to-mid 1990s, offering video games, TV broadcasts and movies {{in a manner similar}} to that {{shown in the}} film. The film also shows flat-screen TV monitors, of which the first real-world prototype appeared in 1972 produced by Westinghouse, but was not used for broadcast television until 1998. Plane cockpit integrated system displays, known as [...] "glass cockpits", were introduced in the 1970s (originally in NASA Langley's Boeing 737 Flying Laboratory). Today such cockpits appear not only in high-tech aircraft like the Boeing 777, but have also been employed in space shuttles, the first being Atlantis in 1985. Rudimentary voice-controlled computing began in the early 1980s with the SoftVoice Computer System and existed in more sophisticated form by the early 2000s, although not as sophisticated as depicted in the film. The first <b>picture</b> <b>phone</b> was demonstrated at the 1964 New York World's Fair; however, due to the bandwidth limitations of telephone lines, personal video communication did not succeed commercially and has only been practical over broadband internet connections. Personal (audio) wireless telephones were ubiquitous in 2001, and yet no one in the movie had a small personal communication device.|$|E
40|$|The traffic {{within the}} control unit of a {{broadband}} switching system is modelled by a stochastic Petri net. In particular, random switches included in this Petri net concept are applied to model the separation of signalling data according {{to the type of}} service requested by the subscribers, and the multiple use of the <b>picture</b> <b>phone</b> during a telephone session is modelled by correlated parallel paths in the Petri net model. The size and the complexity of the Petri net presented is independent of the number of processors of the control unit. The Petri net is analysed by evaluating the Markov chain equivalent to the net. In this connection for the evaluation of the entire control unit the decomposition of the transition rate matrix corresponding to the net is proposed. A performance measure associated with the switching delay is presented in order to show the applicability of the approach. Two configurations of the control unit are investigated and the results are presented graphically...|$|E

40|$|As {{the variety}} of applications, {{especially}} distributed multimedia applications, explodes, their requirements on communication -relevant tasks increase. Besides a communication architecture for dealing with traditional communication protocol processing, multicast features and security requirements {{have to be considered}} in an integrated manner. Therefore, a multicast-capable and security-aware communication subsystem is developed to provide necessary functionality to support an integrated set of reuseable application elements, e. g., audio/video-presentation, application sharing, <b>picture</b> <b>phone,</b> extended WWW browser, tele-banking, or tele-seminar. The main goal includes the provision of a real-world application framework, where different traditional and emerging applications can be managed modularily. Their needs and communication demands in terms of Quality-of-Service (QoS) attributes are specified by numerical values, e. g., bandwidth requirements, delay boundaries, reliability issues. Furthermore, functional features, such as multicast groups, encryption desires, or authentication requests can be selected. In turn, the developed communication subsystem allows for the preparation of flexibly adjusted communication protocols that provide requested functionality, e. g., error control schemes, multicast addressing, encryption, or authentication. Finally, a best suited service for these application requests is offered...|$|E

In my lifetime, I can recall any number of similar, wellintentioned, and seriously thought-out predictions, from those forecasting the inevitable death of the internal-combustion engine auto to the widespread adoption of the <b>picture</b> <b>phone.</b> All these predictions were made by intelligent and thoughtful industry observers who believed that their predictions would come to pass because of their faith in the benefits that a new technology provided. These observers were focused on looking beyond the present into the future and assumed that, in the future, their prediction would inevitably become a reality. 54 If we have learned anything as either consumers or businesspeople in the twenty-first century, it is simply that it doesn’t always work that way.

50|$|Since {{international}} news media was banned in Syria, {{the main source}} of second-hand information/dis-information was private videos usually taken by shaky mobile phone cameras and uploaded to YouTube. Such videos were difficult to verify independently, and several TV stations showed older footage from Iraq and Lebanon, which was claimed to have been filmed in Syria. Twitter accounts have also been used to spread news and opinions about the conflict, using <b>pictures</b> from mobile <b>phones.</b> Rana Harbi from Lebanon {{is one of the most}} popular persons using tweets to inform about the conflict development (using <b>pictures</b> from mobile <b>phones).</b> She is pro Assad and anti opposition tweeter.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{well-documented}} {{increases in}} obesity and unhealthy dietary practices substantiate {{the need for}} evidence-based tools that can help people improve their dietary habits. The current spread of mobile phone–embedded cameras offers new opportunities for recording food intake. Moreover, the act of taking pictures of food consumed may enhance visual consciousness of food choice and quantity. The present study aimed to assess the effect of using cell <b>phone</b> <b>pictures</b> to record food intake on energy intake and food choice in college students. The effectiveness and acceptability of cell phone picture–based diet recording also was assessed. Methods: A repeated measures crossover design was used. One group of participants entered their food intake online during 3 days based on their memory, although a second group recorded their food intake using cell <b>phone</b> <b>pictures</b> as their reference. Participants then crossed over to complete 3 more days of diet recording using the alternate method. Focus groups were conducted to obtain feedback on the effectiveness and acceptability of cell phone picture–based diet recording. Results: Intake of meat and vegetable servings were significantly higher in the memory period compared with the cell phone period, regardless of the order. Results from the focus group indicated {{a positive attitude toward}} the use of cell <b>phone</b> <b>pictures</b> in recording food intake and an increased awareness of food choice and portion size. Linking Evidence to Action: Cell <b>phone</b> <b>pictures</b> may be an easy, relevant, and accessible method of diet self-monitoring when aiming at dietary changes. Future trials should combine this technique with healthy eating educationPublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Many {{universities}} have developed interactive and web-based campus maps. The spatial features of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are usually incorporated in such maps, thereby facilitating visual searches. The {{aim of this}} study is to design and develop an interactive, user-friendly and web-based Beytepe Campus Map to process visual queries. The Google Maps API application builder has been used to design the user interface for our campus map. Data has been gathered about several different places on campus and they were tagged on the map using CommunityWalk’s place-pointing feature. Brief notes (dormitory capacities, <b>pictures,</b> <b>phone</b> numbers, etc.) about each place using explanation buttons have been added. A simple ontology comprising eight categories, each with its own sub-categories to represent the places at the Beytepe Campus has been developed. The MapCruncher software of Microsoft has been used to cut the map and paste it on to Google Maps for predefined granularity levels. A new button added to place the Beytepe campus map on Google Maps. To develop the mashup application using Google Maps API, we wrote the programming code using the Google Code Playground. We used JavaScript and JavaScript libraries to modify the user interface. In summary, the new campus map is more functional. The user interface can be improved in terms of design and functionality by adding new features...|$|R

50|$|The {{integration}} {{of music in}} a cellphone was not easy. On one hand, technology for portable music had been developed since the 1980s with Sony driving the area with its portable walkman. On the other, cellphone technology had focused on the area of imaging, leveraging the user interest in taking pictures and the operator´s need to drive data revenues {{through the use of}} its network. The success of ringtones in driving data revenues had placed operators on guard for interactive applications that could drive revenues. Nevertheless, slow data speeds in the GSM and CDMA areas which had 1 and 2G technology, prevented the economic download of music data through networks in comparison with media sites to a computer. So operators, which tended to subsidize phones with data capabilities focused more on ringtone, SMS, and <b>picture</b> <b>phones</b> than on music ready phones, and this prevented many manufacturers to develop those phones because their primary customer is the operator and not the user. Work on compression algorithms for music was extensive with AMR trying to push the envelope, but the revolution of Napster proliferated the world with the MP3 format and manufacturers began to take notice. Another issue was the development of DRM capabilities which helped prevent music piracy and gave mobile music more of a legal status. At that time, Apple was revolutionizing the world with the introduction of the new iPods and its iTunes Store.|$|R
40|$|A {{new kind}} of social space is created out of the {{transmission}} and reception of data between mobile phone users. A private communicational space arising from the city’s striated space, a social space born out of a new telecommunications technology. This virtual but real communicational space can be thought as a subversive space, a decentralised network where users generate and exchange their own data, taking <b>pictures,</b> making <b>phone</b> calls, accessing the Net. This paper is exploring the creation and appropriation of this space by its users and investigates broadcasting models where people are {{be able to send}} their text and other multi-media elements and display them onto designated local public screens...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{websites}} {{using traditional}} technologies involve {{large amount of}} coding and huge efforts in small tasks. Moreover, to store data the designers need to use and maintain a database and connect the website through JDBC and ODBC for database transactions and verifications. Such development and management of websites is a difficult task and consumes large human resources and investments. Even for regular updation of websites, the professionals need to be hired. A content management system (CMS) is a system used to manage {{the contents of a}} web site. It is a collection of (manual or computer-based) procedures used to manage work flow in a collaborative environment. The procedures are designed to allow for {{a large number of people}} to contribute to and share stored data; control access to data, based on user roles; aid in easy storage and retrieval of data; reduce repetitive duplicate input; improve the ease of report writing; and improve communication between users. In a CMS, data can be defined as nearly anything, i. e., documents, movies, <b>pictures,</b> <b>phone</b> numbers, scientific data, etc. The features of a CMS system vary but most include web-based publishing, format management, revision control, and indexing, search, and retrieval. A CMS can be easily embedded into a live website so as to help the owner update its content at its own having bare minimum knowledge about coding of the websites. It keeps websites well organised and comprehensive, increases the data security, and reduces the site maintenance costs. In this paper we present a review of some of the popular content management system packages...|$|R
