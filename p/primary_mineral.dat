5|$|Enamel's <b>primary</b> <b>mineral</b> is hydroxyapatite, {{which is}} a {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E

500|$|Among the elements, {{fluorine}} ranks 24th in universal {{abundance and}} 13th in terrestrial abundance. Fluorite, the <b>primary</b> <b>mineral</b> source of fluorine {{which gave the}} element its name, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb [...] meaning [...] "flow" [...] gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World WarII.|$|E

The <b>primary</b> <b>mineral</b> is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium phosphate. Enamel is formed on the tooth while the tooth is developing within the gum, before it erupts into the mouth. Once fully formed, it does not contain blood vessels or nerves. Remineralisation of teeth can repair damage to the tooth to a certain degree but damage beyond that cannot be repaired by the body.

40|$|The {{study of}} uranium-series (U-series) {{isotopes}} in soil and sediment materials {{has been proposed}} to quantify rates and timescales of soil production and sediment transport. Previous works have studied bulk soil or sediment material, which is a complex assemblage of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>minerals</b> and organic compounds. However, the approach relies on the fractionation between U-series isotopes in <b>primary</b> <b>minerals</b> since they were liberated from the parent rock via weathering. In addition, secondary minerals and organic compounds have their own isotopic compositions such that {{the composition of the}} bulk material may not reflect that of <b>primary</b> <b>minerals.</b> Hence, {{there is a need for}} a sample preparation procedure that allows the isolation of <b>primary</b> <b>minerals</b> in soil or fluvial sediment samples. In this study, a sequential extraction procedure to separate <b>primary</b> <b>minerals</b> from soils and sediments was assessed. The procedure was applied to standard rock sample powders (TML- 3 and BCR- 2) to test whether it introduced any artefactual radioactive disequilibrium. A new step was introduced to remove the clay-sized fraction (< 2 μm). Significant amounts (5 - 14 %) of U and Th were removed from the rock standards during the procedure. No significant alteration in (²³⁴U/²³⁸U) and (²³⁰Th/²³⁸U) activity ratios of the rock standards occurred during the procedure. Aliquots of soil sample were subjected to the sequential extraction process to test how each step modifies the uranium-series activity ratios and mineralogy. Although no secondary minerals were detected in the unleached soil aliquots, the sequential leaching process removed up to 17 % of U and Th and modified their activity ratios by up to 3 %. The modification of the activity ratios poses a demand for careful means to avoid redistribution of isotopes back to the residual phase during phase extraction. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{basement}} cored at Site 1201 (west Philippine Basin) during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 195 {{consists of}} a 91 -m-thick sequence of basalts, mostly pillow lavas and perhaps one sheet lava flow, with a few intercalations of hyaloclastite and interpillow sedimentary material. Hydrothermal alteration pervasively affected the basalt sequence, giving rise {{to a variety of}} secondary minerals such as K-Fe-Mg-clay minerals, oxyhydroxides and clay minerals mixtures, natrolite group zeolites, analcite, alkali feldspar, and carbonate. The <b>primary</b> <b>minerals</b> of pillow and sheet basalts that survived the intense hydrothermal alteration were investigated by electron microprobe with the aim of characterizing their chemical composition and variability. The <b>primary</b> <b>minerals</b> are mostly plagioclase, ranging in composition from bytownite through labradorite to andesine, chromian-magnesian-diopside, and spinels, both Ti magnetite (partially maghemitized) and chromian spinel. Overall, the chemical features of the <b>primary</b> <b>minerals</b> of Site 1201 basalts correspond to the primitive character of the bulk rocks, suggesting that the parent magma of these basalts was a mafic tholeiitic magma that most likely only suffered limited fractional crystallization and crystallized at high temperatures (slightly below 1200 °C) and under increasing fO 2 conditions.
