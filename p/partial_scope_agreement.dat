50|$|The Belize-Guatemala <b>Partial</b> <b>Scope</b> <b>Agreement</b> is a {{preferential}} trade agreement between the counties of Belize and Guatemala. Negotiations for the agreement began on November 22, 2004. Both countries signed the agreement on June 26, 2006. Belize ratified the agreement in 2009 and Guatemala ratified it in 2010.

At the end of January 2017, Cuba and CARICOM agreed for the expansion of reciprocal duty-free access to their markets. A significant number of items from CARICOM, including fish, manufactured goods, agricultural products and beer have been approved for duty-free entry into the Cuban market, while CARICOM members agreed to duty-free entry for Cuban goods such as pharmaceuticals. A number of Cuban products were also included in the agreement on which each of CARICOM's More Developed Countries would be allowed to determine the level of preference granted to Cuba. The agreement remains a <b>partial</b> <b>scope</b> <b>agreement</b> covering trade in goods, but initial discussions were also held on trade in services and the agreement envisions further expansion towards a full free trade agreement and to that end contains a built-in plan towards adopting double taxation agreements between CARICOM states and Cuba, agreeing on intellectual property rights and the protection and promotion of investment.|$|E

40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) {{have become an}} indelible feature of the international trading landscape. Most, if not all, RTAs contain provisions that establish procedures for resolving disputes among their signatory members. Yet, the design and functioning of these dispute settlement mechanisms (DSMs) and, more specifically, how they differ from the WTO dispute settlement system remain relatively unexplored. Existing academic literature has primarily focused on the narrow issue of jurisdictional conflict between DSMs of RTAs and the WTO dispute settlement system. Literature mapping out and classifying systematically the DSMs of RTAs is more limited. This research paper goes beyond considering the issue of jurisdictional conflict between the multilateral and regional regimes. We map out the DSMs in RTAs that have been notified to the WTO and were in force {{at the end of}} 2012, and consider a typology of these DSMs based on their nature and design. We also use the data obtained from our mapping exercise in two ways. First, we identify trends and patterns of use, either regionally or by individual countries, of the different types of DSMs in RTAs. Trends are analysed in relation to five key factors: (i) evolution over time, (ii) level of economic development, (iii) regional characteristics, (iv) level of integration (<b>partial</b> <b>scope</b> <b>agreement,</b> free trade agreement or customs union), and (v) configuration (bilateral or plurilateral). Second, we undertake a nuts and bolts analysis of the DSMs of RTAs by examining their approach to various issues in international dispute settlement. Our aim is to draw conclusions {{about the extent to which}} the predominant type of DSM in RTAs has features that are different from those of the WTO dispute settlement system...|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the recent}} work in {{computational}} semantics has addressed the problem of analysing ambiguous sentences; that is, sentences which {{have more than one}} possible meaning. A favoured solution has been to represent ambiguous sentences with underspecified meaning languages which are not committed to any one of the possible meanings, but which allow additional information to be used to determine a correct meaning as it becomes available. A problem facing many underspecified meaning representations is that <b>partial</b> <b>scopes</b> may be expressed which do not correspond to well formed final meaning representations. This paper presents work in progress on providing a solution to this; a structure is proposed which is independent of the grammatical and semantic theories used, but which allows only those partial scopings which are actually available to a speaker.

Given a sentence displaying quantifier scope ambiguity, such as Every man loves a woman, part of the problem of representing the sentence's meaning is to distinguish between the two possible meanings: 8 x(man(x) ! 9 y(woman(y) love(x; y))) where every man loves a (possibly) different woman, or 9 y(woman(y) 8 x(man(x) ! love(x; y))) where a single woman is loved [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The CRJ700 Series 705 {{is based}} on the CRJ900, with a {{business}} class cabin and a reduced maximum seating capacity to allow operation with regional airlines. The Series 705 seats 75 passengers. Some regional airlines have scope clauses with their major airlines that limit the maximum passenger capacity of aircraft they operate. The Air Canada Pilots Association negotiated a <b>scope</b> <b>agreement</b> with Air Canada limiting the maximum seating capacity of any jet aircraft at Air Canada Express to 75 seats. Air Canada Jazz was the launch customer for this aircraft in 2005 with 10 Executive Class and 65 Economy Class seats, all fitted with personal audio/video-on-demand systems. The FAA Type Certificate designation of the CRJ705 is the CL-600-2D15. Jazz Aviation, a subsidiary of Chorus Aviation, operates 16 CRJ705s on behalf of Air Canada and is currently the only operator of this version.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} regional trade agreements (RTAs) on commodity trade, with a particular focus on trade creation and diversion effects. Based on the estimation of the gravity equation for commodity trade, dealing with zero-trade flow and endogeneity problems, we analyze the impacts of various types of RTAs involving 67 countries for 20 commodities during 1980 - 2006. We identify that <b>partial</b> <b>scope</b> (PS) RTAs and RTAs among developing countries tend to cause trade diversion. Taking tariff rates into consideration explicitly, our results suggest that trade diversion {{is likely to be}} caused by the remaining tariffs on imports from non-members, while trade creation would be caused by various factors besides the reduction in tariff rates. As for specific RTAs, the EU is shown to have a trade creation effect in trade of agricultural commodities, while the AFTA and the NAFTA have trade creation effects in all types of machinery trade. These results seem to indicate that regional production and distribution networks in machinery have been formulated thanks to the reduction of tariffs under RTAs. ...|$|R
