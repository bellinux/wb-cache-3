She won the junior {{division}} of the U.S. National Championships, as well as gold medals on three of the four events: uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise. She repeated these accomplishments in 2004. Liukin {{was a member of the}} gold-medal winning U.S. team at the 2003 Pan Am Games; she took second place in the all-around behind fellow American Chellsie Memmel.

5|$|In 2004, Sacramone {{helped the}} U.S. win a team {{gold medal at}} the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Alliance</b> Championships in Honolulu and won the {{individual}} vault title. Her performances caught the attention of the media, which began to mention her as a contender for the American team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. However, at the 2004 U.S. Nationals, an error-filled performance dashed her hopes of an Olympic berth. Although she tied with Mohini Bhardwaj for the silver medal on the vault, she finished in 19th place overall and did not qualify to the Olympic Trials. She also injured her back and required time off to recover.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{first meet}} of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City, where she {{defeated}} 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title. She posted the highest {{score of the}} meet, a 16.600 on the uneven bars. In March, Nastia competed at the Pacific Rim (formerly <b>Pacific</b> <b>Alliance)</b> Championships in San Jose, where she led the American team to a gold medal and won the all-around and balance beam titles. In the team competition, Liukin posted an all-time high score of 16.650 on the uneven bars, but in event finals, she fell on her Gienger release move {{and took a step}} on her dismount, earning a 15.225 and taking second place.|$|E

25|$|During Macri's presidency, Argentina's foreign {{relations}} have shifted substantially from those under Kirchner. He immediately proposed action against Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela for human-rights abuses {{and tried to}} remove the country from Mercosur. This shift {{is part of a}} change in the Latin American pink tide. The other countries in the bloc also opposed Maduro's Chavist government, and prevented Venezuela from taking the pro tempore presidency of Mercosur. The bloc seeks a trade and cooperation agreement with the European Union and closer ties with the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Alliance.</b> Macri agreed with Brazilian president Michel Temer to guarantee free trade between their countries. Macri and Temer increased their interest in better trade relations with Mexico, the second-largest economy in Latin America, when the country became involved a diplomatic conflict with US president Donald Trump.|$|E
25|$|The major trade blocs (or {{agreements}}) in {{the region}} are the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Alliance</b> and Mercosur. Minor blocs or trade agreements are the G3 Free Trade Agreement, the Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Andean Community of Nations (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise. Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico are the only four Latin American nations that have an FTA with the United States and Canada, both members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
25|$|Mexico has {{the fifteenth}} largest nominal GDP and the {{eleventh}} largest by purchasing power parity. The Mexican economy is strongly linked {{to those of}} its North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, especially the United States. Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), joining in 1994. It is classified as an upper-middle income country by the World Bank and a newly industrialized country by several analysts. By 2050, Mexico could become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy. The country is considered both a regional power and middle power, and is often identified as an emerging global power. Due to its rich culture and history, Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh {{in the world by}} number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Mexico is a megadiverse country, ranking fourth in the world by biodiversity. In 2016 it was the eighth most visited country in the world, with 35 million international arrivals.

She competed at the 2006 U.S. Classic as the defending all-around champion, but falls on the uneven bars and floor resulted in a fourth-place finish. However, she scored extremely well on the balance beam and was the only competitor in the meet, junior or senior, to earn a score over 16.00 on this event. After that when she was interviewed on ABC television show Dancing with the stars, she said,"After that, I realized that it's not all about winning. It's about the journey." ...|$|E

While American gymnasts did medal in international competitions such as the Goodwill Games and the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Alliance</b> Championships, they were largely unsuccessful in most major meets.
