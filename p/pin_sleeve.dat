A cartridge loaded with the standard charge of 78 gr g of Du Pont 4350 and a 180 gr g bullet was fired {{into the back of}} the first bullet. It was found that both bullets exited the barrel. The primer had been pierced and the exiting gas entered into the bolt and hit the firing <b>pin</b> <b>sleeve,</b> which was loosened slightly. The bolt was opened by hand but the cartridge stayed stuck in the chamber. When the case was tapped out, it was found to be in good condition except for its pierced primer. It was found that the barrel, just in front of the receiver ring, had expanded from 1.147 in to 1.1496 in. The diameter of the bolt head had expanded from [...]7178 in to [...]7190 in. The head space had increased from [...]2163 in to [...]2174 in. All other dimensions had stayed constant. This test was conducted 15 times. A test {{was conducted with}} a 220 gr g bullet lodged into the bore of the rifle and a 180 gr g grain bullet was fired into the back of this bullet. The result of this test found that the cartridge case head had expanded to [...]545 in. After these additional 15 tests it was found that the head space was set back only a mere [...]001 in.|$|E

30|$|The single-incision TT ACL {{reconstruction}} technique {{still seems}} to be the procedure most commonly performed by orthopedic surgeons [36]. Nevertheless, when using an inâ€“out technique, the surgeon {{may not be able to}} place the tunnel within the margins of the anatomical ACL footprint [3]. In fact, femoral tunnel anatomical placement could be achieved if the starting point is close to the tibial joint line, resulting in a short tibial tunnel with concerns regarding sufficient tunnel length for graft fixation and graft incorporation [23]. Therefore, as suggested by some authors [37], if anatomical positioning of the femoral tunnel cannot be achieved with TT drilling, then an alternative approach may be indicated [38]. The TP technique has been shown to allow for slightly greater femoral tunnel obliquity compared with TT drilling [39]. However, a reported risk of the TP technique for ACL femoral tunnel creation is short tunnel length, which can result in reduced length of tendon graft within the femoral bone tunnel [40, 41]. This is an issue for surgeons desiring to avoid the risk of inadequate graft tissue within a tunnel, particularly when using suspensory fixation devices with fixed loop length, as the loop of the device leaves less length of graft within the tunnel. In fact, the drill angle in TP technique is somewhat constrained due to the combination of knee hyperflexion and portal fixed position just above the medial meniscus and lateral to the medial femoral condylar articular cartilage. On the other hand, the OI technique has the advantage of the flexibility of the over-the-top guides, which allow intraosseous distance measurement before drilling by observing marks on the guide <b>pin</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Therefore, if the distance is too short, manipulation of the drill angle and starting position can be performed to achieve a longer tunnel before drilling, whereas with the TP portal technique, intraosseous distance cannot be measured before pin passage.|$|E

5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using <b>pins,</b> <b>sleeves,</b> strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|R

5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95â€“98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of <b>pins,</b> <b>sleeves,</b> strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{record of}} path of {{insertion}} on the dental cast {{is part of}} the dentistâ€²s work authorization to the dental laboratory technician. The path of insertion record enables the dental technician to replace the cast on a surveyor in the same position that the dentist selected. Analysis of factors that influence the path of insertion should determine a path of insertion that will reduce the potential for dislodgement and promote stability of removable partial denture (RPD). Materials and Methods: The recording of the relation of a cast to a dental surveyor and the transfer of this relationship to the dental laboratory may be done by tripodization, by scoring the base of the cast, or by cementing a reference pin on the cast. Conclusion: Recording the established path of insertion can be difficult when the procedure uses a cemented pin and the casts are mounted in an articulator. This article describes a procedure for innovative dowel <b>pin</b> and <b>sleeve</b> device to record the path of insertion of RPDs, which serves the same purpose as the cemented pin but can be easily removed and replaced...|$|R
