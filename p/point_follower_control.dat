40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} explored why strongly identifying followers endorse prototypical leaders {{by addressing}} {{the role of}} procedural fairness in this process. We introduced the distinction between procedural fairness rules relating to leader benevolence (i. e. whether the leader supports the group's interests) and <b>follower</b> <b>control</b> (i. e., whether followers can influence the leader's decisions). We predicted that strongly identifying group members endorse prototypical leaders because they perceive such leaders as acting in line with benevolence related fairness rules rather than because such leaders are perceived as giving <b>followers</b> <b>control.</b> An organizational field study and a laboratory experiment revealed support for these ideas. Our results thus provide insights into why prototypical leaders are endorsed among strongly identifying followers. They also have implications for the procedural fairness literature in showing that frequently studied procedural fairness rules (e. g. voice) do not explain endorsement of leaders believed to support the group's interests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{substantial}} {{effort has}} been devoted to various incentive Stackelberg solution concepts. Most of these concepts work well {{in the sense that the}} leader can get his desired solution in the end. Yet, most incentive strategies developed thus far include either the <b>follower’s</b> <b>control,</b> which may not be realistic in practice, or delays in the state, which makes stabilization more difficult to achieve. In this paper, we obtain the team-optimal state feedback Stackelberg strategy (with no delays) of an important class of discrete-time two-person nonzero-sum dynamic games characterized by linear state dynamics and quadratic cost functionals.

30|$|It {{is noted}} that in the schemes (1.5)-(1.6), the leader {{controls}} all decision variables which is not realistic since in many practical problems the leader only has power on his own decision variables.

In the correction step of our method, only the leader’s variable λ is improved. Furthermore, we provide insights on the convergence of our method and a computational study of its performance.|$|R

30|$|The {{structured}} system (1.1)-(1.2) can {{be viewed}} as a mathematical formulation of a one-leader-m-follower Stackelberg game where ith <b>follower</b> <b>controls</b> his decision x_i, i= 1, 2,...,m. For the special case where the game has one leader and two followers, that is, m= 2, there is extensive literature on numerical algorithms [1 – 5]. Although the one-leader-two-follower game is helpful as a baseline model in analyzing games and their equilibrium-seeking algorithms, many application problems involve three or more followers, that is, they are formulated as the problem (1.1)-(1.2) with m≥ 3. However, there is less work that focuses on designing algorithms for the general case m≥ 3 compared to a considerable number of studies on the special case m= 2.|$|R

The unique feature is that both the absolute attitude and the relative attitude control systems are developed directly {{in terms of the}} line-of-sight observations between spacecraft, without need for estimating the full absolute and relative attitudes, to improve accuracy and efficiency. Control systems are developed on the nonlinear configuration manifold, guaranteeing exponential stability.

40|$|A {{decentralized}} control law using a backstepping scheme is proposed {{to deal with}} a leader follower multiple robots structure. Based on graph theory and Laplacian, the coordination strategy combines the leader <b>follower</b> <b>control</b> with the {{decentralized control}}. In fact, in the proposed approach, each follower robot only needs the information exchange with its connected neighbors and does not assume the existence of direct communication channel with the leader, which mitigate the implementation cost, mainly when the cooperative robots number increases. The objective of the designed control law is to synchronize positions and velocities of multiple followers interconnected via the neighbor-based rule with respect to the leader’s state. The proposed strategy is further extended to adaptive neural network coordination. The performance of synchronization control system and the nonlinear stability are derived by Lyapunov method. Simulations were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization control approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a hierarchical system where a leader incorporates into its strategy {{the reaction of}} the follower to its decision. The follower's reaction is quite generally represented as the solution set to a monotone variational inequality. For the solution of this nonconvex mathematical program a penalty approach is proposed, based on the formulation of the lower level variational inequality as a mathematical program. Under natural regularity conditions, we prove the exactness of a certain penalty function, and give strong necessary optimality conditions for a class of generalized bilevel programs.

50|$|The {{new feature}} of Wheel of Fortune is the namesake wheel, which takes {{the place of}} the {{starting}} tile. The wheel consists of a number of spaces, and players, in place of placing followers on the tile they just played, may place tiles on spaces along the rim of the wheel. Each space on the wheel may have one or two spaces on the rim. In addition, a pig-shaped marker begins on the wheel, and is moved whenever a tiles with certain markings are drawn. When these tiles are drawn, the marker is advanced clockwise along the wheel the number of spaces stated on the tile. The space on the wheel is resolved, and followers {{on the rim of the}} particular space are scored, before the tile is placed. Wheel effects include scoring by all players for certain types of followers (including unplayed followers), scoring by only the player on move, or the removal of a follower on the board (except on the wheel) by all players. Followers on the wheel score three points, except when there is only one follower on a wheel space that has two spaces on the rim, in which the <b>follower</b> scores six <b>points.</b> <b>Followers</b> on the wheel at the end of the game are not worth any <b>points.</b> Once scored, <b>followers</b> on the wheel are returned to their owners.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new aircraft tyre model applied using a co-simulation approach for the multibody dynamic simulation of helicopter ground vehicle dynamics. The new tyre model is presented using a <b>point</b> <b>follower</b> approach that makes a novel contribution to this area by uniquely combining elements of two existing tyre models used by the aircraft industry, namely the NASA R 64 model developed by Smiley and Horne and the Engineering Sciences Data Unit (ESDU) Mitchell tyre model. Before the tyre model was used with a full helicopter model, a virtual tyre test rig was used to examine the tyre and to predict the tyre forces and moments for a range of tyre states. The paper concludes by describing the successful application of the new tyre model with a full helicopter model and the simulation of representative landing, take-off and runway taxiing manoeuvres. The predictive capability of the model is demonstrated to show the open-loop ground vehicle dynamics response of the helicopter and also the ground load predictive capability for the distribution of loads through the tyres, wheels and landing gears...|$|R

This paper presents a novel SCS called Exclusive operation strategy (XOS) that applies simple rules {{based on the idea}} that batteries are efficient at lower loads while engines and generators are efficient at higher loads. The XOS is developed based on insights gained from three conventional SCSs for series HEVs: Thermostat control strategy (TCS), Power <b>follower</b> <b>control</b> strategy (PFCS) and Global equivalent consumption minimization strategy (GECMS). Also, recent technological developments have been considered to make the XOS more suited to modern HEVs than conventional SCSs. The resulting control decisions are shown to emulate the operation of approximate global optimal solutions and thus achieve significant improvement in fuel economy as compared to TCS and PFCS. In addition, the generally linear relationship between required power and engine power for the XOS provides auditory cues to the driver that are comparable to conventional vehicles, thus reducing barriers to adopting HEVs. The simplicity and effectiveness of the XOS makes it a practical SCS...|$|R
