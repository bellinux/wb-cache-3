5|$|The Rolls-Royce Mermaid <b>propulsor</b> pods {{fitted to}} QM2 {{have proven to}} be prone to failure. The {{failures}} had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009. The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod propulsion systems fitted to Cunard Line's flagship Queen Mary 2 are inherently defective in design. Cunard contends that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud in the course of winning the contract. The Achilles’ heel of the design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings, which have continued to show a tendency to fail even after numerous attempts at redesign. In January 2011 Carnival Corporation was awarded US$24 million (approx. UK£15 million at the time of verdict) by the United States court due to the repeated failure of the propulsors.|$|E

2500|$|A new {{pressurised}} water reactor, the Rolls-Royce PWR 2, {{was designed}} for the Vanguard class.

Furthermore, during their long-overhaul refit periods, a 'Core H' reactor is fitted to each of the boats, ensuring that none of the submarines will require further re-fuelling {{for the rest of their}} service lives.

2500|$|In late 2014, the Navy began early {{preparation}} {{work on the}} SSN(X). It was planned that the first submarine would be procured in 2025. However, their introduction (i.e., procurement of the first submarine) has been pushed back to 2033/2034. [...] The long-range shipbuilding plan is for the new SSN to be authorized in 2034, and become operational by 2044 after the last Block VII Virginia is built. Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified {{is the need to}} integrate with off-board systems so future Virginia boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the Pennsylvania State University could allow a torpedo to hit a target [...] away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase. Targeting information might also come from another platform like a patrol aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launched from the submarine. Researchers have identified a quieter advanced propulsion system and the ability to control multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at once as key SSN(X) components. [...] The future submarines will operate {{through the end of the}} 21st century, and potentially into the 22nd century. New propulsion technology, moving beyond the use of a rotating mechanical device to push the boat through the water, could come in the form a biomimetic propulsion system that would eliminate noise-generating moving parts like the drive shaft and the spinning blades of the <b>propulsor.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceAcoustic micropropulsors present great {{potential}} for microfluidic applications. The propulsion is based on encapsulated 20 μm bubbles excited by a contacless ultrasonic transducer. The vibrating bubbles then generate a powerful streaming flow, with speeds 1 – 100 mm s − 1 in water, through the action of viscous stresses. In this paper we introduce a full toolbox of micropropulsors using a versatile three-dimensional (3 D) microfabrication setup. Doublets and triplets of <b>propulsors</b> are introduced, and the flows they generate are predicted by a theoretical hydrodynamic model. We then introduce whole surfaces covered with <b>propulsors,</b> which we term active surfaces.

Several patterns of <b>propulsors</b> are tested, and the flows produced by the two most efficient mixers are predicted by a simple theoretical model based on flow singularities. In particular, the vortices generated by the most efficient pattern, an L-shaped mixer, are analysed in detail...|$|R

5000|$|Reports on the Royal Navy [...] (i.e., {{the class}} that will replace the Vanguard class SSBNs) state that the {{submarines}} may have submarine shaftless drive (SSD) {{with an electric motor}} mounted outside the pressure hull. SSD was evaluated by the U.S. Navy as well but it remains unknown whether the Ohio class replacement will feature it. On contemporary nuclear submarines steam turbines are linked to reduction gears and a shaft rotating the propeller/pump-jet <b>propulsor.</b> With SSD, steam would drive electric turbogenerators (i.e., generators powered by steam turbines) that would be connected to a non-penetrating electric junction at the aft end of the pressure hull, with a watertight electric motor mounted externally (perhaps in an Integrated Motor <b>Propulsor</b> arrangement), powering the pump-jet <b>propulsor,</b> although SSD concepts without pump-jet propulsors also exist. More recent data, including an Ohio Replacement scale model displayed at the Navy League’s 2015 Sea-Air-Space Exposition, indicates that the Ohio Replacement will feature a pump-jet <b>propulsor</b> visually similar to the one used on Virginia class SSNs.

40|$|In {{response}} to growing aviation demands {{and concerns about}} the environment and energy usage, a team at NASA proposed and examined a revolutionary aeropropulsion concept, a turboelectric distributed propulsion system, which employs multiple electric motor-driven <b>propulsors</b> that are distributed on a large transport vehicle. The power to drive these electric <b>propulsors</b> is generated by separately located gas-turbine-driven electric generators on the airframe. This arrangement {{enables the use of}} many small-distributed <b>propulsors,</b> allowing a very high effective bypass ratio, while retaining the superior efficiency of large core engines, which are physically separated but connected to the <b>propulsors</b> through electric power lines. Because of the physical separation of <b>propulsors</b> from power generating devices, a new class of vehicles with unprecedented performance employing such revolutionary propulsion system is possible in vehicle design. One such vehicle currently being investigated by NASA is called the "N 3 -X" that uses a hybrid-wing-body for an airframe and superconducting generators, motors, and transmission lines for its propulsion system. On the N 3 -X these new degrees of design freedom are used (1) to place two large turboshaft engines driving generators in freestream conditions to minimize total pressure losses and (2) to embed a broad continuous array of 14 motor-driven fans on the upper surface of the aircraft near the trailing edge of the hybrid-wing-body airframe to maximize propulsive efficiency by ingesting thick airframe boundary layer flow. Through a system analysis in engine cycle and weight estimation, it was determined that the N 3 -X would be able to achieve a reduction of 70 % or 72 % (depending on the cooling system) in energy usage relative to the reference aircraft, a Boeing 777 - 200 LR. Since the high-power electric system is used in its propulsion system, a study of the electric power distribution system was performed to identify critical dynamic and safety issues. This paper presents some of the features and issues associated with the turboelectric distributed propulsion system and summarizes the recent study results, including the high electric power distribution, in the analysis of the N 3 -X vehicle...|$|R
