5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> walls makes <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Mycena inclinata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving its {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of {{breaking down the}} three major biochemical components of <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.|$|E

5|$|The genetic {{sequence}} information from A.bisporigera {{has been used}} to identify molecular polymorphisms in the related A.phalloides. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms may be used as population genetic markers to study phylogeography and population genetics. Sequence information has also been employed to show that A.bisporigera lacks many of the major classes of secreted enzymes that break down the complex polysaccharides of <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> walls, like cellulose. In contrast, saprobic fungi like Coprinopsis cinerea and Galerina marginata, which break down organic matter to obtain nutrients, have a more complete complement of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E

A bleomycin resistance determinant, located on transposon Tn 5 and functional in bacteria, has been cloned in a plant expression vector and introduced into Nicotiana plumbaginifolia using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The expression of this determinant in <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> confers resistance to bleomycin and allows selection of transformed <b>plant</b> <b>cells.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} efficiency of transformation of <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> by Agrobaeterium tumefaciens during cocultivation {{is limited by the}} properties of the <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> or by the infecting bacteria. Therefore, tobacco protoplasts were infected by cocultivation with two different agrobacteria strains carrying Ti plasmids with distinguishable T-DNAs. These T-DNAs cotransform <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> at a frequency equal to the product of their independent transformation frequencies, which indicates that all <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> are equally competent. On the other hand, when these T-DNAs are located on the same Ti plasmid vector within one bacterial strain, the cotransformation frequency is significantly higher than the product of the single transformation frequencies. We interpret these results to indicate that transformation is limited more by the establishment of effective bacteria/plant cell interaction than by (i) the process of DNA integration and (ii) by the number of <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> capable of being transformed by Agrobacterium. We found that most <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> are transformed by only one or a few agrobacteria. Analysis of the number of T-DNA copies in these clonally transformed lines indicates amplification of the original, infecting T-region copy...|$|R
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E

40|$|Most {{bacterial}} pathogens subvert plant cellular functions using effector proteins delivered inside <b>plant</b> <b>cells.</b> In the <b>plant</b> pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, {{several of}} these effectors contain domains with predicted enzymatic activities, including acetyltransferases, phosphatases, and proteases, among others. How these enzymatic activities get activated inside <b>plant</b> <b>cells,</b> {{but not in the}} bacterial cell, remains unknown in most cases. In this work, we found that the R. solanacearum effector RipAY is phosphorylated in <b>plant</b> <b>cells.</b> One phosphorylated serine residue, S 131, is required for the reported gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase activity of RipAY, responsible for the degradation of gamma-glutamyl compounds (such as glutathione) inside host cells. Accordingly, non-phosphorylable mutants in S 131 abolish RipAY-mediated degradation of glutathione in <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> and the subsequent suppression of plant immune responses. In this article, we examine our results in relation to the recent reports on the biochemical activities of RipAY, and discuss the potential implications of phosphorylation in <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> as a mechanism to modulate the enzymatic activity of RipAY...|$|R
40|$|Adherence of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to suspension-cultured tomato cells {{has been}} {{characterized}} using a quantitative binding assay. Saturable binding of radiolabeled A. tumefaciens to <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> resulted in 100 to 300 bacteria bound per cell. Specificity of A. tumefaciens binding was also inferred from two additional results: (a) an initial incubation of <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> with A. tumefaciens reduced subsequent binding of radiolabeled A. tumefaciens by 60 % to 75 %; (b) tomato cells bound less than three E. coli per cell. Protease treatment of <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> {{had no effect on}} subsequent bacterial binding, but prior treatment of <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> with pectinolytic enzymes increased binding 2 - to 3 -fold. Pectin-enriched and neutral polymer-enriched fractions were obtained from tomato cell walls. The soluble pectin-enriched fraction inhibited binding of bacteria to <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> by 85 % to 95 %, whereas the neutral polymer fraction only partially inhibited binding. Preliminary characterization of the activity showed it is heat stable, partially inactivated by protease treatment, and substantially inactivated by acid hydrolysis...|$|R
25|$|Most chloroplasts in a {{photosynthetic}} cell do {{not develop}} directly from proplastids or etioplasts. In fact, a typical shoot meristematic <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> contains only 7–20 proplastids. These proplastids differentiate into chloroplasts, which divide {{to create the}} 30–70 chloroplasts found in a mature photosynthetic <b>plant</b> <b>cell.</b> If the cell divides, chloroplast division provides the additional chloroplasts to partition between the two daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{responded to}} fungal {{colonisation}} in different ways, {{depending on the}} fungus. The rhizoids of Nothia displayed three responses to fungal infestation: the hyphae of some (mutualistic) colonists were encased by <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> walls; other (parasitic) fungi were met with typical host responses of increased rhizome cell size; while yet other fungi solicited an increase in thickness and pigmentation of cell walls. Once inside a <b>plant</b> <b>cell,</b> fungi produced spores, which are found in decaying plant cells; the cells may have decayed as a defence mechanism to prevent the fungi from spreading.|$|E

30|$|With the {{regard to}} the uptake {{mechanism}} of SWCNTs by <b>plant</b> <b>cells,</b> so far it is not clarified well. It {{is well known that}} uptake of carbon nanotubes into mammalian cells is often by the endocytosis and insertion/diffusion [24]. It has been reported two possible pathways of SWCNTs to enter into cells are as follows: energy-dependent phagocytosis or endocytosis and passive diffusion across lipid bilayers [28]. For <b>plant</b> <b>cells,</b> endocytosis pathway of extracellular molecules has also been investigated [30, 31], for example, Liu et al. [16] reported that carbon nanotubes could be used as molecular transporters for walled <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> and proposed that SWCNTs/fluorescein isothiocyanate was taken up by fluidic-phase endocytosis. In this study, we observed that SWCNTs primarily located within lysosomes, then entered into the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and aggregated together, we also observed that temperature almost did not affect the uptake of SWCNTs by <b>plant</b> <b>cells,</b> therefore, we consider that, for the <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> like Arabidopsis mesophyll cells, SWCNTs enter into <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> via non-energy dependent endocytosis pathway, which may be one kind of nanoscale capillary function, the van der Waals and hydrophobic forces are likely to be very important for the cellular uptake process of SWCNTs, similar to our previous report that DNA molecules entering into carbon nanotubes [29], further confirmation work is under way.|$|R

Tip-growing <b>plant</b> <b>cells</b> such as root hairs and pollen tubes also resemble neurons extending their axons.
