5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my <b>passion</b> <b>to</b> make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|David's {{character}} arc {{throughout the}} Alien prequel series, with his role becoming increasingly central, has been lauded by critics. Kevin Lincoln of Vulture magazine described David {{as being the}} best cinematic villain in years, due to his dynamic personality and ability to win against the characters in Alien: Covenant. John Squires of Bloody Disgusting praised David for supplanting the main protagonist of the first four films, Ellen Ripley, as the overall best character of the franchise in 2017. Squires perceived David's <b>passion</b> <b>to</b> become a creator in Alien: Covenant as a retroactive explanation for poisoning Holloway in Prometheus. Eschewing from most reviews, Wenlei Ma from News.com.au complimented Fassbender's ability to portray David, though she criticized the mystery lost by revealing the character's true intentions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they {{live and work in}} Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early <b>passion</b> <b>to</b> acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E

25|$|Redstone's autobiography, A <b>Passion</b> <b>to</b> Win (co-written {{with author}} Peter Knobler), was {{published}} in 2001 by Viacom's Simon & Schuster. This book details everything from Redstone's life {{as a young boy}} in Boston to the difficult takeover of Viacom and the problems he overcame in purchasing and managing both Blockbuster Video and Paramount Pictures. The book also recounts the legendary CBS merger (Viacom was a spin-off company of CBS to syndicate its programs, and the subsidiary bought the parent almost 30 years later).|$|E
50|$|Seneca's {{thoughts}} {{of the relationship of}} the <b>passions</b> <b>to</b> reason, are that the passions arise in a rational mind {{as a result of a}} mis-perceiving or misunderstanding of reality. Inwood describes this as when the mind makes errors about the values of things , R Bett as caused by defective belief (c.f. Bett p. 546). Seneca denied the assertion of Plato and Aristotle who previously considered the <b>passions</b> <b>to</b> arise from roots within the irrational part of the soul.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of philosophies and religions advocate {{at the very}} least tempering the <b>passions</b> <b>to</b> keep them within acceptable bounds. However most of the great religions recommend both the restraint and the transformation of the <b>passions</b> <b>to</b> the point where they no longer arise. This is true of Christianity (a religion strongly influenced by both Stoicism and Cynicism), Jainism, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. The institution of the monastery within various religions is a means by which human beings may temporarily or permanently seclude themselves from circumstances exacerbating the arising of passion and provide a supportive environment for doing spiritual work.|$|R

25|$|The {{effects of}} mass media on attitudes toward intellect are {{certainly}} multiple and ambiguous. On the one hand, mass communications greatly expand {{the sheer volume of}} information available for public consumption. On the other hand, much of this information comes pre-interpreted for easy digestion and laden with hidden assumption, saving consumers the work of having to interpret it for themselves. Commodified information naturally tends to reflect the assumptions and interests of those who produce it, and its producers are not driven entirely by a <b>passion</b> <b>to</b> promote critical reflection.|$|E

The vehicle {{was shown to}} have a more subtle version of the LF-Gh's spindle grille, while overall exterior dimensions are almost identical to the previous generation. L-shaped LED front daytime running lamps and rear LED tube lamps are a new design feature. The new GS was the centerpiece of Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda's initiative to restore <b>passion</b> <b>to</b> the Lexus brand and better compete with German luxury automakers that had been gaining market share in the United States.

25|$|An {{influential}} book by Leo Steinberg, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion (1983, 2nd edition 1996), {{explores the}} explicit depiction of Christ's penis in art, which he argues became a new {{focus of attention}} in late medieval art, initially covered only by a transparent veil in the early 14th century, and by {{the second half of}} the century completely uncovered, and often being the subject of the gaze or gestures of other figures in the scene. This emphasis is, among other things, a demonstration of Christ's humanity when it appears in depictions of the Madonna and Child and other scenes of Christ's childhood, and also a foreshadowing of Christ's <b>Passion</b> <b>to</b> come in the context of the Circumcision.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{doctrine}} of Valentinus, as described by , the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her <b>passion</b> <b>to</b> comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming {{in contact with the}} limiting power Horos, whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert a danger that threatened to affect them all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of a new pair of Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the permanence of the order thus produced. Irenaeus (u. s.) reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from <b>passion</b> <b>to</b> impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I aim at {{relating}} <b>passions</b> <b>to</b> evil in Kant's philosophy. I {{begin by}} explaining {{the difference between}} affects and passions in the text Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. Kant claims that both affects and passions are illnesses of the mind, because both affect and passion hinder the sovereignty of reason. I show that passions are worse than affects {{for the purpose of}} pure reason. Second, I relate affects and <b>passions</b> <b>to</b> the degrees of the propensity to evil in the Religion. I analyze the idea of an ethical community as a way to overcome the evil, which goes beyond political and anthropological solutions suggested by Kant...|$|R
