It’s the manipulator for objects where is needed change orientation during production process. This thesis describes step by step construction of individual components of the manipulator and calculations of propulsive units. At the beginning the conveyor roller with <b>propulsive</b> <b>unit</b> is designed. The next step is construction of scissor lift table and choice of the <b>propulsive</b> <b>unit.</b> There is also made FEM analysis for the scissor mechanism. The next unit is aimed to the construction and computation of rotating and telescopic jaw. Then hydraulic circuit with computation of the <b>propulsive</b> <b>unit</b> is designed. As the final step the appropriate type of sensors are chosen and the step diagram of the manipulator is made. The manipulator is designed in the 3 D model program and there are also made some assembly drawings...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} reef fish genus Naso (F. Acanthuridae) was examined using a complete species-level molecular phylogeny of all recognized (19) species based on three loci (one nuclear ETS 2 and two mitochondrial 16 S, cyt b). This study demonstrates that distinct foraging modes and specialized body shapes arose independently at different times in the {{evolutionary history}} of the genus. Members of the subgenus Axinurus, characterized by a scombriform morphology, caudal fin structure and pelagic foraging mode, were consistently placed basal to the remaining Naso species, suggesting that pelagic foraging is plesiomorphic and benthic foraging derived in this genus. We used a genus-level phylogeny (nuclear marker, ETS 2), which included several taxa from all other acanthurid genera, to obtain a range of age estimates for the most recent common ancestor of the genus Naso. These age estimates (range of 52 – 43. 3 MY) were then used to estimate divergence times (by nonparametric rate smoothing method) of the node giving rise to extant Naso species using the combined sequence data (from all loci). The reconstruction of the pattern of divergence of extant species indicates two sequences of events. The basal species characterized by pelagic foraging modes arose during the Eocene and Oligocene. Most of the remaining Naso species, including those characterized by benthic foraging, arose {{over a period of}} 20 MY during the Miocene. Diversification during this period was associated with major plate tectonic and glaciation events, resulting in changes in sea level, ocean temperature and productivity regimes. Regardless of the foraging mode exhibited, all species of Naso have a caudal <b>propulsive</b> <b>unit</b> similar to that observed in pelagic scombriform fishes, a legacy of the basal position of the subgenus Axinurus in the phylogeny of the genus...|$|E
40|$|NASA {{currently}} projects {{ending the}} ISS mission in approximately 2016, due {{primarily to the}} expense of re-boost and re-supply. Lunar outposts {{are expected to be}} in place in the same timeframe. In support of these mission goals, a scheme to reuse ISS modules on the moon has been identified. These modules could function as pressurized volumes for human habitation in a lunar vacuum as they have done in low-earth orbit. The ISS hull is structurally capable of withstanding a lunar landing because there is no atmospheric turbulence or friction. A compelling reason to send ISS modules to the moon is their large mass; {{a large portion of the}} ISS would survive re-entry if allowed to de-orbit to Earth. ISS debris could pose a serious risk to people or structures on Earth unless a controlled re-entry is performed. If a <b>propulsive</b> <b>unit</b> is devised to be attached to the ISS and control re-entry, a propulsion system could be used to propel the modules to the moon and land them there. ISS modules on the lunar surface would not require re-boost. Radiation protection can be attained by burying the module in lunar regolith. Power and a heat removal system would be required for the lunar modules which would need little support structure other than the lunar surface. With planetary mass surrounding the module, heat flux may be controlled by conductance. The remaining requirement is the re-supply of life-support expendables. There are raw materials on the moon to supplement these vital resources. The lunar maria is known to contain approximately 40 % oxygen by mass in inorganic mineral compounds. Chemical conversion of moon rocks to release gaseous oxygen is known science. Recycling and cleaning of air and water are currently planned to be accomplished with ISS Environmental Control & Life Support Systems (ECLSS). By developing a Propulsion and Landing Module (PLM) to dock to the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM), several identical PLMs could be produced to rescue and transfer the ISS modules to the lunar surface, one by one. The propulsion does not need to be as swift as Apollo, nor would the modules need to be manned during transportation to the moon. The trajectory from low-Earth to lunar orbit would avoid or quickly pass through the Van Allen belts to minimize radiation exposure to electronics onboard. A landing technology similar to Apollo's could be utilized to land an ISS module on the moon. Since the mission will be unmanned, system redundancy could be minimized to keep the cost down. If the mission failed and a module crashed landed on the moon, the risk of debris landing on Earth would be avoided and the raw materials could be used in future lunar missions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present in}} this paper a novel indoor blimp that is {{propelled}} by a propulsion technology that uses no moving mechanical parts and thus is noiseless and vibration free. In our prior work reported at IEEE/ASME AIM 2007, we demonstrated several prototype <b>propulsive</b> <b>units</b> (with asymmetric capacitor configurations) that lift themselves into air. Using these basic <b>propulsive</b> <b>units</b> (“Ionic Flyers”), we have recently developed an indoor flying blimp that has a propulsion system with no moving mechanical parts and thus generates no noise or vibration [...] the Ionic Propulsion Blimp. The key to successfully create this novel indoor flying system {{is the development of}} a power generation system that includes an 11. 1 V battery which is capable of generating ~ 20 kV DC voltage continuously over time for a load in the MΩ range. The architecture of this ionic power system will be presented. A detailed parametric analysis and an optimal design methodology of the Ionic Flyer are also discussed. Initial experimental results of the Ionic Propulsion Blimp are also summarized {{in this paper}}...|$|R

Research in pulsejet has {{intensified}} recently {{due to its}} design simplicity that can be developed into efficient small scale <b>propulsive</b> <b>units</b> for new applications such as UAVs and Unmanned Combat Vehicles (UCAV). A major obstacle for its development is low efficiency of the engine. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the possibility of using pulsejet in certain applications where the pulsejet can trade its low efficiency with low cost, simple design, and light weight. Numerical analysis is used for analysing the pulsejet engine design. The main results drawn from this research is in increasing efficiency and improving performance of engine by improving size of engine, especially diameter of combustion chamber.

40|$|A calculating {{procedure}} is presented for the sea-level static performance of duct burning and afterburning bypass jet engines {{that have a}} low pressure and a high pressure spool. Performance values can be determined also for operation without reheat. Influence of temperature and fuel/air ratio on the thermodynamic properties of air and combustion gases is taken into account. A calculating program for a Monroe 1880 - 43 programmable electronic desk calculator is described which {{makes it possible to}} evaluate effects of changes of parameters on performance with minimum effort. The program will be used to establish the characteristics of compressors required for <b>propulsive</b> <b>units</b> of later generation Navy air-superiority fighter aircraft, to investigate whether the Turbo-Propulsion Laboratory of NPS would be capable of undertaking research and development work of such machines. Programs of the type presented, and the use of modern programmable desk calculators, will also be of great value for instructional purposes. Teachers can then concentrate on the fundamental nature of particular topics and need not waste time on lengthy derivations, or on simplifications and approximations that are introduced only to solve equations with elementary means. The students would be relieved of the drudgery of routine hand calculations that do not contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the subject matter.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ancient idea of augmenting the thrust {{produced}} by a rotating fan by producing a thermal gradient by heating the outflow. Some of the pioneers of aeronautics have originally conceived this idea: the indirect jet (Bleriot Coanda Monoplane, 1910) and the “thermojet” (Caproni-Ciampini CC 2, 1942). They were abandoned because of the better performances by traditional jets {{such as the ones}} developed in Germany and USA during 2 nd World War. Antony Colozza (NASA), one of the modern fathers of high altitude airships, has recently proposed it again to be used on fuel cells powered airplanes and airships. Most fuel cells have a large thermal dispersion at high temperature (about 40 %), but it could be possible to use it for heating the propulsive stream of high-speed air produced into ducted fan <b>propulsive</b> <b>units.</b> The actual state of the research is only introductory and aims to verify the feasibility of this energy recovery, which could in future enhance the energy efficiency of electrical airplanes powered by ducted fan units especially for high altitude operations. The preliminary research activities presented are conducted assuming a reduced scale system in order to have the possibility of future costless experimental activity for validation. The CFD evaluations have been performed by two different codes: the well tested Ansys Fluent and a lightweight academic code EasyCFD...|$|R
40|$|Marc~z, i 948 Summary. [...] Model {{tests have}} been made to {{investigate}} the functioning of an air interchange system for removing from a return-circuit wind tunnel a high proportion of the exhaust products from <b>propulsive</b> <b>units</b> under test. The tests were planned to assist the design of an engine altitude tunnel. With changing circumstances the priority of this tunnel has been reduced, but the tests were continued to give general information on the extraction of engine exhaust products from this type of wind tunnel. The tests were made on a partial model of a tunnel, which had an air interchange exhaust collector designed to remove 15 per cent of the tunnel mass flow. This was installed on the tunnel axis at the downstream end of the working section. Tests were also made on 10 per cent and 5 per cent collector entries designed to be interchange. able with the 15 per cent entry. The main results obtained were as follows: [...] 1. The flow in the working-section was satisfactory, and was not affected by substituting the 5 per cent or 10 per cent collector for the 15 per cent collector, nor was it affected by changes made to the interchange ratio with a given collector. 2. The flow of the main tunnel air round the collectors and in the annular diffuser downstream of the collectors was satisfactory. The losses at the collectors were of the order expected, but were appreciable, and woul...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an Engineering Doctorate project in Distributed Propulsion carried out from 2004 to 2007 at Cranfield University. Distributed propulsion is a propulsion system arrangement that consists in spreading the engine thrust along the aircraft span. This {{can be accomplished}} by distributing a series of driven fans or the engines themselves. The aim of this project is to determine the feasibility of distributed propulsion for civil aviation in the medium term (with small gas turbines) and long term (with driven fans) from a technical and economic perspective. The effect of distributed propulsion was assessed by creating a long-range subsonic airliner baseline with conventional technology for the small gas turbines study, and an equivalent blended wing body baseline for the driven fans study. Different distributed propulsion effects were modelled and integrated together to produce optimised baselines with different technological parameters. The feasibility of small gas turbine distributed propulsion was found to be limited by the excessive fuel consumption associated with small gas turbines. Although advanced heat exchanger technology could improve their performance, the resulting cost advantage might not be large enough to justify the development costs. The feasibility of distributed driven fans depends on the availability of superconductive elements, as electrical power transmission seems to be the only promising transmission method in the long run. If superconductive elements are applied, distributed driven fans could afford fuel burn reductions of more than 50 % relative to current technology. As both distributed propulsion concepts rely on small <b>propulsive</b> <b>units,</b> their enabling technologies coincide with those required to develop future unmanned aerial vehicles. UAVs therefore represent the most appropriate technological avenue to develop technologies with the potential to become distributed propulsion enablers. Future work should therefore concentrate on improving engine performance and cost for unmanned aerial vehicles...|$|R

Performance of ducted fan is compared with performance (with and without tail-pipe burner) of two hypothetical turbojet engines. At maximum power, the ducted fan has <b>propulsive</b> thrust per <b>unit</b> of frontal area between thrusts obtained by turbojet engines with and without tail-pipe burners. At cruise, the ducted fan obtains lowest thrust specific fuel consumption. For equal maximum thrusts, the ducted fan obtains cruising flight duration and range appreciably greater than turbojet engines...|$|R
40|$|Fish exhibit {{extremely}} high propulsive efficiency and excellent manoeuvrability. Designers {{are looking to}} exploit these traits by mimicking fish motion. A prototype robotic fish has been developed at The University of Auckland modelled on the carangiform mode of swimming. The design’s tail provides {{the majority of its}} thrust by approximating a travelling wave for its motion. A rigid nose cone houses electronics and five servo motors in the front two thirds of the body. Full three dimension motion has been achieved and is controlled by the user via a remote control <b>unit.</b> <b>Propulsive</b> efficiencies of half that of biological fish were attained coupled with a maximum speed of 0. 11 ms- 1, a minimum turning radius of 0. 12 m and maximum ascent and descent rates of 36. 4 ° and 60. 9 ° respectively. Depth sensing was incorporated into the design and has a resolution of 25 mm.
