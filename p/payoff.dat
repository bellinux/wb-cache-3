We study Nash equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> and publicly correlated equilibrium <b>payoffs.</b> If players use deterministic strategies, {{it has been}} proved that the Nash equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> are precisely the reachable and consistent <b>payoffs.</b> Referring to repeated games, we introduce mixed strategies which are probability distributions on pure strategies. We prove that the set of Nash equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> when using mixed strategies is convex and compact. Unexpectedly, this set {{is larger than the}} closed convex hull of the set of Nash equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> using pure strategies. We give a characterization for the Nash equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> using mixed strategies as reachable and consistent, these concepts being adapted to random controls.

40|$|In the {{infinitely}} repeated Prisoners' Dilemma with side payments, we {{characterize the}} Pareto frontier {{of the set}} of subgame perfect equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> for all possible combinations of discount factors. Play paths implementing Pareto dominant equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> are uniquely determined {{in all but the}} first period. Full cooperation does not necessarily implement these <b>payoffs</b> even when it maximizes total stage game <b>payoffs.</b> Rather, when the difference in players' discount factors is sufficiently large, Pareto dominant equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> are implemented by partial cooperation supported by repeated payments from the impatient to the patient player. When both players are sufficiently patient, such <b>payoffs,</b> while implemented via full cooperation, are supported by repeated payments from the impatient to the patient player.

30|$|Third, if the {{material}} <b>payoffs</b> of both games are sufficiently asymmetric (i.e., individuals can greatly reward or punish their opposing players with little cost to themselves), {{the outcome in}} which the sum of {{the material}} <b>payoffs</b> is maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. This result is very optimistic as it concludes that in the outcome where {{the sum of the}} material <b>payoffs</b> is being maximized, nobody wants to deviate (even if they can increase their own material <b>payoffs</b> by doing it). The reason is that in this case, the emotional <b>payoffs</b> is positive, in fact very positive, and even the players who can increase their material <b>payoffs</b> by deviating, prefer to maximize their emotional <b>payoffs</b> instead and being kind (as their partners are being treated nice, in fact, very nice).|$|R
40|$|When {{players have}} {{identical}} time preferences, {{the set of}} feasible repeated game <b>payoffs</b> coincides with the convex hull of the underlying stage-game <b>payoffs.</b> Moreover, all feasible and individually rational <b>payoffs</b> can be sustained by equilibria if the players are sufficiently patient. Neither of these facts generalizes {{to the case of}} different time preferences. First, players can mutually benefit from trading <b>payoffs</b> across time. Hence, the set of feasible repeated game <b>payoffs</b> is typically larger than the convex hull of the underlying stage-game <b>payoffs.</b> Second, it is not usually the case that every trade plan that guarantees individually rational <b>payoffs</b> can be sustained by an equilibrium, no matter how patient the players are. This paper provides a simple characterization of the sets of Nash and of subgame perfect equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> in two-player repeated games.

30|$|Because players 1 and 4 are maximizing {{their opponents}} {{material}} <b>payoffs</b> and players 2 and 3 are maximizing their own material <b>payoffs,</b> the group fairness equilibrium of the two-period game is the outcome where {{the sum of}} the material <b>payoffs</b> is maximized.|$|R

5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher <b>payoff</b> in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar <b>payoff.</b> Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|E

We are interested in the relation between the network of social interaction and equilibrium actions and <b>payoffs.</b> We start with an analysis of two economic examples � strategic advertising in the presence of word of mouth advertising and social non-competitive marketing � to bring out the simple point that changing network connections can increase as well as decrease equilibrium actions and <b>payoffs.</b> This leads to an investigation of general conditions on <b>payoffs</b> under which equilibrium actions and <b>payoffs</b> increase/decrease with an increase in density of connections. We also develop conditions under which a greater dispersion in network connections leads unambiguously to positive and negative effects on actions as well as <b>payoffs.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net <b>payoff</b> of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying <b>payoff.</b> He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Yusuf II in 1224 began {{a period of}} instability. Marrakesh became the stronghold of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and the ahl ad-dar (descendants of Ibn Tumart), who sought to claw power back from the ruling Almohad family. Marrakesh was taken, lost and retaken by force {{multiple}} times by a stream of caliphs and pretenders, such as during the brutal seizure of Marrakesh by the Sevillan caliph Abd al-Wahid II al-Ma'mun in 1226, which {{was followed by a}} massacre of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and their families and a public denunciation of Ibn Tumart's doctrines by the caliph from the pulpit of the Kasbah mosque. After al-Ma'mun's death in 1232, his widow attempted to forcibly install her son, acquiring the support of the Almohad army chiefs and Spanish mercenaries with the promise to hand Marrakesh over to them for the sack. Hearing of the terms, the people of Marrakesh sought to make an agreement with the military captains and saved the city from destruction with a sizable <b>payoff</b> of 500,000 dinars. In 1269, Marrakesh was conquered by nomadic Zenata tribes who overran the last of the Almohads. The city then fell into a state of decline, which soon led to the loss of its status as capital to rival city Fes.|$|E
40|$|We study certain {{classes of}} supermodular and submodular games which are {{symmetric}} {{with respect to}} material <b>payoffs</b> but in which not all players seek to maximize their material <b>payoffs.</b> Specifically, a subset of players have negatively interdependent preferences and care not only about their own material <b>payoffs</b> but also about their <b>payoffs</b> relative to others.

25|$|When {{academics}} {{talk about}} coordination failure, most cases are that subjects achieve risk dominance rather than <b>payoff</b> dominance. Even when payoffs are better when players coordinate on one equilibrium, many times people will choose the less risky option {{where they are}} guaranteed some <b>payoff</b> and end up at an equilibrium that has sub-optimal <b>payoff.</b> Players {{are more likely to}} fail to coordinate on a riskier option when the difference between taking the risk or the safe option is smaller.
