40|$|Public sector organisations (PSOs) {{operate in}} information-intensive environments often within {{operational}} contexts where efficiency is a goal. What's more, the rapid adoption of IT {{is expected to}} facilitate good governance within public sec-tor organisations but it often clashes with the bureaucratic culture of these organisations. Accordingly, models such as IT Governance (ITG) and government reform-in particular the new public management (NPM) - were introduced in PSOs {{in an effort to}} address the inefficiencies of bureaucracy and under performance. This work explores the potential effect of change in <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> policy on the stability of IT governance in Australian public sector organisations. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine implications of a change of government and the resulting political environment on the effectiveness of the audit function of ITG. The empirical data discussed here indicate that a number of aspects of audit functionality were negatively affected by change in <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> resultant policy changes. The results indicate a perceived decline in capacity and capability which in turn disrupts the stability of IT governance systems in public sector organisations...|$|R

The local sphere of {{government is}} tasked with the obligation of providing basic services to citizens in a sustainable manner. Within the context of a developmental state, developmental local government calls for new knowledge, skills and competencies from those in leadership positions in municipalities to promote service delivery. Developmental local government requires political leadership which creates opportunities to account to the community over and above regular elections. In this regard therefore the role of councillors as political leaders in local government is of signifi cance as councillors are elected to provide <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> leadership in municipalities. This article focuses on the development of leadership capacity in local government in South Africa. With an emphasis on the knowledge, skills and competencies that councillors as the providers of <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> leadership require. The article asserts the continuous development and improvement of leadership capacity in local government in order to enable councillors to meet local governance challenges in the 21 st century and to promote the objectives of a developmental local government. am 201...|$|R

The LDDP won 73 seats, with analysts attributing their victory, among other things, to the party's support from farmers and the Russian and Polish minorities, {{as well as}} popular anger about the economic crisis, in particular the fuel shortages since Russia, the main supplier, had cut off imports. The results showed widespread desire for a different <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> dissatisfaction with the confrontational approach to politics used by Sąjūdis.

40|$|Abstract: Reforms of {{the public}} sector have helped create a more {{efficient}} and effective public sector, but also have created a number of problems. Both, the New Public Management and "governance" reforms have contributed to the contemporary problems in governing. These problems have been political to a great extent, reflecting the tendency to emphasize administrative rather than democratic values. Governments have begun to react to the real and perceived problems within the public sector by developing a number of "meta-governance" instruments that can help steer public organizations but which involve less direct command and control. This paper addresses the contemporary governance tasks of restoring <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> policy coherence while at the same supporting the autonomy of public organizations, and the involvement of policy networks, in governing. ...|$|R

Stepan Zorian and Simon Zavarian managed the political campaign for the 1908 Ottoman Elections. ARF field workers were dispatched to the provinces containing significant Armenian populations; for example, Drastamat Kanayan (Dro), went to Diyarbakir as a political organizer. The Committee of Union and Progress could only able to bring 10 Armenian representatives to the 288 seats in the Ottoman general election, 1908. The other 4 Armenians were representing parties with no ethnic affiliation. The ARF was aware that the elections were shaky ground <b>and</b> maintained its <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> self-defense mechanism intact and continued to smuggle arms and ammunition.|$|R

In the following study, we will try to characterize each Popular or Independent University created in Portugal from the late XIXth century, and give the cultural and political ways of each university, focussing on the most important ones. Therefore, we will aim at observing the main Northern and Central Universities situated in Porto, Lisbon, Setubal and Coimbra, giving their ideological <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>direction,</b> <b>and</b> their pedagogical and cultural objectives, the means they use and their promotors' political identity...|$|R
25|$|The strike—probably {{the first}} workers' protest since 1958, with the {{exception}} of a September 1972 strike in the Jiu Valley—began not as an anti-Communist or even an anti-Ceaușescu movement but rather a socio-economic one in spontaneous reaction to the new pensions law, as confirmed by the miners’ inexperience, which led them to improvisation and hasty decision-making. However, once the Communist leaders were sequestered, it moved in a <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and,</b> given the repression that followed, was interpreted as such by the authorities. At the same time, the strike did have an intrinsically political character in the sense that the miners—thought of as essential components of the Communist working class—revolted against their ideological bosses and conditions created by the very political system that used them as part of its labour force. So while collective and unpremeditated, the protest challenged the Communist leadership of the day and ultimately the regime itself.|$|R
50|$|Since gaining its {{independence}} {{with the collapse}} of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, Russia has faced serious challenges in its efforts to forge a political system to follow nearly seventy-five years of Soviet rule. For instance, leading figures in the legislative and executive branches have put forth opposing views of Russia's <b>political</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> the governmental instruments that should be used to follow it. That conflict reached a climax in September and October 1993, when President Boris Yeltsin used military force to dissolve the parliament and called for new legislative elections (see Russian constitutional crisis of 1993). This event marked the end of Russia's first constitutional period, which was defined by the much-amended constitution adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1978. A new constitution, creating a strong presidency, was approved by referendum in December 1993.|$|R

40|$|After the {{constitution}} of Czechoslovakia in 1918, its population also included a large German minority that initially refused the new state formation, hoping {{to become part of}} German Austria, which would then be annexed to Germany. This did not happen, and the socalled Sudeten Germans had to accustom themselves to the new status quo. In the early 1920 ’s, part of their political spectrum turned to a policy of “activism” consisting in cooperation with Czechoslovak authorities. This policy culminated in 1926 with two German ministers joining the first nationally mixed Czechoslovak government. The study looks into the fortunes of one of them, Franz Spina, a professor of Slavonic Studies and top representative of German agrarians (Bund der Landwirte), who held various government positions between 1926 and 1938, before resigning in March 1938 due to his disagreement with the party’s <b>political</b> <b>direction,</b> <b>and</b> who became a symbol of German activism in the Czechoslovak Republic...|$|R

Many of the motions discussed the possible dissolution of Left Unity as a political party, with party members joining either the Labour Party itself or Momentum. Following the Conference decision to remain as a formal political party but not stand in elections, Salman Shaheen, one of Left Unity's prominent National Speakers, resigned. He cited the need for socialists to join the Labour Party.|$|R

To this consideration, authorities and institutions took an extra mile apart from accelerating liberalization efforts. This study found that the financial system of China and the level of its integration to global markets are observable to the hedge fund development not only in China but the Greater China which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, it is also found that hedge fund in the Mainland China is underdeveloped largely attributed to limited development of financial institutions.

The violence erupted when Morsi supporters stormed a stage set up by the rival camp, angered by chants they perceived as insults to the president.|$|R
