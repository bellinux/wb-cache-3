30|$|Now the {{difficulty}} to visualize <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in boron carbide nanowires becomes obvious. If the viewing direction is not parallel to <b>planar</b> <b>defects,</b> the defects will be invisible. In addition, {{even if the}} viewing direction is parallel to <b>planar</b> <b>defects,</b> depending on the initial orientation of the viewing direction, <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> may also not be observed. For example, if the initial viewing direction (i.e., without any tilting of the specimen holder) is along the [110] direction within the (001) plane, it is then impossible to see any characteristic features of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> even after {{a full range of}} tilting examination. This is due to that approximately ± 33 ° is needed to tilt from the [110] direction to the in-zone directions: [010] or [100], according to the roadmap shown in Figure  2 c. This required titling angle exceeds the tilting limit of ± 30 ° for our specimen holder.|$|R

40|$|Diamonds are {{supposed}} to be formed in the diamond window under high-pressure conditions due to the polymorph graphite/diamond phase transition. In this study we present for the first time, that natural diamonds can be formed by C:O:H bearing volatiles during the uplift of the kimberlitic melt in eclogites from the Roberts Victor mine, South Africa. Our results give evidence that the kimberlitic melt acts like a catalyst, and therefore the C:O:H ratio in the kimberlite changes through the uplift of the kimberlite permanently, caused by the formation of hydrous and carbonatitic minerals within the kimberlitic melt. This catalytic process leads to the growth of light carbon bearing molecules and under favorable thermodynamic, stoichiometric and kinetic conditions micro diamonds can be formed, even under lower pressure conditions outside of the diamond window. High-spatial-resolution synchrotron based FT-IR has been used to detect C:O:H-bearing volatiles around <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> structures in garnet. In micro diamond bearing <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> structures, a correlation between C:O:H-bearing volatiles could be identified whereas in micro diamond free <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> structures no correlation of the different C:O:H containing volatiles is visible.

30|$|The {{ratio of}} {{triangle}} and hexagon {{depends on the}} stacking faults commonly occurred in close-packed lattices. For the face-centered cubic metal, when a single <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> (e.g., a twin or a stacking fault) is involved, hexagonal plates can form in the early stage of growth due to the six-fold symmetry of a face-centered cubic lattice. As proposed by previous reports, {{the presence of a}} <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> can cause the six-sided faces, where the defect plane ends, to form alternating concave- and convex-type surfaces [20]. Because each atomic site only has three nearest atomic neighbors on the convex-type surface, the stabilization energy for attaching atoms to this surface is relatively low. As a result, the atoms on this surface tend to be dissolved into solution again, creating a high-energy barrier for the addition of atoms. In contrast, the concave-type surface creates a reentrant groove, a self-perpetuating ledge that increases the number of nearest neighbors for an adatom and thus the stabilization energy. In this case, atomic addition becomes favorable. Taken together, in a crystal with a single <b>planar</b> <b>defect,</b> the fast addition of metal to the concave sides can cause those very faces to grow out of existence, leading to a triangular plate whose side faces are bounded by three convex sides that do not favor atomic addition.|$|E

30|$|In this work, more {{extensive}} TEM examination and model simulation {{were performed to}} gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the nature of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in the aforementioned boron carbide nanowires to answer two questions. (1) Do planar defect-free boron carbide nanowires really exist? Literature review shows that due to its relatively low stacking fault energy (75  mJ/m 2) [26], <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> have been frequently observed in bulk boron carbides independent of the synthesis methods [27 – 30]. It has also been reported that the density of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> decreases as the synthesis temperature increases [30]. However, the <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> were still detectable by TEM from bulk samples synthesized at 2, 100 °C [30]. Considering the common existence of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in bulk boron carbides and the relatively low temperatures researchers used to synthesize boron carbide 1 D nanostructures, one may naturally ask ‘Can boron carbide nanowires synthesized at approximately 1, 100 °C be <b>planar</b> defect-free? Or <b>defects</b> always exist but sometimes are not found by TEM?’ (2) If <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> exist in all of our as-synthesized boron carbide nanowires, can their orientations be determined from TEM results showing no characteristic features (i.e., results from the off-zone directions as discussed later)? It is expected that different orientations of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> could have distinctive effects on the properties of these nanowires, similar to that physical properties of superlattices could be very different along their in-plane and cross-plane directions [31, 32]. Therefore, it is important to know the fault orientation of each boron carbide nanowire when establishing the structure–property relations.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the ‘Background’ section, although in our previous study, approximately 25 % of boron carbide nanowires appear to be planar defect-free based on {{the full range of}} tilting examination, we are wondering whether these nanowires are really without any <b>planar</b> <b>defects.</b> Recently, using the reposition-reexamination process described in the ‘Methods’ section, we clarified this issue. Figure  1 e is a low magnification TEM image of a boron carbide nanowire. An initial full range of tilting examination suggests that the nanowire is planar defect-free, as shown in Figure  1 f. However, after repositioning the nanowire (Figure  1 g) and reexamination, the ‘hidden’ <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> are revealed in Figure  1 h and the nanowire is identified as an AF nanowire. This example further demonstrates that the existence of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> cannot be fully revealed by observation from one single zone axis. Moreover, in specific occasions, even after a full range of tilting examination limited by the configuration of a microscope, there is still a possibility of neglecting the existence of <b>planar</b> <b>defects.</b> In our current study, twenty five planar defect-free-like nanowires were subjected to multiple rounds of reposition and reexamination, and <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> were seen from all of them eventually. This new finding strongly suggests that <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> exist in all of our as-synthesized boron carbide nanowires.

30|$|In summary, a {{thorough}} {{discussion on the}} observation of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in boron carbide nanowires is presented. There are two major findings. (1) <b>Planar</b> <b>defects</b> can easily become invisible during TEM examination, in which case, observation along different zone axes is a must when studying the nature of <b>planar</b> <b>defects.</b> A roadmap based on simulated diffraction patterns along several low index zone axes parallel to <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> is constructed to facilitate the practical TEM examination. (2) An approach has been developed to determine the fault orientation (i.e., transverse faults or axial faults) within a nanowire even if the <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> are not revealed by TEM, which could facilitate further examination of the nanowire and help to establish the structure–property relations. Although our discussion is focused on boron carbide nanowires, the above two major findings are useful when studying other 1 D nanostructures. This study prompts us to use cautions when drawing the conclusion of ‘planar defect-free’ 1 D nanostructures, especially for those made of materials with relatively low stacking fault energy. Last but not the least, it is worth {{pointing out that the}} current study is on long straight portions of boron carbide nanowires only.

The discussed difficulty of identifying ‘hidden’ <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in boron carbide nanowires calls attention to researchers to pay great cautions when analyzing microstructures of 1 D nanomaterials with a complicated rhombohedral crystal structure. Although <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in boron carbide 1 D nanostructures were neglected or misinterpreted in some previous publications [16, 17, 19, 23], some research groups have realized this issue just like us. For instance, the two recent papers on α-rhombohedral boron-based nanostructures [34] and fivefold boron carbide nanowires [35] set good examples, in which abnormal weak diffraction spots were specifically studied and a serial tilting electron diffraction method was conducted to reveal cyclic and parallel twinning inside individual nanostructures.
