5|$|The 13th century saw {{an already}} {{changing}} technology undergo many dramatic changes.

5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument's exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism, while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history,</b> were also added.|$|E
5|$|Turkey's varied landscapes are {{the product}} of complex earth {{movements}} that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the fault lines running through Turkey that {{led to the creation of}} the Black Sea. The North Anatolian Fault Line runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history.</b> The latest of those big earthquakes was the 1999 İzmit earthquake.|$|E

5|$|His {{marriage}} to the hot-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's intimate friend – ensured Marlborough's rise, first to the Captain-Generalcy of British forces, then to a dukedom. Becoming de facto leader of Allied forces during the War of the Spanish Succession, his victories on the fields of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), ensured his <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as one of Europe's great generals. But his wife's stormy relationship with the Queen, and her subsequent dismissal from court, was central to his own fall. Incurring Anne's disfavour, and caught between Tory and Whig factions, Marlborough, who had brought glory and success to Anne's reign, was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile. He returned to England and to influence under the House of Hanover with the accession of GeorgeI to the British throne in 1714.|$|E
5|$|Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Ida Husted Harper {{began in}} 1876 {{to write the}} History of Woman Suffrage. They planned for one volume but {{finished}} four before the death of Anthony in 1906, and two more afterward. The first three volumes chronicled {{the beginnings of the}} women's rights movement, including the years that Stone was active. Because of differences between Stone and Stanton that had been highlighted in the schism between NWSA and AWSA, Stone's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> was marginalized in the work. The text was used as the standard scholarly resource on 19th-century U.S. feminism for much of the 20th century, causing Stone's extensive contribution to be overlooked in many histories of women's causes.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E

5|$|The Sunday Times is a British {{national}} broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister {{paper of}} The Times. In 1968, under {{the ownership of}} Lord Thomson, The Sunday Times {{had been involved in}} a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of The Times in 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the Führer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in Hitler's War Directives (1964) and Hitler's <b>Place</b> <b>in</b> <b>History</b> (1965).|$|E
