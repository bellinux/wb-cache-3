From the early 2010s, manufacturers have designed consumer dishwashers for use without pre-rinsing or <b>pre-washing,</b> so after scraping the user places dishes into the dishwasher.

For the most common installed two-rack consumer style of dishwasher, the user loads cups, bowls, and small dishes onto the top rack. Eating utensils go in the bottom rack into a container, with pointed ends down for safety. Some dishwashers have a third rack for utensils. Heavier dishes go on the bottom rack, with large pots facing downward toward the spray nozzle. After the dishwasher is loaded, the user puts dishwasher detergent into the machine.

No consensus has been reached on specific cut-off values for semen parameters, at which IVF would be advocated over IUI and ICSI over IVF. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions for male subfertility according to total motile sperm count (TMSC).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite the {{introduction}} of smaller cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits for paediatrics, it is frequently necessary to add irradiated {{red blood cell concentrate}} (IRBC) to maintain adequate haemoglobin levels and the oxygen carrying capacity. Irradiation of blood weakens the cell membranes and results in an increase of lactate and potassium concentration. In addition, prolonged shelf time of IRBC may enhance its lactate level. To avoid the adverse effects of increased lactate and potassium concentration during paediatric bypass, prewashing of homologous blood in a cell-saving device was implemented at our institution. A retrospective audit of clinical data was performed to assess the relevance of this method. METHODS: Preceding {{the introduction}} of the blood <b>pre-washing,</b> we investigated 14 units of IRBC for lactate, potassium levels and shelf time. Afterwards, we evaluated the CPB and laboratory data from 69 patients with body weight < 10 kg and the lactate levels in the priming of the bypass circuit. RESULTS: The shelf time of blood units was 7. 6 ± 2. 7 days (minimum 5, maximum 14 days) with lactate concentration of 12. 6 ± 2 mmol/ land potassium concentration of 16. 2 ± 4. 7 mmol/l. In the priming after <b>pre-washing,</b> the lactate concentration was significantly lower than the standard priming (2. 5 ± 0. 9 vs 4. 5 ± 20 mmol/l, p = 0. 002). At the start of bypass, the lactate concentration after <b>pre-washing</b> was still lower (1. 5 ± 0. 4 vs 1. 9 ± 0. 9 mmol/l; p = 0. 04), {{but at the end of}} bypass we detected a significant increase of lactate in the pre-washed group (1. 5 ± 0. 4 vs 2. 2 ± 1. 1 mmol/l, p = 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract: Background/Aims: The {{synthesis}} of pyridine nucleotides from nicotinamide requires adenosine triphosphate. In man when exogenous nicotinamide is poorly utilized in this synthesis, the excess follows a dissipative metabolic pathway and is excreted in urine as N-methylnicotinamide. In human cirrhosis N-methylnicotinamide serum levels {{are higher than}} normal, in basal condition and after nicotinamide oral load, The {{aim of this study}} was to verify N-methylnicotinamide production in relation to hepatic content of adenosine triphosphate during in vitro perfusion of rat liver, in normal conditions and after adenosine triphosphate depletion by metabolic stress. Methods: ''Stress'' was obtained by <b>pre-washing</b> with saline for 15 min before the perfusion with nutritive medium. Results: The adenosine triphosphate decrease in the stressed liver was 38 % after <b>pre-washing</b> with saline and 80 % at the end of nutritive perfusion, In control liver the corresponding decreases were 1 % after <b>pre-washing</b> with nutritive medium and 65 % at the end of perfusion with the same medium, The total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide decreases were 44 % and 56 % in the stressed liver, and 19 % and 52 % in the control liver, The output levels of N-methylnicotinamide at 90 min of rat liver nutritive perfusion were 31. 50 +/- 4. 72 nmol/g for normal liver and 66. 40 +/- 13. 17 for stressed liver (p< 0. 001). Liver adenosine triphosphate was inversely related to N-methylnicotinamide production (r= 0. 93; p< 0. 001). Conclusions: These data suggest that nicotinamide methylation may be enhanced when there is hepatic adenosine triphosphate decrease and energy failure induced by hypoxia or metabolic stress, similar to that obtained in vitro by saline washing before perfusion with nutritive medium, This study shows that the evaluation of N-methylnicotinamide production in man (before and after nicotinamide load) might be useful to explore the energy state of diseased live...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prolonged {{survival}} of patients under HAART {{has resulted in}} new demands for assisted reproductive technologies. HIV serodiscordant couples wish {{to make use of}} assisted reproduction techniques in order to avoid viral transmission to the partner or to the newborn. It is therefore essential to test the effectiveness of techniques aimed at reducing HIV and HCV loads in infected semen using molecular biology tests. METHODS: After seminal analysis, semen samples from 20 coinfected patients were submitted to cell fractioning and isolation of motile spermatozoa by density gradient centrifugation and swim-up. HIV and HCV RNA detection tests were performed with RNA obtained from sperm, seminal plasma and total semen. RESULTS: In <b>pre-washing</b> semen, HIV RNA was detected in 100 % of total semen samples, whereas HCV RNA was concomitantly amplified in only one specimen. Neither HIV nor HCV were detected either in the swim-up or in the post-washing semen fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of HIV and/or HCV shedding in semen by density gradient centrifugation followed by swim-up is an efficient method.

Initial experiments were not successful because the DNA extracts could not be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Results revealed that humic substance content decreased by 31 %, but DNA yield increased by 24 % in the DNA extracts of the pre-lysis washing procedures, compared to the non-washing procedures. DNA extracted by the <b>pre-washing</b> procedure needed less purification for subsequent 18 S and 16 S rDNA PCR amplifications.
