40|$|Electro-hydraulic {{proportional}} {{flow valves}} {{are widely used}} in hydraulic industry. There are several different structures and working principles. However, flow valves based on the existing principles usually have some shortcomings such as {{the complexity of the}} system and additional energy losses. A concept for a two-stage poppet flow valve with pilot pressure drop – <b>pilot</b> <b>spool</b> opening compensation is presented, and the linear relationship between the pilot stage and main stage, the semi-empirical flow equation are used in the electronic flow controller. To achieve the accurate control of the outlet flow, the actual input voltage of the <b>pilot</b> <b>spool</b> valve is regulated according to the actual pilot pressure drop, the desired flow rate and the given input voltage. The results show that the pilot pressure drop – <b>pilot</b> <b>spool</b> opening compensation method is feasible, and the proposed proportional flow control valve with this compensation method has a good static and dynamic performance...|$|E
