40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the technical challenges and countermeasures required to enable extreme gasoline engine downsizing. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is the lead partner in a collaborative project called 'ULTRABOOST' which is supported with funding from the UK Technology Strategy Board (TSB). The project aim is to develop an innovative engine concept capable of a 35 % CO 2 tailpipe reduction over the NEDC drive cycle relative to a current production V 8 engine in a Sports Utility Vehicle, whilst maintaining key vehicle attributes such as performance and transient response. The project consortium is made up of eight technical partners including Jaguar Land Rover, Lotus Engineering, Shell Fuels, GE Precision Engineering, CD-adapco, University of Bath, University of Leeds and Imperial College London. Starting in September 2010 and running for three years the project will utilise the partners expertise and collective skills in engineering, design, combustion modelling, pressure charging and fuels to develop a highly <b>pressure</b> <b>charged</b> downsized engine concept. In this paper the technology required to enable extreme levels of engine downsizing and CO 2 reductions are described, together with accompanying simulation data collected from the initial concept engine development...|$|E
40|$|Turbocharging and {{supercharging}} both {{provide a}} means of improving the specific power output of an engine. Although their basic effect is the same, their method of operation and the resultant engine characteristics are very different. This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} two methods and discusses the relative benefits and disadvantages of each one. A 1 D wave action simulation program was used for this task. This paper explains the procedure for modelling a turbocharger and supercharger. The techniques necessary to accurately simulate a <b>pressure</b> <b>charged</b> engine are discussed. Two computer models of a 4 cylinder 1600 cc spark ignition engine were constructed. One model included a supercharger, the other a turbocharger. Both models included a number of modifications to accurately represent a typical turbocharged or supercharged engine. The models were validated against the available test data and then used to investigate the full load performance of the two engines, and their part load economy. The paper explains the differences in performance between the two methods, and discusses the effect this has on the engine design. The future direction and potential for development in this area is also discussed...|$|E

50|$|For {{additional}} <b>pressure</b> <b>charging</b> a turbocharger may be fitted, {{in series}} with the Roots blower, but a turbocharger cannot be used alone because it would not provide enough air for scavenging at low speeds.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{expedient}} routes to improving in-vehicle fuel economy {{is to reduce the}} swept volume of an engine and run it at a higher BMEP for any given output. This can be achieved through pressure charging. However, for maximum fuel economy, particularly at part-load, the compression ratio (CR) should be kept as high as possible. This is at odds with the requirement in <b>pressure</b> <b>charged</b> engines to reduce the CR at higher loads due to the knock limit. Lotus has studied a pressure charging system which will allow a high compression ratio to be maintained at all times. This is achieved by deliberately over compressing the charge air, intercooling it at the resulting elevated pressure, and then expanding it, via a turbine, to the desired plenum boost pressure, ensuring a plenum temperature which can potentially become sub-ambient at full-load. Due to its high CR, it is possible that an engine fitted with such a charging system could therefore achieve fuel consumption equal to or better than a Variable Compression Ratio unit, while permitting conventional engine architecture and assembly lines. This paper analyses the likely performance of an engine fitted with such a charging system, and presents details of rig tests and results of performance modelling conducted to investigate one potential layout, and discusses the 'Nomad' engine project, which is intended, amongst other things, to prove the ability of a turboexpansion system to facilitate aggressive engine downsizing...|$|E
40|$|Thermodynamic {{parameters}} such as {{temperature and}} pressure {{can be defined}} from the statistical behavior of a system. Therefore, thermal fluctuation is an inseparable characteristic of these parameters which eventually finds its way into experimental data. Analyzing these fluctuations is very useful in studying the phase transitions of a physical system or its behavior around critical points. However, this approach is not straightforward {{as most of the}} times it is impossible to distinguish meaningful thermal fluctuations from those due to the instrumental errors. In this article, we have offered a method by which an experimenter can separate this multi-sourced fluctuation into its constitutive parts according to their sources. Although the article is only focused on a specific system, which is a high <b>pressure</b> <b>charged</b> gas, we have used a computational method which could be used for various other systems. Our proposed idea is very efficient and reduces the required computation time by a remarkable fraction. We have used Euler algorithm, which generally does not hold the internal energy conserved; But we have used this fact as a tool which allows us to surf in the phase space of the system and reach different energy levels in significantly less time. Although system does not spend enough time in a single energy level to equilibrate, but {{we have been able to}} extract the details of the equilibrium state out of our data. Using numerical computations combined with theoretical modelings we have given a final expression for the amount of the overall fluctuations existing in the measured pressure values. This expression is given in terms of the characteristics of both the gas and the barometer so that it can be experimentally verified. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|Engine {{downsizing}} is {{a proven}} approach to reduce CO 2 emissions and improve fuel economy, but {{the approach is}} predicated on achieving high specific power without compromising reliability, drivability, or cost. One approach to engine downsizing is advanced <b>pressure</b> <b>charging,</b> placing challenging demands upon the <b>pressure</b> <b>charging</b> system. This paper addresses engine downsizing in the embodiment of a high performance and high specific power 2. 0 L gasoline engine simulated using Ricardo WAVE software. With best available conventional, single-stage turbocharger technology, the boosting system requires augmentation to maintain the same steady-state torque profile as a naturally aspirated engine of the same power and also to maintain an acceptable transient response, particularly at lower engine speeds. Having specified the requirements for the boosting system in a demanding engine downsizing application, the simulation incorporated an Aeristech 48 V high speed permanent magnet electric supercharger, connected in series with the conventional turbocharger, to augment {{the performance of the}} boosting system. The engine and boosting system was then tuned to produce a relatively consistent torque delivery of the engine across a range of engine speeds, in steady-state and transient conditions, indicating that the downsized engine with the electric supercharger would likely exhibit acceptable levels of responsiveness and desirability...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made to {{optimise}} the influential parameters of surface lapping process. Lapping time, lapping speed, downward <b>pressure,</b> and <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> were chosen from the preliminary studies as parameters to determine process performances in terms of material removal, lap width, and clamp force. The desirability functions of the-nominal-the-best were used to compromise multiple responses into the overall desirability function level or D response. The conventional modified simplex or Nelder-Mead simplex method and the interactive desirability function are performed to optimise online the parameter levels in order to maximise the D response.

5000|$|<b>Charging</b> <b>pressure</b> {{regulation}} utilises a two coiled three way {{solenoid valve}} pneumatically connected with hoses to the turbo charger’s waste gate, the turbo chargers outlet and the compressor’s inlet. The solenoid valve is electrically supplied from +54 via fuse 13 and {{is controlled by}} the ECU via its pin 26 and pin 2. The control voltage is pulse width modulated (PWM) at 90 Hz below 2500 RPM and 70 Hz above 2500 RPM. The rationale for this change is to avoid resonance phenomena in the pneumatic hoses. By grounding pin2 longer than pin 26 the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is decreased and vice verse, when pin 26 is grounded longer than pin 2 the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased. To be able to regulate the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> the ECU must at first calculate a requested pressure, a pressure value that the system must strive for.

40|$|Noise {{generated}} by fluid power applications {{can be treated}} using bladder-style suppressors, and an optimal operating condition for these devices is sought in this thesis. Bladder-style suppressors employ a compliant nitrogen-charged bladder to create an impedance change within the system, reflecting the noise back to the source and preventing it from propagating downstream. The noise in a hydraulic system is created by a pump, the flow source in a hydraulic system, and can be separated into three categories: fluid-borne noise, structure-borne noise and airborne noise. Fluid-borne noise places addition stress on sealing surfaces, potentially causing leaks. Airborne noise can be uncomfortable, even hazardous depending on the level. Bladder-style suppressors primarily treat fluid-borne noise; however, it {{is seen in the}} literature that fluid-borne noise is the cause of structure-borne and airborne noise. This thesis presents an optimization method for finding the optimal <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> for implementation with a given system operating over a broad range of system pressures. The optimization weights suppressor performance by the spectral content of the fluid-borne noise as well as the duty cycle of the system. A single <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> works well over a small range of system pressures, though many fluid power applications operate over a larger range of system pressure than the usable range of a suppressor. For systems operating over an extremely broad pressure range, two suppressors <b>charged</b> to different <b>pressures</b> are used to treat the noise in the entire system pressure range. To determine suppressor performance experimental measurements were performed, and models developed, of the transmission loss of this type of device. A multi-microphone method using transfer function relationships between six sensors determines the transmission loss of the suppressor under test. An equivalent fluid model modeling the wave behavior both upstream and downstream, as well as within the suppressor, was created to predict suppressor transmission loss. Optimal configurations are found for a set of system <b>pressures,</b> <b>charge</b> <b>pressures</b> and duty cycles. Analysis of the results shows the time weighting has a more significant impact on the optimum <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> than the frequency weighting, as shown by duty cycles considered in this thesis. In addition, all <b>charge</b> <b>pressures</b> selected as optimal for either single suppressor optimizations or double suppressor optimizations, exhibit the highest transmission loss for a single system pressure in the pressure duty cycle for a simulated machine.
