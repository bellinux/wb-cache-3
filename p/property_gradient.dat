40|$|In {{the present}} work, a new {{processing}} route for establishing functional <b>property</b> <b>gradient</b> in age-hardenable Al-alloy systems is devised and {{the feasibility of}} this process route is demonstrated. Two age-hardenable Al-alloys, namely, Al- 5 Zn- 1 Mg and Al- 4. 6 Cu alloys are used as model alloy systems. The processing method involves producing a microstructural gradient in the initial homogeneous material without altering {{the composition of the}} bulk. Transmission electron microscopic studies at different layers of FGMs confirm the evolution of graded microstructure across the specimen cross-section. The established microstructural gradient in the material leads to a <b>property</b> <b>gradient</b> in terms of hardness and thereby yield strength for both the alloy systems, which is confirmed through hardness measurements...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Accumulative Roll Bonding (ARB) process enables {{manufacturing}} of multi-layered aluminum sheet metals with outstanding mechanical properties. However, {{a significant}} increase in strength is accompanied by a reduced ductility. Besides, delamination effects can occur during forming operations. Therefore, <b>property</b> <b>gradients</b> will be applied by short-term laser heat treatment according to the Tailored Heat Treated Blanks technology to enhance the formability and to enable the production of components. These gradients can be realized across the plane and in thickness direction of a blank. In this paper, <b>property</b> <b>gradients</b> in thickness direction are applied to multi-layered aluminum sheet metal with nanocrystalline grain structure produced in the ARB process.

40|$|Sharp <b>gradients</b> in {{sectional}} <b>property</b> distributions {{are inherent}} to modern rotor blade design and manufacturing practices. The accuracy of {{finite element models}} of such rotor blades rapidly degrades if sharp <b>property</b> <b>gradients</b> occur within a single finite element. To remedy this situation, two techniques are developed: first, a mesh optimization procedure based on a measure of local sectional <b>property</b> <b>gradients,</b> and second, a sectional property smoothing technique based on conservation arguments for mass properties and energy considerations for stiffness properties. Numerical experimentation shows {{that the use of}} both mesh optimization and sectional property smoothing considerably reduces computational errors in finite element predictions in the presence of <b>property</b> <b>gradients</b> and leads to considerably more monotonic convergence characteristics of the computational process. When the proposed techniques are used, computational requirements are decreased because specified levels of accuracy are achieved for models featuring fewer degrees of freedom; furthermore, better accuracy is obtained when evaluating internal force and moment distributions in the blade...|$|R

Hamaker coefficients and London dispersion energies were quantitatively determined for Σ 5 and near-Σ 13 grain boundaries in SrTiO 3 by analysis of spatially resolved valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy (VEELS) data. From the experimental data, local complex dielectric functions were determined, from which optical properties can be locally analyzed. Both local electronic structures and optical <b>properties</b> revealed <b>gradients</b> within the grain boundary cores of both investigated interfaces.

London dispersion energies of the order of 10 % of the apparent interface energies of SrTiO 3 were observed, demonstrating their significance in the grain boundary formation process. The application of different models to represent optical <b>property</b> <b>gradients</b> shows that long-range van der Waals–London dispersion interactions scale significantly with local, i. e., atomic length scale property variations...|$|R

40|$|We {{apply the}} gradient-directed Monte Carlo (GDMC) method to select optimal {{members of a}} {{discrete}} space, the space of chemically viable proteins described by a model Hamiltonian. In contrast to conventional Monte Carlo approaches, our GDMC method uses local <b>property</b> <b>gradients</b> with respect to chemical variables that have discrete values in the actual systems, e. g., residue types in a protein sequence. The local <b>property</b> <b>gradients</b> are obtained from the interpolation of discrete property values, following the linear combination of atomic potentials scheme developed recently [M. Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 3228 (2006) ]. The local property derivative information directs the search toward the global minima while the Metropolis criterion incorporated in the method overcomes barriers between local minima. Using the simple HP lattice model, we apply the GDMC method to protein sequence design and folding. The GDMC algorithm proves to be particularly efficient, suggesting that this strategy can be extended to other discrete optimization problems in addition to inverse molecular design...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} use of {{friction}} stirring {{in the manufacture of}} in-situ composites, a new additive manufacturing method for the design and manufacture of tailor-made functionally graded composites is presented. The existing literature on the subject matter is limited to creating functional grades {{in the vicinity of the}} weld nugget without direct control on composition and <b>property</b> <b>gradients.</b> A mathematical model is developed for achieving a compositional gradient over a predefined length in a metal matrix composite and subsequently demonstrated through the manufacture of aluminum + TiC functionally graded composite.

The process mechanism is elucidated by correlating results of mechanical tests and electron backscatter diffraction analysis. A specific process condition vis-à-vis the number of passes, volume faction, and particle size combination may promote one or more phenomena such as continuous dynamic recrystallization, particle fragmentation, and breaking of initial matrix grains, which eventually affect particle mixing and matrix grain size and thus cause <b>property</b> <b>gradients.</b> The findings are expected to enable the manufacture of functionally graded composites products of larger size...|$|R
