40|$|Agricultural {{commodities}} prices play {{crucial role}} both in farmers income determination and in price relationship establishment {{for the whole}} economy. Among the factors influencing the wheat prices, crude oil prices are considered {{as one of the}} most important. The aim of this paper was to assess the character of linkage between world crude oil prices and <b>Polish</b> <b>wheat</b> prices. Results of the research confirm the existence of such linkage although the nature and the strength of this relationship changes over time. However, the long-run relationships between the crude oil and <b>Polish</b> <b>wheat</b> prices were not proven. Moreover, growing impact of crude oil prices on <b>Polish</b> <b>wheat</b> prices over time was not detected. The results suggest that exchange rates may strongly influence wheat prices. This in turn may weaken response of <b>Polish</b> <b>wheat</b> prices in relation to world crude oil prices...|$|E

40|$|Cash {{prices for}} wheat in Poland are not {{closely related to}} futures prices in Chicago and London, for several reasons: {{differences}} in seasonality, fluctuations in exchange rate, poor dissemination of information in Poland, and most important the Polish government's intervention in wheat markets. <b>Polish</b> <b>wheat</b> prices generally move to expected intervention prices and then stay there until the next intervention level becomes known. The exception was in 1994 - 95, when sharply higher world prices raised prices in Poland. A wheat futures exchange in Poland could give the private sector a tool for hedging against price risk, improving efficiency and price discovery in Poland. It {{would be difficult to}} develop, however, under present interventionist policies. This situation could be improved by reducing the protection of prices and by making any intervention rules-based (reducing uncertainty about policies).

40|$|The {{influence}} of wheat N-fertilization and grain moistening on some chosen physical properties of wet gluten {{have been studied}} {{by means of the}} Glutomatic System. The study material were grain samples of four <b>Polish</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) grown at two N-fertilization levels (50 and 150 kg N ha- 1). Grain samples for moistening were placed for 6 h between the layers of blotting paper imbibed with distillate water. Then, glutomatic determinations such as quantity and moisture content of wet gluten, gluten index (GI) and thickness of a dry gluten cake were carried out on the grain samples dried at room temperature and on the non-moistened grain. Increasing fertilization levels resulted in a significant decrease of GI and thickness of the dry gluten cake as well as lower losses in the moisture level as measured by centrifuging wet gluten. Application of a moistening treatment improved gluten quality which was reflected in a significant increase in GI and thickness of the gluten cake. It was also observed in the lower shares of the non-bound water in the freshly washed out gluten. Moreover, a strong relation of the GI value and moisture content in the wet gluten was found...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur (S) is an {{essential}} macronutrient that has been proved {{to play an important}} role in regulating plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of S status on <b>polish</b> <b>wheat</b> plant response to Mn toxicity. Results showed that Mn stress inhibited plant growth, disturbed photosynthesis and induced oxidative stress. In response to Mn stress,polish wheat plant activated several detoxification mechanisms to counteract Mn toxicity, including enhanced antioxidant defense system, increased Mn distribution in the cell wall and upregulated genes involved in S assimilation. Moderate S application was found to alleviate Mn toxicity mainly by sequestering excess Mn into vacuoles, inhibiting Mn translocation from roots to shoots, stimulating activities of antioxidant enzymes and enhancing GSH production via upregulating genes involved in S metabolism. However, application of high level S to Mn-stressed plants did not significantly alleviated Mn toxicity likely due to osmotic stress. In conclusion, moderate S application is beneficial to wheat plants against Mn toxicity, S exerts its effects via stimulating the antioxidant defense system and regulating the translocation and subcellular distribution of Mn, in which processes GSH plays an indispensable role...|$|E

Here, we established and compared the {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) patterns on chromosomes of 20 accessions of T. polonicum species using different repetitive sequences from BAC library of wheat 'Chinese Spring'. The chromosome patterns of <b>Polish</b> <b>wheat</b> were compared to tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 28, AABB) Triticum species: T. durum, T. diccocon and T. turanicum, as well. A combination of pTa- 86, pTa- 535 and pTa- 713 probes was the most informative among 6 DNA probes tested. Probe pTa-k 374, which is similar to 28 S rDNA sequence enabled to distinguish signal size and location differences, as well as rDNA loci elimination. Furthermore, pTa- 465 and pTa-k 566 probes are helpful for the detection of similar organized chromosomes.

A line KS 90 WGRC 10 was used as the resistance source of Lr 41 for leaf rust and the 6 VS/ 6 AL translocation line Yangmai 5 was used as the resistance source of Pm 21 for powdery mildew. In foreground selection several molecular markers for Lr 41 (Gdm 35, Barc 124, Gwm 261, Gwm 296 and Gwm 210) and Pm 21 (SCAR 1250, SCAR 1400 and NAU/xibao) were applied.

The combinations were: two hypervirulent strains, AGL 1, containing the pDM 805 binary plasmid, and EHA 101, containing pGAH; and the common Agro strain LBA 4404, harboring the super-binary pTOK 233 vector. pDM 805 contained bar under the control of Ubi 1 promoter, pGAH had nptII under nos, and pTOK 233 had hpt under 35 S. Additionally, pDM 805 and pTOK 233 carried the gus reporter gene under the Act 1 promoter or 35 S promoter, respectively. The highest selection rate was 12. 6 % and was obtained with EHA 101 (pGAH) on a kanamycin-containing medium. Sixty-five of the plants grown on that medium were PCR positive. The second best combination was LBA 4404 (pTOK 233) and kanamycin selection, which gave an average transformation rate of 2. 3 %. Phosphinothricin selection gave 1. 0 % transformation efficiency, while hygromycin, depending on the strain/vector used, gave from 0. 2 to 0. 4 %. PCR tests in T 1 revealed that 67 % of the lines showed a 3 : 1 segregation ratio, and 11 % a 15 : 1 ratio, while in 22 %, segregation was non-Mendelian. The high number of T 0 transgenic plants containing one copy of the transgene was confirmed via Southern blot analysis. Kanamycin resistance in the T 1 generation was very low; in some lines, all the progeny were kanamycin sensitive.

In the present study of dwarf <b>polish</b> <b>wheat</b> (DPW) roots, Cd uptake was inhibited by Zn, and Zn uptake was inhibited by Cd, suggesting that Cd and Zn interact antagonistically in this plant. A study of proteomic changes showed that Cd, Zn and Cd+Zn stresses altered the expression of 206, 303 and 190 proteins respectively. Among these, 53 proteins were altered significantly in response to all these stresses (Cd, Zn and Cd+Zn), whereas 58, 131 and 47 proteins were altered in response to individual stresses (Cd, Zn and Cd+Zn, respectively). Sixty-one differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were induced in response to both Cd and Zn stresses; 33 proteins were induced in response to both Cd and Cd+Zn stresses; and 57 proteins were induced in response to both Zn and Cd+Zn stresses. These results indicate that Cd and Zn induce differential molecular responses, which result in differing interactions of Cd/Zn. A number of proteins that mainly participate in oxidation-reduction and GSH, SAM and sucrose metabolisms were induced in response to Cd stress, but not Cd+Zn stress. This result indicates that these proteins participate in Zn inhibition of Cd uptake and ultimately cause Zn detoxification of Cd. Meanwhile, a number of proteins that mainly participate in sucrose and organic acid metabolisms and oxidation-reduction were induced in response to Zn stress but not Cd+Zn stress. This result indicates that these proteins participate in Cd inhibition of Zn uptake and ultimately cause the Cd detoxification of Zn.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to study the {{input-output}} relationships and economics of pangas monoculture and carp-pangas polyculture in Bangladesh. By analyzing the data collected from 50 pangas farms and 55 carp-pangas farms, the study has investigated the production systems of two technologies and the effects of fingerling stocking and applications of feed and fertilizer on fisheries income. The data were collected from the fishermen of Trishal and Bhaluka of Mymensingh district, and Kahaloo and Adamdighee of Bogra district during 2001 - 02. For pangas monoculture, the stocking density was 31, 561 per ha while it was 55, 017 per ha in carp-pangas polyculture. Most of the farmers used urea, TSP and lime before stocking. Rice and wheat bran happened to be the most common feed ingredients for both types of culture in general. Other important ingredients used were mustard oil-cakes, rice <b>polish,</b> <b>wheat</b> flour, fish meal, bone meal, soybean meal and poultry litter. In terms of quantities, rice bran and wheat bran dominated the farmers list. Rice and wheat bran together constituted about 60 % of all studied feeds. Feed cost constituted 59. 13 % of total costs for pangas monoculture and 67. 44 % for carp-pangas polyculture. Per ha productions of pangas and carp-pangas in a single culture cycle were 15, 508 kg and 19, 745 kg, respectively. Per ha gross profits were estimated to be Tk 310, 311 and Tk 464, 418 for pangas monoculture and carp-pangas polyculture, respectively. Net profit appeared to be Tk 264, 216 per ha for pangas monoculture and Tk 416, 509 per ha for carp-pangas polyculture. The BCRs calculated were 1. 46 and 1. 68 for monoculture and polyculture, respectively. The break-even costs per kg of fish were estimated at Tk 36. 93 for pangas and Tk 30. 93 for mixed species which was much lower than the prices the producers received. Break-even productions were estimated at 10, 702 kg per ha for pangas monoculture and 11, 784 kg per ha for carp-pangas polyculture. Fingerling and feed cost, and pond size significantly explained the variation of income from pangas monoculture. These factors have significantly influenced the income from the crop. Functional analysis shows that 1 % increase in the feed cost might increase 0. 51 % of pangas income and 0. 41 % in carp-pangas income.
