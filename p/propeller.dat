5|$|A rudder and {{a section}} of <b>propeller</b> shaft were {{on display at the}} Arashiyama Art Museum until it closed around 1991. The rudder, an anchor and one <b>propeller</b> have been {{relocated}} to the JMSDF Kure Museum, directly {{across the street from the}} Yamato Museum. The left-side 410mm gun from No. 3 turret is displayed outside as well, in Daiwa Park, Kure. The current whereabouts of the <b>propeller</b> shaft is now unknown.|$|E
5|$|Engines and {{propellers}} numbers 1 to 3 suffered substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and <b>propeller</b> number 4 suffered much less damage. The investigators determined {{that at the time}} of impact, propellers 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing power but <b>propeller</b> number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action was taken by the crew to unfeather <b>propeller</b> number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained evidence of any internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the results indicated normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the <b>propeller</b> blades. United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a <b>propeller</b> had reversed.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{equipped}} with contra-rotating <b>propellers,</b> {{also referred to}} as CRP, coaxial contra-rotating <b>propellers,</b> or high-speed <b>propellers,</b> apply the maximum power of usually a single piston or turboprop engine to drive two coaxial <b>propellers</b> in contra-rotation (rotation about the same axis in opposite directions). Two <b>propellers</b> are arranged one behind the other, and power is transferred from the engine via a planetary gear or spur gear transmission. Contra-rotating <b>propellers</b> {{should not be confused with}} counter-rotating propellers—airscrews on separate shafts turning in opposite directions.|$|R

5|$|The {{engine and}} <b>propeller</b> had {{automatic}} controls, and an auto-trimmer made the aircraft tail-heavy as the pilot rolled over into his dive, lining up red lines at 60°, 75° or 80° on the cockpit side window with {{the horizon and}} aiming at the target with {{the sight of the}} fixed gun. The heavy bomb was swung down clear of the <b>propeller</b> on crutches prior to release.|$|E
5|$|A 1926 {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy, Mumma served {{on a number of}} warships.

50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} XF-12 called for contra-rotating <b>propellers,</b> {{similar to those used}} on the original XF-11. However, due to the added complexity and reliability issues, the <b>propellers</b> were never installed. They would have been twin three-bladed <b>propellers</b> (rotating in opposite directions). As it was, the aircraft used standard four-bladed Curtiss Electric <b>propellers</b> for all flights.|$|R
50|$|Contra-rotating <b>propellers</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counter-rotating <b>propellers,</b> a term which describes non-coaxial <b>propellers</b> on separate shafts; one turning clockwise and the other counter-clockwise.

5|$|In late July, Wichita {{went into}} drydock at the Royal Navy base in Rosyth, Scotland. Repairs, which {{included}} correcting a <b>propeller</b> shaft vibration, lasted from 24 July until 9 August. The repairs to the <b>propeller</b> shaft were ineffective, however, which necessitated {{a return to}} the United States. She reached the New York Navy Yard on 22 August for repairs, which lasted until 5 September. She completed a round of post-repair sea trials before conducting gunnery exercises in the Chesapeake Bay. Wichita conducted training off the Virginia Capes {{for the rest of the}} month, after which she steamed to Casco Bay in Maine for further maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1922, A Farman F.60 Goliath on {{a flight}} from Croydon Airport to Paris, {{suffered}} a severely damaged <b>propeller</b> after flying through torrential rain whilst crossing the English Channel. The engine was shut down and a precautionary landing was made at Saint-Inglevert where the <b>propeller</b> was changed in 15 minutes. The aircraft then departed for Le Bourget, where arrival was only 12 minutes later than scheduled.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October, Wichita {{left the}} area, bound for Ulithi, {{reaching}} her destination on 2 November. After replenishing her ammunition and stores, {{she returned to}} Leyte for several days, {{until the middle of}} November. Her crew detected severe vibrations in her No. 4 engine; the <b>propeller</b> shaft had broken and the <b>propeller</b> was trailing. She was therefore detached on 18 November for repairs in California, via Ulithi. While in Ulithi, divers discovered cracks in a strut for No. 3 <b>propeller</b> shaft; now only two screws were operational. She reached San Pedro in California on 15 December. She entered the Terminal Island Navy Yard shortly after reaching port. Repairs lasted until 8 February 1945, and by 28 February, she departed for Pearl Harbor. Wichita arrived in Hawaii on 6 March, before departing five days later for Ulithi.|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{efficiencies}} of two series of <b>propellers</b> having {{two types of}} blade sections are compared. Six full-scale <b>propellers</b> were used, three having R. A. F. - 6 and three Clark Y airfoil sections with thickness/chord ratios of 0. 06, 0. 08, and 0. 10. The <b>propellers</b> were tested at five pitch setting, which covered the range ordinarily used in practice. The <b>propellers</b> having the Clark Y sections gave the highest peak efficiency at the low pitch settings. At the high pitch settings, the <b>propellers</b> with R. A. F. - 6 sections gave about the same maximum efficiency as the Clark Y <b>propellers</b> and were more efficient for the conditions of climb and take-off...|$|R
5000|$|Counter-rotating <b>propellers</b> are {{sometimes}} used on twin-, and other multi-engine, propeller-driven aircraft. The <b>propellers</b> of these wing-mounted engines turn {{in opposite directions}} from those on the other wing. Generally, the <b>propellers</b> on both engines of most conventional twin-engined aircraft spin clockwise (as viewed {{from the rear of}} the aircraft). Counter-rotating <b>propellers</b> generally spin clockwise on the left engine, and counter-clockwise on the right. The advantage of counter-rotating <b>propellers</b> is to balance out the torque effects of high-power piston engine as well as gyroscopic precession effects (p-factor) during flight manoeuvres, eliminating the problem of the critical engine. These {{are sometimes}} referred to as [...] "handed" [...] <b>propellers</b> since there are left hand and right hand versions of each prop.|$|R

5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast <b>propeller.</b> The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the <b>propeller</b> to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the <b>propeller</b> design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E
5|$|The very {{expensive}} project of 1910, costing Coandă about one million francs, {{left him with}} limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coandă to build the Coandă-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy. At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed <b>propeller.</b> The combination of two engines connected to one <b>propeller</b> was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one. During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed <b>propeller</b> was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version, was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified.|$|E
50|$|Folding <b>propellers</b> are spun {{outwards}} by {{centrifugal force}} when {{the engine is}} turning, but when the engine stops, the pressure of airflow or waterflow forces the blades back. It follows that such <b>propellers</b> must be pushers, as tractor <b>propellers</b> cannot fold back. Typically, the blades are geared together so that they open and close in unison. Folding <b>propellers</b> used mainly to be two-bladed, but 3-bladed and 4-bladed versions are now available.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its <b>propeller.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coandă was {{interested}} in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor <b>propeller,</b> and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift <b>propeller</b> was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. It was around this time that Coandă's interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, {{but it would not}} be ready for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a <b>propeller</b> in flight but landed safely; K7033s <b>propeller</b> was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E
