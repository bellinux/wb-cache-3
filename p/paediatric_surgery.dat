500|$|Jones' murder made {{headline}} news across Jamaica. Jamaica's Justice Minister, Senator Mark Golding, condemned the killing {{and called for}} an end to [...] "depraved acts of violence" [...] in Jamaica. He added that [...] "all well-thinking Jamaicans" [...] should embrace [...] "the principle of respect for the basic human rights of all persons" [...] and express tolerance towards minority groups such as the LGBT community. Annie Paul, the publications officer of the Jamaican campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI), stated that on the basis of comments provided on social media, she thought that most Jamaicans believed that Jones provoked his own murder by cross-dressing within a society that did not tolerate such behaviour. NewtonD. Duncan, the UWI Professor of <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Surgery,</b> similarly noted that the [...] "overwhelming majority" [...] of Jamaicans believed that cross-dressers are homosexuals and deserve punishment. He added that this was a common misconception, because the majority of cross-dressers were heterosexual. He condemned the attack and compared it to the lynching of an African-American man in Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, drawing links between the anti-LGBT violence of Jamaica and the anti-black violence of the mid-20th century United States.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Myocardial {{injury is}} an {{important}} cause of mortality and morbidity after <b>paediatric</b> cardiac <b>surgery.</b> Data obtained from studies in animals imply that juvenile myocardium is more resistant {{to the effects of}} ischaemia and reperfusion than adult myocardium but there is little confirmatory evidence in the clinical setting. DESIGN: Prospective observational study of biochemical markers of myocardial injury in a paediatric population undergoing cardiac surgery. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre for <b>paediatric</b> cardiac <b>surgery.</b> PATIENTS: Forty patients undergoing <b>paediatric</b> cardiac <b>surgery</b> of varying complexity including closure of atrial and ventricular septal defects and arterial switch for simple transposition. A control group included patients undergoing thoracotomy for closure of a patent ductus arteriosus or repair of a coarctation. INTERVENTIONS: Serial measurements of myoglobin, the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), and the highly specific markers of myocardial damage cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) were made before and 1, 6, 24, and 48 to 72 hours after operation. RESULTS: There were significant increases in myoglobin and CK-MB, but not cTnT or cTnI, in the control group. There were significant increases in the four biochemical markers in all the cardiac operations but especially in the ventricular septal defect and transposition group. Increases in CK-MB and cTnT were about five times greater than those previously reported in adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: (i) Cardiac troponins are more specific markers of myocardial injury in <b>paediatric</b> cardiac <b>surgery</b> than myoglobin and CK-MB. (ii) Paediatric myocardium seems to be more vulnerable to injury during cardiac surgery than adult myocardium...|$|R

40|$|How {{creation}} of a parent satisfaction questionnaire improved multidisciplinary service delivery in a <b>paediatric</b> day <b>surgery</b> unit. Alison Bradley Auditing patient satisfaction has become a keystone of quality patient centred healthcare. A plethora of patient satisfaction studies exist {{but only a few}} studies have been evaluated for their validity, reliability, specificity or psychometric properties. And the majority focus on adult health care. However, if validated tools are not utilised, then inaccurate results could stymie service improvement. The level of satisfaction with the <b>paediatric</b> day <b>surgery</b> service at Tayside Children's Hospital was unknown. Our objective was to measure parent satisfaction with the <b>paediatric</b> day <b>surgery</b> by creating a parent satisfaction questionnaire which has undergone satisfactory testing for validity, reliability, specificity and psychometric properties. A Likert-style questionnaire was constructed through literature review and focus group meetings with professionals, parents and patient groups to establish content validity. Statements worded in positive phrasing were re-worded in negative phrasing to ensure intra-rater reliability. A pilot study was conducted and responses analysed for construct validity and inter-rater agreement. Internal reliability was established using Chronbach's alpha analysis, which produced scores for each part of the questionnaire between 0. 7 and 0. 9. Overall parent satisfaction was high. 95. 48 % either strongly agreed or agreed with positively worded statements regarding pre-operative clini...|$|R

40|$|<b>Paediatric</b> day-case <b>surgery</b> now forms a {{large part}} of {{paediatric}} anaesthetic practice in both specialist and non-specialist centres. It is popular not only with those who plan and manage health care but also with the medical personnel, parents and children attending. The economic arguments are sound, allowing more patients to be treated at a lower cost per patient 1 while freeing up scarce resources for others. Advances in anaesthesia and the promotion of local anaesthetic techniques have already opened the way for more extensive surgery to be feasible as day-case procedures. However, more invasive surgery such as orchidopexy and tonsillectomy are associated with intense and longer lasting pain which may be missed after the patient has been discharged home.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Transcranial {{electric}} stimulation elicited muscle motor evoked potentials (TESmMEPs) {{is one of}} {{the best}} methods for corticospinal tract's function monitoring during spine and spinal cord surgeries. A train of multipulse electric stimulation is required for eliciting TESmMEPs under general anaesthesia. Here, we investigated the best stimulation parameters for eliciting and recording tibialis anterior's TESmMEPs during <b>paediatric</b> scoliosis <b>surgery.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: Numbers of pulses (NOP), inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) and current intensities allowing the best size tibialis anterior muscle's TESmMEPs under general anaesthesia, were tested and collected during 77 <b>paediatric</b> scoliosis <b>surgery</b> monitoring procedures in our hospital. Individual pulse duration was kept at 0. 5 ms and stimulating electrodes were positioned at C 1 and C 2 (International 10 - 20 -EEG-System) during all the tests. RESULTS: The NOP used for eliciting the best tibialis anterior TESmMEPs response was 5, 6, and 7 respectively in 21 (27 %), 47 (61 %) and 9 (12 %) out of the 77 patients. The ISI was 2, 3 and 4 ms respectively in 13 (17 %), 55 (71 %) and 9 (12 %) of them. The current intensity used varied from 300 to 700 V (mean: 448 ± 136 V). CONCLUSION: Most patients had 6 as best NOP (61 %) and 3 ms as best ISI (71 %). These findings support that a NOP of 6 and an ISI of 3 ms should be preferentially used as optimal stimulation settings for intraoperative tibialis anterior muscle's TESmMEPs eliciting and recording during <b>paediatric</b> scoliosis <b>surgery...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: <b>Paediatric</b> cardiac <b>surgery</b> has {{developed}} dramatically {{during the last}} decades. Today, {{a wide range of}} patients is operated on-from premature neonates to grown up children with congenital heart disease. Excessive bleeding during and after cardiac surgery is still common, and {{it is one of the}} most serious complications. In this thesis, we consider different aspects of monitoring of coagulation and platelet function during and after <b>paediatric</b> cardiac <b>surgery.</b> The aims were to determine (1) whether thromboelastometry analyses can be accelerated, (2) whether routine use of intraoperative thromboelastometry reduces perioperative transfusions, (3) whether platelet inhibition can be monitored with impedance aggregometry in children with systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, (4) how platelet count and function varies perioperatively, (5) whether ultrafiltration influences coagulation and platelet function, and (6) whether thromboelastometry detects clinically significant platelet dysfunction. Methods: Paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery were included in five pro-spective studies. Coagulation was assessed with standard laboratory tests and throm-boelastometry while platelet function was assessed with impedance aggregometry. Results: Thromboelastometry can be accelerated by performing the analysis before ultrafiltration and weaning of cardiopulmonary bypass, and by analyzing clot firmness after 10 minutes. Routine use of intraoperative thromboelastometry reduces the overall proportion of patients receiving transfusions (64 % vs. 92 %, p < 0. 001). Impedance aggregometry can be used to monitor anti-platelet effects of acetyl salicylic acid after shunt implantation in paediatric patients. A substantial proportion of the patients are outside the therapeutic range 3 - 6 months after surgery. There are substantial reduc-tions both in platelet count and platelet function during and immediately after surgery. Platelet function, but not platelet count, recovers during the first 24 hours after sur-gery. Ultrafiltration has no or limited effect on platelet count, platelet function, and thromboelastometry analyses. Thromboelastometry has acceptable ability to detect intraoperative but not postoperative ADP-induced platelet dysfunction. Conclusion: Monitoring of coagulation and platelet function gives important information about haemostatic disturbances during and after <b>paediatric</b> cardiac <b>surgery.</b> Routine monitoring of the coagulation markedly reduces transfusion requirements in pae-diatric cardiac surgery. After surgery, more specific platelet tests are necessary to assess platelet function.
