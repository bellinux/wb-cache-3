5|$|A few {{controversial}} {{studies have}} linked <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> initials. However, McCullough and Williams {{found no evidence}} of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.|$|E

5|$|Although athletes {{representing}} Jamaica had won {{medals at}} every Olympic games since 1948 with the exceptions of the 1956 and 1964 games, the nation's {{delegation to the}} Beijing Olympics marked its most successful <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> that date {{than at any other}} Olympic games. More athletes (50 in total, including more female athletes than ever before) competed for Jamaica in Beijing than at any previous Games, more gold medals were won (6 in Beijing alone, almost doubling the number of gold medals won in Jamaica's Olympic history) and more medals were won overall (11 medals, besting Jamaica's showing at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where 9 medals were won).|$|E
5|$|As the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 {{became more}} common, the U.S. Air Force {{initiated}} the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) program {{to provide an}} equivalent to allies. The USAF desired a light weight fighter with competitive <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> the MiG, inexpensive when purchased in large numbers, and with reasonable operating costs for prospective customer nations. Although numerous companies entered designs, Northrop's existing F-5 {{put them in a}} leading position. They submitted an upgrade, the F-5E Tiger II, with the AN/APQ-153 radar and other changes to allow the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile to be fired from wing-tip rails. On 20 November 1970, Northrop's entry was announced as the IFA winner. Northrop produced a total of 1,399 F-5E/F Tiger IIs by the time manufacturing ended in 1986.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Del Potro {{defeated}} Henri Laaksonen, Adrián Menéndez-Maceiras and Roberto Bautista Agut {{in straight}} sets, putting his best year <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> date against Bautista Agut. He began his fourth round match against Dominic Thiem greatly struggling, falling 1-6, 2-6 behind. However, he then raised his level and, {{with the help}} of the crowd, he eventually prevailed in five sets, including saving two match points in the fourth set with two aces. In the post match interview he admitted he considered retiring from the match during the second set.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the Armored Force had two {{operational}} armored divisions: the 1st Armored Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games of the Louisiana Maneuvers in August and September 1941, and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> date.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too costly to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E

It was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards held on January 31, 2010.

5|$|For 2011, Robson hired a new coach, Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, {{and moved}} her working base to Paris. Her season was {{disrupted}} by injury at the Hopman Cup {{and she did}} not compete in a tournament until March 2011; her comeback was then delayed for a further month by an injury in her second competition. Returning again at the end of April 2011, Robson's best <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> date came at the $50,000 tournament at Indian Harbor Beach, Florida, where she reached the semifinal. Robson split from Mouratoglou just before Wimbledon. Robson then won her first match at a Grand Slam as she defeated Angelique Kerber, but lost to Maria Sharapova in the second round.|$|E
5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E

Ryder offered a $200,000 reward for the 12-year-old kidnap victim's safe return. After the girl's death, Ryder starred as Jo in the 1994 film {{adaptation}} of Little Women by Louisa May Alcott and dedicated her <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> Klaas's memory. Little Women was one of Klaas's favorite novels.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 England {{first used}} a skin-tight strip. This was {{intended}} {{to make it more}} difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling. The home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials used are superior, offering improved <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> the 2003 kit. However, a sweeping red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the top left, and a changed away-strip (dark blue to red), have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on St George's Cross at the expense of the traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two.

Massa shared the third row with Mark Webber, who {{did not seem to be}} suffering the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard out in the first session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at a lap in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E

Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times notes that Parker's talents are well-employed in his supporting role. In Every Secret Thing, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times found Parker and his detective partner to Elizabeth Banks to have been overwhelmed in their roles. Travers also found the detectivework to be uncompelling. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter found Parker's <b>performance</b> <b>to</b> have had its moments.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Arthur Hammond orchestrated the {{sections}} of the neglected 1863 vocal score that had been cut out from the post-1886 scores.
