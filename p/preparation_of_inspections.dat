40|$|Under the Additional Protocol of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) {{complementing}} the safeguards {{agreements between}} States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), commercial satellite imagery {{is an important}} source of information within safeguards that are fully information-driven. Satellite imagery can assist in the evaluation of site declarations, the detection of undeclared nuclear facilities, and the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> or other visits. For analyzing and assessing the development of sites under construction (whether declared or not) and for monitoring clandestine facilities, multitemporal satellite imagery acquired over the same area at different times is needed. In remote sensing processing, the comparison of two or more images acquired at different times in order to identify significant changes of or at the earth’s surface is known as change detection. In the last decade several approaches for change detection have evolved and evaluated with regard to their suitability as to safeguards purposes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} further investigate the potential of object-based change detection using two images acquired over the same area. In addition, also methods for assessing a series of satellite imagery acquired over the same area, the so-called time series analysis, will be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|When {{a nuclear}} {{installation}} enters a Safeguards regime, {{it is important}} to provide a description of the premises in a cost-effective manner. This paper describes an outdoor modelling and verification system - OVS - developed under the research programme associated to the European Commission's Support Programme to the IAEA. The OVS consists of a 3 D laser range scanner, high-resolution digital photography or video, geo-location system (e. g., GPS or Galileo) and an inertial navigation system. The complete OVS is easily mounted on a vehicle roof bars, or on any mobile transport system (e. g., scooter). The OVS integrates models using data acquired at ground level with airborne and/or satellite data. For complete modelling, i. e., both indoors and outdoors, the OVS could complement the already operational 3 Dimensional Laser Range Finder system (3 D-LRFD) that is currently used by the IAEA to accurately map the interiors of complex facilities for the purpose of performing design information verification (DIV). The paper describes the OVS architecture and recent demonstration examples. Also discussed are the integration and navigation capabilities of the high resolution 3 D models 'as is' with geographical information systems and associated databases and layers. The result is a spatially accurate image that not only is useful for design verification but could also be relevant for the training and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections.</b> JRC.

40|$|Under the Additional Protocol of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) {{complementing}} the safeguards {{agreements between}} States and the International Atomic Energy Agency, commercial satellite imagery, preferably acquired by very high-resolution (VHR) satellite sensors, {{is an important}} source of safeguards-relevant information. Satellite imagery can assist in the evaluation of site declarations, design information verification, the detection of undeclared nuclear facilities, and the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> or other visits. With the IAEA’s Geospatial Exploitation System (GES), satellite imagery and other geospatial information such as site plans of nuclear facilities are available for a broad range of inspectors, analysts and country officers. The demand for spatial information and new tools to analyze this data is growing, together with the rising number of nuclear facilities under safeguards worldwide. Automated computer-driven processing of satellite imagery could therefore add a big value in the safeguards verification process. These could be, for example, satellite imagery pre-processing algorithms specially developed for new sensors, tools for pixel or object-based image analysis, or geoprocessing tools that generate additional safeguards-relevant information. In the last decade procedures for automated (pre-) processing of satellite imagery have considerably evolved. This paper aims at testing some pixel-based and object-based procedures for automated change detection and classification in support of safeguards verification. Taking different nuclear sites as examples, these methods will be evaluated and compared with regard to their suitability to (semi-) automatically extract safeguards-relevant information...|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a fish quality control and <b>of</b> a fish <b>inspection</b> service {{has been one of}} the most important contributions of the UNDP/FAO assistance to the Mozambique Fishery Sector through many subsequent projects since 1993. The institutionalization of a national fish inspection service within the Secretariat of State for Fisheries (SEP) was only feasible following the approval of the Fisheries Law in 1991. The project provided assistance during the whole of 1992 for the setting up of the service central nucleus, definition of functions and responsibilities, and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> regulations. At the same time, activities focused on training and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> training programmes for national staff in all technical, managerial and legal aspects to be applied to inspection/quality certification of products for export.

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports design {{requirements}} derived from an ethnographic fieldwork on road inspectors, {{the design of}} a mobile service supporting infrastructure management, and initial user feedback. Seeing that the road inspectors are truly mobile, acting in vast settings, full of objects with variable status, they lack overview of their upcoming tasks. The PlaceMemo prototype allows them to place geographically coupled voice annotations in their work setting. The voice memos are played in their entire length before reaching the precise position of the recording, and are also accessible when being geographically distant. By handing out the prototype to a number of users, we successfully demonstrate that this lightweight context-aware system facilitates their mobile work. They receive an overview supporting the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> tours in advance, and can easily access earlier recordings while driving, in order to be reminded and to prepare stops in time...|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive {{testing of}} rails, {{pipelines}} and other structures is of {{strong interest in}} evaluating the integrity <b>of</b> components. <b>Preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> procedures for such complex structures with simulation is of great importance to understand the ultrasonic wave behaviour and influencing factors, to optimize NDT configurations and to save time and cost. This contribution reports on the three-dimensional simulation of elastic wave propagation using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The equations of motion and the stress strain relations completely define the elastic wave motion in the considered media. The numerical model has been successfully implemented and tested for numerous cases involving phased array and circular transducers in steel specimens in immersion and contact technique. Model defects such as flat-bottomed holes or side-drilled holes have been simulated. The work presented here also addresses the use of GPGPU (General Purpose computation on Graphical Processing Units) in taking advantage of massive data parallelism innate to the FDTD approach. The results show a strong improvement in the speed of computation in comparison to serial execution on CPU. We show representative results, also in comparison against simulated data obtained by a validated semi-analytical approach...|$|R

The species was based on a single individual collected on July 9, 1883, in 698 meters of water off northwest Africa ("Talisman" Station 70). Unfortunately, Richardson included no illustrations with her des-cription. Kussakin (1965) tentatively listed Dactyhstylis as belonging to the Desmoso-matidae, but did not attempt to diagnose the genus. He probably had not seen the specimen and was only following Richardson's determination. Wolff (1962) also included Dactyhstylis in the Desmosomatidae, but without comment. Recently, J.
