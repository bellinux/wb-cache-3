50|$|A DOWS {{system is}} {{installed}} {{at the bottom of}} an oil well, it separates oil and water in the wellbore. The oil rich stream is brought to the surface while the water rich stream is pumped into an injection formation without ever coming to the surface. A DOWS system includes many components but the two primary components are an oil/water separation system and a pumping/injection system used to lift oil to the surface and inject the water into a deeper formation. Two basic types of DOWS systems have been developed, one type uses hydrocyclones to mechanically separate oil and water and the other relies on gravity separation that takes place in the wellbore. Three basic types of pumping/injection systems are used with the DOWS technology. These include electrical submersible <b>pumps,</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pumps</b> and sucker rod pumps. Hydrocyclone separators are usually used with the electrical submersible pumps because of higher drawdown created with effective injection of water into the lower zone.|$|R

50|$|In operation, <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{fundamentally}} fixed flow rate pumps, like piston pumps and peristaltic pumps, and {{this type of}} pump needs a fundamentally different understanding than the types of pumps to which people are more commonly introduced, namely ones that {{can be thought of}} as generating pressure. This can lead to the mistaken assumption that all pumps can have their flow rates adjusted by using a valve attached to their outlet, but with this type of pump this assumption is a problem, since such a valve will have practically no effect on the flow rate and completely closing it will involve very high pressures being generated. To prevent this, pumps are often fitted with cut-off pressure switches, rupture discs (deliberately weak and easily replaced), or a bypass pipe that allows a variable amount of a fluid to return to the inlet. With a bypass fitted, a fixed flow rate pump is effectively converted to a fixed pressure one.|$|R
5000|$|In the SAGD process, two {{parallel}} horizontal oil wells are drilled in the formation, one about 4 to 6 metres above the other. The upper well injects steam, {{and the lower}} one collects the heated crude oil or bitumen that flows down due to gravity, plus recovered water from the condensation of the injected steam. The basis of the SAGD process is that thermal communication is established with the reservoir so that the injected steam forms a [...] "steam chamber". The heat from the steam reduces the viscosity of the heavy crude oil or bitumen which allows it to flow down into the lower wellbore. The steam and associated gas rise because of their low density compared to the heavy crude oil below, ensuring that steam is not produced at the lower production well, tend to rise in the steam chamber, filling the void space left by the oil. Associated gas forms, to a certain extent, an insulating heat blanket above (and around) the steam. Oil and water flow is by a countercurrent, gravity driven drainage into the lower well bore. The condensed water and crude oil or bitumen is recovered to the surface by <b>pumps</b> such as <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pumps</b> that work well for moving high-viscosity fluids with suspended solids.|$|R

50|$|A <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a type}} of {{positive}} displacement pump and is also known as a progressing cavity pump, progg cavity pump, eccentric screw pump or cavity pump. It transfers fluid by means of the progress, through the pump, of a sequence of small, fixed shape, discrete cavities, as its rotor is turned. This leads to the volumetric flow rate being proportional to the rotation rate (bidirectionally) and to low levels of shearing being applied to the pumped fluid. Hence these pumps have application in fluid metering and pumping of viscous or shear-sensitive materials. The cavities taper down toward their ends and overlap with their neighbours, so that, in general, no flow pulsing is caused by the arrival of cavities at the outlet, other than that caused by compression of the fluid or pump components.|$|E

40|$|A fluidic {{pulse jet}} mixing system, {{designed}} and fabricated by AEA Technology, was successfully demonstrated for mobilization of remote-handled transuranic (RH-TRU) sludge for retrieval from three 50, 000 -gal horizontal waste storage tanks (W- 21, W- 22, and W- 23) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The pulse jet system is unique {{because it does}} not contain any moving parts except for some solenoid valves which can be easily replaced if necessary. The pulse jet system consisted of seven modular equipment skids and was installed and commissioned in about 7 weeks. The system used specially designed fluidic jet pumps and charge vessels, along with existing submerged nozzles for mixing the settled sludges with existing supernate in the tank. The operation also used existing piping and <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pumps</b> for retrieval and transfer of the waste mixtures. The pulse jet system operated well and experienced no major equipment malfunctions. The modular design, use of quick-connect couplings, and low-maintenance aspects of the system minimized radiation exposure during installation and operation of the system. The extent of sludge removal from the tanks was limited by the constraints of using the existing tank nozzles and the physical characteristics of the sludge. Removing greater than 98 % of this sludge would require aggressive use of the manual sluicer (and associated water additions), a shielded sluicer system that utilizes supernate from existing inventory, or a more costly and elaborate robotic retrieval system. The results of this operation indicate that the pulse jet system should be considered for mixing and bulk retrieval of sludges in other horizontal waste tanks at ORNL and US Department of Energy sites...|$|R

40|$|During this quarter, the {{majority}} of activity focused on grout emplacement at the Lodestar Energy Inc. (formerly Costain Coal Co.) surface mine auger holes described in the previous report. Specifically, {{two different types of}} grout pumps were investigated: a piston pump used in previous demonstrations, and a <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pump.</b> The latter is currently utilized for grouting in underground coal mines, is relatively small and portable, and is capable of receiving dry material (e. g., fly ash) and water, mixing it to produce a grout, and pumping the grout at high pressure. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate it`s potential use in auger mine filling. Several field demonstrations were conducted using the different pumps. Numerous problems were encountered when using the <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pump,</b> all of which were related to its inability to handle the highly reactive and heterogeneous FBC fly ash. Even relatively small ash agglomerates (< 1 in. in diameter), which were not a problem for the larger piston pump, caused blockages in the <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> which not only proved extremely difficult to clear, but also resulted in significant mechanical failures. Furthermore, mixing of dry fly ash with water within the <b>progressive</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> was inconsistent and difficult to control. Consequently, the pump was unable to completely fill even a single auger hole. It was found that a large proportion of bed ash in the grout generated a large amount of heat and caused early stiffening of the material. During the experiments, cylinders of grout were prepared for compressive strength testing, and moisture contents were determined on-site. A thermocouple assembly was also constructed to record grout temperatures within an auger hole...|$|E

40|$|Depleted reservoirs, damaged {{wells and}} high GOR ratio wells {{need to be}} estimulated in order to {{increase}} their production or to start it, normally, after wells under such circumstances have been intervened. Gas injection has been a default solution in decades for estimulating well production. The main reason for using gas at high injection rates is to circulate the column of fluids inside the well up to the surface and reduce the differential pressure across the wellbore so that the well may eventually produce by itself. As a simple analysis, mechanical pumps do the same function, they increase the fluid rate and decrease the differential pressure so that fluids can flow easier and be transported from one point to another. This study suggests the use of downhole Electrical Submersible <b>Pumps</b> and <b>Progressive</b> <b>Cavity</b> <b>Pumps</b> driven by electrical motors and not rods on subsea wells, in order to perform the same operation as nirogen injection. To reduce the differential pressure across the wellbore, transport the fluids from the wellbore to the surface, initially, so that the well may recover its flowing capacity. The pumps are not to be placed permanently and are intended to be suspended by means of intervention tools (CT & WL). Intervention operations are driven currently by three different kinds of equipments, BOP, LWRP and RLWI. Results suggest the use for pumping devices above the DHSV in cases where the well has been shut in and filled with kill fluid. Such intervention can be even driven by RLWI. However, wells with GOR ratios greater than 200 m 3 /m 3 may represent great technical and safety challenges. Pump devices may encounter several operational problems and operations should be carried out close to the well perforations. Alternative methods should be evaluated for such case. Analysis on pump design calculations, operational well limitations, pump capacities, well barrier schematics and intervention methodology along with disussion of the cases are further described within this project. </p...|$|R
