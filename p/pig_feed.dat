5|$|Given the {{location}} of Aransas bay, shipping {{has always been a}} major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay, especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since {{there was no way to}} refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as <b>pig</b> <b>feed,</b> were disposed in the bay. This changed in 1871, when an ice machine was installed in a packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of the beef from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on the bay. By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.|$|E

However, in 1885, the brothers were persuaded to join the temperance movement, and they poured their entire stock into the gutters of the High Street. Left with no livelihood, they converted their now empty shop into a dairy. Using a milk separator, they bought milk from local farmers, and after extracting the cream and whey, sold the skim back to the farmers for <b>pig</b> <b>feed.</b> In 1888 three more of the Gates brothers and their sons joined the business, which led to the formal registration of the company under the name of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, which after development of its dried milk baby formula in 1906 became Cow & Gate.|$|E

2500|$|Pigs are {{naturally}} omnivorous and are generally fed {{a combination of}} grains and protein sources (soybeans, or meat and bone meal). [...] Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. [...] Consequently, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. [...] <b>Pig</b> <b>feed</b> may be bought packaged, in bulk or mixed on-site. [...] The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. [...] The individual feeding system also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as vitamins and antibiotics are administered preemptively.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds</b> {{has a major}} contribution to climate change, energy use and land occupation impacts of the animal product. Nonetheless, the traditional least-cost (LC) feed formulation methods minimize {{the cost of the}} feed mix, without consideration of its environmental impacts. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the potential mitigation of environmental impacts calculated by Life Cycle Assessment through a multi-objective formulation of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds,</b> in the French context. The linear programming problem built searches the best feed formula under nutritional constraints with a multi-objective function including an economic price index (price of the feed mix relative to LC formulation) and an environmental impacts index (environmental impacts relative to LC formulation). A weighting coefficient between price and environment (α) ranging from 0 to 1 was included. Growing and finishing feeds were formulated with two scenarios of feed ingredients availability (current limited LIM, increased NLIM) and 4 scenarios of feed ingredient prices. When increasing α from 0 to 0. 5, the environmental indexes of the growing and finishing feeds dropped down to - 10 % in LIM and down to - 17 to - 20 % in NLIM scenario, respectively. Concomitantly, the average feed price increased by 1. 5 % in LIM and 1. 7 % in NLIM. For α higher than 0. 5, the environmental index was almost no further reduced. At α= 0. 5, all the impacts considered were reduced relatively to LIM-LC, excepted for land occupation in NLIM. The low-impact feeds incorporated higher proportions of pea and wheat middlings and lower proportions of meals (rapeseed and sunflower) than LC formulated feeds. The multi-objective formulation of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds</b> is an efficient methodology to find low-impact feeds according to a given economic scenario. Improving the availability of some feed ingredients (pea, co-products of wheat…) at the territory level would allow (at same feed’s nutritional composition) further reduction of <b>pig</b> <b>feeds</b> impacts relatively to the current French context. Multi-objective formulation can provide a decision support tool to the feed industry to produce low-impact <b>feeds</b> for the <b>pig</b> production chain...|$|R
