Such <b>pilot</b> <b>investigations</b> may not be required when the same or similar studies are conducted repeatedly and regularly at various points of time. In both the cases, the statistical analyses may provide some potential and useful information about the parameters which can be fruitfully employed in the statistical analysis of current data. Use of such prior information, it is well documented, yields generally more efficient inferences under [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{individuals}} with severe speech impairments {{would benefit from}} a dedicated speech recognition system that is tuned to their speech production abilities. Current commercial systems, however, make strong assumptions about the user's speech patterns and are therefore ineffective for this population. These systems factor out prosodic features that {{may in fact be}} more consistent in this population than phonetic features alone. Our goal is to identify prosodic parameters that convey information about the speaker’s communicative intentions to their listeners. Results of <b>pilot</b> <b>investigations</b> suggest that pitch contour is effective for marking the difference between questions and statements in this population. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that drug abusers are more prone to suicidal ideation, and indeed self-harm is akin to the drug abuse itself. It is therefore important to have maximal contact with this at risk population. Needle exchanges are front line and their main purpose is to reduce the spread of infection. This said there are other purposes for which needle exchanges could and are used. A <b>pilot</b> <b>investigation</b> into the ability of needle exchanges to support users presenting with suicidal and self-harm concerns was implemented...|$|E

Patient safety (PS) {{is a key}} {{healthcare}} goal, yet health professionals struggle to acquire appropriate expertise, including Human Factors/Ergonomics skills, reflected in undergraduate curricula content. More than 50 % of adverse events are medicines-related, yet focus on pharmacists as experts in medicines is scant. This <b>pilot</b> <b>investigation</b> used focus groups and interviews to explore undergraduate PS teaching in purposively-selected UK pharmacy schools.

The notion of question session will be introduced as a means to control the communication among the different agents. We then present a shallow model mainly based on an IR engine and a passage re-ranking that uses the notion of expanded query. We will report the <b>pilot</b> <b>investigation</b> on the performances of the method. 1...|$|E

A <b>pilot</b> <b>investigation</b> on 14 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) newborns was conducted utilizing custom-made reflectance photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensors placed at the fontanelle and foot.

40|$|University collaborations with {{external}} partners {{can be difficult}} to initiate, especially in early-stage or emerging topics. External collaborators may be reluctant to commit the level of funding required to ensure that the topic is given adequate attention, and low-stakes mechanisms are relatively rare. Here, we present a successful model for collaboration between universities and NASA, which uses existing project-based coursework as a vehicle for exploration of emerging topics. This model leverages existing structures, reducing the financial and intellectual commitment of both University and NASA research partners, and facilitating <b>pilot</b> <b>investigations</b> for exploration of potential areas for more in-depth research. We outline the logistical structure and benefits for University and NASA partners over 1. 5 years of collaboration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} information on the background to the two <b>pilot</b> <b>investigations</b> into 'interactive distance e-learning' [IDeL] following the introduction in New South Wales and in the Northern Territory of Australia of satellite-supported two-way broad-band internet services for school-age and adult distance education. The context is the expansion and reform of educational services to these communities. The IDeL service is provided to 'School of the Air' students and parents on isolated stations, remote schools, students and adults in isolated Aboriginal communities, and adults on isolated properties or living in small towns seeking vocational education. The shift to satellite delivery of distance education allows teachers and students to communicate using realtime video, shared computer applications, graphics, audio-conferencing, online chat, and email...|$|R
