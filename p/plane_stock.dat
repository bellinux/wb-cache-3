50|$|At {{the end of}} most episodes, {{the narrator}} would provide an {{epilogue}} of what eventually happened {{to some of the}} passengers, staff, or business decisions (e.g. new <b>plane,</b> <b>stock</b> price) involved in that particular episode.|$|E
50|$|Clocking {{refers to}} the angle at which the {{transfer}} case is tilted {{with reference to the}} horizontal <b>plane.</b> <b>Stock</b> Jeep clocking for the Dana 300 (1980-1986) is usually 23° and stock Eagle and Jeep/New Process clocking is usually 13°. Many factors, most notably ground clearance and front drive shaft clearance, can necessitate a change in the clocking angle. Some aftermarket adapters feature flanges with multiple clocking options.|$|E

50|$|The film {{chronicles the}} history of the State Fair of Texas {{beginning}} in 1886. It covers the banning of gambling at the fair, early Midway rides and some of Dallas' firsts such as electric lights, power stations and air <b>planes.</b> Old <b>stock</b> footage of the State Fair shows why it attracted {{people from all over the}} country. It includes scenes from the bake-offs and cook-offs held annually, plus a comical scene that has women singing a song about SPAM. A Fair to Remember also shows foods that have been included at the fair. Interviews of attendees provide a look into historical Dallas.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war most turbochargers were manually controlled superchargers that used mechanical energy from the engine to force air into the combustion process through the intake manifold. The exhaust based turbocharger most common today was first created for World War II bomber <b>planes</b> and became <b>stock</b> equipment on B-17, B-24 and B-29 bombers.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, Litvinov {{introduced}} {{the new system}} of project development, featuring prefabricated stocks with unified elements. This made a considerable economy of metal and reduced the cycles of stocks production. In 1940, he {{introduced the}} parallelism principle into the aircraft building industry: the preparations {{for the start of}} production were made simultaneously with design works and production of the new machine's plans. After the start of World War II and the evacuation of the factory to Kuybishev, Victor Litvinov organized the mass production of Ilyushin Il-2, introducing the new principle of the conveyor line with both <b>planes</b> and <b>stocks</b> moving on the conveyor band. This innovation was further introduced into all aircraft factories of the USSR and Litvinov was made director of the factory in 1944. In 1965-1973 - Deputy Minister of the General Engineering of the USSR.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotary valve}} works using a short {{circular}} plug {{housed in a}} larger cylindrical casing. Ports are cut along one <b>plane</b> through the <b>stock</b> and direct the airflow into the lengths of tubing when the stock is rotated 90 degrees.Trombone F-attachment valves are usually rotary, with several variations on the basic design also in use, such as the Thayer axial flow valve and Hagmann valve. Horns almost always have rotary valves, and many tubas have rotary valves.Joseph Riedlin is credited with the first use of rotary valves on brass instruments in 1832.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{us believe}} that we make {{contracts}} over the Internet all the time. We buy books and computers, arrange for hotels and <b>planes,</b> trade <b>stocks,</b> and apply for mortgages. But as recently as seven months ago that transaction was most likely not legally binding. This uncertainty led many practitioners, businesspeople, and consumers to question the efficacy of contracts executed by electronic signatures. Without a uniform standard, many jurisdictions ruled inconsistently, while other jurisdictions did not consider the issue. This disparate treatment threatened the legitimacy of online agreements and deprived both consumers and businesses of the certainty and predictability expected from well-developed markets. The law 2 ̆ 7 s formalities evolved outside of the digital world, {{and the process of}} adapting them to it has proven to be more difficult than expected. In June of 2000, Congress attempted to solve this problem with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign) ...|$|R
5000|$|Pocomoke {{continued}} her vital services, taking on Marine Night Fighter Squadron 532 (VMF(N)-532) with <b>planes,</b> rolling <b>stock</b> and equipment and sailed via Pearl Harbor to Funafuti Atoll, anchoring there 11 January 1944. With [...] she steamed for Tarawa {{and returned to}} Hawaii 25 January. Another brief return to the West Coast {{was followed by a}} stopover at Pearl Harbor to take on troops and ammunition destined for Espiritu Santo. Shuttling cargo and fighting men between Espiritu Santo and Guadalcanal consumed Pocomoke’s efforts until she sailed 4 April among the islands of the Solomons group, dispensing needed services, and back to Espiritu Santo. She tended seaplanes at Kwajalein and Eniwetok before anchoring off Saipan 15 June to begin operations for Patrol Squadron 16 which were continued until 12 September. She departed for Kossol Passage, Palau Islands where she {{continued her}} repair and supply functions until 23 November. She finally sailed via Ulithi, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor for San Francisco, arriving 15 December.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurchases {{of major}} {{long-life}} assets such as rolling <b>stock,</b> <b>planes,</b> wind turbines etc. represent a substantial investment by companies or governments, {{from which the}} owner needs to ensure maximum return over the asset's life. A big question facing industry is: “What tools and techniques could be used when planning to introduce a major long life (40 + years) asset, to extend the design life and could this be cost effective?” This paper discusses one particular example of how a customer explored the potential to {{extend the life of}} their asset purchase by approximately 50 % and the methods they were using to achieve this...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} hide his {{addiction}} from a work colleague, he informs her that the petrol smell in his house is from his hobby of flying remote controlled planes. To try to engage an ever-distant Wilson, she asks her brother-in-law, Denny (Jack Kehler), a radio control (RC) hobbyist, to visit Wilson. With the knowledge of an impending visit from Denny, Wilson heads down to the local RC hobbyist shop to buy himself a <b>plane.</b> He also <b>stocks</b> up on some RC fuel to fill his plane and feed his addiction. Out of this lie, a very unusual friendship forms between Wilson and an energetic Denny.|$|R
5|$|Roberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' {{cousin and}} driver shoot {{a woman and}} then use {{the threat of a}} long {{sentence}} to get him to wear a wire. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last <b>planes</b> carrying Lucas' <b>stock,</b> discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this evidence they obtain a warrant to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized Shelby Mustang Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse, killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers.|$|R
25|$|While {{living in}} Lorain, Ohio {{and working in}} a factory, Barr first learned how to fly {{aircraft}} in 1946 {{as part of a}} Piper club. She had dropped out of Oberlin College the year before in order to find a job to pay for flying lessons. After completing her training, she obtained a job training others to be commercial pilots. During the end years of World War II, she decided to help build aircraft for the war, which led to her moving to New York City and joining a aircraft mechanic school. This also involved acting alongside members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots to assist in transporting war goods and planes across the US. The end of the war resulted in the Barrs moving to Susanville, California in 1949, and setting about running and improving the Susanville airport. After obtaining her certification in 1957, she obtained the position of FAA Pilot Examiner for Lassen County. In 1964, Barr {{became one of the first}} four women to ever be a part of the Reno Air Races. She placed second in the Reno National Championships in the <b>Stock</b> <b>Plane</b> Class using a Piper Cherokee.|$|R
50|$|Reactivated under Pacific Air Forces at Clark AB, Philippines in 1973 with a {{training}} mission to provide dissimilar air combat training (DACT) to PACAF fighter squadrons using Soviet-style fighter tactics. Was carried in non-operational status {{until the end}} of August 1975, by which time the 405th Fighter Wing had been replaced by the 3rd TFW at Clark. Even then, it did not start training activities until January 1976, using a number of T-38 Talon DACT aircraft made surplus by the arrival of the F-5E Tiger IIs at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Eventually, the squadron also received the F-5E, with some of the <b>planes</b> coming from <b>stocks</b> destined for the South Vietnamese Air Force but never delivered and an embargoed Ethiopian Air Force order. By that time it had been redesignated Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, and secondly as a Tactical Fighter Training and Aggressor Squadron. Eventually, it became the 26th Aggressor Squadron. The aggressor F-5Es were painted in a variety of colorful camouflage schemes designed to mimic those in use by Warsaw Pact aircraft. Two-digit Soviet-style nose codes were applied to most aggressor aircraft, and these coincided with the last two digits of the serial number. When there was duplication, three digits were used. Squadron {{was among the first to}} apply the star and bar in toned-down or stencil form.|$|R
