25|$|Sibutramine is well absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract (77%), but undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism, reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> after 1 hour {{and has also}} a half-life of 1 hour. Sibutramine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 into two pharmacologically-active primary and secondary amines (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after three to four hours. The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and hydroxylated metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6). Metabolites 5 and 6 are mainly excreted in the urine.|$|E

The absorption of cephalexin was improved in coeliac disease diverticulosis and cystic fibrosis. In Crohn's disease the <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> was reduced and delayed. The absorption of both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole was increased in all three conditions.

40|$|A blinded, four-treatment {{crossover}} study in 16 normal adult male volunteers compared plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of digoxin, measured by radioimmunoassay, after oral administration of soft gelatin capsule formulations of digoxin. Four 0. 4 -mg formulations with different in vitro “burst times” and dissolution rates were administered, with 2 - week intervals between treatments. The two capsules with lowest in vitro burst times (2. 9 and 16 min) gave comparable in vivo results. The other two capsules, with in vitro burst times of 62 and 229 min, produced significant delays in digoxin absorption. In vitro-in vivo correlations {{were obtained by}} comparing the logarithm of the in vitro burst time with time to <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> and the time to the first measurable plasma level (≥ 0. 05 ng/ml).

40|$|A current {{programme}} {{of wildlife}} utilisation in the Andean region involves {{the capture of}} wild vicunas, their shearing, transport and, in some cases, captive farming. The effects of these interventions on the physiology, and thus welfare, of wild vicunas are unknown. As a first step to quantifying and thus mitigating any adverse welfare consequences of this harvest, we measured the immediate and longer-term physical and physiological effects of capture, shearing and transport. A sample of juvenile male vicunas was captured. Six were shorn at the capture site, six after two weeks in captivity, and the remaining seven animals were kept as controls for 39 days. In general, vicunas showed changes in blood glucose, packed cell volume, cortisol, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios within 4 – 6 h following capture. Creatine kinase was also affected by capture and transport, showing a <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> 24 h after capture, which {{was followed by a}} <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> of aspartate aminotransferase four days after capture and transport. After 12 days in captivity, all of the vicunas showed physiological parameters close to expected baseline values for the species.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of ofloxacin {{were investigated}} in 12 normal subjects and 21 uremic patients after {{the administration of}} a single oral 200 -mg dose. An open three-compartment body model was used to calculate ofloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters. In healthy subjects, the <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> averaged 2. 24 +/- 0. 90 micrograms/ml and was obtained at 0. 83 +/- 0. 31 h. The absorption rate constant was 4. 22 +/- 1. 64 h- 1. The terminal half-life was 7. 86 +/- 1. 81 h. The apparent volume of distribution was 2. 53 +/- 0. 78 liters/kg. Total body and renal clearances were 241. 4 +/- 53. 8 and 196. 5 +/- 42. 9 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, respectively. A total of 68. 4 +/- 11. 9 % of the dose was recovered unchanged in 24 -h urine. In uremic patients, the terminal half-life increased {{in relation to the}} degree of renal failure: from 8 h in normal subjects to 37 h in severely uremic patients. Renal insufficiency did not significantly modify the <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level,</b> the apparent volume of distribution, the fractional clearance, or the nonrenal clearance of ofloxacin. However, the time to peak level was delayed in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min.

The onset of antihypertensive action oc-curred within 1 h, with a peak effect at 3 h after dosing. The mean duration of action was up to 12. 0 h. Tol-mesoxide had a mean half-life of 3. 0 h.

40|$|Metrifonate {{concentrations}} in plasma, its inhibition of blood cholinesterase, and side-effects were studied in 16 healthy volunteers {{who received a}} single oral dose of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 or 15 mg/kg in a randomized double-blind study (4 subjects for each dose). Metrifonate was determined by a gas chromatographic method. <b>Peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> were reached within 2 hours; the half-life in plasma, oral clearance, and normalized Cmax and AUCs {{did not differ significantly}} between the four groups. Plasma cholinesterase (BuchE) was inhibited to low levels in all subjects, while erythrocyte cholinesterase (AchE) was affected in a dose-dependent fashion. The occurrence of side-effects correlated strongly with <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> but not with maximum AchE inhibition or with increase in salivation.

The area under the time activity curve, <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> and time taken to reach the peak level of non-metabolised 18 F-GP 1 were calculated.

It is an inhibitor of leukotriene A 4 hydrolase; therefore, production of leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) in biological fluids provides a direct measure of the pharmacodynamic (PD) response to acebilustat treatment. Here we compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and PD between CF patients and healthy volunteers, and investigate the food effect and CYP 3 A 4 induction in healthy volunteers. No significant differences between study populations were observed for <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> (C max) or exposure (AUC).

40|$|Aloin is a physiologically active {{anthraquinone}} {{present in}} aloe. There are two isomers of aloin, aloin A and aloin B, occurring as {{a mixture of}} diastereomers.

Rats were gavaged with 11. 8 g/kg aloin, and the levels of aloin and its conjugates were measured in plasma, tissues, and urine. Plasma aloin level showed a peak at 1 hr after the administration and the concentration was 59. 07 ± 10. 5 ng/ml. The 24 h cumulated urinary aloin was 0. 03 % of the initial dose. These results suggest that aloin is absorbed and reaches a <b>peak</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> within 1 - 1. 5 h after the administration and a significant portion is possibly metabolized or is excreted in feces.
