He instead filed across the raised lines of the type, leaving gaps in the <b>printed</b> <b>letter</b> for long vowels. This can be seen in early printings. Later still a dot diacritic, originally used for vowel length only in handwriting, was extended to print: Thus today ᐊ a contrasts with ᐋ â, and ᒥ mi contrasts with ᒦ mî. Although Cree ê only occurs long, the script made length distinctions for all four vowels. Not all writers then or now indicate length, or do not do so consistently; since there is no contrast, no one today writes ê as a long vowel.|$|E

One represents a separate acquisition of the uppercase and lowercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters</b> (sequentially) and the other deals with letters simultaneously. In practice, teachers often asked themselves, especially in times of reforms in literacy, which model of the acquisition of the letters in initial literacy is more efficient. The research focused on the effect of the two most frequently chosen procedures for acquiring letters of structured literacy in Slovenia, namely the simultaneous treatment of the uppercase and lowercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters</b> (lowercase cursive letters and upper-case cursive letters) and consecutive treatment of <b>letters</b> (uppercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters,</b> lowercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters,</b> lowercase cursive letters, and at last, uppercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters).</b> Furthermore, the focus of the research was on the impact of gender on the ability to write.

All these gave our author the greatest encouragement, and particularly Mr. Walsh, whom Mr. Dryden, in his postscript to Virgil, calls the best critic of his age. [...] "The author," [...] says he, [...] "seems to have a particular genius for this kind of poetry, and a judgment that much exceeds his years. He has taken very freely from the ancients. But what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. It is not flattery at all to say that Virgil had written nothing so good at his age. His preface is very judicious and learned." [...] Letter to Mr. Wycherley, Ap. 1705. The Lord Lansdowne, about the same time, mentioning the youth of our poet, says, in a <b>printed</b> <b>letter</b> of the character of Mr. Wycherley, that [...] "if he goes on as he hath begun in the pastoral way, as Virgil first tried his strength, we may hope to see English poetry vie with the Roman." [...] Notwithstanding the early time of their production, the author esteemed these as the most correct in the versification, and musical in the numbers, of all his works. The reason for his labouring them into so much softness, was, doubtless, that this sort of poetry derives almost its whole beauty from a natural ease of thought and smoothness of verse: whereas that of most other kinds consist in the strength and fulness of both. In a letter of his to Mr. Walsh about this time, we find an enumeration of several niceties in versification, which perhaps have never been strictly observed in any English poem, except in these Pastorals.

The proposed method has been tested on both a publicly available dataset of 10 printers and a new dataset of 18 printers scanned at a resolution of 600 dpi as well as 300 dpi printed in four different fonts.

It is not amiss in {{this place}} to enter a little more fully {{into the spirit of}} the {{principal}} arguments on which Mr. Fox thought proper to rest this his grand and concluding motion, particularly such as were drawn from the internal state of our affairs. Under a specious appearance, (not uncommonly put on by men of unscrupulous ambition,) that of tenderness and compassion to the poor, he did his best to appeal to the judgments of the meanest and most ignorant {{of the people on the}} merits of the war. He had before done something of the same dangerous kind in his <b>printed</b> <b>letter.</b> The ground of a political war is of all things that which the poor laborer and manufacturer are the least capable of conceiving. This sort of people know in general that they must suffer by war. It is a matter to which they are sufficiently competent, because it is a matter of feeling. The causes of a war are not matters of feeling, but of reason and foresight, and often of remote considerations, and of a very great combination of circumstances which they are utterly incapable of comprehending: and, indeed, it is not every man in the highest classes who is altogether equal to it. Nothing, in a general sense, appears to me less fair and justifiable (even if no attempt were made to inflame the passions) than to submit a matter on discussion to a tribunal incapable of judging of more than one side of the question. It is at least as unjustifiable to inflame the passions of such judges against that side in favor of which they cannot so much as comprehend the arguments. Before the prevalence of the French system, (which, as far as it has gone, has extinguished the salutary prejudice called our country,) nobody was more sensible of this important truth than Mr. Fox; and nothing was more proper and pertinent, or was more felt at the time, than his reprimand to Mr. Wilberforce for an inconsiderate expression which tended to call in the judgment of the poor to estimate the policy of war upon the standard of the taxes they may be obliged to pay towards its support.|$|E

That he, {{the said}} Warren Hastings, among other insolent and contumacious charges and aspersions on the Court of Directors, did address {{them in the}} <b>printed</b> <b>letter</b> {{aforesaid}} as follows. [...] "I deny that Rajah Cheyt Sing was a native prince of India. Cheyt Sing {{is the son of}} a collector of the revenue of that province, which his arts, and the misfortunes of his master, enabled him to convert to a permanent and hereditary possession. This man, whom you have thus ranked among the princes of India, will be astonished, when he hears it, at an elevation so unlooked for, nor less at the independent rights which your commands have assigned him,--rights which are so foreign to his conceptions, that I doubt whether he will know in what language to assert them, unless the example which you have thought it consistent with justice, however opposite to policy, to show, of becoming his advocates against your own interests, should inspire any of your own servants to be his advisers and instructors." [...] And he did further, to bring into contempt the authority of the Company, and to excite a resistance to their lawful orders, frame a supposition that the Court of Directors had intended the restoration of the Rajah of Benares, and on that ground did presume in the said libel to calumniate, in disrespectful and contumelious terms, the policy of the Court of Directors, as well as the person whom he did conceive to be the object of their protection, as followeth. [...] "Of the consequences of such a policy I forbear to speak. Most happily, the wretch whose hopes may be excited by the appearances in his favor is ill qualified to avail himself of them, and the force which is stationed in the province of Benares is sufficient to suppress any symptoms of internal sedition; but it cannot fail to create distrust and suspense in the minds both of the rulers and of the people, and such a state is always productive of disorder. But it is not in this partial consideration that I dread the effects of your commands; it is in your proclaimed indisposition against the first executive member of your first government in India. I almost shudder at the reflection of what might have happened, had these denunciations against your own minister, in favor of a man universally considered {{in this part of the}} world as justly attainted for his crimes, the murderer of your servants and soldiers, and the rebel to your authority, arrived two months earlier." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{all those}} acts {{the system of}} {{commerce}} is established as that from whence alone you proposed to make the colonies contribute (I mean directly and by the operation of your superintending legislative power) {{to the strength of}} the empire. I venture to say, that, during that whole period, a Parliamentary revenue from thence was never once in contemplation. Accordingly, in all the number of laws passed with regard to the plantations, the words which distinguish revenue laws specifically as such were, I think, premeditately avoided. I do not say, Sir, that a form of words alters the nature of the law, or abridges the power of the lawgiver. It certainly does not. How ever, titles and formal preambles are not always idle words; and the lawyers frequently argue from them. I state these facts to show, not what was your right, but what has been your settled policy. Our revenue laws have usually a title, purporting their being grants; and the words [...] "give and grant" [...] usually precede the enacting parts. Although duties were imposed on America in acts of King Charles the Second, and in acts of King William, no one title of giving [...] "an aid to his Majesty," [...] or any other of the usual titles to revenue acts, was to be found in any of them till 1764; nor were the words [...] "give and grant" [...] in any preamble until the sixth of George the Second. However, the title of this act of George the Second, notwithstanding the words of donation, considers it merely as a regulation of trade; [...] "An act for the better securing of the trade of his Majesty's sugar colonies in America." [...] This act was made on a compromise of all, and at the express desire of a part, of the colonies themselves. It was therefore in some measure with their consent; and having a title directly purporting only a commercial regulation, and being in truth nothing more, the words were passed by, at a time when no jealousy was entertained, and things were little scrutinized. Even Governor Bernard, in his second <b>printed</b> <b>letter,</b> dated in 1763, gives it as his opinion, that [...] "it was an act of prohibition, not of revenue." [...] This is certainly true, that no act avowedly for the purpose of revenue, and with the ordinary title and recital taken together, is found in the statute-book until the year I have mentioned: that is, the year 1764. All before this period stood on commercial regulation and restraint. The scheme of a colony revenue by British authority appeared, therefore, to the Americans in the light of a great innovation. The words of Governor Bernard's ninth letter, written in November, 1765, state this idea very strongly. [...] "It must," [...] says he, [...] "have been supposed such an innovation as a Parliamentary taxation would cause a great alarm, and meet with much opposition in most parts of America; it was quite new to the people, and had no visible bounds set to it." [...] After stating the weakness of government there, he says, [...] "Was this a time to introduce so great a novelty as a Parliamentary inland taxation in America?" [...] Whatever the right might have been, this mode of using it was absolutely new in policy and practice.|$|E

6000|$|The {{letters to}} Cromwell {{had more than}} an ephemeral success. Curll, in his reply in 1729 to the attack on him in the Dunciad, after noticing Pope's {{affected}} depreciation of them, says, [...] "However, they sell very well; price 5s."[17] The poet had already devised an excuse for following them up by a second set. Theobald, who had earned his lasting enmity by pointing out the errors in his edition of Shakespeare, was employed by some booksellers to edit the posthumous papers of Wycherley, which had been purchased from his heir. The work appeared in 1728. Pope saw in this circumstance a pretence for dragging his own letters before the world, and an opportunity of gratifying his spleen against Theobald. He said that the poems were disreputable {{to the memory of}} his early friend, and that the correspondence was published because it showed that it was his last resolution to have suppressed them.[18] It showed the reverse. The last <b>printed</b> <b>letter</b> of Wycherley exhibits him as intent as ever upon preparing his poems for the press, and if we are to believe that he subsequently abandoned the design, we must accept the fact upon the bare assertion of Pope, which derives no support from any part of the correspondence. But though it failed to answer the purpose avowed by its editor, it answered purposes not avowed which were much nearer to his heart. It shows that the verses of Wycherley were rugged, feeble, and full of repetitions, and that whatever they possessed of strength and harmony was due to the revision of Pope. It shows that he furnished entire passages, and where the text is not explicit on the point he is careful to reclaim his contributions in the notes. It displays on the one hand the [...] "first sprightly runnings" [...] of the precocious young poet, and on the other the [...] "last dull droppings" [...] of the veteran author, who was verging upon his dotage. [...] "If we were to judge," [...] says Warburton, [...] "of this set of letters by the manner of thinking and turn of expression, we should conclude that they were all mistitled, and that those given to the boy of sixteen were written by the man of seventy, and the contrary,--such sober sense, such gravity of manners, and so much judgment and knowledge of composition, enlivened with manly wit, distinguish those of Mr. Pope, while a childish jealousy, a puerile affectation, a lying at catch for points, together with a total contempt of method, make up the character of those of Mr. Wycherley." [...] Warton transcribes the judgment of Warburton, and adds his testimony to the superiority of the letters of Pope. He says that he [...] "has excelled Wycherley in his own way of striving to be always witty," [...] and that [...] "the perpetual attempt of the vain old man to be brilliant, the accumulation of simile upon simile, the antithesis, the cant of satire, the severity on authors, critics, and women, are sufficiently disgusting." [...] In short, the whole effect of the correspondence was to display the infirmities of Wycherley and the merits of Pope; and his mode of relieving his departed friend from the reproach of the posthumous poems was to reveal the secret that the only portions of them which might have done him credit were not his own, but the work of this zealous vindicator of his fame.|$|E

[...] Mayn't I offer you----?" [...] "No, no, no, thank you." [...] "Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.-- [...] And now I'm leaving you a little while. [...] You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps-- [...] Lie down--let yourself go and get some sleep. [...] But first--let's see--what was I going to ask you? [...] Those collars--who shall I address them to, [...] Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?" [...] "Really, friend, I can't let you. You--may need them."

[...] They're only turning yellow where they are. [...] But you're the doctor as the saying is. [...] I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: [...] I've just begun the night. You get some sleep. [...] I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door [...] When I come back so you'll know who it is. [...] There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people. [...] I don't want you should shoot me in the head. [...] What am I doing carrying off this bottle? [...] There now, you get some sleep." [...] He shut the door. [...] The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.|$|E
