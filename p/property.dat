2500|$|In philosophy, supervenience is a {{relation}} {{used to describe}} cases where (roughly speaking) a system's upper-level <b>properties</b> are determined by its lower-level <b>properties.</b> Some philosophers hold {{that the world is}} structured into a kind of hierarchy of <b>properties,</b> where the higher-level <b>properties</b> supervene on the lower-level <b>properties.</b> According to this view, social <b>properties</b> supervene on psychological <b>properties,</b> psychological <b>properties</b> on biological <b>properties,</b> and biological <b>properties</b> on chemical <b>properties.</b> That is, the chemical <b>properties</b> of the world determine a distribution of biological <b>properties,</b> those biological <b>properties</b> determine a distribution of psychological <b>properties,</b> and so forth. So, for example, mind–body supervenience holds that [...] "every mental phenomenon must be grounded in, or anchored to, some underlying physical base (presumably a neural state). This means that mental states can occur only in systems that can have physical properties; namely physical systems." [...] However, mental states cannot be reduced to physical <b>properties.</b>|$|R
