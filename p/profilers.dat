5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} <b>profilers</b> Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe the driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E

5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on <b>profilers</b> such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} design and {{implementation}} of a call-graph <b>profiler</b> for GNU Octave, a numerical computing platform. GNU Octave simplifies matrix computation for use in modeling or simulation. Our work provides a call-graph <b>profiler,</b> which is an improvement on the flat <b>profiler.</b> We elaborate design constraints of building a <b>profiler</b> for numerical computation, and benchmark the <b>profiler</b> by comparing it to the rudimentary timer start-stop (tic-toc) measurements, for a similar set of programs.

40|$|In {{this report}} we present the region <b>profiler</b> {{used in the}} ML Kit (a Standard ML {{compiler}} that uses region inference, [7]).

25|$|In {{the early}} IBM PC market (1981–83) the major {{programming}} tool vendors all made compilers that {{worked in a}} similar fashion. For example, the Microsoft Pascal system consisted of two compiler passes and a final linking pass (which could take minutes on systems with only floppy disks for secondary storage, although programs were very much smaller than they are today). This process was less resource-intensive than the later integrated development environment (IDE). Vendors of software development tools aimed their products at professional developers, and the price for these basic tools plus ancillary tools like <b>profilers</b> ran into the hundreds of dollars.|$|E
25|$|The {{matter is}} then {{taken over by}} a pair of representatives from the New York County District Attorney's Office, an Executive Assistant District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney. They discuss deals, prepare the {{witnesses}} and evidence, and conduct the People's case in the trial. The District Attorneys work together and with the Medical Examiner's office, the crime laboratory (including fingerprint analysts, DNA <b>profilers</b> and ballistics analysts), and psychologists or psychiatrists (if the defendant uses an insanity plea), all of whom may be needed to testify in court for the prosecution. The police may also reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the D.A.'s office, in consultation with the District Attorney for advice on the case, as the D.A., being an elected official, sometimes brings political considerations to bear concerning decisions to prosecute various alleged offenders. If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.|$|E

40|$|A <b>profiler</b> is an {{important}} tool for understanding the dynamic behaviour of concurrent programs to locate problems and optimize performance. The best way to improve profiling capabilities and reduce the time to analyze a concurrent program {{is to use a}} target-specific <b>profiler</b> that understands the underlying concurrent runtime environment. A <b>profiler</b> for understanding execution of user and kernel level threads is presented, which is target specific for the C++ concurrency system. This allows the insertion of hooks into the C++ data structures and runtime kernel to ensure crucial operations are monitored exactly. Because the <b>profiler</b> is written in C++ and has an extendible design, it is easy for users to write new metrics and incorporate them into the <b>profiler...</b>|$|R

500|$|Since then, the National Science Foundation {{has decided}} to {{establish}} a helicopter camp for the scientists to safely study the ice-ocean interaction. During the 2010–11 summer field season in Antarctica, it is planned that tractors and sleds will haul all of the equipment needed to establish a camp near the ice shelf. A tractor train traverse of about [...] is needed to deliver the materials. The plan over the following two field seasons, 2011–12 and 2012–13, is for scientists to use helicopters to fly to sites on the ice shelf, where they will deploy specially designed <b>profilers</b> down through the ice shelf to measure various ocean properties.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (C) used drift bottles from 1846 to 1966. More recently, {{technologies}} involving satellite tags, fixed current <b>profilers</b> {{and satellite}} communication have permitted more efficient analysis of ocean currents: {{at any given}} time, thousands of modern [...] "drifters" [...] transmit current position, temperature, velocity, etc., to satellites, thus avoiding conventional drift bottles' dependence on serendipitous finds and cooperation by conscientious citizens. Some agencies continue to use drift bottles into the 21st century, but with increased awareness that man-made floating items can harm marine life or constitute waste material, biodegradable drift cards and biodegradable wooden drifters are gaining favor.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that psychopathy is associated with [...] "instrumental", also known as predatory, proactive, or [...] "cold blooded" [...] aggression, a form of aggression characterized by reduced emotion and conducted with a goal differing from but facilitated by the commission of harm. One conclusion in this regard was made by a 2002 study of homicide offenders, which reported that the homicides committed by homicidal offenders with psychopathy were almost always (93.3%) primarily instrumental, significantly more than the proportion (48.4%) of those committed by non-psychopathic homicidal offenders, with the instrumentality of the homicide also correlated with the total PCL-R score of the offender as well as their scores on the Factor 1 [...] "interpersonal-affective" [...] dimension. However, contrary to the equating of this to mean exclusively [...] "in cold blood", {{more than a third of}} the homicides committed by psychopathic offenders involved some component of emotional reactivity as well. In any case, FBI <b>profilers</b> indicate that serious victim injury is generally an emotional offense, and some research supports this, at least with regard to sexual offending. One study has found more serious offending by non-psychopathic offenders on average than by offenders with psychopathy (e.g. more homicides versus more armed robbery and property offenses) and another that the Affective facet of the PCL-R predicted reduced offense seriousness.|$|E

40|$|A new S-band {{vertical}} <b>profiler</b> with a coupler {{option for}} extending the dynamic {{range of the}} radar’s receiver is discussed. The added dynamic range allows the <b>profiler</b> to record radar reflectivity measurements in moderate to heavy precipitation that otherwise {{would not have been}} possible with this system because of receiver saturation. The radar hardware, signal processor, and operating software are based on existing S-band and UHF <b>profiler</b> technology. Results from a side-by-side comparison with a calibrated Ka-band radar are used to determine the calibration and sensitivity of the S-band <b>profiler.</b> In a typical cloud profiling mode of operation, the sensitivity is 214 dBZ at 10 km.
