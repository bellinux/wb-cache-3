5|$|Also {{starting}} in September 1906 was {{the publication of}} the revival's own newsletter, the Apostolic Faith. Issues were published occasionally up until May 1908, mostly through the work of Seymour and a white woman named Clara Lum, a member of the Apostolic Faith Mission. The Apostolic Faith was distributed without charge, and thousands of laypersons and ministers received copies worldwide. Five thousand copies of the first edition were printed, and by 1907 the <b>press</b> <b>run</b> reached over 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite the denunciations {{from the}} anarchist {{organizations}} and periodicals around the world, opinion {{began to change}} in 1976, when Sam Dolgoff published his book The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective. As well, in 1979, the MLCE began publishing a new magazine titled Guángara Libertaria, reprinting Alfredo Gómez' article The Cuban Anarchists, or the Bad Conscience of Anarchism. In 1980, the MLCE and Guángara Libertaria supported the mass evacuation of Cubans from Cuba after many Cuban dissidents occupied the Peruvian embassy in Havana. Many of those who left Cuba at this time joined the editorial collective of Guángara. By 1985, the collective had correspondents around the world, including Mexico, Hawaii, Spain, and Venezuela. The magazine reached a <b>press</b> <b>run</b> of 5000 copies in 1987, making it the largest circulation anarchist periodical in the U.S. However, in 1992, the collective ceased publication of GL, though many of its members continued to publish writings. By 2008, the MLCE was structured as an affinity group and coordinating network for Cuban anarchists of diverse tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early <b>press</b> <b>run</b> and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital presses, it became {{practical}} in the 1990s to print full-color menus affordably in short <b>press</b> <b>runs,</b> sometimes as few as 25 menus. Because of limits on sheet size, larger laminated menus were impractical for single-location independent re to produce <b>press</b> <b>runs</b> of as few as 300 menus, but some restaurants may want to place far fewer menus into service. Some menu printers continue to use shells. The disadvantage for the restaurant {{is that it is}} unable to update anything but prices without creating a new shell.|$|R
5000|$|It {{appeared}} that the local media influenced the investigators. On July 21, 1954, the Cleveland <b>Press</b> <b>ran</b> a front-page editorial titled [...] "Do It Now, Dr. Gerber" [...] which called for a public inquest. Hours later, Dr. Samuel Gerber, the coroner investigating the murder, {{announced that he would}} hold an inquest the next day. The Cleveland <b>Press</b> <b>ran</b> another front-page editorial titled [...] "Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?" [...] on July 30 which was titled in later editions, [...] "Quit Stalling and Bring Him In!". That night, Sheppard was arrested for a police interrogation.|$|R

25|$|Nők Világa (Women's World) (September 1934 – September 1970) — This Hungarian-language {{communist}} monthly magazine {{first appeared}} as a mimeographed newsletter called Munkásnő (Working Woman), a publication which had a <b>press</b> <b>run</b> {{of only a few}} hundred copies. In September 1934 this publication was rebranded as the monthly newspaper Nők Világa, published in New York City. All editors of the publication were Hungarian-American Communist women.|$|E
25|$|White riots {{against blacks}} took place again in Cincinnati in 1836 and 1842. In 1836, {{a mob of}} 700 pro-slavery men {{attacked}} black neighborhoods, {{as well as a}} <b>press</b> <b>run</b> by James M. Birney, publisher of the anti-slavery weekly The Philanthropist. Tensions increased after congressional passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Act, which required cooperation by citizens in free states and increased penalties for failing to try to recapture escaped slaves.|$|E
25|$|Deșteptarea (The Awakening) (January 1914 – February 1938) — Desteptarea {{began as}} a Detroit weekly issued by the Federation of Romanian Socialists in America and ended up as a {{bankrupt}} Detroit monthly, moving its offices {{along the way to}} Cleveland and Chicago. The paper became the official organ of the Romanian section of the Workers Party of America during the early 1920s and the Romanian section of the International Workers Order in the 1930s. Desteptarea was one of the smallest circulation Communist Party language papers, with a <b>press</b> <b>run</b> of just 500 copies in 1925. Somewhat surprisingly, a complete run of the publication has survived.|$|E

5000|$|Født til å Herske (lit. [...] "Born to rule") is Norwegian solo artist Mortiis's debut album, {{released}} on Malicious Records in 1994. It consists of one long song, {{split into two}} tracks. Due to misprints, several <b>press</b> <b>runs</b> of the CD state different labels.|$|R
25|$|The National Guardian {{launched}} with {{a circulation}} of 5,000 and was initially received very positively, with its <b>press</b> <b>run</b> approaching the 100,000 mark {{by the end of}} the paper's first year. The editors envisioned continued growth and a lowering of the paper's cover price, with a view to establishment of an influential mass weekly with {{a circulation of}} 500,000 or even 1,000,000 copies. With over 1 million voters casting ballots for Henry Wallace in November 1948, such a goal seemed within realization, and the editors tied their hopes to the continued growth and success of the Progressive Party movement. Circulation peaked at 75,000 by 1950.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{was first}} {{published}} in the UK, without the author's notes, in the first issue (October 1922) of The Criterion, a literary magazine started and edited by Eliot. The first appearance of the poem in the US was in the November 1922 issue of The Dial magazine (actually published in late October). In December 1922, the poem was published in the US in book form by Boni and Liveright, the first publication to print the notes. In September 1923, the Hogarth Press, a private <b>press</b> <b>run</b> by Eliot's friends Leonard and Virginia Woolf, published the first UK book edition of The Waste Land in an edition of about 450 copies, the type handset by Virginia Woolf.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers often refine {{distribution}} of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change {{to reflect the}} location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, {{but there will be}} different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next <b>press</b> <b>run,</b> these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising rate card provides a good example of editioning.|$|E

500|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} in 1955, {{and has been}} given annually since except for in 1958. A [...] "fanzine" [...] is defined for the award as a magazine that {{does not meet the}} Hugo award's criteria for a professional or semi-professional magazine. Specifically, it must meet less than two of the five Hugo criteria for consideration as a semiprozine: that the magazine had an average <b>press</b> <b>run</b> of at least one thousand copies per issue, paid its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication, provided at least half the income of any one person, had at least fifteen percent of its total space occupied by advertising, and announced itself to be a semiprozine. This is the oldest long-running Hugo award for fan activity; in 1967 Hugo Awards were added specifically for fan writing and fan art. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or [...] "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fanzine category has been included each year.|$|E
