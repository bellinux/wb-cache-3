25|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} in 1982, he {{significantly}} reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created <b>Performance</b> <b>Standard</b> Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E
25|$|Other enthusiasts {{oppose the}} use of Border Collies as show dogs, for fear that {{breeding}} for appearance {{will lead to a}} decline in the breed's working dog traits. Few handlers of working Border Collies participate in conformation shows, as working dogs are bred to a <b>performance</b> <b>standard</b> rather than appearance standard. Likewise, conformation-bred dogs are seldom seen on the sheepdog trial field, except in Kennel Club-sponsored events. Dogs registered with either working or conformation based registries are seen in other performance events such as agility, obedience, tracking or flyball; however, these dogs do not necessarily conform to the breed standard of appearance as closely as the dogs shown in the breed rings as this is not a requirement in performance events, nor do they necessarily participate in herding activities.|$|E
25|$|President Klaus Iohannis is a {{supporter}} of the fight against corruption in Romania. Since coming to power in November 2014, has sent several messages of support to prosecutors investigating sensitive cases against politicians accused of corruption. Making one of its important position was in February 25, 2016 {{at the annual meeting of}} the National Anticorruption Directorate: “From year to year the work of the National Anticorruption Directorate has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and recovery of property from crime. You are a model of functional institution and created a <b>performance</b> <b>standard.</b> Through the work and achievements, you've earned the appreciation of the Romanian citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. The results obtained by you in fighting corruption, appreciated and beyond Romania's borders are a guarantee that the process of strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Romania are on track. I am convinced that we will be increasingly more powerful in applying the constitutional principle that nobody is above the law and to align our established practice in countries with democracies that put the citizen at the center of any policy”, stated Klaus Iohannis.|$|E

One issue addressed in the 1985 Illinois educational reform legislation was the improvement of instruction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine to what extent <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> included in the evaluation plans in selected Illinois elementary- and high-school districts stressed instruction. The study also observed differences in <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> between elementary- and high-school districts. Evaluation plans were also to include the definitions of summative ratings. This study also examined the definitions of the ratings with observed differences in ratings between elementary- and high-school districts. The <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> included in the study were investigated through the technique of content analysis. The content of the <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> in each of the selected evaluation instruments was analyzed to determine categorization as either instructional or noninstructional. Numbers of instructional and noninstructional <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> were utilized to determine the focus of each instrument. Summative ratings were analyzed using a research protocol. The protocol was utilized to determine the type of rating system as well as identifying key words in the definition for each of the selected instruments. The protocol was also used to compare definitions between elementary- and high-school districts. The findings demonstrated that evaluation instruments in the selected school districts contained more noninstructional than instructional <b>performance</b> <b>standards.</b> However, in comparison of elementary- and high-school districts, the study found that high-school evaluation instruments contained more instructional <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> than did elementary. Other conclusions from the study were (a) the same wording of <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> and summative rating definitions were found among the instruments; (b) there were some common areas contained within the standards; (c) <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> categorized as instructional focused on areas including objectives/curriculum, instruction, planning, and assessment; (d) <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> categorized as noninstructional focused on competency in subject matter, classroom management, and professional development; (e) <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> were written so that they could be used in either elementary- or high-school districts; (f) there was a lack in variation in the definition of the summative ratings among all selected school districts; and (g) most districts utilized a nonnumeric measure to determine the summative rating...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LLM (Environmental Law and Governance)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The {{research}} investigates {{whether the}} environmental <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> prescribed by international financial lending institutions {{have the potential}} to regulate within the South African legislative framework. In assessing this, the environmental <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> of three specific financial lending institutions, namely, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa are analysed. In addition, the extent to which South African framework legislation accommodates the use of the environmental <b>performance</b> <b>standards</b> is looked at with specific focus on the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA) and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution).

2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor of}} the Mistral-C Club Class glider was the Strauber Mistral high <b>performance</b> <b>Standard</b> Class aircraft designed by Manfred Strauber, Alois Fries, Hartmut Frommhold and Horst Gaber. [...] Design works began in January 1970 and the Mistral {{made its first}} flight in July 1975. [...] It {{was not intended to}} be serially produced. It was a 15.00m (49ft2.5in) span shoulder wing monoplane with a T-tail which made much use of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) in its structure. [...] The wings had an area of 9.40m² (101.2sqft), an aspect ratio of 23.9 and sweepback at one quarter chord of 0.4°. The dihedral was also 0.4°. The airfoil sections used were Wortmann FX-66-S-196 at the root and FX-66-S-161 at the tips. [...] The wings were constructed from GRP/balsa sandwich with ailerons of GRP and rigid, closed cell, polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam. [...] Aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extended from the upper wing surface only. The tail unit, with an all-moving tailplane, was also formed from PMI filled GRP. The fuselage of the Mistral was a pod and boom monocoque made from GRP/balsa sandwich, with the single seat cockpit under a single piece, framed canopy. [...] Its main, single landing wheel was manually retractable and assisted by a tailskid. The Mistral had a best glide angle of 39:1 and a minimum sink speed of 0.6m/s (118ft/mim).|$|E
