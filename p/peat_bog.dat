The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Bury passes through the city; a hoard of over 550bronze Roman coins dating between 259AD and 278AD was discovered in Boothstown; and a Romano-British bog body, Worsley Man, was discovered in the Chat Moss <b>peat</b> <b>bog.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lindow Moss is a <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> in Lindow, {{an area of}} Wilmslow, Cheshire, {{which has}} been used as common land since the medieval period. It formed after the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in {{north-east}} Cheshire and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice. Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity around the edge of Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity. Once covering over , the bog has now shrunk to a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised. Lindow Moss is a lowland raised mire; this type of <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> often produces the best preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27bodies to be recovered from such areas.|$|E
5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a <b>peat</b> <b>bog.</b>|$|E

The Serra do Espinhaço Meridional (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) - SdEM - a terrestrial biosphere reservation area, contains a considerably large area with different types of <b>peat</b> <b>bogs,</b> which were described in three profiles at 1, 250, 1, 800 and 1, 350 m above sea level and classified, respectively, as Organosol Haplic sapric terric (P 1), Organosol Haplic fibric typical (P 2) and Organosol Haplic Hemic typical (P 4), {{in agreement with the}} Brazilian System of Soil Classification. The three profiles were characterized morphologically and the samples were chemically, physically and microbiologically analyzed. It was found that the location, altitude and drainage influenced the morphologic, physical, chemical, and biological properties of the <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> in SdEM. The decomposition state of organic matter is more advanced when the drainage in the <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> is better. The amount of heavy metals is related with the quantity and granulometric composition of the mineral fraction and location of the <b>peat</b> <b>bogs.</b> The highest mean levels of Ti, Zr, Pb were detected in profile P 1, highest mean levels of Mn, Zn and Cu in P 2, and the highest mean Fe content in P 4.

5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the <b>peat</b> <b>bog.</b>|$|E
