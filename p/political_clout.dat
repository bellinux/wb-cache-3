5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great <b>political</b> <b>clout,</b> such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} did not fare as {{well under}} Carroll. He cut the proposed {{budget for the}} state's Council on Higher Education by 40 percent. Because of the considerable <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> of the Golden Triangle (Lexington, Louisville and Covington), the University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, and Northern Kentucky University were spared the more severe budget cuts imposed on the state's regional universities.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, borscht's {{popularity}} spread beyond its Slavic homeland, largely due to such factors as territorial expansion of the Russian Empire, Russia's growing <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> and cultural stature, and waves of emigration out of the country. As Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia, borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories both within and adjacent to the empire, from Finland to the Caucasus and Iran, to Central Asia and China, to Alaska (Russian America).|$|E

Whenever policy changes were announced, if {{he played a}} role in lobbying for those changes, he would keep quiet about his involvement. Xun Liang (荀良), one of his younger relatives, advised him to let others know the good deeds he did so that he would gain greater respect. Wu Tong (武統), his son-in-law, also urged him to attract people to support him. However, Xun Xu refused to listen to them and he warned his sons against forming their own <b>political</b> <b>clouts</b> and forgetting their place as subjects of the emperor. Later, Emperor Wu promoted Xun Xu to be the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令).|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{offers a}} set of {{theoretical}} reflections on postmodern and postcolonial territorial restructuring. It is mainly based on fifteen years of scientific research on the demarcation processes at local and provincial levels in African contexts (South Africa, Morocco and Niger) and at intermunicipal level in France. A broad international bibliography {{on the issues of}} demarcation and territorial engineering is also used. Chapters deal with specific entries: the arguments on the choice of new provincial capital cities and county-towns; territorial solutions and innovations introduced in borderlands institutional and local government design; the evolution of the optimal territorial pattern in the public policies of spatial planning and devolution. Lastly some laws and trends arising from this work are applies to territorial restructuring beyond local and national <b>political</b> <b>clouts...</b>|$|R

5|$|Construction of the Westside MAX {{project began}} in 1993. In November 1996, Hillsboro and TriMet named the yet-to-be-completed {{station at the}} western end of the project as the Mark O. Hatfield Government Center Station. Hatfield was {{retiring}} from 30 years as U.S. Senator and previously used his <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure funding for the project. In June 1998, after completion of the station but prior to its opening, government officials held a dedication ceremony at the station. Retired U. S. Senator Mark Hatfield was in attendance as the station was officially dedicated in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{left his}} mark on Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} racing {{as a world}} championship winning rider, an advocate for increased safety standards in racing, and as a racing team owner and a motorcycle engine and chassis constructor. His dirt track-based riding style changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. Roberts' proposal to create a rival motorcycle championship in 1979 broke the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) hegemony and increased the <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> of Grand Prix racers, which subsequently led to improved safety standards and {{a new era of}} professionalism in the sport. In 2000, Roberts was named a Grand Prix Legend by the FIM.|$|E
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> of the gay community.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 UNESCO report {{showed that}} {{cultural}} exchange {{is becoming more}} frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the European Union's shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high <b>political</b> American <b>clout</b> and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 12th-century {{ascendancy}} of the Hoysalas, {{the kings of}} the dynasty entertained imperial ambitions. King Vishnuvardhana wanted to perform Vedic sacrifices befitting an emperor, and surpass his overlords, the Western Chalukyas, in military and architectural achievements. This led to his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. Around the same time, the well-known philosopher Ramanujacharya sought refuge from the Cholas in Hoysala territory and popularised the Sri Vaishnava faith, a sect of Hindu Vaishnavism. Although Jains continued to dominate culturally {{in what is now}} the southern Karnataka region for a while, these social changes would later contribute to the decline of Jain literary output. The growing <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> of the Hoysalas attracted many bards and scholars to their court, who in turn wrote panegyrics on their patrons.|$|E
5|$|However, {{given the}} length of time the abuse has been going on, Connie is afraid no one will believe her. The {{assistant}} district attorney assigned to the case, Rhonda Preshutski (Christine Dunford) agrees, believing the case to be weak. Child Protective Services cannot remove Sara from the household until Connie undergoes a psychiatric evaluation, although Black and police lieutenant Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) investigate the Bangs home to check up on the girl. The father, Joe Bangs (Paul Dooley), chases them off as his wife watches detachedly. Bangs wields a degree of <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> in the community, and pressures the district attorney's office to drop the case. Preshutski is furious with Black over the matter, until it is discovered from Connie's medical exams that Sara is not her sister, but her daughter.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. She changed {{the style of the}} government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, and increased the <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

5|$|Model's {{first order}} was that Falaise be defended, {{which did not}} impress his staff. However, he quickly changed his mind, convincing Hitler to authorize the {{immediate}} escape of the German Seventh Army and Panzer Group Eberbach—something that Kluge, with his limited <b>political</b> <b>clout,</b> {{had not been able}} to do. He was thus able to rescue a high proportion of the units involved, albeit at the cost of nearly all their armour and heavy materiel. When Hitler demanded that Paris be held, Model replied that he could do so, but only if given an extra 200,000 men and several panzer divisions—an act that has been described as naïveté by some, and canny bargaining by others. The reinforcements were not forthcoming, and the city's liberation took place on 25 August. Meanwhile, Model fell back to the German border.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly {{and that the only}} two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their <b>political</b> <b>clout</b> has also been reduced.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} two co-prime ministers, Ranariddh and Hun Sen, {{deteriorated}} from March 1996, when the former accused the CPP of repeatedly delaying the allocation process of low-level government posts to FUNCINPECs. Ranariddh threatened {{to pull out of}} the coalition government and hold national elections in the same year if his demands were not met, stoking unease among Hun Sen and other CPP officials. The following month, Sihanouk presided over a meeting between several royal family members and senior FUNCINPEC officials in Paris. Sihanouk attempted to reduce tensions between FUNCINPEC and the CPP by assuring that FUNCINPEC would not leave the coalition government and that there were no reactionary elements planning to bring down Hun Sen or the CPP. In March 1997 Sihanouk expressed his willingness to abdicate the throne, claiming that rising anti-royalist sentiment among the populace was threatening the monarchy's existence. In response, Hun Sen tersely warned Sihanouk that he would introduce constitutional amendments to prohibit members of the royal family from participating in politics if he followed through on his suggestion. As Widyono saw it, Sihanouk remained popular with the Cambodian electorate, and Hun Sen feared that, should he abdicate and enter politics, he would win in any future elections, thereby undercutting CPP's <b>political</b> <b>clout.</b>|$|E
