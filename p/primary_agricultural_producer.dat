40|$|Agricultural {{sector is}} {{perceived}} to have more difficult access to finance than other sectors of the economy. We test and confirm this hypothesis for EU transition economies, using a unique firm-level panel data of 700 bank loans given to agricultural and non-agricultural SMEs in Slovakia between 2000 and 2005. Probit estimation results suggest that on average the <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> and food processing SMEs do not exhibit higher default rate than other sectors’ SMEs. However, highly indebted agricultural and food SMEs {{are more likely to}} default than their counterparts in other sectors. Controlling for firm heterogeneity we find that firms in agriculture and food processing are more credit constrained due to higher risk present in this sector. By contrast, we provide some evidence that the EU accession decreased default rates for <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers,</b> especially for low indebted agricultural SMEs. JRC. DDG.

40|$|In {{most of the}} {{developing}} countries, small scale farmers (SSFs) are usually the <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> of staple crop. Furthermore, they highly depend on rainfall for their rain-fed agricultural production. SSFs have limited capacity to adapt to extreme climate variability, thus rendering them {{to be among the}} most vulnerable to climate change. Some recent studies show that agricultural production and productivity is being negatively impacted by climate change and variability in most parts of Southern Africa. This is likely to continue for decades into the future, unless corrective or adaptation measures are implemented to reduce the impact on agriculture. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is one of the climate change and weather variability adaptation measures being promoted for SSFs in Kalomo District of Zambia. CA is not only being promoted to improve production and productivity for food security for the majority rural population, but also as an adaptation measure for sustainable agricultural production. The present study analysed the CA practices being promoted in Kalomo district of southern Zambia and the associated challenges in the management and implementation, as well as, how best these challenges can be addressed. Semi-structured interviews and literature review were used as methodologies of data collection for the study. The findings of the study indicate that among the three principles of CA, minimum tillage is mostly practiced compared to crop rotation and retention of crop residue. Within minimum tillage, ripping was found to be practiced on a larger scale compared to making basins. The major challenges include planning and human resource development, financial resource and policy constraints and cultural barriers to adoption of CA...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} estimation and {{the interpretation}} of its behavior are of extreme interest for primary producer in agriculture {{as well as for}} policy makers. In Kosovo one of the main objectives of Agriculture and Rural Development Plan 2007 - 2013 and 2014 - 2020 is to improve competitiveness and the efficiency of <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> and to attain sustainable land use. Regardless of this, {{there was a lack of}} studies on farm efficiency estimation and the productivity changes of the agriculture sector in Kosovo. Therefore, the conducted study of this thesis focuses on estimation and the analysis of efficiency at farm level. More specifically, the study aimed estimation of technical, economic, and environmental efficiency of the farms oriented on tomato, grape and apple production. In addition, identification of the factors that extensively explain the variation of the efficiency scores among farms was sought. The study was based entirely on primary data, collected in three different stages. In the first stage, a survey using structured questionnaire was conducted with 120 farms which were distributed equally for each selected production system in the study. Farm efficiency scores were obtained using a Data Envelopment Analysis, which is a linear programming optimization technique that measures relative efficiency of a set of comparable units. In general, the efficiency scores for three different production systems were high, showing that there was little space for efficiency improvement. On average, tomato farms tend to be more technical efficient, followed by scale, revenue, and cost allocative efficiency. Farmers oriented in grape production were very scale efficient, followed by technical, revenue and cost allocative efficiency. Apple farms on average were performing relatively well in terms of technical efficiency which was the highest on average, followed by revenue efficiency and scale efficiency. Factors which were proved to be statistically important in explaining the variation of the efficiency scores among the farms were household size, farm size and number of cultivated crops, number of land plots, farmer´s education and experience in farming. In terms of the position in ranking between technical and environmental efficiency estimation, three different groups of farms were found. The group of farms which showed increase in ranking at environmental efficiency when compared to the technical one. Farms with no difference in ranking, and a group of farms showing a decrease in ranking at environmental efficiency compared to the technical efficiency. Farms which displayed an increase in ranking were mostly farms that improved or maintained good quality of soil at farm land and good level of agro-biodiversity provision. The second group of farms showed no difference in ranking, as they were fully efficient in technical and environmental efficiency estimation. The third group of farms which showed a decrease in ranking were those farms performing weakly in both technical and environmental efficiency. This group of farms were also having lower soil quality at farm land and lower agro-biodiversity when compared to the averages of total sample...|$|R

40|$|This paper assesses how {{successfully}} {{reducing the}} incidence of overweight and obesity in the US to meet public health objectives might influence agricultural production. We also examine the consequent agri-environmental effects of the production changes. Our estimates show that a reduction in aggregate consumption by between 2 and 6 percent, associated with public health goals being met, would lead to reduced production of <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> commodities, increased exports, and reduced discharge of agricultural pollutants. In both cases, neither the estimated changes in commodity production nor the subsequent environmental impacts would be uniform across the landscape. Results indicate that in value terms, the largest changes (either positive or negative) in <b>agricultural</b> <b>producer</b> net returns would occur in the Corn Belt and the Lake States; conversely, the largest impacts on consumer surplus would occur in the Northeast and Pacific regions.

Further development of this kind of economic partnership among <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> in the Czech Republic is eligible for support via public subsidies, namely by Common Agricultural Policy. Nevertheless many <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> are still facing tougher foreign direct competitors after EU accession as single economic units instead of establishing new or joining existing producer groups, namely in production of fruit and vegetables.

This paper examines issues related to the acquisition of capital by niche <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers.</b> Niche <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> face greater capital acquisition challenges than traditional small firms because their business models are not well understood and, thus, often considered high risk. Few studies have examined the capital acquisition of niche <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> despite the importance of the overall agricultural industry and niche producers. The findings show firms that are more familiar with sources of capital are more likely to acquire capital.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects that}} a cutback in production by Texas <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> {{would have on the}} economic well-being of all producers and consumers in the state's economy. To do this, a quadratic input-output model incorporating econometric estimates of final demand was developed for the Texas economy. The output of the agricultural production sectors was constrained to reflect the cutback in production. The results show that <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> would be economically worse off than before only if the <b>producers</b> of raw <b>agricultural</b> products in Texas imported their input needs from other geographical areas. In 1977 - 78, some <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> were making strong statements about what actions they would take if legislation were not enacted to guarantee farm prices at 100 percent of parity. These actions ranged from sending tractorcades to Washington, to cut-ting back production in an effort to dramatize the importance of a viable agriculture {{to the rest of the}} economy. Some of these actions, like the tractorcade, were carried out while others, such as cutting back agricultural production, never materialized at the nation-al level. The regional differences noted in producer attitudes toward cutting back pro-duction were no doubt influenced by whether their costs of production were above or below the U. S. average costs of production used in determining deficiency payments to <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers.</b> While talk of cutbacks in production by <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> has subsided since th...|$|R
