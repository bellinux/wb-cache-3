40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pressure}} in out-of-hours primary care is high {{due to an}} increasing demand for care and rising health-care costs. During the daytime, substituting general practitioners (GPs) with nurse practitioners (NPs) shows positive results to contribute to these challenges. However, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge about the impact during out-of-hours. The current study aims to provide an insight into the impact of substitution on resource use, production and direct health-care costs during out-of-hours. METHODS: At a general practitioner cooperative (GPC) in the south-east of the Netherlands, experimental teams with four GPs and one NP were compared with control teams with five GPs. In a secondary analysis, GP care versus NP care was also examined. During a 15 -month period all patients visiting the GPC on weekend days were included. The primary outcome was resource use including X-rays, drug prescriptions and referrals to the Emergency Department (ED). We used logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Secondary outcomes were <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> and direct health-care costs using a cost-minimization analysis. RESULTS: We analysed 6, 040 patients in the experimental team (NPs: 987, GPs: 5, 053) and 6, 052 patients in the control team. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the teams. In the secondary analysis, in the experimental team NP care was associated with fewer drug prescriptions (NPs 37. 1 %, GPs 43 %, p <. 001) and fewer referrals to the ED (NPs 5. 1 %, GPs 11. 3 %, p =. 001) than GP care. The mean <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> was 3. 0 consultations for GPs and 2. 4 consultations for NPs (p <. 001). The cost of a consultation with an NP was euro 3. 34 less than a consultation with a GP (p =. 02). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated no overall differences between the teams. Nonetheless, a comparison of type of provider showed that NP care resulted in lower resource use and cost savings than GP care. To find the optimal balance between GPs and NPs in out-of-hours primary care, more research is needed on the impact of increasing the ratio of NPs in a team with GPs on resource use and health-care costs.

30|$|The {{so-called}} Growth Report, {{which was}} written {{as a basis for}} federal growth policy in the past decade, in my view is a good example in Swiss economic policy of the added value, a (permitted) simplification can provide. 5 A glance at the literature shows that growth theory is an exceptionally technical area of economics. And even the use of its most basic models for the explanation of growth policy would not have been digestible for non-specialists. But it is easy to understand that growth can only come from two sources, namely additional hours worked, on the one hand, and additional <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> worked (= labour productivity), on the other hand. From this simple insight, the decisive conclusion can be drawn that Switzerland—contrary to most EU countries—has already strongly exploited its labour potential and, therefore, additional sustainable growth has to be achieved by increasing productivity. This simple idea was the story the whole growth report was subsequently based on and it proved to be an easily communicable concept in debates with policymakers.|$|E

30|$|Technical {{electricity}} generation assessment and economic analysis of six wind energy conversion {{systems in the}} categories small, medium, and large (with power ratings of 20, 35, 275, 500, 1, 000, and 2, 000 kW) were examined in this study. Electricity cost values were estimated based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and present value cost (PVC) methods for six locations selected across all the geopolitical zones of Nigeria. This was done using wind speed data that span between 25 and 37 years, measured {{at the height of}} 10 m. The result showed that the annual average energy output ranges from 2.242 MW h in Uyo with P 10 - 20 turbine to 12, 521.55 MW h in Kano using Vestas V 80 - 2 MW wind turbine. Furthermore, of all the selected sites, Kano gave the least costs of electricity <b>production</b> <b>per</b> kilowatt <b>hour</b> with Vestas V 80 - 2 MW model at 67 -m hub heights, while the highest is obtained in Uyo with GEV-HP (1 MW) model at 70 -m hub heights for the LCOE and PVC height for both the LCOE and PVC methods. In addition, sensitivity of the selected parameters to the levelized cost of electricity was also carried out.|$|R
40|$|Thinning is {{performed}} today with essentially two thinning methods, with strip-roads or stand-thinning machines. The result after thinning affects the stands future development. In this study, the two thinning methods was compared {{with regard to}} distribution of basal area, resulting damage, the distribution of stems, actual thinning intensity and the impact that these differences may provide in the future. The survey was conducted in Sundsvall, Sweden in two different stands where basal area- surfaces, number of stems, damage and thinning strength was measured. The result shows that stand-thinning machines produce less damage to the stems and a more even distribution of the basal area. The strip-road method carried out a thinning of excessive thinning intensity of 50 % compared to 30 % for stand-thinning method. From a quality point of view the stand-thinning machines performed a better result. These machines have a lower <b>production</b> (harvested volume <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> which probably results in lower financial gains in thinnings.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Abdominal {{surgery is}} a major {{oxidative}} stress effector. The increase in oxidative stress has been related to postoperative complications. Oxidative stress leads to the formation and accumulation of oxidation protein end products, which exhibit autofluorescence (AF) and induce inflammatory reactions. METHODS: Skin AF was assessed perioperatively in 40 consecutive colorectal surgery patients until discharge. Duration of surgery, estimated blood loss, and urinary <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> were analyzed as measures of surgical stress. The clinical occurrence of anastomotic leakage, systemic infections, and cardiopulmonary complications within 30 days of surgery were analyzed. RESULTS: A perioperative increase in skin AF of 19 +/-. 2 % was observed. Duration of operation and blood loss were independently associated with the perioperative increase in skin AF. Skin AF correlated with C-reactive protein levels postoperatively. American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, duration of operation, and preoperative and perioperative increases in AF were independently associated with postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate an association between skin AF and surgical stress and outcomes, which may rate the condition of a patient after operation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the capacity of being intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, the Ugandan F 1 generation of Biomphalaria snail species that were laboratory-bred from parent populations originally collected from either Lake Victoria or Lake Albert was challenged with sympatric and non-sympatric S. mansoni isolates. After a prepatent period of 20 days, a daily 10 -hourly snail shedding for cercariae was done to determine the infection rate, cercarial <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> and survival period of infected snails. The study suggests that when parasite strains from a different geographical origin is used for infection, survival of infected snails increase, leading to an increased transmission potential. Although earlier literature had indicated that the Lake Victoria Biomphalaria sudanica is refractory to S. mansoni, we showed that all Ugandan Biomphalaria spp., including B. sudanica from all locations, were highly susceptible to the S. mansoni isolates. Thus if B. choanomphala, which is an efficient intermediate host in Lake Victoria, is {{given an opportunity to}} occupy Lake Albert, it will most likely be compatible with the Albertine S. mansoni parasites. Equally, if B. stanleyi, currently restricted to Lake Albert invades Lake Victoria, it is likely to act as an efficient intermediate host. Future work should concentrate on intraspecific population-level differences in compatibility...|$|E

40|$|Producing {{off-line}} captions for {{the deaf}} and hearing impaired people is a labor-intensive task that can require up to 18 hours of <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> of film. Captions are placed manually close to the region of interest but it must avoid masking human faces, texts or any moving objects that might be relevant to the story flow. Our goal is to use image processing techniques to reduce the off-line caption production process by automatically placing the captions on the proper consecutive frames. We implemented a computer-assisted captioning software tool which integrates detection of faces, texts and visual motion regions. The near frontal faces are detected using a cascade of weak classifier and tracked through a particle filter. Then, frames are scanned to perform text spotting and build a region map suitable for text recognition. Finally, motion mapping {{is based on the}} Lukas-Kanade optical flow algorithm and provides MPEG- 7 motion descriptors. The combined detected items are then fed to a rule-based algorithm to determine the best captions localization for the related sequences of frames. This paper focuses on the defined rules to assist the human captioners and the results of a user evaluation for this approach.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different reaction {{conditions on the}} catalytic activity of vanadium-aluminium oxynitride "VAlON" in propane ammoxidation is investigated. This new catalytic material exhibits amorphous character, high specific surface area, basic-redox properties and remarkable acrylonitrile <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> and amount of catalyst. Optimal performance is achieved when the reaction temperature is 500 degreesC and the molar ratio of propane, oxygen, and ammonia in the gas feed is 1. 25 : 3 : 1. Under these optimal reaction conditions, the catalyst showed a propane conversion level of 60 %, an acrylonitrile selectivity of 56 %, and an acrylonitrile productivity of 8121 /kg h. The formation of a propylene intermediate compound as well as hydrogen cyanide was detected only for those reaction conditions where the NH 3 :C 3 H 8 ratio was lower than 1. This suggests differences in the reaction mechanism with respect to conventional V-Me-oxide propane ammoxidation catalysts. In propane ammoxidation over VAlON catalysts, ammonia seems to play a double role: (i) as a reagent necessary for the thermal nitridation and generation of nitrogen species, (ii) participating in N-insertion step for the acrylonitrile formation from propane. The catalytic performances depend on the generation of nitrogen species {{as a function of}} the reaction conditions, which determine the level of propane conversion and selectivity to the reaction products.
