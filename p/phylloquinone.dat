40|$|ABSTRACT: Electron {{transfer}} within PS I reaction centers {{has been}} analyzed in vivo in a mutant of Chlorella sorokiniana which lacks {{most of the}} PS II and of the peripheric antennae, using a new spectrophotometric technique with a time resolution of 5 ns. Absorption changes associated with the oxidation of semiphylloquinone (acceptor A 1 -) have been characterized in the 371 - 545 nm spectral range. The oxidation of A 1 - and the reduction of an iron-sulfur cluster (FX, FAFB) is monitored by an absorption decrease at 377 nm (semiphylloquinone absorption band) and by the decrease of two positive absorption bands around 480 and 515 nm, respectively, very likely associated with a local electrochromic shift induced by A 1 - on a carotenoid molecule localized in its vicinity. A 1 - undergoes a two-phase oxidation of about equal amplitude with half-times of 18 and 160 ns, respectively. Two hypotheses are proposed to interpret these data: (1) Photosystem I reaction centers are present under two conformational states which differ by the reoxidation rate of A 1 -. (2) The two <b>phylloquinones</b> corresponding to the two branches of the PS I heterodimer {{are involved in the}} electron transfer. The similar amplitude of the two phases implies that the rates of electron transfer from P 700 to each of the <b>phylloquinones</b> are about equal.

40|$|AbstractMolecular {{dynamics}} (MD) calculations, a semi-continuum (SC) approach, and {{quantum chemistry}} (QC) calculations were employed together {{to investigate the}} molecular mechanics of ultrafast charge separation reactions in Photosystem I (PS I) of Thermosynechococcus elongatus. A molecular model of PS I was developed with the aim to relate the atomic structure with electron transfer events in the two branches of cofactors. A structural flexibility map of PS I was constructed based on MD simulations, which demonstrated its rigid hydrophobic core and more flexible peripheral regions. The MD model permitted the study of atomic movements (dielectric polarization) in response to primary and secondary charge separations, while QC calculations were used to estimate the direct chemical effect of the A 0 A/A 0 B ligands (Met or Asn in the 688 / 668 position) on the redox potential of chlorophylls A 0 A/A 0 B and <b>phylloquinones</b> A 1 A/A 1 B. A combination of MD and SC approaches was used to estimate reorganization energies λ of the primary (λ 1) and secondary (λ 2) charge separation reactions, which {{were found to be}} independent of the active branch of electron transfer; in PS I from the wild type, λ 1 was estimated to be 390 ± 20 mV, while λ 2 was estimated to be higher at 445 ± 15 mV. MD and QC approaches were used to describe the effect of substituting Met 688 PsaA/Met 668 PsaB by Asn 688 PsaA/Asn 668 PsaB on the energetics of electron transfer. Unlike Met, which has limited degrees of freedom in the site, Asn was found to switch between two relatively stable conformations depending on cofactor charge. The introduction of Asn and its conformation flexibility significantly affected the reorganization energy of charge separation and the redox potentials of chlorophylls A 0 A/A 0 B and <b>phylloquinones</b> A 1 A/A 1 B, which may explain the experimentally observed slowdown of secondary electron transfer in the M 688 NPsaA variant.

40|$|Photosystem I, {{one of the}} two light driven {{reaction}} {{centers of}} oxygenic photosynthesis, functions as the light-driven plastocyanin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase in the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. It is a pigment protein complex with 11 [...] 14 proteins and several types of organic (e. g. chlorophyll a) and inorganic energy and electron transfer cofactors (e. g. Fe-S cluster). The objectives of this dissertation are: (i) to demonstrate that the spectroscopic and kinetic properties of photosystem I cofactors are determined by the protein environments, (ii) to determine whether the electron transfer in photosystem I is unidirectional or bidirectional, (iii) to identify which aromatic residues in the helix ten of PsaB are involved in electron transfer from plastocyanin to P 700.;P 700, accessory chlorophyll and A 0 are chemically the same as other chlorophyll a molecules, however they have distinct spectroscopic properties. Similarly, <b>phylloquinones</b> that function as A 1 have far lower redox potentials than the <b>phylloquinones</b> in solution. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis showed that the spectroscopic properties of P 700, accessory chlorophyll, A 0 and A 1 were altered when the proteins were changed by mutations. Therefore, the photosystem I proteins are responsible for the precise arrangement of cofactors and determine their spectroscopic properties. There exist two branches for the electron transfer chains in photosystem I; it is unclear that both function or only one functions. To address this question, equivalent pairs of mutations were generated and characterized. Optical kinetics results indicate that the structural changes in both branches influence electron transfer rates. However, transient electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which cannot detect kinetic events at less than 50 ns time scale could only detect changes when the PsaA protein was altered. These results revealed the functional importance of two branches of electron transfer. The helix ten of PsaB subunit contains several aromatic residues in the region between P 700 and the luminal side of thylakoid membrane. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of these residues indicated that many of these residues are critical in structural integrity of photosystem I and a phenylalanyl residue at position 647 could be involved in electron transfer from plastocyanin to P 700...|$|R
30|$|The {{branched}} isoprenoid pathway {{is rather}} complex and comprises enzymatic steps {{in at least}} two compartments. In plants, Phy represents the side chain of Chls, tocopherols (TP) and <b>phylloquinones,</b> and is necessary for their integration into plastidmembranes (Soll et al. 19801983;Soll 1987;Bollivar et al. 1994). In both Chl and TP synthesis, the Phy chain is provided by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a plastidial isoprenoid, formed by four molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which are derived from the cytosolic and chloroplastidic pathways (Rohmer et al. 1993;Lichtentaler et al. 1997). In Chl synthesis, GGPP can either be reduced to phytyl pyrophosphate (PhyPP) and esterified with Chlide to generate phytyl Chl (ChlPhy), or first esterified with Chlide to form geranylgeranylated Chl (ChlGG) and then stepwise reduced into ChlPhy (Soll et al. 1983;Bollivar et al. 1994;Keller et al. 1998;Chew et al. 2008). In the TP pathway, tocopherols are generally believed to arise from the condensation of homogentisic acid and PhyPP (Schultz et al. 1985;Soll et al. 1980;Collakova and DellaPenna 2001;Savidge et al. 2002;Cahoon et al. 2003).

Chl fluorescence emission measured with isolated PSI submembrane fractions was reduced following {{the addition of}} exogenous quinones. This quenching progressively increased with rising concentrations of the exogenous quinones according to the Stern–Volmer law. The values of Stern–Volmer quenching coefficients {{were found to be}} 3. 28 × 105 M− 1 (DBMIB), 1. 31 × 104 M− 1 (DCBQ), and 3. 7 × 103 M− 1 (duroquinone). The relative quenching capacities of the various exogenous quinones in PSI thus strictly coincided to those found for the quenching of Fo level of Chl fluorescence in isolated thylakoids, which is emitted largely by Photosystem II (PSII) [Biochim. Biophys. Acta (2003) 1604, 115 – 123]. Quenching of Chl excited states in PSI submembrane fractions by exogenous quinones slowed down the rate of P 700, primary electron donor of PSI, photooxidation measured at limiting actinic light irradiances thus revealing a reduced photochemical capacity of absorbed quanta.

40|$|Background. Olive (Olea europaea L.) is an emblematic {{species and}} one of the most {{widespread}} fruit tree in the Mediterranean basin. It is a member of the Oleaceae family, which includes 600 species within 25 genera distributed over all continents, from northern temperate to southern subtropical regions and from low to high altitudes. On the basis of several morphological synapomorphies, Oleaceae family is considered as monophyletic and is easily circumscribed. Within the family, phylogenetic relationships among genera have been assessed by a cladistic analysis of chloroplast non-coding DNA sequences. The different members of Oleaceae family are trees, shrubs or woody climbers and among them Olea europaea L. features as an evergreen schlerophyllous tree. Native to the Mediterranean region, olive represents a unique species within the Olea genus that produces edible fruits. There are historical evidences that the utilization of wild olive as fruit tree can be dated to Neolithic period, as early as the 8 th millennium B. C., and that its domestic cultivation was firstly undertaken on Crete island during the Minoan period, between 1500 – 3000 BC. From here, olive plants and their products were exported not only towards mainland Greece, but also to Northern Africa and Asia Minor. Today, olive is one of the most extensively cultivated crop species in the world and about 96 % of olive cultivated area is within the Mediterranean basin (8, 6 million of hectares, over 750 million of trees). Most of olive fruits is destined for oil production. About 73 % of the global oil production comes from European Countries and main producers among them are Spain, Italy and Greece. However, a considerable part of olive fruits is destined for direct human consumption as table olives, whose worldwide production amounts to about 17 million tons. Primarily, the quality of olive products (e. g. table olive and oil) relies on agronomic and organoleptic features of fruits which according to botanical nomenclature are named “drupes”. On the other hand the distinctive features of drupe vary in relation to the genetic traits (cultivar) but also to ripening stage as well as to the environmental growth conditions (i. e. soil and climatic conditions). Note that, these latter potentially include different biotic and abiotic stressful factors that, besides influencing plant productivity, strongly impact on the quality of its product. Commonly, a “good” oil (i. e. obtained from healthy drupes collected at the optimal maturation stage) contains about 98 % of acyl lipids while the remaining 2 % includes several minor component such as polyphenols, esters, terpenes, chrorophyll, tocopherols, <b>phylloquinones,</b> vitamin K and unsaponifiable volatiles. The monounsaturated oleic acid represents the main component of lipidic fraction (up to 80 %). Other major fatty acids are the polyunsaturated linoleic acid (2. 5 – 20 %) and the saturated palmitic acid (10 – 20 %). Certainly, a strong impact on the perception of olive oil quality is played by sensory testing which in turn is tightly related, on one hand to a well-balanced composition of fatty acids and, on the other, to the profile of minor components. Chief among these components are different volatiles responsible for characteristic aroma which make olive products unique among other oils. Moreover, olive oil quality strongly relies on the presence of antioxidant compounds, such as polyphenols and tocopherols, which ensures the stability of fatty acids, acting as an effective scavenging system of reactive oxygen radicals and thus largely reducing lipid peroxidation. Taking into account the above features it is clear that oil extraction process is rather relevant for preserving oil sensory properties and a high oxidative stability during storage. So far, olive oil is the only major dietary oil extracted by pressing rather than by solvent extraction. Therefore, no harsh treatment (high temperature, organic solvents and removal of these by evaporation) is generally applied before olive oil is ready for human consumption. This allows olive oil to maintain the integrity of its minor constituents, such as polyphenols, tocopherols and volatile compounds, which are partly water-soluble and, as above mentioned, play a key role in conferring oxidative stability and sensory properties. It is worth noting that olive oil is a predominant and relevant component of so-called “Mediterranean diet”. To day, a major attention is worldwide paid to this diet as a result of the even increasing evidences of its protective action against cardiovascular diseases and cancer, derived by both fundamental researches and epidemiological studies. Concerning olive oil, healthy property is related to the above mentioned high proportion of monounsaturated fats as well as to the high content of antioxidants (i. e. phenols, tocopherols, <b>phylloquinones,</b> vitamin K) (Green, 2002). Consistently with this role, worldwide consumption of olive oil multiplied 6 -fold over the past 30 years. Despite the relevant properties of olive plant products, breeding strategies for this crop species are still long term due to the long juvenile phase before flowering (20 / 25 years) and the inherent self-incompatibility. Currently, olive germoplasm is under an intensive survey but its characterisation is far from a clear definition, even though it has recently benefited by the availability of genomic polymorphic markers. Very recently, pyrosequencing technology provided large scale information on the structure and putative function of gene transcripts in relation to drupe development. Notwithstanding, the information on the genetic control underlying specific agronomic traits and/or physiological performance of olive plant is still limited. Hence, fundamental and applied research is required to improve olive breeding programs. In particular, a wider characterization of genes related to both the quality of plant products and the adaptive mechanism to abiotic and biotic stresses could provide knowledge and tools for marker aided selection (MAS) and biotechnological approach, as well as for developing appropriate farming techniques leading to enhance productivity and quality of this unique oil tree species.
