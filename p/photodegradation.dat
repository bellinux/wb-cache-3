25|$|Upon {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation in {{the presence}} of oxygen, chloroform slowly converts into phosgene by a radical reaction. To suppress this <b>photodegradation,</b> chloroform is often stored in brown-tinted glass containers. Chlorinated compounds used to remove oil from metals, such as automotive brake cleaners, are converted to phosgene by the UV rays of arc welding processes.|$|E
25|$|TNT is a {{reactive}} molecule and {{is particularly}} prone to react with reduced components of sediments or <b>photodegradation</b> {{in the presence}} of sunlight. TNT is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems. This includes wholly abiotic reactants, like photons, hydrogen sulfide, Fe2+, or microbial communities, both oxic and anoxic.|$|E
25|$|Managed {{burning of}} moorland {{vegetation}} in the UK {{has been shown}} to generate PAH which become incorporated into the peat surface. Burning of moorland vegetation such as heather initially generates high amounts of 2-3 ring PAH relative to 4-6 ringed PAH in surface sediments, however, this pattern is reversed as the lower molecular weight PAH are attenuated by biotic decay and <b>photodegradation.</b> Evaluation of the PAH distributions using statistical methods such as principal component analyses (PCA) enabled the study to link the source (burnt moorland)to pathway (suspended stream sediment) to the depositional sink (reservoir bed).|$|E
2500|$|This pigment is used {{extensively}} in plastics and other applications {{not only as}} a white pigment or an opacifier but also for its UV resistant properties where the powder disperses the light – unlike organic UV absorbers – and reduces UV damage, due mostly to the extremely high refractive index of the particles.], DuPont, pp. 1–2 Certain polymers used in coatings for concrete or those used to impregnate concrete as a reinforcement are sometimes charged with titanium white pigment for UV shielding in the construction industry, but it only delays the oxidative <b>photodegradation</b> of the polymer in question, which is said to [...] "chalk" [...] as it flakes off due to lowered impact strength and may crumble after years of exposure in direct sunlight if UV stabilizers have not been included.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photodegradation</b> is the {{alteration}} of materials by light. Typically, the term {{refers to the}} combined action of sunlight and air. <b>Photodegradation</b> is usually oxidation and hydrolysis. Often <b>photodegradation</b> is avoided, since it destroys paintings and other artifacts. It is however partly responsible for remineralization of biomass and is used intentionally in some disinfection technologies. <b>Photodegradation</b> {{does not apply to}} how materials may be aged or degraded via infrared light or heat, but does include degradation in all of the ultraviolet light wavebands.|$|E
50|$|Benzophenones (BPs) {{are widely}} used in UV filters, {{fragrance}} enhancers,and plastic additives. The major sources of BP-3 are reported to be human recreational activities and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents.The anionic forms of both BP-3 and 4-OH-BP3 can undergo direct <b>photodegradation.</b> The photolytic rates of both compounds in natural waters are faster than those in pure water. Radical scavenging experiments revealed that triplet-excited dissolved organic matter (3DOM*) {{was responsible for the}} indirect <b>photodegradation</b> of BP-3 and 4-OH-BP3 in seawater, whereas in freshwater, the indirect <b>photodegradation</b> of these two compounds was attributed to Dissolved Organic Matter and OH radical.|$|E

50|$|Zhou and Mopper {{showed that}} nitrate {{enhanced}} the <b>photodegradation</b> of PABA by factor of 2. However, {{in the presence}} of free radical scavengers such as carbonate forms and natural organic matter (NOM), the <b>photodegradation</b> of PABA decreased. It was proposed that the indirect photolysis of PABA was mainly due to the NO3 photolysis product •OH.|$|E
50|$|Anatoxin-a is {{unstable}} {{in water}} and other natural conditions, and {{in the presence of}} UV light undergoes <b>photodegradation,</b> being converted to the non-toxic products dihydroanatoxin-a and epoxyanatoxin-a. The <b>photodegradation</b> of anatoxin-a is dependent on pH and sunlight intensity but independent of oxygen, indicating that the degradation by light is not achieved through the process of photo-oxidation.|$|E
50|$|Lacquerware is very {{sensitive}} to exposure to light, which causes <b>photodegradation,</b> fading and discoloration.|$|E

50|$|Bisoctrizole shows {{very little}} <b>photodegradation</b> {{and has a}} {{stabilizing}} effect on other UV absorbers, octyl methoxycinnamate (octinoxate) in particular.|$|E
50|$|Indirect {{catalysts}} {{may also}} act through surface sensitization of reactants, by which species sorbed to a surface become {{more susceptible to}} <b>photodegradation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>photodegradation</b> of {{pesticides}} {{is of great}} interest because of the scale of agriculture and the intensive use of chemicals. Pesticides are however selected in part not to photodegrade readily in sunlight {{in order to allow}} them to exert their biocidal activity. Thus, additional modalities are implemented to enhance their <b>photodegradation,</b> including the use of photosensitizers, photocatalysts (e.g., titanium dioxide), and the addition of reagents such as hydrogen peroxide that would generate hydroxyl radicals that would attack the pesticides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photodegradation</b> and {{biodegradation}} {{are common}} mechanisms of fenthion degradation in the environment. In the atmosphere, vapor phase fenthion reacts rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, and its half-life is about 5 hours. In soil and water, <b>photodegradation</b> is again predominant mechanism {{if there is}} enough presence of sunlight. Under normal aquatic environment, half-life of fenthion in water is 2.9 to 21.1 days. It may be photodynamically, chemically or biologically degraded. The degradation mechanisms can be hydrolysis, oxidation, and/or alkylation-dealkylation, which are dependent {{on the presence of}} light, temperature, alkali, or enzymatic activity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>photodegradation</b> of {{pharmaceuticals}} is {{of interest}} because they are found in many water supplies. They have deleterious effects on aquatic organisms including toxicity, endocrine disruption, genetic damage. But also in the primary packaging material the <b>photodegradation</b> of pharmaceuticals has to be prevented. For this, amber glasses like Fiolax amber and Corning 51-L are commonly used to protect the pharmaceutical from UV radiations. Iodine (in the form of Lugol's solution) and collodial silver are universally used in packaging that lets through very little UV light {{so as to avoid}} degradation.|$|E
5000|$|Uncatalyzed photoreactions: {{photoinduced}} or photoactivated reactions proceed via {{the action}} of light alone. For example, <b>photodegradation</b> of organic compounds often proceeds without a catalyst if the reactants themselves absorb light.|$|E
50|$|PPV is {{also used}} as an {{electron-donating}} material in organic solar cells. Although PPV-based devices suffer from poor absorption and <b>photodegradation,</b> PPV and PPV derivatives (especially MEH-PPV and MDMO-PPV) find frequent application in research cells.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, a {{group at}} Washington state {{university}} observed reversible <b>photodegradation</b> or simply, self healing in organic dyes like Disperse orange 11 when doped in polymers. They used {{amplified spontaneous emission}} as a probe to study self healing properties.|$|E
50|$|In soil, {{fenthion}} degradation {{ranges from}} {{four to six weeks}} and it occurs through <b>photodegradation</b> as well as anaerobic or non-photolytic organisms. However, soil particles strongly adsorb fenthion that makes it less susceptible to percolate with water through the soil.|$|E
50|$|Phthalates {{are easily}} {{released}} into the environment. In general, they do not persist in the outdoor environment due to biodegradation, <b>photodegradation,</b> and anaerobic degradation. Outdoor air concentrations are higher in urban and suburban areas than in rural and remote areas.|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} be used as an {{environmental}} restorative. Swamp trees in general are, by necessity, good at surviving and thriving in areas where highly mobile environmental toxins are present. Black Willow is very resistant to herbivory and flooding and is also a fantastic erosion control tool. Thus, it is useful for any sort of marshland stabilization or restorative as long as the roots don’t penetrate any clay liner that may be in place. In a relatively extensive phytoremediation study, Salix Nigra demonstrated some success as a <b>photodegradation</b> tool. <b>Photodegradation</b> is theorized to work by drawing the target chemical up the roots and stem into the leaves where it is degraded by higher energy radiation provided by the sun.|$|E
50|$|Singlet oxygen is a high-energy form of oxygen. A gas {{with the}} formula O2, its {{physical}} properties differ only subtly {{from those of}} the more prevalent triplet ground state of O2. In terms of its chemical reactivity, however, singlet oxygen is far more reactive toward organic compounds. It is responsible for the <b>photodegradation</b> of many materials but can be put to constructive use in preparative organic chemistry and photodynamic therapy. Trace amounts of singlet oxygen are found in the upper atmosphere and also in polluted urban atmospheres where it contributes to the formation of lung damaging nitrogen dioxide. It often appears and coexists confounded in environments that also generate ozone, such as pine forests with <b>photodegradation</b> of turpentine.|$|E
50|$|Paints, inks and dyes {{that are}} organic are more {{susceptible}} to <b>photodegradation</b> than those that are not. Ceramics are almost universally coloured with non-organic origin materials so as to allow the material to retain its colour even with the most relentless photo -degradation.|$|E
5000|$|Once in the environment, {{cellulose}} acetate {{can go through}} biodegradation and <b>photodegradation.</b> [...] Several factors go into determining the rate of both degradation process. This variance in rate and resistance to biodegradation in many conditions {{is a factor in}} littering and environmental damage.|$|E
50|$|Bemotrizinol is a broad-spectrum UV absorber, {{absorbing}} UVB {{as well as}} UVA rays. It has two absorption peaks, 310 and 340 nm. It {{is highly}} photostable. Even after 50 MEDs (minimal erythemal doses), 98.4% remains intact. It helps prevent the <b>photodegradation</b> of other sunscreen actives like avobenzone.|$|E
50|$|Hierarchically porous {{graphitic carbon}} nitride (hp-g-CN) had a 90% <b>photodegradation</b> of methyl orange, {{which is an}} {{improvement}} over other commercial photocatalysts. This {{is due to a}} higher surface area for an increased absorption capacity and porous features that allow for an increased diffusion of methyl orange.|$|E
50|$|Erythrosine, {{also known}} as Red No. 3, is an organoiodine compound, {{specifically}} a derivative of fluorone. It is cherry-pink synthetic, primarily used for food coloring. It is the disodium salt of 2,4,5,7-tetraiodofluorescein. Its maximum absorbance is at 530 nm in an aqueous solution, and it is subject to <b>photodegradation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a {{chemical}} <b>photodegradation</b> process, when a molecule dissociates after absorbing a light quantum, the quantum yield {{is the number}} of destroyed molecules divided by the number of photons absorbed by the system. Since not all photons are absorbed productively, the typical quantum yield will be less than 1.|$|E
5000|$|Absorption of UV {{radiation}} causes CDOM to [...] "bleach", {{reducing its}} optical density and absorptive capacity. This bleaching (<b>photodegradation)</b> of CDOM produces both low-molecular-weight organic compounds {{which may be}} utilized by microbes, and reactive oxygen species, which may damage tissues and alter the bioavailability of limiting trace metals.|$|E
50|$|In {{attempts}} {{to raise the}} chemical and quantum yields of nitrobenzyl-based PPGs, several beneficial modifications have been identified. The largest increase in quantum yield and reaction rate can be achieved through substitution at the benzylic carbon. However, potential substitutions must leave one hydrogen atom so the <b>photodegradation</b> can proceeded uninhibited.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation in {{the presence}} of oxygen, chloroform slowly converts into phosgene by a radical reaction. To suppress this <b>photodegradation,</b> chloroform is often stored in brown-tinted glass containers.

50|$|Breakdown in {{soil and}} groundwater: Dicofol is {{moderately}} persistent in soil, with a half-life of 60 days. Dicofol {{is susceptible to}} chemical breakdown in moist soils. It is also subject to degradation by UV light. In a silty loam soil, its <b>photodegradation</b> half-life was 30 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions, the half-life for dicofol was 15.9 days.|$|E
50|$|Cleviprex is {{available}} in ready-to-use 50- and 100-mL glass vials at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of clevidipine butyrate. Vials should be refrigerated at 2-8oC (36-46°F). Cleviprex can be stored to controlled room temperature for up to 2 months. Cleviprex is photosensitive and storage in cartons protects against <b>photodegradation.</b> Protection from light during administration is not required.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photodegradation</b> of {{plastics}} {{and other materials}} can be inhibited with additives, which are widely used. These additives include antioxidants, which interrupt degradation processes. Typical antioxidants are derivatives of aniline. Another type of additive are UV-absorbers. These agents capture the photon and convert it to heat. Typical UV-absorbers are hydroxy-substituted benzophenones, related to the chemicals used in sunscreen.|$|E
