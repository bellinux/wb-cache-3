40|$|Issues {{related to}} the {{volatility}} of aid flows are now becoming crucial in view of their relevance to {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goals. The paper examines aid volatility using data for 66 aid recipients over the period 1973 - 2002. We improve upon earlier work in this important area by disaggregating total aid inflows into sector and programme aid. In this way they avoid focussing on a single aggregate, unlike most previous studies on aid volatility. They also adopt a different methodology to capture aid volatility. The institutional quality of the aid recipient affects the stability of sector aid but not that of <b>programme</b> <b>assistance.</b> Moreover, more open economies, which tend to be smaller and richer, ceteris paribus, are associated with more volatile sector aid flows.

40|$|This paper reviews {{both the}} {{literature}} on aid volatility and also adds to that literature. In general, {{the focus of this}} literature has been on the volatility of overall aid, while we focus more on the volatility of the individual aid sectors, e. g., education aid. In doing this, detailed use is made of the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) database on aid commitments and disbursements, particularly the latter. Key aid sectors in explaining total aid volatility relate to debt, <b>programme</b> <b>assistance,</b> infrastructure and government. This reflects both these sectors' volatility and their size. The most volatile aid sectors per se are debt, industry, humanitarian, NGO and <b>programme</b> <b>assistance.</b> The least volatile are education, health, other social infrastructure and multi-sector aid. We also find evidence that the volatility of different aid sectors saw a peak around 2006, which was about when debt aid volatility was at its highest. In an asymmetric VAR, we find that both positive and negative aid volatility tend to be corrected for in the following period, rather than there simply being a return to trend. There are also cross-sector effects by which volatility in one sector has subsequent impacts on other sectors. These tend to revolve around government aid and <b>programme</b> <b>assistance.</b> Finally we examine the impact of aid and aid volatility on very specific targets, finding both to be significant. There are several lessons we draw from this: first, in analysing aid's impact, for example, on social targets such as school completion rates, social sector aid rather than overall aid is the relevant variable although not necessarily just education aid. Second, we argue that a complete understanding of aid's impact can only be obtained by an analysis such as this, across a range of targets and then analysing the impact of these targets on the macroeconomy itself. This leads to the further conclusion {{that it is not the}} volatility of total aid which matters so much as the sum of sector and subsector volatilities...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{study of}} (a) the HIPC debt relief initiative, (b) the linking {{of aid to}} policy {{conditionality}} and (c) transactions-cost arguments in favour of programme aid, this article argues that major elements in the new aid agenda may not be well-based empirically. This is partly because of inadequate knowledge, but particularly because the evidence often conflicts with political preferences. As a result, {{it is likely that}} large amounts of aid resources are being misdirected. Ways are suggested of narrowing the gap between evidence-based and ‘political ’ decision-making. In the meantime, donors should avoid diverting more aid into debt relief, should roll back their reliance on policy conditionality, and should exercise pragmatic caution in the expansion of <b>programme</b> <b>assistance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Following a {{break of}} nearly ten years, the {{proportion}} of owner-occupiers rose again from 1997 to 2001. During this period, nearly 600, 000 households a year bought their usual residence, approximately one-third more than during the eight previous years. The vast majority of these recent homeowners were mortgage holders. No doubt the foremost of the factors behind this upturn is the sharp drop in interest rates {{in the second half}} of the 1990 s. In addition to its direct effect on monthly repayment amounts, this drop has made the lengthening of mortgage periods more efficient. Another positive element is the renewal of public housing purchase <b>programme</b> <b>assistance</b> with the instantly successful introduction of the no-interest loan for an unlimited number of beneficiaries in late 1995.

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, the Government of Indonesia has {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> intended {{to improve the lives of}} the poor and help them escape poverty. Many of these programmes are now operating at a national scale and cover millions of Indonesians. Using a new household survey dataset that covers the eastern areas of Indonesia (Indonesian Family Life Survey East 2012), this paper investigates the household-level determinants of access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The analysis reveals that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are relatively more available in poorer provinces and that poorer households—all things being equal—are more likely to access social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> than nonpoor households, which suggests that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in eastern Indonesia are successful in their efforts to target the poor (poverty targeting), both across regions and households. However, poverty targeting still has scope for improvement in terms of accuracy. Besides the poverty status (as measured in per capita consumption expenditures), the authors found that several other factors infl uence programme access. Having a disabled household member or having a household head who is a widow(er) appears to increase the likelihood of receiving social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the level of trust and confl ict in a community affects access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Particularly in the case of Raskin, we found that the programme is distributed more widely among those communities that are characterized by higher levels of confl ict and lower levels of trust. The authors did not fi nd that poor access to infrastructure and remoteness infl uences household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> once they controlled for province fi xed effects in the regression framework. Furthermore, the fi ndings suggest that possession of a local ‘poverty letter’ strongly improves household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> even after controlling for a wide set of socioeconomic characteristics.

40|$|Ownership {{refers to}} {{programme}} aid recipient countries establishing their own development priorities by leading development policymaking {{in partnership with}} donors, rather than donors prescribing priorities for these recipients. Ownership has become a central indicator of global aid effectiveness since the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Simultaneously, donors have shifted towards a reliance on sectoral <b>programme</b> <b>assistance</b> which channels programme aid throughout whole sectors rather than using piecemeal projects. The donors comprising the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) have institutionalized ownership as international aid policy, and are broadly of the view that ownership at the sectoral level is best promoted through a reliance on sector wide approaches (SWAps). However there is no settled understanding of what recipient leadership entails; there is lack of an institutional understanding of recipient contexts, and how these contexts can operationalize ownership; {{and there has been}} a spurious association between ownership and SWAps over time. By relying on Historical Institutionalism, this thesis discusses how broader institutional characteristics establish the context of recipient policymaking generally, and how these characteristics contextualize the operationalization of ownership during sectoral development policymaking, specifically. The evidence reveals that ownership can be simultaneously reflected and challenged in Jamaica...|$|E
40|$|YesPurpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the entrepreneurial attitudes of upcountry vegetable farmers in Sri Lanka with respect to the characteristics of innovation, opportunity seeking and risk taking and considers their implications for rural development efforts. Design/methodology/approach – The study was carried out in the hilly areas of the Badulla district in the Uva Province of Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected through a survey using a researcher-administered questionnaire as the data collection instrument and the individual farmer as the unit of analysis. Findings – Most vegetable farmers in the upcountry areas were found to be attitudinally entrepreneurial. Entrepreneurial attitudes were determined more by educational background and farming experience than age, gender, extent of farmland, type of farming and ownership of farmland. Farming experience related positively with innovation, opportunity seeking and risk taking, but farmers’ educational background showed no significant association with innovation. Research limitations/implications – It is suggested that farmer-owned companies with appropriate institutional arrangements could reduce transaction costs for buyers, and introduce accessible rural finance schemes to enhance provision of assets and technology. Such a rural setting would gain from initiatives on marketing alternatives and entrepreneurial skill development. Future research could benefit from analysis of the financial and social performance and entrepreneurial skills of vegetable farmers. Originality/value – The entrepreneurial attitude of farmers is an under-researched area of study particularly in the Sri Lanka context. Rural development initiatives could target entrepreneurial farmers based on these criteria to achieve maximum production impact. However care needs to be taken to consider the potential distributive impact of such targeting on farmers regarded as non-entrepreneurial.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to look at the Perceptions of School Principals on their Role in the Implementation of the National School Nutrition Programme in the King Williams Town Education District. The areas that were deemed to be the most {{important}} in this regard were, (i) The role of principals in the implementation of the National School Nutrition Programme. Challenges faced by principals in the implementation of the National School Nutrition Programme. The views of principals on the training received for the implementation of the <b>programme.</b> <b>Assistance</b> provided to schools by the district offices. The study was situated in the interpretive paradigm which seeks to construct detailed descriptions of reality. Qualitative methods were employed for data collection purposes because they allow the use of interviews and document analysis for data collection. This was the most suitable method for the study which seeks to understand the perceptions of principals on their role in the implementation of the National School Nutrition Programme. The study found out that, there were a lot of positives with regard to the implementation of the programme and principals were satisfied with its positive impact on teaching and learning. However, principals raised serious concerns regarding some aspects of the programme such as, lack of infrastructure, budget constraints, lack of capacity of the School Nutrition Committees and food handlers. Also, the study revealed that, there is non-compliance by schools with the 10 H 00 feeding time, menu guidelines and five day feeding requirement of the programme. Furthermore, the study found out that, lack of training and support from the district offices were other challenges facing the programme. Community involvement was missing and this was having a negative impact on the implementation of the programme. The study recommends that, the department must embark on a mobilization drive to educate communities about the benefits of participating in the programme. It is further recommended that, the department should develop partnerships with other departments such as Social Development and Health, form partnerships with Universities, Non-Governmental Organisations and corporate businesses. This must be done so as to ensure that issues of lack of capacity and budgetary constraints are addressed. Furthermore, the study recommends that, the number of food handlers be increased and the department should ensure that budget allocations to schools are transferred on time. Training and monitoring should be consolidated through employment and training of district officials...|$|E

40|$|Social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} noted {{as one of the}} {{important}} keys to determining the success of the recovery process in the aftermath a disaster. It has also been shown that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster, significantly contribute to the recovery phase of disaster management, by utilizing the communities? capacity to facilitate community recovery from a disaster. Through the community recovery framework, social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with active collaboration and interaction between the community and the social assistants, can speed up community recovery efforts; contributing to the disaster recovery management. The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the social assistance delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the affected community. Therefore, the current study sought to address this gap by exploring the experiences of social assistance within the affected community following a disaster. With this knowledge, the government, NGOs, private sectors and other parties would gain insights, inputs and recommendations from the affected community, to whom the programmes were delivered, so that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster may be made more effective. A qualitative study was conducted in Kinahrejo hamlet, the most affected community from the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption.
