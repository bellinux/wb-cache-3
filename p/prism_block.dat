In order to simplify the problem, {{the region of the}} container is discretized into a sequence of <b>prism</b> <b>blocks.</b> The problem is decomposed into two parts: 1. Pack tubes in these blocks, 2. Connect these packed tubes at the ends of each block. 	 In the first part, since each block is prismatic, the problem of packing tubes is equivalent to the packing of circles in the cross-sectional area of each block. In this case, we assume that the cross-sectional area of each block is a polygon. We investigate a series of algorithms to pack circles, including a rather naive approach as well as the GGL [2] circle packing algorithm. Then we modify the GGL algorithm to pack circles in regions that are more complicated. Based on the GGL, we will also invent new algorithm that provides more satisfactory packing results. In the second part, we connect the packed tubes from Part one to form a complete network system. First we consider the simplest case [...] constructing a tubular system in a container with no variations, i. e., a single block. We solve this problem in terms of the travelling salesman problem (TSP) which is a classical problem in discrete optimization. For containers with varying cross-sections, we connect tubes at end of each block independently instead of constructing a complete system. This problem can be reduced to a perfect matching (PM) problem at each end. We apply similar integer programming algorithms to both perfect matching problem and TSP. However, the design of complete tubular network system in a container exhibiting longitudinal symmetry remains an open problem for future work...|$|R

The same standard also specifies the test of walls in real size, but they are too expensive and its execution is very difficult, so few laboratories are able to carry them out.

Two types of blocks and four types of mortars were used. These last ones can be divided, according to its origin, in mixing and industrialized.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{critically}} assess the mechanical properties of hollow concrete masonry using experimental results from <b>prisms</b> constructed with <b>blocks</b> of two different strengths and four types of mortar. A key conclusion is that mortar is mostly responsible for the non-linear behavior of masonry.

Since experimental material testing of individual masonry components (e. g. masonry unit and mortar joints) often produces highly variable results, this paper presents a numerical modelling based approach to address the associated uncertainty for the prediction of the maximum compressive load of masonry prisms. The method considers numerical model to be semi-random for a masonry prism by adopting a Latin Hyper cube simulation method used in conjunction with a parametric finite element model of the individual masonry prism. The proposed method is applied to two types of masonry <b>prisms</b> (using hollow <b>blocks</b> and solid clay bricks), for which experimental testing was conducted as part of the 9 th International Masonry Conference held at Guimarães in July 2014. A Class A prediction (presented before the tests were conducted) was generated for the two masonry prisms according to the proposed methodology, and the results were compared to the final experimental testing results. The root mean square deviation of the method for prediction of eccentric compressive strength of both types of prisms differed by only 2. 2 KN, thereby demonstrates the potential for this probabilistic approach.

Herein are reported the results of a study on the post-cracking behavior of <b>blocks,</b> <b>prisms,</b> and small walls reinforced with sisal fibers (lengths of 20 mm and 40 mm) added at volume fractions of 0. 5 % and 1 %. Tests were performed to characterize the fibers and blocks and to determine the compressive strength of the units, prisms, and small walls. The deformation modulus of the elements was calculated and the stress-strain curves were plotted {{to gain a better understanding}} of the values obtained. The compression test results for the small walls reinforced with fibers were similar to those of the reference walls and better than the <b>blocks</b> and <b>prisms</b> with added fibers, which had resistances lower than those of the corresponding conventional materials. All elements prepared with the addition of sisal exhibited an increase in the deformation capacity (conferred by the fibers), which was observed in the stress-strain curves. The failure mode of the reference elements was characterized by an abrupt fracture, whereas the reinforced elements underwent ductile breakage. This result was because of the presence of the fibers, which remained attached to the faces of the cracks via adhesion to the cement matrix, thus preventing loss of continuity in the material. Therefore, the cement/plant fiber composites are advantageous in terms of their ductility and ability to resist further damage after cracking...|$|R

Estas verificações e análises se fazem necessárias porque a NBR 8798 (1985) ainda especifica a colocação de argamassa em todas as paredes dos blocos (argamassa plena), embora o que mais se tem observado nas nossas construções é a colocação de argamassa apenas nas paredinhas longitudinais. Além disso, essas verificações se tornam mais necessárias quando se sabe que esse tipo de assentamento é o mais usado nos países mais ricos e desenvolvidos do mundo. Para a determinação do valor dessa redução, bem como para melhor compreender a ruptura das paredes com esses dois tipos de assentamento, foram ensaiados corpos-de-prova de blocos, prismas eparedes de 1, 00 m de altura, na idade de 14 dias, com argamassa plena e longitudinal. Todos os ensaios foram feitos com blocos de concreto e com blocos cerâmicos. Finalizando, após evidenciar as deficiências dos atuais modelos de prismas, principalmente dos prismas com argamassa longitudinal, este trabalho tem como um último objetivo propor novos modelos de prismas para ensaios, em conformidade com os tipos de assentamentoAbstract: The {{two main}} aims {{of this work}} are to verify and analyze the {{reduction}} of the compressive strength of structural masonry walls, when the blocks are laid with mortar only in the outside faces of the block (face shell bedding). These verifications and analysis are important because, although the Brazilian code NBR 8798 (1985) still specifies that the entire block surface must be bonded (full mortar bedding), in Brazil the most used type of bedding is the face shell bedding. Besides, these verifications are important because we notice that the face shell bedding is used in the richest countries. In order to find the magnitude of this reduction and to understand the collapse of the two types of bedding, 14 days old specimens of <b>blocks,</b> <b>prisms</b> and wallettes of one meter height were tested, with face shell and full mortar bedding. All the tests were carried out with concrete and ceramic structural blocks. After realize the handicaps of the Brazilianprisms, mainly that ones bonded whit face shell bedding, the last aim of this work is to propose a new model of prisms, to be used in laboratory test...|$|R
