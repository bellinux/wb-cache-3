Only 5 ft. wide between the low parapets, consisting of five bays with ancient stone piers having <b>pointed</b> <b>cut-water</b> faces on the west side against the flow of the streamâ€”and square projections on the east. The three northern arches are segmental-pointed, the southern two have been rebuilt with brick arches. East of the bridge is a ford.|$|E
2500|$|The piers {{are shaped}} {{so as to}} act as cutwaters, rounded on the {{upstream}} and pointed on the downstream side. The only exception is the broadest pier on the western shore, which is wedge-shaped on both sides. This feature of the Sangarius bridge sets it apart from most known Roman bridges, which usually feature <b>pointed</b> <b>cut-waters</b> upstream, and - if existing - also downstream.|$|R
