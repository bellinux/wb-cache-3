For any such operator, the matrices B that can be written in the form B=A − T(A) are those whose entries sum to zero along every group diagonal.

In T, the weight of a number x in row i, denoted ωi(x), is the number of times x occurs in row i of T. When T is not clear from context, we write ωi(x|T) in place of ωi(x). We extend this so that ωi(x 1, [...] ., xj|T) = (ωi(x 1 |T), [...] ., ωi(xj|T)). 10 Implicitly, we take ωi(T) = (ωi(1),) [...] ., ωi(a)), which is called the row-weight of row i ω 1 (xj) of T. Similarly, ω(xj) =. is the weight vector of xj of T. Hence ω(T) is the ωℓ(xj) matrix corresponding to ωi(j|T). Note that row permutations do not effect weight, so ω(σT) = ω(T) ...|$|R

More precisely, we show that, under some moment conditions, such random matrices are asymptotically $ B $-diagonal and Boolean independent from each other. The paper also gives a combinatorial condition under which such matrices are asymptotically Boolean independent from the matrix obtained by <b>permuting</b> the <b>entries</b> (thus extending a recent result in Boolean probability).

There is also an analysis of asymptotic second order relations between semicircular matrices and their transposes, with results not very similar to the commutative (i. e. Gaussian random matrices) framework. The paper also presents an application of the main results to the study of Gaussian random matrices and furthermore it is shown that the same condition {{as in the case of}} semicircular matrices gives Boolean independence, or asymptotic Boolean independence when applied to Bernoulli matrices.

40|$|Statistical {{entailment}} analysis (White, 1984; White and McCann, 1988 Social Structures: Form and Behaviour in Social Life) (Cambridge University Press) pp. 380 - 404) aims {{first at}} a rigorous evaluation of null hypotheses of statistical independence {{as a potential}} source of binary data structure, and second at constructing a discrete structure (Boolean) model of those statistical interactions that remain when the null hypothesis is rejected for particular subsets of variables. Signal detection theory, rather than a conventional significance level, is used to specify optimal cutoffs given an ordering of ratios of actual to expected across levels of exception and relevance. Bivariate entailment analysis is generalized here to improve its utility for use in lattice approximation. Generalized statistical entailment analysis describes Boolean patterns {{in a set of}} data in terms of those that occur with greater frequency than expected by chance according to a model of complete statistical independence (the specific model of independence derives from a distribution of randomly <b>permuted</b> <b>entries</b> in the columns of the data matrix marginals, i. e. keeping univariate marginals fixed). This expands on the initial design of entailment analysis (White, 1984) to deal with partial orders of quasi-implication in pairs or chains of dichotomous variables, supported by statistical evidence of departure from bivariate independence and conformity to the rules of transitivity. Statistical approximations simplify a lattice representation of discrete structure by forcing quasi-implications (ignoring exceptions), for example, but they also provide information about those implications in the lattice that represent statistically significant tendencies. Given a lattice representing the discrete structure of a raw data matrix, the findings of entailment analysis describe additional structural regularities (tendencies towards further statistical constraints on Boolean patterns that occur in the data) {{that can be used to}} simplify (by approximation) the lattice of empirical patterns. As demonstrated with studies of dual orderings of material possessions (possessions stratify people; people possessions), the statistical interpretability of discrete structure lattices is enhanced by using the results of entailment analysis for consensus-simplification of statistically strong or significant implicational relations...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} presents new preconditioners for linear systems. We {{proceed from}} the most general case to the very specific problem area of sparse optimal control. In the first most general approach, we assume only that the coefficient matrix is nonsingular. We target highly indefinite, nonsymmetric problems that cause difficulties for preconditioned iterative solvers, and where standard preconditioners, like incomplete factorizations, often fail. We experiment with nonsymmetric permutations and scalings aimed at placing large entries on the diagonal {{in the context of}} precon-ditioning for general sparse matrices. Our numerical experiments indicate that the reliability and performance of preconditioned iterative solvers are greatly enhanced by such preprocessing. Secondly, we present two new preconditioners for KKT systems. KKT systems arise in areas such as quadratic programming, sparse optimal control, and mixed finite element formulations. Our preconditioners approximate a constraint precon-ditioner with incomplete factorizations for the normal equations. Numerical experiments compare these two preconditioners with exact constraint preconditioning and the approach described above of <b>permuting</b> large <b>entries</b> to the diagonal. Finally, we turn to a specific problem area: sparse optimal control. Many optimal control problems are broken into several phases, and within a phase, most variables and constraints depend only on nearby variables and constraints. However, free initial and final times and time-independent parameters impact variables and constraints throughout a phase, resulting in dense factored blocks in the KKT matrix. We drop fill due to these variables to reduce density within each phase. The resulting preconditioner is tightly banded and nearly block tridiagonal. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the preconditioners are effective, with very little fill in the factorization...|$|R
