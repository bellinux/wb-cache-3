50|$|When Yahoo {{acquired}} Overture, the Claria software impaired {{the operation}} of Yahoo's services. For example, when a user with a Claria application installed used Yahoo Search, they received a standard set of Yahoo results with sponsored listings at the top supplied by Overture. The user would then receive a full-screen <b>pop-under</b> <b>window</b> from Search Scout. Since Search Scout uses Overture's paid listings as well, Claria's window has exactly the same listings as the Yahoo search results.|$|E
50|$|The {{program will}} display pop-up advertising, and can open <b>pop-under</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} on the pop-up <b>window,</b> the <b>pop-under</b> advertisement, opens a new browser window under the active <b>window.</b> <b>Pop-unders</b> do not interrupt the user immediately, but appear when the user closes the covering window, {{making it more difficult}} to determine which web site created them.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pop-up ad}} is {{displayed}} in a new web browser window that opens above a website visitor's initial browser <b>window.</b> A <b>pop-under</b> ad opens a new browser window under a website visitor's initial browser <b>window.</b> <b>Pop-under</b> ads and similar technologies are now advised against by online authorities such as Google, who state that they [...] "do not condone this practice".|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 's, on-line {{advertising}} has (increasingly) become a reliable form of (company) revenue (generation) and an "apparently" persuasive means of obtaining user click-throughs. However, {{the problem with}} the design of this advertising is pop-up (and <b>pop-under)</b> <b>windows</b> are persuasive, but can reduce the usability' and credibility of applications. In contrast advertisements banner and column can maintain good levels of usability and credibility, but are relatively unpersuasive. Existing templates for advertising are either too specific applicaple to search engines or check out pages or result in advertisements that are ignored, irritating or misleading. Many studies have identified features (such as navigation placement) that contribute to usability and credibility of websites or web applications containing advertising, but these studies have not synthesized or applied such knowledge to produce a recommendation. This research makes a recommendation {{in the form of a}} advertising template; this advertising template (called a follow-on) looks to promote a sponsored task in a sequential fashion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the design template, this research compares Banner Ads, Follow-on ads and Banner + Follow-on ads, to measure advertising within the context of an onl√≠ne Academic Integrity Quiz that promotes- the take up of an Academic Integrity Pledge. Laboratory tests show that follow-on ads are more persuasive than banner ads, therefore suggesting presenting persuasion at the end of a previous task; will achieve a high user click-through without "negatively" influencing the usability and or credibility of the application. A recommendation for modifying free-to-use Internet sites or applications to better accommodate follow-on ads is suggested...|$|R
