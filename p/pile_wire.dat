40|$|Abstract — Scour is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} caused due to the erosive action of flowing stream on alluvial beds which removes the sediment around or near structures located in flowing water. It means the lowering of the riverbed level by water erosions such {{that there is a}} tendency to expose the foundations of a structure. It is the result of the erosive action of flowing water, excavating and carrying away material from the bed and banks of streams and from around the piers and abutments of bridges. Scour has been the main cause for failures of marine structures throughout the world. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review few previous studies related to scour. Many researchers have conducted various studies to predict the maximum depth and diameter of scour hole. Vertical piles have been generally used in flumes to investigate the effects of scour. In a few studies, techniques to reduce the scour depth have been employed by making use of splitter plates and collars on the <b>piles.</b> Helical <b>wires</b> or cables wrapped spirally around the pile to resemble a threaded pile have also been used to reduce the scour. With the use of different special techniques, the scour depth has been reported to reduce by modifying the flow field near the piles. Prediction of scour depth is difficult as there are many uncertainties associated with it. Various methods of protecting the erodible soils around foundations of marine structures have also been adopted and such methods sometimes prove costly. It is therefore felt that more studies are still required to predict the scour depth effectively and also to find cost effective ways to reduce the scour...|$|R
40|$|My work {{is both a}} {{commentary}} on the pervasive societal ills of disposability and detachment in contemporary culture and {{an active participant in}} the same environment it criticizes. By exaggerating the colors of plastic bottles in a painting, I hope to show our obsession with the material as well as its overlooked value. Plastic packaging is often made from petroleum that is sourced from the Middle East, and waged for in war. It is often used once and then discarded. I make small attempts to fight these wasteful practices by working bottles into utilitarian lights, reincorporating plastic molding from store-bought items into collages, and incorporating LED lighting. I demonstrate my simultaneous revulsion and fascination with disposable goods. I photograph myself with such chemically toxic substances as cosmetics, sodas and cleaning products, speaking to their harmful nature while also reveling in their shimmering color. Their clever design is no accident and I find myself giving into the marketing seduction. The same goes for such other harmful behaviors as obsessive use of cell phones and social media, and rabid consumption of reality television and gossip magazines. In my work I want to show we are the consumers and the consumed. I embrace excess with <b>piles</b> of <b>wires,</b> trash, screaming colors and all sorts of environmentally unfriendly materials such as foil, resin and neon spray paint. It feels a bit over the top at times, screaming for attention like an ad in a swarm of commercialism. We have become hoarders and foragers, sifting through endless stuff: accumulated waste, material goods, and information. This proliferation of technology has enabled greater access to our global community, but leaves us feeling helpless without it. I try to assault the viewer with extraneous material, in the same way media has assaulted me. My ambition to make a political statement has evolved into a paradox. I criticize aspects of contemporary society while simultaneously celebrating them. My work asks the question: Is there a way out of these cultural addictions? - Julie Or...|$|R
40|$|A {{soil and}} rock slope {{assessment}} {{survey was conducted}} along Bireun – Takengon main road in Aceh Province, Indonesia. The slope assessment survey was carried out to determine the geological condition, verify and identify the potential areas of slope failure and to study what type of slope stability and protection method {{could be applied to}} the road. Several research methodologies were conducted in the field such as rock and soil identification, and slope assessment. The survey was conducted in four selected areas along Bireun – Takengon main road. In study area I, soil creep occurred because of a presence of montmorillonite clay. The mitigation methods to reduce soil creeping in this area are building a retaining wall and <b>pile.</b> The shotcrete, <b>wire</b> mesh, net rock bolting, and rock removal method is suitable to apply in study area II. The shotcrete and soil nails were used because the type of rocks in those areas is sedimentary rock such as shale, sandstone, siltstone, and a boulder of a volcanic rock. The same approach shall be applied in study area IV. study area III was the best spot to learn about the mitigation approach for slope stability and provides many lessons learned. Aceh Province experience active tectonic movement, high intensity of rain, geological structures, a high degree of weathering, and high intensity of earthquake,as primary factors which trigger landslides. The techonology of slope stabilizing and protection methods can be applied to mitigate landslides...|$|R
30|$|A {{relatively}} ample {{financial capacity}} can support {{the development of}} green and high-efficiency agriculture so as to create conditions to reduce agricultural non-point source pollution. Now, the difficulty of preventing environmental pollution in China has shifted from point source pollution to non-point source pollution. The former {{is caused by the}} industrial sector, and the latter is caused by agriculture and life. Developing high-efficiency and green agriculture will not only increase farmer incomes but also reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, resulting in significant reduction of non-point source pollution caused by agriculture. For example, planting kiwi trees is a typical type of high-efficiency and green agriculture. It takes 3 to 5  years from investment to planting to producing benefits. Without the government's guidance or support, it is difficult for farmers to carry out a long-term investment in such a field. To reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution, the government of Xixia County has actively guided farmers to develop local organic agriculture with low pollution. In doing so, the government has provided farmers with more infrastructure and technical support services. For example, in order to promote the planting of organic and harmless kiwi trees, the government contributed to the building of a kiwi fruit production base, setting the cement <b>piles</b> and barbed <b>wires</b> for kiwi trees to climb, and spent money on buying kiwi seedlings for farmers to grow. The government of Xixia County has been able to allocate funds to subsidize farmers to plant kiwi trees because the industrial development of the Xixia County provides sufficient financial resources.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{investigation}} into the design and performance of the piled raft foundation for the recently completed shops and offices building complex {{on the south side of}} Victoria Street, London. In particular, an attempt has been made to determine the proportion of the total load supported by the piles, using simple calculation techniques. The ability to predict accurately this share out of foundation loading between piles and raft could have a marked influence in saving costs in foundation design. An attempt has also been made to predict foundation settlement with a piled raft foundation, taking into account the non-linear soil strata and heave effects from the removal of the considerable depth of overburden, in the basements. Comprehensive site investigations were carried out; initially for Blocks B. and C, and later for Block D. The results from these site investigations were used for the initial design of the piled foundations, but were found to give very conservative results. Four test piles were constructed and tested to verify the initial pile design for Blocks B and C, The test piles were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges in an attempt to determine the distribution of load down the pile shafts and on the pile bases. The results from these test piles showed that much higher stresses could be applied to the ground than had been indicated in the soil investigation report. Three further test piles were tested for Block D and gave similar results to the test piles for Blocks B and C. The various considerations affecting the choice of foundation design are discussed and the validity of the initial assumptions are compared with the actual performance of the foundations as derived from the results recorded by the instrumentation of the foundations. In order to monitor the dispersion of loading through the foundation system, vibrating wire strain gauges were built into the working <b>piles</b> and vibrating <b>wire</b> soil cells were installed under the rafts and at the bottom of piles. The test piles were also instrumented to record the distribution of shear forces on the shaft and the end bearing forces. The building construction was phased, commencing in 1971, but all of the blocks, Block B, C, and D are now completed and occupied. The last two were monitored for some time after their occupation...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of displacement pile capacity in sand is {{hampered by the}} extreme changes in stress which occur {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pile during installation (Randolph 2003). High quality instrumented tests on steel model piles, such as those reported by Lehane (1992) and Chow (1997), have helped identify other factors that have a bearing on preformed displacement pile behaviour in sand. These factors include the extent of soil displacement during installation and loading, the reduction in shaft friction due to increasing load cycles during installation (referred to as friction fatigue), increases in radial stresses due to dilation at the pile-soil interface, differences in shaft resistance with loading direction (i. e. compressive and tensile loading) and increases in shaft capacity with time, i. e. pile ageing. The majority of these phenomena have now been incorporated in four new cone penetration test (CPT) -based design methods which give superior estimates of preformed displacement pile capacity in sand in comparison to traditional methods. The knowledge gained from the high-quality studies of displacement pile behaviour is now being applied to other pile types such as partial displacement piles (e. g. open-ended piles) and replacement piles (e. g. bored and screw piles). One category of pile which has received sparse attention is the driven cast-in-situ (DCIS) pile which is typically classified as a large displacement pile, despite sharing certain aspects of its construction with replacement pile types. Furthermore, there are relatively few case histories of load tests on DCIS piles in the literature to verify the assumption that they behave as full displacement piles. The behaviour of DCIS piles during installation, curing and maintained load testing was therefore investigated by constructing a total of seven instrumented DCIS piles in layered soils and sand at sites in the United Kingdom. The resistance of the steel installation tube during driving was derived using instrumentation fitted to the DCIS piling rigs. The variation in temperature and strain after casting was monitored continuously in three of the test piles to examine the development of residual loads during curing. After developing sufficient concrete strength, the test piles were subjected to maintained compression load tests to failure (i. e. a displacement in excess of 10 % of the pile diameter), with the shaft and base resistance during loading derived from strain measured within the test <b>piles</b> using vibrating <b>wire</b> strain gauges. The installation resistance derived by the rig instrumentation shows good agreement with the base resistance profile derived by the University of Western Australia UWA- 05 method using the Dutch averaging technique. Residual loads developed during curing of the DCIS piles installed in layered soils due to consolidation settlement of soft soil layers as pore pressures induced by the driving process dissipated. On the other hand, residual loads for DCIS piles in uniform sand were negligible. The instrumented DCIS piles in sand exhibited a clear reduction in normalised local shear stresses and radial effective stresses at failure with distance from the pile base, i. e. friction fatigue, which is a well-known characteristic of preformed displacement piles and its existence for DCIS piles implies that radial stresses during driven installation of the steel tube are not erased upon concreting and tube withdrawal. The normalised base resistance at failure showed excellent agreement with the UWA- 05 design method for driven closed-ended displacement piles, with the onset of degradation in base stiffness occurring at large base displacements. Design correlations have subsequently been developed {{based on the results of}} the instrumented DCIS pile tests. The main implication of the experimental data for DCIS pile design in sand is that the shaft, base and total capacities of a DCIS pile are similar to a preformed closed-ended displacement pile of equivalent dimensions. In keeping with this finding, an examination of the predictive performance of seven CPT-based displacement pile design methods using a database of 26 DCIS pile load tests with adjacent CPT qc profiles demonstrated that the recent methods provide improved estimates of DCIS shaft, base and total capacity in comparison to traditional simplified methods. However, a statistical study of DCIS pile load-displacement behaviour in sand using a database of 105 pile load tests showed that the total resistance of a DCIS pile tends to mobilise at a slower rate in comparison to preformed driven displacement piles, implying that DCIS piles may exhibit greater levels of displacement for a given applied load...|$|R
