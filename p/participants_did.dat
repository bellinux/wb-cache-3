5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent study}} by Cohen, Alvarez & Nakayama (2011) calls into {{question}} the validity of evidence supporting the attention-free hypothesis. They found that <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> display inattentional blindness while doing certain kinds of multiple-object tracking (MOT) and rapid serial visual presentation (RVSP) tasks. Furthermore, Cohen et al. found that participants' natural scene perception was impaired under dual-task conditions, but that this dual-task impairment happened only when participants' primary task was sufficiently demanding. The authors concluded that previous studies showing the absence of a need for focused attention did not use tasks that were demanding enough to fully engage attention.|$|E

25|$|The {{optimism}} of la belle époque was destroyed, {{and those who}} had fought in the war were referred to as the Lost Generation. For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder). Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, Paul Fussell, and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Prospective memory cues {{will lead}} to {{spontaneous}} retrieval of an intention when {{at least one of}} four conditions is met: the cue and target action are highly associated with each other, the cue is salient, the other processes performed during the period between cue and action of the prospective memory task direct attention to relevant cue features (e.g., task appropriate processing), or the intended action is simple. Further research has found that although many aspects of prospective memory tasks are automatic, they do involve a small amount of processing. An experiment conducted by Einstein et al. (2005) found that some participants performed slower on a filler task when performing a prospective memory task at the same time. Even though some of the <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> not engage in active monitoring, they showed nearly the same rate of success on the task, demonstrating the use of multiple processes for prospective memory performance.|$|E
25|$|While {{the link}} between ethnic {{heterogeneity}} and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran a serious of behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> not favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics. The possibility of social sanctions compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no {{evidence to suggest that}} co-ethnics display a greater degree of altruism towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1991, the Soviet Union {{had reached}} a state of emergency. According to the {{official}} commission (the Soviet Academy of Sciences) appointed by the Supreme Soviet (the higher chamber of the Russian parliament) immediately after the events of August 1991, the Army did not {{play a significant role}} in what some describe as coup d'état of old-guard communists. Commanders sent tanks into the streets of Moscow, but (according to all the commanders and soldiers) only with orders to ensure the safety of the people. It remains unclear why exactly the military forces entered the city, but they clearly did not have the goal of overthrowing Gorbachev (absent on the Black Sea coast at the time) or the government. The coup failed primarily because the <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> not take any decisive action, and after several days of their inaction the coup simply stopped. Only one confrontation took place between civilians and the tank crews during the coup, which led to the deaths of three civilians. Although the victims became proclaimed heroes, the authorities acquitted the tank crew of all charges. Nobody issued orders to shoot at anyone.|$|E
25|$|As late as 1964 Sivatte {{tried to}} {{maintain}} correct relations with Don Carlos Hugo, but the attempt backfired as {{significant number of}} Sivattistas, including Carles Feliu de Travy, left RENACE and re-integrated within Javierismo. The conversion was a serious blow to Sivatte, who made sure that the prince was a subversive leftist traitor and vehemently opposed his bid {{to take control of}} Carlism; this stand produced even sort of rapprochement between Sivatte and Fal Conde. Over time RENACE was getting more and more marginalized. Entirely failing to attract young activists, it was turning into a group of rapidly aging if not already senile dissenters. In 1970 it seemed reinvigorated when representatives of Juntas de Defensa and envoys of RENACE met in Estella to co-ordinate their activities; the meeting produced nothing but a few documents, eclipsed by what looked like impressive dynamics of the socialist-controlled Partido Carlista. In 1973, during the key annual Sivattista event, Aplec de Montserrat, only 150 <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> show up. During the same event next year Sivatte was detained and fined, perhaps the last sign of political recognition he has received in his life.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities, Trueswell et al. {{conducted a series of}} experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, Zajonc {{proposed}} the affective primacy hypothesis, which hypothesizes that affective reactions (i.e. liking) can be [...] "elicited with minimal stimulus input". Through mere-exposure experiments, Zajonc sought to {{provide evidence for}} the affective-primacy hypothesis, namely, that affective judgments are made without prior cognitive processes. Zajonc tested this hypothesis by presenting repeated stimuli to participants at suboptimal thresholds such {{that they did not}} show conscious awareness or recognition of the repeated stimuli (when asked whether they had seen the image, responses at chance level), but continued to show affective bias towards the repeatedly exposed stimuli. Zajonc compared results from primes exposed longer which allowed for conscious awareness to stimuli shown briefly such that <b>participants</b> <b>did</b> not show conscious awareness. He found that the primes shown more briefly and not recognized prompted faster responses for liking as compared to primes shown at conscious levels.|$|E
