50|$|The Wapping dispute was a {{significant}} {{turning point in the}} history of the trade union movement and of UK industrial relations. It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employers, News International (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by Rupert Murdoch). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in the London district of Wapping, and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU). Despite the widespread use of the offset litho printing process elsewhere, the Murdoch papers in common with the rest of Fleet Street continued to be produced by the hot-metal and labour-intensive Linotype method, rather than being composed electronically. Eddy Shah's Messenger group, in a long-running and bitter dispute at Warrington had benefited from the Thatcher government's trade union legislation to allow employers to de-recognise unions, enabling the company to use an alternative workforce and new technology in newspaper production. He launched Today on Tuesday 4 March 1986, as a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established Daily Mail and Daily Express. It pioneered computer <b>photosetting</b> and full-colour offset printing at a time when national newspapers were still using Linotype machines and letterpress. Established national newspapers converted to electronic production and colour printing. Today ceased publication on 17 November 1995, the first long-running national newspaper title to close since the Daily Sketch in 1971.|$|E

The PRX containing 50 α-cyclodextrins (α-CDs) with disulfide end groups was initially modified with n -butylamine {{to obtain a}} resin monomer-soluble PRX. The PRX containing 13 n -butyl groups per α-CD molecule was completely soluble in conventional resin monomers such as 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA).

The prepared resin monomer-soluble PRX crosslinker was successfully polymerized {{with a mixture of}} HEMA and UDMA to provide <b>photosetting</b> plastic. It was confirmed that the Vickers hardness of the prepared plastic was greatly decreased after treatment with dithiothreitol.

Systematic evaluation of 115 <b>photosets</b> was combined with field observation and environmental data to determine the age class and degree of foliage cover, as well as fire frequency, rockiness of habitat, altitude, aspect of slope, annual mean temperature and annual precipitation for each tree viewed in <b>photosets.</b> Mortality and recruitment events were documented {{in each of the}} <b>photosets.</b> A total of 1315 trees were recorded in historical photographs (1931 - 1982), with 968 of these shown to have died in the repeat photographs (2007 - 2013), indicating 74 % mortality. With only 45 (3. 4 %) recruits being recorded, the total current living population of W. cedarbergensis in the repeat photographs was 392. There was no significant difference found in mortality or recruitment across the sampled sites. From the historical to repeat <b>photosets</b> there was an 8 % increase in the proportion of mature adults and a 13 % increase in the proportion of W. cedarbergensis individuals with sparse foliage cover.

40|$|The {{deficiencies}} of traditional dendrometry mean improvements in methods of tree mensuration are {{necessary in order}} to obtain accurate tree metrics for applications such as resource appraisal, and biophysical and ecological modelling. This thesis tests the potential of SfM-MVS (Structure-fromMotion with Multi-View Stereo-photogrammetry) using the software package PhotoScan Professional, for accurately determining linear (2 D) and volumetric (3 D) tree metrics. SfM is a remote sensing technique, in which the 3 D position of objects is calculated from a series of photographs, resulting in a 3 D point cloud model. Unlike other photogrammetric techniques, SfM requires no control points or camera calibration. The MVS component of model reconstruction generates a mesh surface based on the structure of the SfM point cloud. The study was divided into two research components, for which two different groups of study trees were used: 1) 30 small, potted ‘nursery’ trees (mean height 2. 98 m), for which exact measurements could be made and field settings could be modified, and; 2) 35 mature ‘landscape’ trees (mean height 8. 6 m) located in parks and reserves in urban areas around the South Island, New Zealand, for which field settings could not be modified. The first component of research tested the ability of SfM-MVS to reconstruct spatially-accurate 3 D models from which 2 D (height, crown spread, crown depth, stem diameter) and 3 D (volume) tree metrics could be estimated. Each of the 30 nursery trees was photographed and measured with traditional dendrometry to obtain ground truth values with which to evaluate against SfM-MVS estimates. The trees were destructively sampled by way of xylometry, in order to obtain true volume values. The RMSE for SfM-MVS estimates of linear tree metrics ranged between 2. 6 % and 20. 7 %, and between 12. 3 % and 47. 5 % for volumetric tree metrics. Tree stems were reconstructed very well though slender stems and branches were reconstructed poorly. The second component of research tested the ability of SfM-MVS to reconstruct spatially-accurate 3 D models from which height and DBH could be estimated. Each of the 35 landscape trees, which varied in height and species, were photographed, and ground truth values were obtained to evaluate against SfM-MVS estimates. As well as this, each <b>photoset</b> was thinned to find the minimum number of images required to achieve total image alignment in PhotoScan and produce an SfM point cloud (minimum <b>photoset),</b> from which 2 D metrics could be estimated. The height and DBH were estimated by SfM-MVS from the complete <b>photosets</b> with RMSE of 6. 2 % and 5. 6 % respectively. The height and DBH were estimated from the minimum <b>photosets</b> with RMSE of 9. 3 % and 7. 4 % respectively. The minimum number of images required to achieve total alignment was between 20 and 50. There {{does not appear to be}} a correlation between the minimum number of images required for alignment and the error in the estimates of height or DBH (R 2 = 0. 001 and 0. 09 respectively). Tree height does not appear to affect the minimum number of images required for image alignment (R 2 = 0. 08) ...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} long-term range {{conditions in}} southern Utah, 1, 879 repeat photographs {{were made on}} the Dixie and Fishlake National Forests, and adjoining lower elevation BLM and private lands. Repeat photographs were also made in Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks National Monument, and Bryce Canyon National Park where livestock grazing has been prohibited for many years. Of the total, 926 photo-pairs depict sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) communities and 471 depict mountain brush associations (Cercocaprus ledifolius, C. mountanus, Amelamchier utahensis, Quercus gambelii, Prunus virginiana). Sagebrush decreased in 261 <b>photosets,</b> increased in 386 and remained unchanged in 279, while mountain brush decreased in 10 photopairs, increased in 440, and showed no change in 21. Sagebrush increased on all sites that had been treated and planted to crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum) during the 1950 s to 1960 s. Most {{of the decline in}} sagebrush was due to invasion by pinyon (Pinus spp.) and/or juniper (Juniperus spp.), while an absence of fire is the most likely reason mountain brush increased.
