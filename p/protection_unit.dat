5|$|SS-Begleitkommando des Führers ("Escort Command of the Führer") was {{an elite}} SS <b>{{protection}}</b> <b>unit</b> formed in February 1932 as Hitler's protection escort while travelling. The unit consisted of eight men who served {{around the clock}} protecting Hitler. Later the SS-Begleitkommando was expanded and {{became known as the}} Führerbegleitkommando ("Führer Escort Command"; FBK).

5|$|Führer Begleitbattalion ("Führer Escort Battalion"; FBB) was a {{military}} <b>protection</b> <b>unit</b> set up just before war began. It had the task of protecting Hitler's military headquarters and accompanying him when visiting battlefronts. It also was responsible for all luggage that travelled with Hitler and his staff. It was originally commanded by then infantry colonel Erwin Rommel. Otto Ernst Remer went on to command an expanded FBB, which {{played a key role}} in putting down the attempted military coup against Hitler of 20 July 1944 in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Führer Schutzkommando ("Führer Protection Command"; FSK) was a <b>protection</b> <b>unit</b> {{founded by}} Himmler in March 1933. Originally charged with {{protecting}} the Führer only {{while he was}} inside the borders of Bavaria, its members consisted of police detectives of the Bavarian police and ministry. In the spring of 1934, they replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's overall protection throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst ("Reich Security Service"; RSD) in August 1935. Thereafter, the RSD and FBK worked together for security and protection during trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. Johann Rattenhuber, chief of the RSD, was in overall command and the current FBK chief acted as his deputy.|$|E

5|$|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ("Life Guards SS Adolf Hitler"; LSSAH) was {{an elite}} SS <b>{{protection}}</b> <b>unit</b> founded in 1933 as a palace guard to provide protection for Hitler's residences and offices. The LSSAH {{had some of}} the strictest entry requirements. The commander, Sepp Dietrich insisted that the men be in good physical condition, between the ages of 23 to 35, and have a confirmed ancestry record without Jewish lineage. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, a core group of 800 men stayed in Berlin and made up the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E
5|$|The Stoßtrupp was {{abolished}} {{after the}} failed 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, {{an attempt by}} the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organize a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando (Protection Command). It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the Sturmstaffel (Storm Squadron), and finally the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squad; SS). Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch). The new SS was to provide protection for NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS <b>protection</b> <b>unit</b> was later enlarged to include combat units.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1920, the Sturmabteilung (SA) was {{the first}} of many {{paramilitary}} protection squads that worked to protect Nazi officials. In 1923, a small bodyguard unit, which became known as the Stosstrupp-Hitler (SSH), was set up specifically for Hitler's protection. It was {{under the control of the}} SA. Then in 1925, as the Nazi Party grew, the Schutzstaffel (SS) was created as a sub-section of the SA. Initially only about a hundred men, it was also originally a personal <b>protection</b> <b>unit</b> for Hitler. Several other bodyguard organisations, such as the Führerbegleitkommando (FBK), Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) and Reichssicherheitsdienst (RSD) were created as sub-sections of the SS. Police and security forces available included the Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo), Ordnungspolizei (Orpo), Kriminalpolizei (Kripo) and Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo). In addition, the Nazi intelligence organization, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), investigated and performed security checks on people, including party members. If the SD personnel determined an arrest was to be made, they passed the information on to the Gestapo. Like many autocratic rulers, Hitler surrounded himself with security units for protection.|$|E

5|$|Two other SS units {{composed}} the inner ring of Hitler's personal protection. The SS-Begleitkommando des Führers (Escort Command of the Führer), formed in February 1932, served as Hitler's protection escort {{while he was}} travelling. This unit consisted of eight men who served around the clock protecting Hitler in shifts. Later the SS-Begleitkommando was expanded and {{became known as the}} Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). It continued under separate command and remained responsible for Hitler's personal protection. The Führer Schutzkommando (Führer Protection Command; FSK) was a <b>protection</b> <b>unit</b> founded by Himmler in March 1933. Originally it was charged with protecting Hitler only while he was inside the borders of Bavaria. In early 1934, they replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's protection throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst (Reich Security Service; RSD) in August 1935. Johann Rattenhuber, chief of the RSD, for the most part took his orders directly from Hitler. The current FBK chief acted as his deputy. Wherever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and FBK would be present. RSD men patrolled the grounds and FBK men provided close security protection inside. The RSD and FBK worked together for security and personal protection during Hitler's trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. By March 1938, both units wore the standard field grey uniform of the SS. The RSD uniform had the SD diamond on the lower left sleeve.|$|E
