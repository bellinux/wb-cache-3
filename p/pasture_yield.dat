40|$|Summary: Rabbits {{are serious}} {{economic}} and environmental pests in New Zealand’s semi arid lands, yet there is surprisingly little quantitative information about their grazing impacts. This paper describes the shortterm gains in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> following protection from rabbit grazing in a rabbit-prone, dry tussock grassland community in Central Otago. During the four most productive plant growing months of 1994 (September to December), a six-fold increase in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> was observed after protection from rabbit grazing (139 kg dry weight ha- 1 with rabbits cf. 853 kg DW ha- 1 without rabbits). Rabbit counts were 30 to 42 rabbits per spotlight km. The following four months (January to April) were characterised by reduced pasture growth (3 kg DW/ha with rabbits cf. 337 kg DW ha- 1 without rabbits) and higher rabbit numbers (42 - 76 rabbits per spotlight km), and was a critical period of herbage depletion. These substantial differences in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> indicate the potential benefits for pastoral production and land conservation following protection from rabbits. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|Land {{clearing}} in Queensland {{is often}} practised to enhance pasture production, and hence, increase financial returns from beef production. The benefits of clearing have been quantified {{in terms of}} short-term gains in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> but have not adequately accounted for possible medium- or longer-term impediments that {{may be attributed to}} clearing. Therefore, impacts of clearing and the subsequent sowing of exotic grasses such as Cenchrus ciliaris L. on pasture composition and production were studied. To achieve this, paired sites were selected representing cleared and uncleared pastures across three different times since clearing (i. e. 5, 11 – 13 and 33 years since clearing) for the three dominant tree communities of central Queensland (i. e. Eucalyptus populnea F. Muell. (poplar box), E. melanophloia F. Muell. (silver-leaved ironbark) and Acacia harpophylla F. Muell. ex. Benth. (brigalow)). The results demonstrated that species diversity declined with clearing and sowing of exotic pastures. Species diversity and pasture production were negatively related. Although <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> was 2 – 3 times greater 13 years after clearing of E. populnea and A. harpohylla, the gains in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> were not consistent over time, yields being only 1. 5 times greater after 33 years of clearing. In E. melanophloia, an increase in the yield of only 1. 5 – 1. 8 times occurred 5 years after clearing compared with uncleared pastures, whereas 33 years after clearing, yield was 3 / 4 of that in uncleared pastures. The initial gains in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> were accompanied by a loss of plant diversity that may affect ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling or soil mineralisation, and the longer-term production gains...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a range of pasture {{management}} options (introduced legumes and grasses, super-phosphate, timber treatment, cultivation before sowing and stocking rate) on the amounts of ground cover {{at the end of the}} dry season were measured from 1985 – 1991 at two sites, Hillgrove and Cardigan, near Charters Towers, north-east Queensland. Ground cover levels varied signifi-cantly between years and were significantly affected by pasture management. Cover levels were curvilinearly related to pasture yields. Management options which increased pasture growth (tree killing, using sown pastures, applying superphosphate) or decreased pasture consumption (lower stocking rates) increased cover levels. Pasture treatments affected the shape of the relationship between <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> and cover. Cover levels were higher for oversown than native pastures at all levels of <b>pasture</b> <b>yield.</b> For pasture yields below 3000 kg/ha, cover levels increased with stocking rate but there was little difference in cover levels between stocking rates at higher pasture yields.

This paper reports an approach to develop best practice options for controlling medium to dense infestations of bellyache bush using combinations of control methods. The efficacy of five single treatments including foliar spraying, slashing, stick raking, burning and do nothing (control) were compared against 15 combinations of these treatments over 4 successive years. Treatments were evaluated using several attributes, including plant mortality, changes in population demographics, seedling recruitment, <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> and cost of treatment. Foliar spraying once each year for 4 years proved the most cost-effective control strategy, with no bellyache bush plants recorded {{at the end of the}} study. Single applications of slashing, stick raking and to a lesser extent burning, when followed up with foliar spraying also led to significantly reduced densities of bellyache bush and changed the population from a growing one to a declining one. Total experimental cost estimates over 4 successive years for treatments where burning, stick raking, foliar spraying, and slashing were followed with foliar spraying were AU 408, AU 584, AU 802 and AU 789 ha– 1, respectively. Maximum <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> of 5. 4 t ha– 1 occurred with repeated foliar spraying.

40|$|Broadscale tree {{clearing}} {{has been}} widespread in Queensland as landholders try to increase pasture production. The recent government policies aim to stop broadsca 1 e clearing by 2006, but {{the debate over}} the opportunity cost of the regulatory controls continues. Previous studies of the pasture production gains following clearing have identified key improvements, which can be expected to increase livestock production. These studies have all been focused at relatively short term impacts (less than 10 years), raising questions of whether pasture production gains are sustainable over the longer term. The key focus of the research reported in this paper was to determine if pasture production gains following clearing were maintained over the longer term. For this, the <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> and the ecological effects of tree clearing over three different time periods for three different vegetation communities in central Queensland. The results indicate that pasture production increases post-clearing, but then declines over the longer term (more than 30 years). A bioeconomic model applied to develop scenarios for pasture production over the 50 years of time frame of clearing, also suggested a decline in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> with age of clearing based on the yearly average increase estimated from the old (30 years) to 50 years of age clearing. Although, the cleared pastures could be economically beneficially as predicted in bioeconomic model, however, it is difficult to predict how the change in ecosystem functions in old pastures (> 30 years of clearing), by implication, affect <b>pasture</b> <b>yield.</b> The opportunity cost of clearing to achieve production gains in terms of loss of ecosystem functions and their implication for future production gains, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the production of two pasture species, Brachiaria brizantha cv. BRS Piatã and Panicum maximum cv. Mombaça, under different irrigation depths. The experiment was carried out from May to December 2014, at the State University of Maringá, in the municipality of Cidade Gaúcha-PR, Brazil. The experiment was set out in a strip-plot design, with four replicates, six irrigation depths in the plot and two pasture species in the subplot. Irrigation depths were represented by a percentage of reference evapotranspiration (ET 0), which was estimated by the Penman-Monteith equation. Four pasture cuts were performed during the studied period {{and there were no}} differences between the yields of both evaluated pasture species; however, irrigation depths caused a quadratic response on <b>pasture</b> <b>yield.</b> The maximum values of dry matter yield of the pastures under irrigated conditions were 52. 1, 41. 6, 26. 2 and 25. 1 % higher than under non-irrigated conditions, for the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th cuts, respectively.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to most economic drivers of land-use change, climate-related drivers display substantial geographic variation. Accounting for this spatial heterogeneity {{is important in}} simulations of the land-use response to climate change. I use a discrete choice model to estimate the relationship between <b>pasture</b> <b>yields</b> and rural land use. Land-use predictions from the model respond to climate change through its effects on <b>pasture</b> <b>yields.</b> This econometric model provides {{the foundation for the}} development of a new module of the Land Use in Rural New Zealand (LURNZ) model, the Yield Change Module. In addition to enabling simulations of overall land-use change under different climate scenarios, the module also draws on the estimation results to allocate land-use change spatially. I employ the Yield Change Module to perform illustrative mid-century and end-of-century simulations of land use in a climate scenario characterised by a high level of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 8. 5). Yield changes in this scenario lead to an expansion (by nearly 600, 000 hectares) of dairy area and a fall (by over 800, 000 hectares) of sheep-beef area by the end of the century. The implied rate of land-use change is modest relative to that observed in New Zealand’s recent past...|$|R
50|$|There are, however, some {{positive}} possible aspects {{to climate change}} as well. The projected increase in temperature {{during the first half}} of the century (1-3 °C) is expected to benefit crop and <b>pasture</b> <b>yields</b> in the temperate regions. This will lead to higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in these regions; resulting in a longer growing season, increased thermal resources and accelerated maturation. If the climate scenario results in mild and wet weather, some areas and crops will suffer, but many may benefit from this.|$|R

40|$|Tree {{clearing}} {{is widely}} practised in Queensland to develop exotic pastures to enhance pasture production {{and hence the}} financial gains. One of the major woodland community i. e. brigalow (Acacia harpop hylla) was targeted for clearing in the early 1950 s due to its fertile soils. Recently, some marginal communities such as Poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea) and Iron bark (Eucalyptus melanophloia) are targeted for clearing. Net benefits from clearing woodlands to increase pasture production, hence cattle production, is questioned in this paper. Previous studies have emphasised the gains in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> over 15 yrs.) or whether such an increase is 'actually beneficial' and does not result in any adverse in-situ and ex-situ ecological effects on grazing systems? The study is based on detailed ecological data on pasture production, soil properties (biological and physicochemical), litter production and nutrient recycling, and pasture plant diversity and diet quality. For this, three tree communities i. e. A. harpophylla, E. melanophloia and E. populnea were selected in central Queensland. There were three different ages of clearing i. e. 5 yr, 11 - 13 yr and 33 yr {{for each of the}} tree community. Comparisons were made for paired plots between cleared and uncleared (intact) woodlands across 3 age groups of clearing. An economic analysis was conducted of tangible (<b>pasture</b> <b>yield)</b> and intangible parameters (soil properties, plant diversity and diet quality, and nutrients recycled through litter). The total assessment for <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> and various ecological parameters across 3 different age groups of clearing and their paired uncleared plots provides information for the land holders, policy makers and land managers to make decisions on tree clearing for pasture development considering the long term ecological effects.

In a field campaign in a high input ryegrass-kikuyu pasture system we compared the soil N pools, losses and pasture production between a) urea coated with the nitrification inhibitor (3, 4 -dimethyl pyrazole phosphate - DMPP) b) urea coated with the urease inhibitor (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide - NBPT) and c) standard urea.

40|$|For {{improving}} {{soil and}} water conservation and developing livestock production, an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and crop rotation practice has been widely employed in the dryland region of the Loess Plateau in China.

The length of alfalfa phase is essential for attaining high <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> and remaining enough soil water for subsequent crops. To determine the optimal length of alfalfa phase, one continuous growing alfalfa treatment and nine other treatments, including eight alfalfa/crop rotations and a crop/crop rotation, were studied at the Changwu Agri-ecological Station of the Loess Plateau in China from 1985 to 2001. Results showed that alfalfa yield decreased with time at a rate of 0. 629 t ha(- 1) year(- 1) and soil water storage in the 0 - 500 cm profile by 33. 5 mm year(- 1). After alfalfa grew for > 8 years, its yield responded very vigorously to seasonal precipitation variations, and the yield age coefficient (YAC), which reflects the effects of alfalfa growing age and soil water deficit on <b>pasture</b> <b>yield,</b> was less than 1. 0. Our analysis also showed that the average soil water content within the profile from 300 to 1000 cm was less than 0. 18 cm cm(- 3), this was determined to be a threshold value for creating a strong water stress to alfalfa growth.

This paper summarises the growth of tropical and temperate grass pastures on dairy farms in 2 rainfall environments in south-east Queensland. Fertiliser and feed inputs and milk output were investigated, and forage utilised for milk production was calculated by the reverse application of feeding standards. Growth of tropical grass pastures in summer averaged 100 kg DM/ha/day, with greatest yields at recommended nitrogen inputs. Irrigated annual ryegrass pastures produced 40 - 50 kg DM/ha/day in winter and over 60 kg DM/ha/day in spring. West Moreton farms (800 mm rainfall) produced 7 - 10 t DM/ha/year from rain grown tropical grass. Corresponding yields for East Moreton farms (1000 mm rainfall) were 19 t DM/ha/year.

After 11 months, shoots of Caucasian clover were small (3 mg), indicating an inoculation failure, and effects of fertilisers were not biologically meaningful. Therefore, the influence of rhizobia inoculant, superphosphate and lime on early growth of Caucasian clover was assessed using the same soil in a glasshouse. Un-inoculated plants were 13 – 24 % the size of inoculated plants and this lack of vigour was not overcome by fertilisers.

Two technology levels are available, either as a basic system deriving average cover for individual paddocks, or with the incorporation of a GPS to allow pasture production to be mapped. Recent independent calibration results from New Zealand based research organisations have shown the C-Dax Pasture Meter to have a higher level of accuracy than traditionally used methods as well as increased utility. The system has also proved to be reliable in measuring post grazing residual levels which are known as Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) to achieving good pasture management and maintaining pasture quality. Measuring pasture covers allows farmers to make timely decisions regarding feed conservation, fertiliser use and stocking policies as well as giving farmers greater certainty in budgeting feed resources. The paper examines the KPI’s that farmers use to benchmark the success of their grazing management. Acase study is presented to illustrate how the C-Dax Pasture Meter is benefiting dairy farmers in New Zealand and Australia...|$|E

We study {{the effect of}} two contrasting, in terms of morphological traits and reproductive strategy, shrub species: Retama sphaerocarpa (a deep rooted shrub) and Citus ladanifer (a shallow rooted shrub), in order to account for specie-specific effects, on neighboring vegetation (tree and pasture). Pasture and tree rooting profile, soil resources availability (water and nutrients), tree and pasture production, tree physiological status and tree regeneration were assessed with and without the presence of shrubs. The {{results showed that the}} presence of shrubs deeply modify tree and pasture root systems. Trees growing either with Cistus or Retama exhibited a significantly deeper rooting profile than growing without competition, whereas herbaceous species showed the opposite trend, shifting most of their roots upwards to shallower soil horizons. Cistus appeared to be a great competitor for soil resources, what led to significantly lower tree leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange parameters, acorn production and growth. Cistus encroachment also reduced <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> by 68 to 98 %. Retama ameliorated top soil fertility and showed positive effect on soil moisture. Retama increased significantly <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> by 11 to 157 % and tree growth by 6 to 13 %, but had a neutral to negative effect on acorn yield. Both shrubs showed a similar positive effect on tree seedling emergence in spring and survivorship after summer. However, as seedling aged, this positive association strengthened with Retama and weakened over time with Cistus. To sum up, shrubs have the potential to modify the functioning and persistence of Mediterranean open oak woodlands. Thus, future management practices must bear in mind this specificity of effects and try to optimize the positive effect of shrubs without jeopardizing the productivity or functioning of the system...|$|E
40|$|Pasture {{degradation}} {{caused by}} overgrazing and inappropriate fertiliser management {{is a major}} production and environmental threat in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Previous {{research has focused on}} the effects of mixed nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser and reduced grazing pressure on the plant community of the grassland; however, the role of P and how it interacts with various defoliation (the process of the complete or partial removal of the above-ground parts of plants by grazing or cutting) intensities on the plant and soil of the grassland ecosystem have not been quantified. A field experiment was conducted to quantify how P application in combination of defoliation pressure could impact the dynamic change of the plant and soil in a native alpine grassland ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, from May 2012 to September 2014. A split-plot design with 4 replicates and repeated measures was used to determine the growth and composition of plant community and soil physical and chemical properties under various levels of P fertiliser and defoliation intensity. The results showed that applying 20 kg P/ha increased the herbage yield of Melissitus ruthenica by 68 % and total <b>pasture</b> <b>yield</b> by 25 %. Close defoliation favoured the growth and plant frequency of the shorter species, whereas lax defoliation favoured that of the taller plant species. Medium P rate and cutting to 3 cm above ground gave an overall best outcome in <b>pasture</b> <b>yield,</b> quality and frequency and soil moisture and nutrient concentration. Application of P fertiliser with a moderate defoliation pressure to promote legume growth and N fixation has the potential to achieve multiple benefits in increasing pasture and livestock production and improving environmental sustainability in the alpine pasture of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a fragile and P-deficient ecosystem zone in China and its western neighbouring countries...|$|E

30|$|CC {{impacts on}} {{mountain}} agriculture in Austria {{are expected to}} be quite ambivalent. On the one hand, mountain regions are among the most vulnerable regions worldwide and agriculture is heavily exposed to climatic conditions and climatic change due to its mode of production (Behringer et al. 2000). Climate variations affect crop yields and lead to changes in food prices (Rosenzweig and Perry 1994), so that several adaptation options could be identified, such as irrigation or changing cropping practices, patterns, and planting dates (IPCC 2014). This might result in the assumption that mountain agriculture is very vulnerable and there is a high demand for adaptation. On the other hand, mountain regions in Austria are often seen as a “winner” of climate change. A general raise in crop and <b>pasture</b> <b>yields</b> is predicted for mid- to high-latitude regions in case of moderate warming (IPCC 2014). Mitter et al. (2014) predict a strong growth in productivity of grasslands, which is the main land use type in Tyrol until the middle of the twentyfirst century. Observations show that the temperature rise from nineteenth century {{until the end of the}} twentieth century in the Austrian Alps was about twice as large as the northern-hemispheric average (Auer et al. 2007). However, climate change effects include direct and indirect effects that go beyond increases of temperature and CO 2 concentration, which are mainly considered as responsible for the productivity growth.|$|R
