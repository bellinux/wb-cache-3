Formative assessments are planned in accordance with specific outcomes, which {{make it easier for}} teachers to group students. Groups may change frequently and are not static groups for the entire school year. Student groups change throughout the year based on assessed performance and not on teacher <b>perceived</b> <b>ability.</b> Each group has a purpose and the teacher plans instructional lessons based on the common needs of the group.

25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the difference between the hot-hand and gambler's fallacy. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome. Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a craps table or spinning the roulette wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue. There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's <b>perceived</b> <b>ability</b> to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the illusion of control.|$|E
40|$|The {{three studies}} in this {{dissertation}} {{contribute to our}} understanding of leadership development by examining <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> among underserved adolescents and emerging adults. Study 1 and 2 utilized data from the Flint Adolescent Study, which followed participants from high school into adulthood. Participants in the sample were predominantly African American and all demonstrated low academic performance. Study 1 considered the influence of context on <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> by examining changes in <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> during the developmental period known as emerging adulthood. Findings demonstrated that <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> declined between the ages of 18 and 22, with the largest declines occurring among emerging adults who did not attend four year colleges. These findings suggest that <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> is malleable and responds to contextual factors, such as limited access to leadership roles during emerging adulthood. Study 2 explored the relationship between adolescent leadership and adult thriving. Findings demonstrated that adolescents’ <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> predicted leadership roles in later adolescence, which predicted adult mental health and community participation. Adolescent <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> also directly predicted adult community participation. These findings suggest that <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability,</b> in addition to leadership roles, provides a useful indicator of adolescent thriving among underserved youth. Study 3 utilized data collected as part of the program evaluation of Badges for Baseball, a juvenile crime prevention program for middle school-aged youth, and sought to identify predictors and mechanisms by which <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> develops among adolescents. The study focused on the role of interpersonal skills in promoting <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability.</b> Findings revealed that adolescents’ empathy and social competence were unrelated and they contributed to <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> in different ways. The effects of empathy on <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> were mediated by community participation and peer support, whereas social competence was directly related to <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability.</b>  These findings suggest that different profiles may exist among youth with high <b>perceived</b> leadership <b>ability</b> and raises questions about how their leadership behaviors may differ. Together, these studies contribute {{to our understanding of}} leadership development among underserved adolescents and emerging adults and offer implications for practice to support their leadership development...|$|R

25|$|After {{defeating}} the Red Stick Creeks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, {{there was a}} migration of refugees to Spanish West Florida. The presence of the Creek refugees had motivated British Captain George Woodbine of the Royal Marines to travel to Pensacola in July 1814.

40|$|Through {{a set of}} four papers this {{dissertation}} {{is aimed}} at understanding the role of subjective ability judgment {{in the form of}} <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> in influencing the decision to initiate entrepreneurial activities. Recent studies suggest that the decision to initiate entrepreneurial activities could be influenced by subjective ability judgment i. e. positive perceptions of one´s entrepreneurial ability. This dissertation extends this steam of research by comparing <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> with actual ability and examines the role of these two ability dimensions in influencing {{the quality and quantity of}} entrepreneurial activities. In this dissertation entrepreneurial ability is defined as the cognitive and non-cognitive abilities necessary to undertake and pursue the tasks of new venture creation and management while <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> is an individual´s subjective judgment about his/her own entrepreneurial ability. The main premise of this dissertation is that <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> is an important determinant of entrepreneurial behavior. Secondly, the impact of <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> is higher than actual ability in the decision to initiate entrepreneurial activities leading to increase in the quantity of entrepreneurial initiatives. Thirdly, individuals with high actual ability are more likely to initiate entrepreneurial activities when they develop positive perceptions about their entrepreneurial ability. Fourthly, the interaction effect of high actual <b>ability</b> and <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> is positive and influences both the decision to initiate entrepreneurial activities and the choice of innovative entrepreneurship. This implies that <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> in conjunction with high actual ability is a source of quality entrepreneurship. To test the above premises this dissertation uses a large statistical sample with consistent definitions and concepts across multiple contexts. Overall the results of this dissertation support the contention that <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> have a distinct and significantly positive influence on the decision to initiate t entrepreneurial activities and its impact is greater than actual ability. Furthermore, the joint effect of <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> and high actual ability not only influences entrepreneurial action but also leads to innovative form of entrepreneurship...|$|R

They were social animals willing, even eager, to join forces with another animal to merge their sense of group with the others' sense and create an expanded super-group that was beneficial to both in multiple ways. They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{hypotheses}} derived from Jones and Berglas's (1978) self-handicapping model. It was hypothesized that individuals using many self-handicaps would use more internal attributions and report greater gains in <b>perceived</b> judo <b>ability</b> following success than individuals using few self-handicaps. In addition, it was hypothesized that individuals using many self-handicaps would use more external attributions and report less reduction in <b>perceived</b> judo <b>ability</b> following failure. Fifty-three judo players completed measures of trait self-handicapping, situational self-handicapping and a measure of <b>perceived</b> judo <b>ability</b> before competition. Following competition, the participants completed the Causal Dimension Scale II and the measure of <b>perceived</b> judo <b>ability</b> for a second time. Analyses of variance revealed that high self-handicappers attributed failure to more external factors than low self-handicappers. It was also found that high self-handicappers reported less of a reduction in <b>perceived</b> judo <b>ability</b> following failure than low self-handicappers. The findings therefore provide support for the potential short-term benefits of self-handicapping in sport, although further research is required to examine the long-term implications of using self-handicaps...|$|R

Aim and Objectives:(1) To assess the influence of occlusal support and <b>perceived</b> chewing <b>ability</b> on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among adults attending a private dental institution in Mangalore. (2) To evaluate occlusal support using Eichner index (EI), <b>perceived</b> chewing <b>ability</b> using a self-administered questionnaire and OHRQoL using Oral Health Impact Profile- 14 (OHIP- 14). Materials and Methods: Overall, 300 adults attending a private dental institution in Mangalore were included. EI was used to group participants into three groups. The chewing ability was assessed using a questionnaire on perceived difficulty while chewing eight common foods. OHRQoL was measured employing OHIP- 14. Perceived general and oral health status and demographic information were collected. Results: The mean <b>perceived</b> chewing <b>ability</b> score was 12. 98 ± 6. 2 and the mean total OHIP score was 9. 23 ± 8. 9. EI showed a significant relation with <b>perceived</b> chewing <b>ability,</b> OHIP, and <b>perceived</b> general health status (P < 0. 05). <b>Perceived</b> chewing <b>ability</b> and OHIP demonstrated a significant correlation (r = 0. 31, P< 0. 001).

30|$|Understanding the {{antecedents of}} <b>perceived</b> {{entrepreneurial}} <b>ability</b> is important {{as it can}} lead to the source of an important cognitive attribute that has a significantly positive influence on nascent entrepreneurial activity (Arenius and Minniti, 2005; Townsend et al. 2010; Clercq et al. 2011; Bayon et al., 2015). Moreover, although <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> is similar to entrepreneurial self-efficacy there is an important difference. Unlike <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability,</b> entrepreneurial self-efficacy is an indication of two different and distinct ability beliefs – the first is specific or task related confidence, for instance, the ability to perform the various tasks related to new venture creation and the other is the confidence that such task-related abilities would lead to a successful outcome, for instance, successful creation of a new venture (Wood and Bandera, 1989; McGee et al. 2009). Townsend et al. (2010) has shown that task related perceptions such as <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> can exist independently of goal attainment beliefs (Townsend et al. 2010). If so, and together with the finding that <b>perceived</b> entrepreneurial <b>ability</b> influences nascent entrepreneurial activity it is necessary to identify the root cause of an important antecedent of nascent entrepreneurial activity (Grégoire et al. 2011).|$|R
