5|$|When Governor Isaac Shelby {{announced}} he would not seek reelection, Garrard's friends encouraged {{him to become a}} candidate. The other announced candidates were Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Logan was considered the favorite in the race due to his military heroism while helping settle the Kentucky frontier. However, his oratory was unpolished, and his parliamentary skills were weak, despite his considerable <b>political</b> <b>experience.</b> Todd, who had served as secretary of all ten Kentucky statehood conventions, had the most <b>political</b> <b>experience,</b> but his youth was considered a disadvantage by some. Garrard benefited from his political connections in Bourbon County, and many held him in high regard due to his work in the Baptist church.|$|E
5|$|Earp and Behan both {{applied to}} fill the new {{position}} of Cochise County sheriff, which like the Pima County sheriff job, paid the office holder 10% of the fees and taxes collected.

However, Behan had greater <b>political</b> <b>experience</b> and influence in Prescott.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} self-regulation strategies and youth civic and <b>political</b> <b>experiences,</b> assuming that out-of-school learning can foster metacognition. The study {{is based on a}} sample of 732 Portuguese students from grades 8 and 11. Results show that the quality of civic and <b>political</b> participation <b>experiences,</b> together with academic self-efficacy, are significant predictors of young people’s self-regulation, particularly regarding cognitive and metacognitive strategies (elaboration and critical thinking). Such effects surpass even the weight of family cultural and school variables, such as the sense of school belonging. There-fore, we argue that the pedagogical value of non-formal civic and <b>political</b> <b>experiences</b> is re-lated to learning in formal pedagogical contexts. This is because civic and political participa-tion with high developmental quality can stimulate higher-order cognitive engagement and, thus, {{contribute to the development of}} learning strategies that promote academic success...|$|R

5|$|Black {{was chosen}} as the Democratic nominee for {{lieutenant}} governor in 1915, despite having only meager previous <b>political</b> <b>experience.</b> He was elected on a ticket with Augustus O. Stanley and was elevated to governor when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. Much of his seven months as governor were spent on his re-election campaign. He was unable to satisfactorily answer charges of corruption made against the Stanley administration by his opponent, Edwin P. Morrow. Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes. Black returned to his legal practice in Barbourville and served as president of a bank founded by his older brother. He was campaign manager for Alben Barkley's senatorial campaign when he died of pneumonia on August 5, 1938.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{resigned}} from the sheriff's office on November 9, 1880, and Shibell immediately appointed Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County. Democrat Johnny Behan had considerably more <b>political</b> <b>experience</b> than Republican Wyatt Earp. Behan had previously served as Yavapai County sheriff from 1871 to 1873. He had been elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature twice, representing Yavapai Country in the 7th Territorial Legislature in 1873 and Mohave County in the 10th in 1879. Behan moved for a time to the northwest Arizona Territory, where he served as the Mohave County recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of Mohave County at Gillet, in 1879.|$|E

5|$|Madison's <b>political</b> <b>experience</b> before {{becoming}} governor {{consisted of a}} twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he run for governor in 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped out early due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, {{he became the first}} Kentucky governor to die in office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office.|$|E

5|$|The main Whig contenders in 1848 were Clay again, and two {{war hero}} generals with little <b>political</b> <b>experience,</b> Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor. Seward {{supported}} the nominee, General Taylor. The former governor was less {{enthusiastic about the}} vice-presidential candidate, New York Comptroller Millard Fillmore, a rival of his from Buffalo. Nevertheless, he campaigned widely for the Whigs against the Democratic presidential candidate, former Michigan senator Lewis Cass.

The Taylor/Fillmore ticket was elected, and the split in the New York Democratic Party allowed the Whigs to capture the legislature.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great achievement for a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and a founding member of his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating position of having to submit to a cabinet composed of men with less <b>political</b> <b>experience,</b> such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith {{had prior}} <b>political</b> <b>experience,</b> having been elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in France {{as part of}} the Eurosceptic Movement for France {{coalition}} in June 1994. Although his father had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain's Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by Margaret Thatcher, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it could draw on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party's formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of £800 million, and promised to put £20 million into the party. He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to the same extent as the country's larger political parties. Goldsmith's intervention in British politics has been compared to that of the multi-millionaires Ross Perot in the United States and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy.|$|E

His brother Joseph was, at the time, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and another brother, James, had served in the Kentucky Senate.

5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have <b>political</b> <b>experience.</b> Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E

Since the end of the war, he had worked as an independent right-wing political editor and public speaker.

Although this duality is inherent to the migration process, researchers typically separate the study of emigration from that of immigration.

We find that immigrants’ home country social ties yield modest political consequences, whereas the more important influences sustaining connections to homeland polities stem from premigration <b>political</b> <b>experiences.</b> Both cross-border social ties and premigration <b>political</b> <b>experiences</b> reinforce homeland national identities. Furthermore, the acquisition of U.
