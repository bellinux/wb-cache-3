At first, conservative forces, which favored conciliation with the Bakufu {{in order to secure}} the domain, were dominant in Chōshū politics, and Takasugi and some of his compatriots had to leave the domain to avoid renewed imprisonment. Takasugi, with only about a dozen followers, including future political leaders Yamagata Aritomo, Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru, gathered in Kokura in Kyūshū and prepared an attack on the conservative forces in Chōshū. The subsequent Chōshū civil war began on 13 January 1865.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{set out to}} turn Taiwan into a Dutch colony. The {{first order}} of {{business}} was to punish villages that had violently opposed the Dutch and unite the aborigines in allegiance with the VOC. The first punitive expedition was against the villages of Baccloan and Mattauw, north of Saccam near Tayowan. The Mattauw campaign had been easier than expected and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign also served as a threat to other villages from Tirossen (modern Chiayi) to Lonkjiaow (Hengchun). The 1636 <b>punitive</b> <b>attack</b> on Lamay Island in response to the killing of the shipwrecked crews of the Beverwijck and the Golden Lion ended ten years later with the entire aboriginal population of 1100 removed from the island including 327 Lamayans killed in a cave, having been trapped there by the Dutch and suffocated in the fumes and smoke pumped into the cave by the Dutch and their allied aborigines from Saccam, Soulang and Pangsoya. The men were forced into slavery in Batavia (Java) and the women and children became servants and wives for the Dutch officers. The events on Lamay changed the course of Dutch rule to work closer with allied aborigines, though there remained plans to depopulate the outlying islands.|$|E
25|$|In 1415, {{the fleet}} made {{a stop at}} {{northern}} Sumatra during the journey homeward from Hormuz. They would engage Sekandar at this point of the voyage. Sekandar had earlier usurped the Semudera throne from Zain al-'Abidin, but the Chinese had formally recognized the latter as the King of Semudera. Even though Sekandar was an autonomous ruler in his own right, he was not recognized by the Chinese. Admiral Zheng He had orders to launch a <b>punitive</b> <b>attack</b> against the usurper and restore Zain al-'Abidin as the rightful king. In retaliation to the situation, Sekandar led his forces to attack the Ming forces, but Admiral Zheng He and his troops disembarked from their ships and captured Sekandar. They had pursued Sekandar's forces to Lambri where they caught Sekandar, his wife, and his child. King Zain al-'Abidin later dispatched a tribute mission to express his gratefulness. This conflict reaffirmed Chinese power over the foreign states and the maritime route by protecting the local political authority that sheltered the trade. Sekandar {{was presented to the}} Yongle Emperor at the palace gate and later executed. It is not known when this execution happened, but Ma Huan stated that Sekandar was publicly executed in the capital after the fleet returned.|$|E

For their loyalty, the Tang emperor conferred imperial titles on the Turgesh khagan Suluk and awarded him the city of Suyab in return for his loyalty.

2500|$|In 1865, Maitland Brown {{was again}} {{part of an}} {{expedition}} to the north. [...] The year before, three explorers, Frederick Panter, James Harding and William Goldwyer, had set out from Roebuck Bay to explore the area around La Grange Bay. [...] The Panter-Harding-Goldwyer expedition had failed to return, and it was widely speculated {{that they had been}} speared by natives. [...] When the Government learned of the missing men, it organised a search expedition. [...] Maitland Brown offered his services and was appointed leader of the expedition. [...] The La Grange expedition left Fremantle in February 1865, and on 3 April it found the missing men dead. [...] They had been speared and clubbed to death by natives, at least two of them in their sleep. [...] Shortly after the discovery of the dead men, the expedition party engaged in a pitched battle with a tribe of natives. [...] Between six and twenty natives were killed, with no injuries to the expedition party. [...] Brown's journal states that the party had walked into an ambush, but most latter-day historians have interpreted the event as a <b>punitive</b> <b>attack</b> on the natives by Brown's party.|$|E
2500|$|Mehmed II {{abandoned}} his siege of Corinth {{to launch a}} <b>punitive</b> <b>attack</b> against Vlad III in Wallachia but suffered many casualties in a surprise night attack led by Vlad III Dracula, who was apparently bent on personally killing the Sultan. It is said that when the forces of Mehmed the Conqueror and Radu the Handsome came to Târgoviste, they saw so many Turks impaled around the city that, appalled by the sight, Mehmed considered withdrawing but was convinced by his commanders to stay. However, Vlad's policy of staunch resistance against the Ottomans was not a popular one, and he was betrayed by the boyars's (local aristocracy) appeasing faction, most of them also pro-Dăneşti (a rival princely branch). His best friend and ally Stephen III of Moldavia, who had promised to help him, seized the chance and instead attacked him trying {{to take back the}} fortress of Chilia [...] Vlad III had to retreat to the mountains. After this, the Ottomans captured the Wallachian capital Târgoviște and Mehmed II withdrew, having left Radu as ruler of Wallachia. Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey, who served with distinction and wiped out a force 6,000 Wallachians and deposited 2,000 of their heads at the feet of Mehmed II, was also reinstated, as a reward, in his old gubernatorial post in Thessaly. Vlad eventually escaped to Hungary, where he was imprisoned on a false accusation of treason against his overlord, Matthias Corvinus.|$|E
6000|$|The third {{peculiarity}} of {{aerial warfare}} {{was that it}} was at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive. It had this unique feature, that both sides lay open to <b>punitive</b> <b>attack.</b> In all previous forms of war, both by land and sea, the losing side was speedily unable to raid its antagonist's territory and the communications. One fought on a [...] "front," [...] and behind that front the winner's supplies and resources, his towns and factories and capital, the peace of his country, were secure. If the war was a naval one, you destroyed your enemy's battle fleet and then blockaded his ports, secured his coaling stations, and hunted down any stray cruisers that threatened your ports of commerce. But to blockade and watch a coastline is one thing, to blockade and watch the whole surface of a country is another, and cruisers and privateers are things that take long to make, that cannot be packed up and hidden and carried unostentatiously from point to point. In aerial war the stronger side, even supposing it destroyed the main battle fleet of the weaker, had then either to patrol and watch or destroy every possible point at which he might produce another and perhaps a novel and more deadly form of flyer. It meant darkening his air with airships. It meant building them by the thousand and making aeronauts by the hundred thousand. A small uninitated airship could be hidden in a railway shed, in a village street, in a wood; a flying machine is even less conspicuous.|$|E

In the same year, a Sui warship happened to run aground on Jeju Island, which was ruled by the Baekje dependency of Tamna. Wideok provided the crew with an official escort (bearing tribute and congratulations) to the Chinese court. In 598 he sent an embassy offering {{to assist in the}} Sui expedition against Goguryeo that year. The expedition, however, had already been completed.

Along the Amazon river and its major tributaries, repeated slaving raids and <b>punitive</b> <b>attacks</b> left their mark. One French traveler in the 1740s described hundreds of miles of river banks with no sign of human life and once-thriving villages that were devastated and empty. In some areas of the Amazon Basin, and particularly among the Guarani of southern Brazil and Paraguay, the Jesuits had organized their Jesuit Reductions along military lines to fight the slavers. In the mid-to-late 19th century, many Amerindians were enslaved to work on rubber plantations.|$|R
