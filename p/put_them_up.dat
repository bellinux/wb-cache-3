5|$|Pittsburgh {{took their}} first {{lead of the}} game on their first drive of the second half, after Reed's second field goal <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> by three points. On the ensuing kickoff the Steelers {{recovered}} a Patriots' fumble and Roethlisberger connected with Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown pass. James Harrison forced his first of two fumbles on the Patriots' next drive and the Steelers recovered as Reed added his third field goal of the game—putting the Steelers up 23–10. Gary Russell scored a touchdown after Lawrence Timmons returned an interception 89yards to the Patriots' one-yard line.|$|E
25|$|The Rockies got on {{the board}} in the second when Garrett Atkins doubled with one out off Beckett and scored on Troy Tulowitzki's double one out later, but the Red Sox got that run back off of Francis when Youkilis walked with two outs and scored on Ortiz's double. In the fourth, the Red Sox loaded the bases with two outs on a single, double, and {{intentional}} walk when Varitek's two-run double <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 6-1.|$|E
25|$|The Seminoles {{started off}} {{sluggish}} against the Gators, scoring only three {{points in the}} first quarter. The offense was more productive in the second quarter, scoring their first touchdown of the game when Jameis Winston completed a 45-yd pass to Kelvin Benjamin to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> by ten. Just before the half, Winston completed a 29-yd pass to Kelvin Benjamin for a touchdown to give the Noles a seventeen-point lead at halftime. Despite the offensive struggles, the defense held the Gators scoreless in the first half.|$|E

25|$|The rest of {{the half}} was a tight affair, with England edging in front from {{applying}} pressure and Jonny Wilkinson's boot <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to a 9–5 lead after Australian indiscipline gave away several penalties, but were unable to capitalise on their territory. Towards {{the end of the}} first half, England stretched their lead further. Lawrence Dallaglio made a break and popped the ball inside to Jonny Wilkinson, who drew the defence before putting Robinson away in the corner for a try. The conversion was missed, but England went in at half time leading by 14–5.|$|E
25|$|Still the Saints {{were just}} {{trailing}} 10-3 {{near the end}} of the third quarter, and had a great chance to tie the game when defensive tackle Renaldo Turnbull blocked Butler's 45-yard field goal attempt. New Orleans defensive end Vince Buck recovered the ball and returned it 62 yards for a potential touchdown, only to see the play wiped out by an offsides penalty on teammate Robert Massey, who had lined up with his hand over the neutral zone. The penalty not only eliminated the score, but it also gave Chicago a first down, and seven plays later, Butler kicked a 25-yard field goal to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 13-3.|$|E
25|$|Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham {{got off to}} a rough {{start as}} he lost three first half {{turnovers}} that would be converted into nine New York points. After each team punted to start the game, Cunningham lost a fumble that was recovered by defensive tackle Bernard Holsey on the Vikings 23. New York ended up losing yardage with their ensuing drive, but Brad Daluiso kicked a 43-yard field goal to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 3-0. Cunningham fumbled again on his next drive, and New York lineman Michael Strahan recovered the ball on the Minnesota 46-yard line. Quarterback Danny Kanell subsequently completed a 27-yard pass to running back Charles Way, setting up Daluiso's second field goal that made the score 6-0.|$|E

25|$|Houston responded {{on their}} next drive, moving the ball 96 {{yards to the}} Steelers 3-yard line, but could go no further and settled for a 26-yard Zendejas field goal. Then McDowell {{recovered}} a fumble from Worley on the Pittsburgh 41. From there the Oilers advanced to the 17-yard line, but when faced with fourth and 1 they decided to settle for another Zendejas field goal, cutting the score to 7–6. Pittsburgh struck back with a drive to the Oilers 9, featured a 49-yard run by Merril Hoge. However, they also ended up facing fourth and 1, and would settle for an Anderson field goal to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 10–6 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|The {{field goal}} battle {{continued}} in the third quarter, with Zendejas kicking one more and Anderson adding another two, making the score 16–9 {{at the start of}} the fourth quarter. But quarterback Warren Moon finally got his team to the end zone with a 10-play, 80-yard drive to score on his 18-yard touchdown pass to Ernest Givins that tied the game. Following a Pittsburgh three-and-out, Harry Newsome's punt went just 25 yards to the Steelers 38-yard line. From there it took just five plays for Houston to take their first lead of the game, scoring on Moon's 9-yard pass touchdown pass to Givins that <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 23–16 with 5:16 left in regulation. Starting from their own 18 after the kickoff, Pittsburgh drove 82 yards, featuring a 22-yard run by receiver Dwight Stone (the only time he touched the ball all game) on a reverse play, to score on Hoge's 2-yard touchdown run with 46 seconds left, tying the game and sending it into overtime.|$|E
25|$|Baylor {{controlled}} {{the ball for}} most of the first half, gaining a total of 166 yards. However, it was a pair of touchdown runs by Oklahoma's Chris Brown, both in the second quarter, that put the Sooners up 14–7 at halftime. Baylor's points came during a drive that started on their own 41-yard line and included a 43-yard pass that put them in the red zone. In the second half, Oklahoma's offense failed to capitalize in the red zone on several occasions. The Oklahoma offense progressed to inside the Baylor 20-yard line four times but was forced to settle for a field goal each time. Oklahoma's kicker Jimmy Stevens was 4-for-4, making field goals of 35, 25, 21, and 24 yards. Oklahoma did not score a touchdown in the second half until within the five-minute mark to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 33–7. Baylor went three-and-out in their next possession and Oklahoma ran out the clock to end the game.|$|E

25|$|Philadelphia {{scored on}} the opening drive of the game, holding the ball for seven minutes {{on the way to}} a 32-yard field goal by kicker Roger Ruzek, but then Dallas scored 34 {{consecutive}} points. Kelvin Martin returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards to the Eagles 46, sparking a 10-play drive that ended on Troy Aikman's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Derek Tennell, who had been signed by the team as a free agent only a week before this game. After the next three drives from each team ended in punts, Aikman completed a 41-yard pass to Alvin Harper on the Philadelphia 14-yard line with 1:04 left in the half. Following an 8-yard scramble by Aikman, he finished the 67-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jay Novacek. Then Cowboys defensive back Darren Woodson forced a fumble from Vai Sikahema on the following kickoff, which Thomas Everett recovered for Dallas on the Eagles 29. This enabled Lin Elliott to kick a 20-yard field goal before halftime that <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 17-3.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, the Mets {{loaded the}} bases on a hit-by-pitch and two walks off of Shawn Estes when Timo Perez's two-run single <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> 2–0. The Giants cut it to 2–1 {{in the bottom}} of the inning when Jeff Kent hit a leadoff single and scored on Ellis Burks's double. Behind strong {{pitching}} from Al Leiter and a two-out two-run home run from Edgardo Alfonzo in the top of the ninth inning off of Felix Rodriguez, the Mets carried a 4–1 lead into the last of the ninth. However, following a double by Barry Bonds and a single from Jeff Kent, pinch hitter J. T. Snow hit a towering three-run home run off of Mets reliever Armando Benítez to tie the game at four. The Mets would bounce back in the tenth inning, with Rookie Jay Payton singling home Darryl Hamilton, who doubled with two outs, off of Rodriguez. The Giants would threaten again, and had the tying run on with two out and Bonds at the plate, but John Franco struck out Bonds looking on a wicked 3–2 changeup, giving the Mets a heart-stopping 5–4 victory and a 1–1 series moving to New York.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} Dutch-speaking white farmers {{trekking}} {{away from the}} Cape was {{the abolition of slavery}} by the British government on Emancipation Day, 1 December 1838. The farmers complained they could not replace the labour of their slaves without losing an excessive amount of money. The farmers had invested large amounts of capital in slaves. Owners who had purchased slaves on credit or <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> as surety against loans faced financial ruin. Britain had allocated the sum of 1 200 000 British Pounds as compensation to the Dutch settlers, on condition the Dutch farmers had to lodge their claims in Britain as well as the fact that the value of the slaves was many times the allocated amount. This caused further dissatisfaction among the Dutch settlers. The settlers, incorrectly, believed that the Cape Colony administration had taken the money due to them as payment for freeing their slaves. Those settlers who were allocated money could only claim it in Britain in person or through an agent. The commission charged by agents was the same as the payment for one slave, thus those settlers only claiming for one slave would receive nothing.|$|E

25|$|The Colts {{came into}} Week 15 of the NFL season still undefeated, and this week's game {{featured}} the Colts playing the San Diego Chargers at home. San Diego started {{the game with}} 4 scores in the first 3 quarters of the game, before the Colts could even score. By the time the Colts finally put some points on the scoreboard, they were down 16–0 to the Chargers. Marty Schottenheimer and the Chargers {{were in the middle}} of a playoff hunt, and they were not going to go down easy. But after San Diego jumped out to a 16-point lead, the Colts came back in the third quarter with three scores of their own, to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> by one point at the beginning of the fourth quarter, 17–16. However, they were not able to score the rest of the game, and the Chargers scored twice in the fourth quarter, once on a field goal and another on an 83-yard touchdown run by RB Michael Turner. The loss to the Chargers was the first loss of the season for the Colts, but the last team to go 13–0, the 1998 Denver Broncos, lost their 14th and 15th games, before winning their last game of the season, and they went on to win Super Bowl XXXIII. The Colts had history in their favor, but Peyton Manning did not want to lose any more games during the 2005 season.|$|E
