5000|$|Zoom climbs {{have been}} used to test new {{aircraft}} designs and conduct research in different flight regimes. During the <b>proving</b> <b>phase</b> of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, on December 6, 1959, an early version of the aircraft (the XF4H-1) performed a zoom climb to a world record 98,557 feet (30,040 m) as part of Operation [...] "Top Flight". The previous record of 94,658 feet (28,852 m) was set by a Soviet Sukhoi T-43-1 prototype. Commander Lawrence E. Flint Jr. accelerated his aircraft to Mach 2.5 at 47,000 feet (14,330 m) and climbed to 90,000 feet (27,430 m) at a 45-degree angle. He then shut down the engines and glided to the peak altitude. As the aircraft fell through 70,000 feet (21,300 m), Flint restarted the engines and resumed normal flight.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Chessboard {{estimates}} {{are one of}} the standard tools for <b>proving</b> <b>phase</b> coexistence in spin systems of physical interest. In this note we show that the method not only produces a point in the phase diagram where more than one Gibbs states coexist, but that it {{can also be used to}} rule out the existence of shift-ergodic states that differ significantly from those proved to exist. For models depending on a parameter (say, the temperature), this shows that the values of the conjugate thermodynamic quantity (the energy) inside the “transitional gap ” are forbidden in all shift-ergodic Gibbs states. We point out several models where our result provides useful additional information concerning the set of possible thermodynamic equilibria. 1...|$|E

40|$|Reflection {{positivity}} (RP) is {{a property}} of Gibbs measures exhibited by {{a class of}} lattice spin systems that include the Ising, Potts and Heisenberg models. The RP property is useful because of its two basic consequences: infrared bound and chessboard estimates.

40|$|The {{model of}} the "maintaining {{dragging}} scheme" seems appropriate for describing the processes of conjecture-generation when MD is used, providing evidence to a correlation between {{the introduction of the}} dragging schemes, and MD in particular, and a specific new (with respect to those in literature) cognitive process described by the model. We have referred to such process as a form of instrumented abduction, a new notion that we hope can be generalized to other contexts in which abduction is supported by another instrument. We seem to have captured the key idea which may lead to complete appropriation of the MDS,and described how it resides at a meta-level with respect to each specific exploration in whichMD is exploited as an instrument for conjecture-generation. We described how for expert solvers the MDS might be transformed into a way of thinking. In this sense it may lead to the construction of fruitful “mathematical habits of mind” (Cuoco, 2008) that may be in various mathematical explorations leading to the generation of conjectures. When such way of thinking is developed, the abductive reasoning has the advantage of involving geometrical concepts, like in the case of Francesco and Gianni. The geometrical concepts that emerge in this case can become “bridging elements” with respect to the <b>proving</b> <b>phase,</b> since they can be re-elaborated into the deductive steps of a proof. On the other hand, expert use of the MDS supported byMD seems to lead to conjectures in which no geometrical elements arise to “bridge the gap” between the premise and the conclusion. In other words, although expert use of MD seems to offer the possibility of generating “powerful” conjectures that solvers might have trouble reaching without support of the dragging instrument (since the IOD which becomes the premise may be cognitively “quite distant” from the conclusion), generating conjectures “mechanically” through the MDS associated to the dragging instrument, may hinder the <b>proving</b> <b>phase</b> in which these “bridging elements” are essential...|$|E
40|$|The {{logic of}} {{discovering}} {{and that of}} justifying have been a permanent source of debate in mathematics, because of their different and apparently contradictory features within the processes of production of mathematical sentences. In fact, a fundamental unity appears {{as soon as one}} investigates deeply the phenomenology of conjecturing and proving using concrete examples. In this paper it is shown that abduction, in the sense of Peirce, is an essential unifying activity, ruling such phenomena. Abduction is the major ingredient in a theoretical model suitable for describing the tran-sition from the conjecturing to the <b>proving</b> <b>phase.</b> In the paper such a model is introduced and worked out to test Lakatos' machinery of proofs and refutations from a new point of view.

40|$|International audienceGroup {{encryption}} (GE) is {{the natural}} encryption analogue of group signatures in that it allows verifiably encrypting messages for some anonymous member of a group while providing evidence that the receiver is a properly certified group member. Should the need arise, an opening authority is capable of identifying the receiver of any ciphertext. As introduced by Kiayias, Tsiounis and Yung (Asiacrypt' 07), GE is motivated by applications {{in the context of}} oblivious retriever storage systems, anonymous third parties and hierarchical group signatures. This paper provides the first realization of group encryption under lattice assumptions. Our construction is proved secure in the standard model (assuming interaction in the <b>proving</b> <b>phase)</b> under the Learning-With-Errors (LWE) and Short-Integer-Solution (SIS) assumptions. As a crucial component of our system, we describe a new zero-knowledge argument system allowing to demonstrate that a given ciphertext is a valid encryption under some hidden but certified public key, which incurs to prove quadratic statements about LWE relations. Specifically, our protocol allows arguing knowledge of witnesses consisting of X ∈ Z m×n q, s ∈ Z n q and a small-norm e ∈ Z m which underlie a public vector b = X · s + e ∈ Z m q while simultaneously proving that the matrix X ∈ Z m×n q has been correctly certified.

We <b>prove</b> <b>phase</b> transitions in community detectability {{as a function of the}} external edge connection probability and the noisy edge presence probability under a general network model where two arbitrarily connected communities are interconnected by random external edges. Specifically, the community detection performance transitions from almost perfect detectability to low detectability as the inter-community edge connection probability exceeds some critical value. We derive upper and lower bounds on the critical value and show that the bounds are identical when the two communities have the same size. The phase transition results are validated using network simulations. Using the derived expressions for the phase transition threshold we propose a method for estimating this threshold from observed data. Comment: conference paper at IEEE ICASSP 201...|$|R
