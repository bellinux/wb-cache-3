25|$|The basic {{amplification}} {{system used}} in Nova and other high-power lasers of its era was limited {{in terms of}} power density and <b>pulse</b> <b>length.</b> One {{problem was that the}} amplifier glass responded over a period of time, not instantaneously, and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified. Another problem was that the high power densities led to the same sorts of self-focusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs, but at such a magnitude that even measures like spatial filtering would not be enough, in fact the power densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air.|$|E

30|$|Length {{constraint}} is {{the primary}} design criterion for OFDM pulse shapes. Since many use cases in the eMBB and URLLC context require short processing latency and stringent timing for framed transmission, short <b>pulse</b> <b>lengths</b> comparable to one OFDM symbol duration (i.e., K≃ 1) are favorable here. In other scenarios such as mMTC or NB-IOT, though, latency constraints may be relaxed, such that <b>pulse</b> <b>lengths</b> of several symbols (K≥ 2) can be allowed if they provide clear benefits {{addressing the needs of}} the corresponding service.|$|R
2500|$|FROG and {{autocorrelation}} {{share the}} idea of combining a pulse with itself in a nonlinear medium. [...] Since a nonlinear medium will only produce the desired signal when both pulses are present {{at the same time}} (i.e. “optical gating”), varying the delay between the pulse copies and measuring the signal at each delay gives a vague estimate of the <b>pulse</b> <b>length.</b> [...] Autocorrelators measure a pulse by measuring the intensity of the nonlinear signal field. [...] Estimating the <b>pulse</b> <b>length</b> requires assuming a pulse shape, and the phase of the pulse electric field cannot be measured at all. [...] FROG extends this idea by measuring the spectrum of the signal at each delay (hence “frequency-resolved”), instead of just the intensity. [...] This measurement creates a spectrogram of the pulse, which can be used to determine the complex electric field as a function of time or frequency as long as the nonlinearity of the medium is known.|$|E
2500|$|FROG is {{currently}} the standard technique for measuring ultrashort laser pulses, and also popular, replacing an older method called autocorrelation, which only gave a rough estimate for the <b>pulse</b> <b>length.</b> [...] FROG is simply a spectrally resolved autocorrelation, which allows {{the use of a}} phase-retrieval algorithm to retrieve the precise pulse intensity and phase vs. time. [...] It can measure both very simple and very complex ultrashort laser pulses, and it has measured the most complex pulse ever measured without the use of a reference pulse. [...] Simple versions of FROG exist (with the acronym, GRENOUILLE, the French word for FROG), utilizing only a few easily aligned optical components. [...] Both FROG and GRENOUILLE are in common use in research and industrial labs around the world.|$|E

50|$|A boundary-layer radar wind {{profiler}} can be configured {{to compute}} averaged wind profiles for periods {{ranging from a}} few minutes to an hour. Boundary-layer radar wind profilers are often configured to sample in more than one mode. For example, in a “low mode,” the pulse of energy transmitted by the profiler may be 60 m in length. The <b>pulse</b> <b>length</b> determines the depth of the column of air being sampled and thus the vertical resolution of the data. In a “high mode,” the <b>pulse</b> <b>length</b> is increased, usually to 100 m or greater. The longer <b>pulse</b> <b>length</b> means that more energy is being transmitted for each sample, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. Using a longer <b>pulse</b> <b>length</b> increases the depth of the sample volume and thus decreases the vertical resolution in the data. The greater energy output of the high mode increases the maximum altitude to which the radar wind profiler can sample, but at the expense of coarser vertical resolution and an increase in thealtitude at which the first winds are measured. When radar wind profilers are operated in multiple modes, the data are often combined into a single overlapping data set to simplify postprocessing and data validation procedures.|$|E

Addition of a magnetic shield intended to alter the magnetic field geometry below the cathode eliminated internal tube sparks.

Fluence levels were 5 - 15 J/cm 2; <b>pulse</b> <b>lengths</b> were 20 - 60 ms; spot size was 1 mm. Vascular lesions : 10 patients (5 small angiomas, 5 telangiectases). Fluences were 6 - 10 J/cm 2; <b>pulse</b> <b>lengths</b> were 10 - 50 ms; spot size was 2 mm. In all cases the areas surrounding the lesions were cooled. Pigmented lesions : 5 patients (5 keratoses). All the lesions were evaluated by dermatoscopy before the treatment. Fluence levels were 7 - 15 J/cm 2; <b>pulse</b> <b>lengths</b> were 20 - 50 ms; spot size was 1 mm.

40|$|X-ray free-electron lasers {{have enabled}} new {{approaches}} to the structural determination of protein crystals that are too small or radiation-sensitive for conventional analysis 1. For sufficiently short pulses, diffraction is collected before significant changes occur to the sample, {{and it has been}} predicted that pulses as short as 10 fs may be required to acquire atomic-resolution structural information 1 - 4. Here, we describe a mechanism unique to ultrafast, ultra-intense X-ray experiments that allows structural information to be collected from crystalline samples using high radiation doses without the requirement for the pulse to terminate before the onset of sample damage. Instead, the diffracted X-rays are gated by a rapid loss of crystalline periodicity, producing apparent <b>pulse</b> <b>lengths</b> significantly shorter than the duration of the incident pulse. The shortest apparent <b>pulse</b> <b>lengths</b> occur at the highest resolution, and our measurements indicate that current X-ray free-electron laser technology 5 should enable structural determination from submicrometre protein crystals with atomic resolution...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} {{tremendous}} progress {{in the field of}} ultrashort-pulse measurement.
