5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most effective way to achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia {{show that the}} intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E

5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised. In 1984 Salford City Council used a {{derelict}} land grant {{to purchase the}} docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company, rebranding the area as Salford Quays. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal's upper reaches had declined {{to such an extent}} that its owners considered closing it above Runcorn. In 1993 the Ship Canal Company was acquired by Peel Holdings; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the Port of Liverpool. The company announced a £50billion Atlantic Gateway plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester Ship Canal as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large distribution centre to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of containers transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.|$|E

25|$|Some {{observers}} <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English {{variant of}} Yeshivish may develop {{further to the}} point that it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, Ladino or Judeo-Arabic. The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to Middle High German, Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it did in the past.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal rolls are {{counter-rotating}} vortex rolls {{that are}} nearly {{aligned with the}} mean wind of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). They {{can be caused by}} convection {{in the presence of a}} moderate wind and/or dynamic inflection point instabilities in the mean wind profile. Early theory on the features <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vortices may be aligned up to 30° to the left for stably stratified environments, 18° to the left for neutral environments, and nearly parallel to the mean wind for unstably stratified (convective) environments. This theory has been supported by aircraft observations from several field experiments.|$|E

Decreases in sea-ice extent and thickness are expected to continue over the next century, with some models predicting the Arctic Ocean will be free of sea ice in late summer by the mid to late part of the century (IPCC 2007).|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century, {{there were}} three conquests and some Anglo-Saxon people would live through it: one in the {{aftermath}} of the conquest of Cnut in 1016; the second after the unsuccessful attempt of battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066; the third after that of William of Normandy in 1066. The consequences of each conquest can only be assessed with hindsight. In 1016, no-one was to know that whatever cultural ramifications were felt then, they would be subsumed half a century later; and in 1066 there was nothing to <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effects of William's conquest would be any greater or more lasting than those of Cnut's.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{experiments}} by Ernest Rutherford established that atoms {{consisted of a}} diffuse cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding a small, dense, positively charged nucleus. Given this experimental data, Rutherford naturally considered a planetary-model atom, the Rutherford model of 1911 – electrons orbiting a solar nucleus – however, said planetary-model atom has a technical difficulty. The laws of classical mechanics (i.e. the Larmor formula), <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> electron will release electromagnetic radiation while orbiting a nucleus. Because the electron would lose energy, it would rapidly spiral inwards, collapsing into the nucleus on a timescale of around 16 picoseconds. This atom model is disastrous, because it predicts that all atoms are unstable.|$|E
