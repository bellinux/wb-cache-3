40|$|AIMS [...] To {{establish}} a simple method of quantitative culture {{for determining the}} viable bacterial numbers present in expectorated sputum samples. METHODS [...] Sputum samples were homogenised with dithiothreitol, sterile saline or glass beads to determine which method recovered {{the greatest number of}} viable bacteria. Culture broths were also incubated with dithiothreitol and sampled over time to determine its effect on bacterial viability. Sputum samples homogenised with dithiothreitol were diluted in sterile saline and sampled using either standard bacteriological loops or a <b>precision</b> <b>pipette</b> to determine which method resulted in the least variation. RESULTS [...] Homogenisation of sputum using dithiothreitol increased the recovery of viable bacteria compared with sterile glass beads and/or saline, with no apparent effect on bacterial viability when incubated with culture broths. By inoculating agar plates with 10 (- 3), 10 (- 4) and 10 (- 5) dilutions of the homogenised sputum sample, all potential pathogens could easily be identified. A 10 microliter sample volume dispensed by <b>precision</b> <b>pipette</b> and spread with a "hockey stick" resulted in the least variation between plates (less than 16 %) and an even distribution of bacterial colonies. Numbers of viable bacteria recovered from different aliquots of individual sputum samples were generally of the same order of magnitude. CONCLUSIONS [...] This method represents a relatively quick and simple technique for accurately quantifying viable bacteria present in sputum samples. The use of a small portion appears to be representative of the sample as a whole...|$|E
30|$|Up to five {{different}} concentrations were tested; that is, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 1000 IJs per white grub, thus per 28  m 2 soil surface in a bioassay arena (Table 2). The 100 to 1000 IJ step in concentrations reflects a log 10 step, as {{commonly used in}} dose trials allowing a more linear response analyses. One-millilitre suspensions containing the required concentration of IJs were distributed across the soil surface of each arena using a <b>precision</b> <b>pipette.</b> No direct application onto an insect body was carried out. Water without nematodes was used on the untreated controls. The arenas {{were placed in the}} dark at 24 [*]±[*] 2  °C for 14  days.|$|E
40|$|Summary: We have {{assessed}} {{a compact}} Blood Ammonia Checker System (Ammonia Checker) {{consisting of a}} reflectometer which measures the intensity of colour formed by blood ammonia on a bromocresol green indicator reagent plate. The results show good correlation (r = 0. 95) with our routine chemical method and a regression line y = 0. 835 — 1. 468. The Ammonia Checker has good precision (CV < 10 %) at the critical blood ammonia concentration and accurately measures predetermined ammonia concentrations. Blood sam-pling is improved with a <b>precision</b> <b>pipette.</b> The Ammonia Checker is simple, convenient and reliable and is ideally suited for a laboratory required to perform an urgent blood ammonia measurement.

40|$|Fecha de presentación internacional: 25. 08. 2005. - Titular: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for measuring hydraulic conductivity, which {{is suitable for}} samples of branches ranging from a few millimetres in diameter to several centimetres and which can precisely measure low conductivities in up to five samples simultaneously. The inventive device is cheap, sturdy and easy to maintain since it is not made from sophisticated elements. The invention consists in using <b>precision</b> <b>pipettes</b> {{in order to measure}} volumes passed through samples. The pressure and, consequently, the flow of the perfusion solution can be adjusted by varying the height of the container. In addition, valves enable the solution to pass through the samples and the system to be emptied for cleaning. The invention also comprises a device which enables the perfusion to be stopped instantaneously, without the measurement being affected by undesired variations in the pressure. The inventive device further comprises a high-pressure perfusion system which can be used to eliminate embolism from the samples and, in this way, to measure the maximum hydraulic conductivity.

40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{potential}} risk of microfiltration between {{two different types}} of implant-abutment connections screwed at 45 Ncm: external and internal. For the first time the use of a mechanical artificial mouth is used with the values (compression and torsion loads with a frequency of 2 Hz) of the human chewing. The mechanical tests were performed with an artificial saliva at 37 degrees C. The microgap in the connection was measured by an Image Analysis software incorporated in a high resolution scanning electron microscopy. Implant connections were filled with methylene blue by using self-adjustable <b>precision</b> <b>pipettes</b> and the quantity of leakage was determined by high sensitivity spectometry. We showed that the internal connection has lower microgaps compared to the external ones and these microgaps increased with the number of mechanical cycles. The leakage of methylene blue was higher when the external connection was performed. Microgaps and the influence of the mechanical loads are very important for the long-term behavior avoiding the bacteria colonization in the dental implants. These aspects should be known by the implantologists. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R
40|$|Experimental dependences on {{the effect}} of the drop volume from the contact angle under the {{conditions}} of the static three-phase contact line formation during wetting the non-ferrous metals (aluminium, magnalium, copper and brass) are presented in the work. The surface of the substrates was investigated by modern equipment (profilometer "Micro Measure 3 D station" and microscope TM- 3000). The drop was placed on the surface by the <b>precision</b> electronic single-channel <b>pipette</b> (Thermo scientific). Shadow method was used to obtain the drop profile; symmetry of the drop was controlled by Schlieren method. The comparison of the methods used to determine the contact angle on the image of the drop profile was executed. It was established that in spite of influencing the friction and gravity forces the structure of metal surfaces affects greatly the value of the contact angle...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{suspensions}} {{are usually}} characterised by the percentage weights of particles settling with velocities between defined limits, such as silt and clay. If percentages were measured sufficiently accurately {{by both the}} pipette method and a plummet balance, dry densities of fractions could be calculated and hence their composition inferred. The accuracy and <b>precision</b> of the <b>pipette</b> method were confirmed by the mass balance of particles in peptised suspensions of a red-brown earth subsoil and a kaolinite. Percentages indicated by a plummet balance were corrected for the actual densities of fractions measured separately. Residual differences from the pipette values showed that the balance was accurate but lacked the precision needed to deduce densities to 0. 01 mg/mm 3. Values of the density of clay fractions were deduced from the means of published percentages obtained by the two methods where replicate suspensions were used and also from the mean difference based on a comparison using 199 soil samples. For the latter, an underestimate of clay percentages indicated by the balance had first to be allowed for. Clay-deduced densities were in the range 2. 802. 83 mg/mm 3, compared with 2. 84 mg/mm 3 measured on the separated subsoil clay. The values are similar, probably because the clays are derived from mica. The density of the separated subsoil silt was 2. 64 mg/mm 3, less than quartz, {{because of the presence}} of feldspar. Such results indicate the potential use of the method if the precision of the balance is improved...|$|R
