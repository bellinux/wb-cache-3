The Direct Elicitation of Utility function was employed to determine producers' degree of aversion to risk.

The highly diverse risk attitudes which vary between extremely concave and <b>extremely</b> <b>convex</b> utility functions indicate, on average, a slightly risk averse behaviour for both farming groups. Dairy producers have 69 % risk-averse, 10 % close to risk-neutrality and 21 % risk-loving individuals for the $ 100, 000 investment game in the EP format. These figures are respectively 69 %, 6 % and 23 % for hog producers. Hog farmers are found more averse to risk than dairy producers, but more significantly at higher levels of investment.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{solution}} to the apparent discrepancy between the radial gradient in the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emissivity and the distribution of supernova remnants, believed to be the sources of cosmic rays. Recent determinations of the pulsar distribution have made the discrepancy even more apparent. The problem is shown to be plausibly solved by a variation in the CO-to-N(H 2) scaling factor. If this factor increases by a factor of 5 - 10 from the inner to the outer Galaxy, as expected from the Galactic metallicity gradient, we show that the source distribution required to match the radial gradient of gamma-ray can be reconciled with the distribution of supernova remnants as traced by current studies of pulsars. The resulting model fits the EGRET gamma-ray <b>profiles</b> <b>extremely</b> well in longitude, and reproduces the mid-latitude inner Galaxy intensities better than previous models.

This growth is resulting in a proportional {{increase in the number}} of samples that medicines control laboratories have to test. Thus the need for simple and affordable preliminary screening methods to be used by inspectors to decide in the field whether to collect a sample for further laboratory analysis or not. This paper intends to evaluate the possibility to employ for preliminary examinations of suspicious samples an optical spectrophotometer (colorimeter) used in the graphic industry, capable of measuring the reflectance visible spectrum of solid materials. The colorimeter was tested on original and counterfeited Viagra, Cialis and Levitra by measuring the colour of tablets' surface and of a specific spot of the packages. Various batches of the original drugs were employed both to investigate precision and robustness of the technique and to build spectral libraries. These libraries were used to compare suspicious samples to the corresponding original by means of a wavelength distance pattern recognition method. The method was eventually tested on suspicious samples sized by police authorities in order to evaluate its effectiveness. The device resulted precise and robust toward ambient conditions changes, although some limits emerged: the libraries of original samples need a frequent update and a lower precision is to be expected for tablets which surface is <b>extremely</b> <b>convex.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background. Mucocoele is histopathologically benign, cystic {{change of}} {{paranasal}} sinuses filled with mucoid contents, which with its growth is pressuring and destroying local bone walls. In only 3 % {{of the cases}} it can be localized in maxillary sinuses. Etiology is unknown. Pyocoele develops by secondary infection. Case report. The male patient was 21 years old. His symptoms were runny nose with thick contents and heavy breathing {{on the right side}} of the nose, headaches, as well as the swelling of the right cheek. During clinical examination, the expansive change was found. It was completely closing the right side of the nose cavity. Computerized tomography (CT) of paranasal cavities showed excessive expansion of the right maxillary sinus, with very thinned walls, while the cavity was filled with liquid. After antibiotics therapy, the radical operation of the right maxillary sinus was performed, based on Caldwell Luc method. The frontal wall was found to be <b>extremely</b> <b>convex</b> and thinned, while the medial wall was with dehiscention. The cystic change was extirpated. Mucocoele was proved by pathohistologic findings. Its wall was about 2 mm thick and it showed squamous metaplasia in the large part of the mucocoela epithel. In the submucosa fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrate was present. Postoperative follow-up was under control. Clinically and radiographycaly, six months after therapy, the patient does not have troubles. Conclusion. The rare localization of the mucocoeles in maxillary sinus can be explained with the width of the maxillary ostia. Infected mucocoeles, expanded to the local anatomical structures, should be operated on with classic radical surgical operation. ...|$|R
40|$|Petrographic and {{chemical}} variability in two tropical, low ash, domed peat deposits of similar age and physiographic setting, but different external morphology, were examined as modern analogues for coal. Both occur in microtidal alluvial to deltaic plain settings, support similar arborescent vegetation and have accumulated {{in the past}} 5, 000 years. One deposit is an <b>extremely</b> <b>convex,</b> mature done, with a surface that rises 10 m above river level; {{the other is a}} low-gradient dome, rising only 3 m above river level but with a concave base up to 6 m below. Both deposits have been eroded by adjacent rivers, yet peat in the mature dome has accumulated remote from persistent flooding and exhibits distinctive internal stratigraphy. Decomposed sapric peat floors the deposits and is overlain by increasingly better preserved woody hemic and a cap of coarse fibrous peat derived from less arborescent vegetation. Consistent flooding in the low-gradient dome has maintained conditions for the accumulation of predominantly woody hemic peat, which interfingers with and is overlain by oxidised sapric peat and levee-derived clastic sediments. Peat types in both deposits exhibit distinctive polymodal textures and organo-chemical signatures that correspond to botanical input and degree of decay. Due to the abundance of pre-huminite/vitrinite macerals in all peat types from these deposits, megascopic and microscopic texture is a better discriminator for comparison to ancient coal types. It is suggested that the upward vertical sequence of decreasing woodiness and increasing lightness in colour observed in the mature dome might best be compared to sequences observed in Tertiary brown coals.

We have analyzed isophotal and elliptical integration surface brightness and color <b>profiles,</b> <b>extremely</b> deep (mu_B< 29 mag arcsec^{- 2 }) contour maps and RGB images for each galaxy in the sample.

We detect extremely extended low surface brightness (LSB) components dominant beyond the Holmberg radius as well as optical bridges between companion galaxies at the mu_V~ 28 th mag arcsec^{- 2 } isophotal level. The central surface brightness mu_ 0 and scale length h_r are derived from two radial ranges typically assumed {{to be dominated by}} the underlying host galaxy. We find that mu_ 0 and h_r of the BCGs host deviate from those of dwarf ellipticals (dE) and dwarf irregulars (dI) solely due to a strong burst contribution to the surface brightness profile almost down to the Holmberg radius. Structural parameters obtained from a fainter region, mu_B= 26 - 28 mag arcsec^{- 2 }, are consistent with those of true LSB galaxies for the starbursting BCGs in our sample, and with dEs and dIs for the BCGs with less vigorous star formation.

The observations do not match a calculated line <b>profile</b> <b>extremely</b> well at any abundance for any isotopic ratio. If the B abundance previously determined from observations at 2500 A is assumed, the calculated line profile is too weak, indicating a possible blending line. Assuming that the absorption at 2090 A is entirely due to boron, the best-fit total B abundance is higher than but consistent with that obtained at 2500 A, and the best-fit isotopic ratio (B 11 /B 10) is in the range ~ 10 : 1 to ~ 4 : 1. If the absorption is not entirely due to B {{and there is an}} unknown blend, the best-fit isotopic ratio may be closer to 1 : 1.

The simulation source consists of an arbitrary signal generator and a grid controlled X-ray tube.

In the grid controlled X-ray tube, the grid voltage changes the number of electrons hitting on the target and controls the X-ray intensity. With an analog modulated pulse profile applied on the tube grid electrode, the tube will emit X-rays which will match photons' statistical distribution and simulate the X-ray pulsar <b>profile</b> <b>extremely</b> well.

Proteins (mainly egg yolk and/or egg white, casein, animal glue and collagen) have been extensively used as paint binders, adhesives and varnishes in mural and easel paintings, {{and they can be}} found in archaeological findings, such as bones and skin tissues. In order to overcome limitations of wet chemical methods arising from the reduced solubility of aged proteins in samples of cultural heritage, a combination of analytical pyrolysis techniques was used to characterise reference materials, paint reconstructions and samples from different historical periods (2 nd century BC- 20 th century AD) and geographical origins, which were collected from paintings and archaeological findings. In particular evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry (EGA/MS), pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py/GC/MS) and double shot pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (DSP/GC/MS) were used. This analytical approach allowed us to characterise and differentiate the proteinaceous media, investigate their thermal behaviour and evidence changes occurring with ageing.
