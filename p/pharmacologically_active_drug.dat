This compound, a decarboxylated product of the amino acid phenylalanine, has received considerable interest in psychiatric research, as it may be a neuromodulator of aminergic synapses (neurons that use monoamines as a neurotransmitter) and it has been suggested to enhance energy, elevate mood, and promote aggression. The authors propose that there may be an interaction between phenylethylamine and psilocin (the metabolic breakdown product of psilocybin) through competitive inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes.|$|E

Subsequently, we characterize cardiomyocytes derived from these hiPSC using molecular and electrophysiological methods to characterize their applicability for regenerative medicine. Our results demonstrate that mRNA-iPSCs differentiate ontogenetically into cardiomyocytes with increased expression of early commitment markers of mesoderm, cardiac mesoderm, followed by cardiac specific transcriptional and sarcomeric structural and ion channel genes. Furthermore, these cardiomyocytes stained positively for sarcomeric and ion channel proteins. Based on multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings, these mRNA-hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes responded predictably to various <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> that target adrenergic, sodium, calcium and potassium channels.

40|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known of the toxic arsenal of {{cnidarian}} nematocysts compared to other venomous animals. Here we investigate the toxins of nematocysts isolated from the jellyfish Olindias sambaquiensis. A total of 29 unique ms/ms events were annotated as potential toxins homologous to the toxic proteins from diverse animal phyla, including conesnails, snakes, spiders, scorpions, wasp, bee, parasitic worm and other Cnidaria. Biological activities of these potential toxins include cytolysins, neurotoxins, phospholipases and toxic peptidases. The presence of several toxic enzymes is intriguing, such as sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase B (SMase B) that has only been described in certain spider venoms, and a prepro-haystatin P-IIId snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) that activates coagulation factor X, which is very rare even in snake venoms.

40|$|Abstract Background Albumin is {{the most}} {{abundant}} protein in blood plasma, and due to its ligand binding properties, serves as a circulating depot for endogenous and exogenous (e. g. drugs) compounds. Hence, the unbound drug is the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drug.</b> Commercial human albumin preparations are frequently used during surgery and in critically ill patients. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} the use of pharmaceutical-grade albumin is controversial in critically ill patients. In this in vitro study we investigated the drug binding properties of pharmaceutical-grade albumins (Baxter/Immuno, Octapharma, and Pharmacia & Upjohn), native human serum, and commercially available human serum albumin from Sigma Chemical Company. Methods The binding properties of the various albumin solutions were tested in vitro by means of ultrafiltration. Naproxen, warfarin, and digitoxin were used as ligands. HPLC was used to quantitate the total and free drug concentrations. The data were fitted to a model of two classes of binding sites for naproxen and warfarin and one class for digitoxin, using Microsoft Excel and Graphpad Prism. Results The drugs were highly bound to albumin (95 – 99. 5 %). The highest affinity (lowest K 1) was found with naproxen. Pharmaceutical-grade albumin solutions displayed significantly lower drug-binding capacity compared to native human serum and Sigma albumin. Thus, the free fraction was considerably higher, approximately 40 times for naproxen and 5 and 2 times for warfarin and digitoxin, respectively. The stabilisers caprylic acid and N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan used in the manufacturing procedure seem to be of importance. Adding the stabilisers to human serum and Sigma albumin reduced the binding affinity whereas charcoal treatment of the pharmaceutical-grade albumin from Octapharma almost restored the specific binding capacity. Conclusion This in vitro study demonstrates that the specific binding for warfarin and digitoxin is significantly reduced and for naproxen no longer detectable in pharmaceutical-grade albumin. It further shows that the addition of stabilisers may be of major importance for this effect. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous fluid was {{withdrawn}} from eyes of patients undergoing cataract extraction at various intervals after administration of two drops 2 % pilocarpine-HCl {{in a standard}} manner. Determination of aqueous pilocarpine concentration was made both by spectroscopy of a ferric hydroxylamine complex and by gas-liquid chromatography. These methods were consistent in indicating that concentration does not rise beyond 5 micrograms/ml at any time following topical instillation. The mean of 71 GLC determinations of aqueous tapped between 2 and 32 minutes after drops was 1. 67 micrograms/ml. With assumption of a total chamber volume of 400 microliter, the average total pilocarpine in aqueous in these circumstances is less than 1 microgram. These findings correlate well with investigations of transcorneal flux of pilocarpine for the rabbit in a partial in vitro transport chamber system, with which comparable low flux efficiency was found after simulated drop administration. This serves to validate in some measure in extrapolation of other findings in chamber experiments to the living human eye. The combined in vitro and in vivo experimental results suggest that two distinct mechanisms govern the flux of pilocarpine across the cornea. High doses, comparable to those in standard clinical use, whether administered in drops or in constant flow, are transported inefficiently with kinetics indicating a diffusional mechanism and are associated with intracorneal retention or degradation of a substantial moiety. Low doses, if continuously applied, are much more efficiently transported. Hydrogel polymer vehicles appear to mobilize this low-dose mechanism by retaining drug against mechanical dissipation and elution by tear flow, but also by retaining drug against the capability of the cornea to take up more pilocarpine than can be transported to produce an intracorneal drug "depot. " Although {{the exact nature of}} the "depot" is not clear, it is not elutable as <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drug.</b> It is consistently associated with the relatively poor flux efficiency found with high doses, and thus may act in some manner to disable a more efficient mechanism. The flux efficiency found with hydrogel mediation is more than double the best found in constant flow determinations. Vehicular mediated flux is rate limited by the cornea, independent of dose, linear with time despite exponentially secreasing available drug, and not associated with an intracorneal drug "depot. " These features are consistent with carrier mediation of some type...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Intracellular {{pathogens}} are a {{major cause}} of global morbidity and mortality due to their complex and intricate ability to replicate within host cells while evading the innate immune defense system. Many intracellular pathogens, such as F. tularensis and B. pseudomallei, are highly infectious and can cause severe and fatal diseases. They are designated as Tier 1 select agents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to their high infectivity and mortality, transmission by pulmonary route of infection, and potential development as a bioweapon. Current antibiotics are limited by poor pharmacokinetic properties, and consequently require high frequency dosing at high concentrations to show promising clinical success. The physicochemical properties may also limit the route of administration of drugs – a critical factor to consider when select target tissues are of importance. To date, intravenous administration followed by oral tablets are the common routes of administration to deliver drugs; however, in a mass casualty setting, intravenous injections may not be practical. Therefore, new strategies are needed to improve the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating intracellular pulmonary infections. This work utilizes RAFT polymerization techniques to explore synthetic multivalent glycopolymer prodrug systems. Prodrugs are inactive forms of the drug, but when administered undergo hydrolysis to release the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drug.</b> We hypothesized that engineering mannose glycopolymer prodrugs to target the macrophage mannose receptor on alveolar macrophage cells would eradicate or minimize bacterial replication and allow for better protection against intracellular infections. We demonstrated that mannose polymeric prodrug systems provided significantly improved protection against intracellular F. novicida infection in mice challenge models compared to free antibiotic. When intratracheally administered to the lungs of mice in a prophylactic setting, poly(Man-co-CTM) improved survival in 50 % of the mice and in a post-infection treatment setting, the survival of mice increased to 87. 5 %. In both studies, mice treated with free antibiotics remained ineffective. We also show that these results are due to the improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ciprofloxacin, in which targeted mannose polymer prodrugs had more than double elimination half-life time in the lungs compared to non-specific polymer prodrugs. We are excited about the promising results of the work presented here, but even more so at the modularity of the prodrug system such that it can be expanded and fine-tuned to be utilized for other diseases and applications...|$|E

40|$|The general aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop and {{validate}} human keratinocyte cell culture systems that are useful in large-scale pharmacological screening. We describe a screening model to detect <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> in two keratinocyte-based, 96 -well culture models that use expression of CK 10 and SKALP as markers for respectively normal and psoriatic differentiation. Furthermore, we developed a system applicable to screen <b>drugs</b> that are <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> in keratinocyte growth inhibition, using a highly sensitive, fluorescent dye to monitor proliferation in 96 -well format. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies were developed and applied for a SKALP-ELISA. Though SKALP expression is regarded to be a useful marker for psoriatic differentiation, the time-consuming SKALP ELISA limits its practical use in high-throughput drug screens. To circumvent this drawback we generated a stably transfected keratinocyte cell line that expresses EGFP, {{under the control of}} a 0. 8 kb-fragment derived from the promoter of the SKALP gene. Unfortunately, the transgene achieved only 0. 5 % of the expression level of the endogenous SKALP gene, thereby limiting the dynamic range of the system. We describe the regulation of SKALP gene expression in human keratinocytes, which was studied at the molecular level. Microarray expression profiling is a powerful method that can be employed to reveal (clusters of) genes that are differentially expressed in drug treated and untreated cell culture models. In this thesis we describe the application of a customized microarray system (SKINarray) containing 750 cDNAs that are relevant for skin biology and inflammation. The SKINarray was used to analyse the effect of all-trans retinoic acid on the gene expression profiles of submerged keratinocyte cultures that can mimic the normal or the psoriatic phenotype of human epidermis. We anticipate the combined use of our cell culture models and the microarray methodology to be a powerful tool for evaluation of gene expression profiles induced by keratinocyte-targeted compounds...|$|R

The site and mechanism of action by which these compounds interact with the 5 -HT 3 receptor is not fully understood although research indicates they may bind to a currently unidentified allosteric binding site. Using in silico techniques, such as molecular docking and GRID analysis, we have characterized the recently available murine 5 -HT 3 receptor by identifying sites of strong interaction with particular functional groups at both the orthogonal (serotonin) site and a proposed allosteric binding site situated at the interface between the transmembrane region and the extracellular domain. These were assessed concurrently with the top-scoring poses of the docked ligands and included key active gingerols, shogaols and dehydroshogaols as well as competitive antagonists (e. g. setron class of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drugs),</b> serotonin and its structural analogues, curcumin and capsaicin, non-competitive antagonists and decoys.

The specific Aims of this dissertation consist of two parts: 1) to obtain structural information about the transport with a focus on TMD 10 and loop 6 - 7; 2) to investigate the effect of ethanol on hPepT 1 transport function. This was accomplished by 1) testing the hypothesis that physical-chemical parameters in TMD 10 and Loop 6 ~ 7 region in hPepT 1 play an important role in translocation 2) the hypothesis that endotoxin LPS inhibit hPEPT 1 transport function.; This work will contribute to our long-term goal of validating and developing a refined, experimentally constrained computer model of hPEPT 1 that can be used as template for rational drug design and identify new targets and treatment strategies that can be used to improve the dietary as well as immunological deficiencies that are experienced by the alcoholic patient...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Plant {{products}} such as leafs, barks, seeds etc., hold <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> moieties for <b>drug</b> discovery and development of semisynthetic drugs from natural products. However, as therapeutically effective these plant derived molecules may be, most herbal medicines lack in the scientific information regarding their constituents and impurities. In recent times, due {{to the development of}} chromatographic techniques, their medicinal uses are substantiated with relevant to the constituents present. Standardization of plant extract before formulation of herbal medicines and export is much needed. In the present article an attempt was made to enlist the immunomodulatory constituents from plant origin. INTRODUCTION: According to an estimate of the World Health Organization (WHO), about 80 % of the world population still uses herbs and other traditional medicines for their primary health car...|$|R

Despite favorable therapeutic indices in cultured cells, PGA 2 was not effective as a therapeutic agent {{in the treatment of}} herpetic keratitis in a rabbit model. The sequelae of disease appeared more severe in animals receiving PGA 2 than in untreated or placebo-treated controls. The recovery of virus from tissues of latently infected rabbits was not affected by therapy. PGA 2 therapy alone induced breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier, indicating that <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> concentrations of <b>drug</b> were achieved in the eye. Thus, PGA 2 had antiviral activity, but its proinflammatory effects appeared to be more detrimental than beneficial in the treatment of herpetic keratitis...|$|R
40|$|Placebos do {{not possess}} any direct {{pharmacological}} method of action, however placebo treatment {{has been shown to}} markedly reduce pain across multiple studies. This effect, termed placebo analgesia, is typically mediated by expectations, such that greater reductions in pain are explicitly related to greater expectations for pain relief. This dissertation examines the psychological processes and neurobiological mechanisms involved in placebo analgesia across three different studies, and the results are interpreted within a dual process framework. The first study introduces a novel procedure used to induce expectation-independent placebo analgesia without <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drugs.</b> In this study, subjects who experienced multiple conditioning sessions across several days continued to report placebo analgesia both before (Pre-Reveal) and after (Post-Reveal) a complete and convincing disclosure of the placebo manipulation. The second study explores the neurobiological mechanisms involved in placebo analgesia using a similar paradigm. Pre-Reveal, analgesia was associated with reduced activity within brain regions associated with pain experience, including both cortical (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex) and subcortical (putamen, thalamus, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM)) regions. Analgesia was correlated with decreased expression of the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), a multivariate pattern sensitive and specific to pain, and was captured by changes in a classifier trained to predict analgesia based on brain activity (5 -fold CV, r = 0. 32, t 37 = 2. 36, p = 0. 023). Post-Reveal, analgesia was correlated with reduced activity within dlPFC and RVM, but was not captured by changes in NPS or other trained classifiers. The third and final study evaluates whether expectations are important during learning by informing half of the subjects that the intensity of the painful stimuli was reduced during conditioning. These subjects experienced placebo analgesia Pre-Reveal, but not Post-Reveal. These studies extend the current model of placebo effects to include separable underlying processes that either respond rapidly to new information or slowly accumulate information over time. This work highlights the importance of managing expectations during treatment of clinical disorders, as initial expectations for treatment may be critical for inducing a therapeutic placebo response that could persist even when expectations about that treatment are reduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Discovery {{of novel}} natural {{products}} is an accepted method for the elucidation of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> molecules and <b>drug</b> leads. Best known sources for such discovery have been terrestrial plants and microbes, accounting for about 85 % of the approved natural products in pharmaceutical use (1), and about 60 % of approved pharmaceuticals and new drug applications annually (2). Discovery {{in the marine}} environment has lagged due {{to the difficulty of}} exploration in this ecological niche. Exploration began in earnest in the 1950 ’s, after technological advances such as scuba diving allowed collection of marine organisms, primarily at a depth to about 15 m. Natural products from filter feeding marine invertebrates and in particular, sponges, have proven to be a rich source of structurally unique <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> compounds, with over 16, 000 molecules isolated thus far (3, 1) and a continuing pace of discovery at hundreds of novel bioactive molecules per year. All classes of pharmaceuticals have been represented in this discovery process, including antiprotazoals, pesticides, TGF-beta inhibitors, cationic channel blockers, anticancer, cytotoxic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compounds. Important biosynthetic pathways found in sponges which give rise to these compounds include the terpenoid (4), fatty acid, polyketoid, quinone reductase, alkaloid, isoprenoid (5), and non-ribosomal protein synthase pathways...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{considered}} as prohibited at any concentration (with {{the exception of}} threshold drugs) in body fluids collected during racing or equestrian events, even if environmental or feeds contamination might occur. This can create unexpected positive cases when feeds or supplements contain unlisted drugs in supplements or in feeds containing alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine or caffeine. There are several contamination origins depending on drugs involved. Manufacturing or transportation are major factors which may explain {{the presence of these}} drugs in the feed. Two studies were carried out to assess the maximum intake of major contaminants absorbed through the diet that would not result in a positive test in urine. Caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, atropine, scopolamine and morphine were administered orally at different dosages, for 2 days before urine was sampled and submitted to analysis by screening methods. Each cocktail of drugs were administered to two horses. Caffeine: a 10 mg daily intake was found to induce urinary concentrations ranged from 23 to 50 ng/ml; theobromine: a 30 mg daily intake was found to produce urinary concentrations from 700 to 900 ng/ml; theophylline: a 15 mg/day intake was found to induce urinary concentrations of 140 - 500 ng/ml; atropine: a 10 mg/day intake was found to produce 10 to 25 ng/ml in urine; scopolamine: a 10 mg/day intake was found to give urinary concentrations from 25 - 140 ng/ml and, finally morphine: a 1 mg/day intake was found to produce a range of 10 - 15 ng/ml in urine. Horse feeds containing contaminants, even at low levels, may produce positive test results in anti [...] doping urine analysis. A maximum daily intake or a maximum concentration in feeds must be adopted to avoid inadvertent positive findings in routine tests. The use of feeds or supplements properly tested or guaranteed by manufacturers by an effective quality controlled process is crucial for feeding horses in training or before competition or racing events. The sensitivity of screening tests used to control feeds or feed supplements must at least comply with the concentrations determined in the present study. Nevertheless the lack of international harmonization remains an important issue, a MRL s (Maximum Residue Level) like approach would be the more appropriate as soon as harmonized levels of detection will be adopted. vo...|$|R

40|$|Quantification and {{identification}} of chiral drugs and their metabolites constitutes a significant issue {{for both the}} pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory authorities, {{which led to a}} continuous growth of research areas devoted to the development of direct methods of discrimination of enantiomers. Stereoisomers frequently differ in terms of their biological activity and pharmacokinetic profiles as well as their metabolites can be toxic or <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active,</b> just like <b>drug</b> candidates. NMR spectroscopy provides several tools in the field of the identification and quantification of chiral compounds, based on the use of suitable chiral auxiliaries which have the role of converting enantiomeric mixtures into their diastereoisomeric derivatives or solvates, the NMR resonances of which are distinguishable in principle. The survey will be addressed on the NMR determinations of the enantiomeric purity of chiral compounds, with an outline of the three classes of chiral auxiliaries for NMR, without any intent of giving an exhaustive analysis of literature data. Particular attention will be focused on the literature regarding the use of NMR spectroscopy for the identification and quantification of chiral drugs and metabolites...|$|R
40|$|For centuries {{the science}} of {{pharmacognosy}} has dominated rational drug development until it was gradually substituted by target-based drug discovery in the last fifty years. Pharmacognosy stems from the different systems of traditional herbal medicine and its "reverse pharmacology" approach {{has led to the}} discovery of numerous <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> molecules and <b>drug</b> leads for humankind. But do botanical drugs also provide effective mixtures? Nature has evolved distinct strategies to modulate biological processes, either by selectively targeting biological macromolecules or by creating molecular promiscuity or polypharmacology (one molecule binds to different targets). Widely claimed to be superior over monosubstances, mixtures of bioactive compounds in botanical drugs allegedly exert synergistic therapeutic effects. Despite evolutionary clues to molecular synergism in nature, sound experimental data are still widely lacking to support this assumption. In this short review, the emerging concept of network pharmacology is highlighted, and the importance of studying ligand-target networks for botanical drugs is emphasized. Furthermore, problems associated with studying mixtures of molecules with distinctly different pharmacodynamic properties are addressed. It is concluded that {{a better understanding of the}} polypharmacology and potential network pharmacology of botanical drugs is fundamental in the ongoing rationalization of phytotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Efavirenz (EFV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for the treatment of HIV. Highly protein-bound drugs, like EFV, have limited central nervous system (CNS) penetration whenmeasured using total drug concentration gradients between blood plasma (BP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the more relevant <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> pro-tein-free <b>drug</b> concentrations are rarely assessed directly in clinical studies. Using paired BP and CSF samples obtained from 13 subjects on an EFV-containing regimen, both the protein-free and total concentrations of EFV were determined. Despite a me-dian (interquartile range [IQR]) total EFV BP/CSF concentration ratio of 134 (116 to 198), the protein-free EFV BP/CSF concen-tration ratio was 1. 20 (0. 97 to 2. 12). EFVmedian (IQR) protein binding was 99. 78 % (99. 74 to 99. 80 %) in BP and 76. 19 % (74. 47 to 77. 15 %) in CSF. In addition, using the law of mass action and an in vitro-derived EFV-human serum albumin dissociation con-stant, we have demonstrated that the predicted median (IQR) protein-free concentration in BP, 4. 59 ng/ml (4. 02 to 9. 44 ng/ml), compared well to that observed in BP, 4. 77 ng/ml (3. 68 to 6. 75 ng/ml). Similar results were also observed in CSF and seminal plasma. This method provides a useful predictive tool for estimating protein binding in varied anatomic compartments. Our results of equivalent protein-free EFV concentrations in BP and CSF do not support prior concerns of the CNS as a pharmaco-logical sanctuary from EFV. As CSF penetration of ARVsmay increase our understanding of HIV-associated neurological dys-function and antiretroviral effect, assessment of protein-free CSF concentrations of other highly protein-bound ARVs is warranted...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} similar {{compounds}} contained in cannabis {{that do not}} exhibit any psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality: cannabidiol (CBD), an isomer of THC; cannabivarin (CBV), an analog of cannabinol (CBN) with a different side chain, cannabidivarin (CBDV), an analog of CBD with a different side chain, and cannabinolic acid. How these other compounds interact with THC is not fully understood. Some clinical studies have proposed that CBD acts as a balancing force to regulate {{the strength of the}} psychoactive agent THC. CBD is also believed to regulate the body’s metabolism of THC by inactivating cytochrome P450, an important class of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Experiments in which mice were treated with CBD followed by THC showed that CBD treatment was associated with a substantial increase in brain concentrations of THC and its major metabolites, most likely because it decreased the rate of clearance of THC from the body. Cannabis cofactor compounds have also been linked to lowering body temperature, modulating immune functioning, and cell protection. The essential oil of cannabis contains many fragrant terpenoids which may synergize with the cannabinoids to produce their unique effects. THC is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active,</b> so the <b>drug</b> effect outlasts measurable THC levels in blood.|$|R
