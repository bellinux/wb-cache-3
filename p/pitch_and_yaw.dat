Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up.

5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw</b> control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw</b> control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E

25|$|In {{spacecraft}} propulsion, rocket {{engines are}} generally {{mounted on a}} pair of gimbals to allow a single engine to vector thrust about both the <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw</b> axes; or sometimes just one axis is provided per engine. To control roll, twin engines with differential pitch or yaw control signals are used to provide torque about the vehicle's roll axis.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida used {{a culture}} of 25,000 neurons taken from a rat's brain to fly a F-22 fighter jet {{aircraft}} simulator. After collection, the cortical neurons were cultured in a petri dish and rapidly began to reconnect themselves to form a living neural network. The cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and used to control the <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw</b> functions of the simulator. The study's focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{previous}} factors, {{one of the biggest}} difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw)</b> platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every single one of these factors. Load transfer in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and elastomeric bearings are used in several British sea turbines.|$|E
25|$|Three-axis MEMS-based {{gyroscopes}} {{are also}} being used in portable electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, and smartwatches. This adds to the 3-axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of devices. Together these sensors provide 6 component motion sensing; acceleration for X,Y, and Z movement, and gyroscopes for measuring the extent and rate of rotation in space (roll, <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw).</b> Some devices (e.g. the iPhone) additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular measurements relative to the Earth's magnetic field. Newer MEMS-based inertial measurement units incorporate up to all nine axes of sensing in a single integrated circuit package, providing inexpensive and widely available motion sensing.|$|E
25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw.</b> Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E

25|$|The Su-57 has a blended wing body {{fuselage}} and incorporates all-moving {{horizontal and}} vertical stabilizers; the vertical stabilizers toe inwards {{to serve as the}} aircraft's airbrake. The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and has adjustable leading edge vortex controllers (LEVCONs) designed to control vortices generated by the leading edge root extensions, and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour, including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails. The advanced flight control system and thrust vectoring nozzles make the aircraft departure resistant and highly maneuverable in both <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw,</b> enabling the aircraft to perform very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev's Cobra and the Bell maneuver, along with doing flat rotations with little altitude loss. The aircraft's high cruising speed and normal operating altitude is also expected to give it a significant kinematic advantage over prior generations of aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the {{aircraft}} was largely of wire-braced wood with fabric covering. The wings, of RAF34 section, were built in four sections, all with dihedral but the outer sections markedly so.

To facilitate storage the outer wing sections folded to the rear for a folded span of [...] At {{the rear of the}} fuselage a biplane tail-unit with twin fins and rudders provided control and stability in <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Earlier Burnelli {{lifting body}} designs had fuselages which were {{rectangular}} in plan, with the empennage directly attached, but the CB-16's fuselage tapered and the tail unit was mounted beyond the lifting body's trailing edge {{on a pair}} of thin panels extending from its sides. The alteration was motivated by the difficulties of <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw</b> control encountered with the earlier arrangement. [...] The panels swept upwards into a pair of fins and balanced rudders carrying a high set tailplane with three balanced elevators, the rudders working between them. The single wheels of the still novel retracting undercarriage were mounted on V-struts hinged at the lower, outer fuselage, retracting inwards.|$|E

The system would be a north seeking stable platform controlled by gyroscopes and accelerometers. Such a system would automatically provide velocities in the East-West and North-South direction.

2500|$|With a [...] engine, Pearse's design had an {{adequate}} power-to-weight ratio to become airborne (even without an aerofoil).

Diagrams and eyewitness recollections agree that Pearse placed controls for <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw</b> at {{the trailing edge of}} the low-aspect-ratio kite-type permanently stalled wing. This control placement (located in turbulent air-flow, and close to the centre of gravity) would have had minimal, possibly inadequate, turning moment to control the pitch or yaw of the aircraft. The Wright brothers, in comparison, successfully applied the principles of airfoil wing-profile and three-axis control to produce fully controlled flight.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the primary flight controls for roll, <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> <b>yaw,</b> there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload. [...] The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim, so that the pilot {{does not have to}} maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch attitude (other types of trim, for rudder and ailerons, are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones). [...] Many aircraft have wing flaps, controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing. [...] Other secondary flight control systems may be available, including slats, spoilers, air brakes and variable-sweep wings.|$|E
