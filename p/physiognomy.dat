40|$|Over {{the past}} 35 years, {{more than two}} thirds of the Cerrado`s {{original}} expanse has been taken by agriculture. Even if some {{attempts have been made to}} conserve closed cerrado <b>physiognomies,</b> open cerrado <b>physiognomies,</b> richer in species and more fragile, have been systematically ignored. These open <b>physiognomies</b> are used by almost half of the Cerrado bird species, many of which being endemics. Using data from 11 surveys carried out in Cerrado landscapes, we asked what would happen to bird functional diversity if open cerrado species became extinct. Open cerrado birds would be able to keep on average 59 % of the functional diversity. If they became extinct, on average 27 % of the functional diversity would be lost. In this case, the remaining functional diversity would be lower than what would be expected by chance in five sites. Although many functions were shared by both open cerrado and forest species, there was some degree of complementarity between them, highlighted by the decrease in functional diversity when the former became extinct. Destruction of open cerrado <b>physiognomies</b> would lead to a habitat simplification, decrease in bird functional diversity, and, ultimately, to a considerable impact on community functioning. Thus, open cerrado <b>physiognomies</b> must receive much more conservation attention than they are currently receiving, because they maintain a high bird functional diversity that would otherwise be considerably diminished Were open cerrado species to become extinct...|$|R

5|$|The {{information}} {{found in}} the Liber physiognomiae {{seems to have been}} derived largely from Arabic copies of Aristotelian and Pseudo-Aristotelian works. The work was written in the early 13th century for Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor, but was first officially printed in 1477. Liber physiognomiae would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on <b>physiognomy</b> itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and <b>physiognomy.</b> His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E
40|$|Riparian forests play a {{vital role}} in the {{maintenance}} of fluvial ecosystems, not only preventing bank erosion and silting, but also by filtering pollutants which might compromise water quality. They also serve as wildlife corridors for animals and plants, increasing connectivity among patches on fragmented landscapes, such as the highly degraded Brazilian savannah - the cerrado. With remote sensing and GIS, it is possible to characterize plant <b>physiognomies</b> and their distribution in a given landscape. Using said tools, the goal of this work was to characterize the riparian <b>physiognomies</b> occurring on a cerrado region in western São Paulo state, creating a <b>physiognomies</b> map for them; as well as to assess if large and medium-sized mammals would use them as corridors. 8 different riparian areas were visited, their coordinates marked on a GPS, along with any large or medium-sized mammal tracks found in them. The riparian zones consisted of a riparian forest stripe, bordered by a wetlands buffer, except in areas under anthropic pressure. A <b>physiognomies</b> map showing these two <b>physiognomies</b> was created upon using vegetation indexes, elevation models and the data obtained on the field. Tracks from 8 mammal species were found, and were plotted on a NDVI map. The finding of two large mammals - cougar (Puma concolor) and Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris) - tracks in a narrow riparian forest corridor might indicate that these forests are being used as a corridor for these species.

That project studied 206 Cerrado polygons within the state of São Paulo – Brazil, in order to discriminate their <b>physiognomies</b> and their conservation stages. This study started in one pilot area located in a Conservation Unit (CU) which presents all Cerrado <b>physiognomies.</b> Thus, the vegetation classes within the CU were analyzed using Landsat TM/ETM+ and Terra-MODIS images, and then compared with the JERS- 1 /SAR images.

5|$|The use of {{anthropology}} in the forensic investigation of remains {{grew out of}} the recognition {{of anthropology}} as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and <b>physiognomy</b> could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E

The study area involved several types of natural vegetation including different cerrado <b>physiognomies</b> and semi decidual forest, meanwhile the sugar cane and critics cultures were the main man-made vegetation coverages. The preliminary results showed an acceptable classification by the methodology and CCD images, allowing a good differentiation between natural and man-made vegetation <b>physiognomies.</b> Therefore some specific confusion occurred between natural and forests of exotic species. Future studies should be carried out to analyze the applicability of CCD CBERS- 2 sensors to differentiate more specific cerrado classes.

Based on the videography, five types of vegetation <b>physiognomies</b> were identified: Upland Forest, Floodplain Forest, Secondary forest, Babacu Forest and Grassland. The results demonstrated the percentage of shadow in the videographic data allowed only the differentiation of Babacu Forest from the remaining classes. The Shadow component of the linear mixing model was the most efficient product for the discrimination of the vegetal <b>physiognomies,</b> allowing the discrimination among all the classes but between Grassland and Secondary forest.

40|$|Phenological {{studies are}} key to {{understand}} the role of distinct <b>physiognomies</b> regarding carbon and energy fluxes. This is particularly true in the Cerrado biome, marked by a strong seasonality in its vegetative cover. To this end, we are currently evaluating the seasonal and phenological responses of the main Cerrado physiognomic types, in order to map and characterize its functional diversity, {{as well as to}} understand how the severe changes taking place affect and are accommodated by its different ecosystems. This paper is focused on our sampling scheme, which consider the most prominent <b>physiognomies</b> and is restricted to pristine areas. Specifically, a set of random points, over 33 <b>physiognomies,</b> were evaluated regarding their spatial distribution and ability to depict the Cerrado landscapes. As morphometric and precipitation data shows, our 330 samples comprehensively encompasses the Cerrado heterogeneity.

25|$|Although Nazi {{doctrine}} {{stressed the}} importance of <b>physiognomy</b> and genes in determining race, in practice race was determined only through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors. Individuals were considered non-Aryan (i.e. Jewish) if at least three of four of their grandparents had been enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation; it did not matter if those grandparents had been born to a Jewish family or had converted to Judaism in adulthood. The actual religious beliefs of the individual himself or herself were also immaterial, as was the individual's status under Halachic law.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainstream}} Nazi anti-Semitism {{considered the}} Jewry being {{a group of}} people bound by close, so-called genetic (blood) ties, to form a unit, which one could not join or secede from. The influence of Jews was declared to have detrimental impact on Germany, to rectify the discriminations and persecutions of Jews. To be spared from that, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the so-called Aryan race. Paradoxical was, that never genetic tests or outward allegedly racial features in one's <b>physiognomy</b> determined one's affiliation, although the Nazis palavered a lot about <b>physiognomy,</b> but only the records of religious affiliations of one's grandparents decided. However, while the grandparents were earlier still able to choose their religion, their grandchildren in the Nazi era were compulsorily categorised as Jews, if three or four grandparents were enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation. This Nazi categorisation as Jews of course included mostly Jews of Jewish descent, but also many Gentiles of Jewish descent, such as Catholics, irreligionists, and Protestants, who happened to have had grandparents belonging– according to the records– to a Jewish congregation. While Jewish congregations in Germany tried– little as they were allowed– to help their persecuted members, the Protestant church bodies ignored their parishioners who were classified as Jews (according to the Nuremberg Laws), and the somewhat less persecuted Mischlinge of partially Jewish descent.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the possibility of temporal variation in functional characteristics of arboreal species in three Cerrado vegetation <b>physiognomies.</b> We analyzed 195 species in total, including 88 in typical cerrado, 89 in cerradão and 105 in gallery forest, with 87 species common {{in at least two}} <b>physiognomies.</b> The study was based on lists provided by floristic and phytosociological surveys conducted over 12 years. We observed temporal variation in functional diversity values for typical cerrado and cerradão, while the gallery forest remained constant. The arboreal communities in all three <b>physiognomies</b> showed temporal variation in species richness and abundance, which is likely attributed to drought and ire events that occurred during the study. The lack of temporal change in functional diversity, species richness, and abundance in the gallery forest suggests higher functional stability during periods of environmental change. The causes of the functional changes observed in the typical cerrado and cerradão remain uncertain, but may be related to greater seasonality of soil water availability compared to the galleryforest, where trees have increased access to soil water throughout the year...|$|R

Thus, the studied vegetation <b>physiognomies</b> were compared concerning their anuran species composition. The existence of indicator species for these areas was also tested. Similarity analyzes showed a high beta diversity among the different areas studied, but it is rather a consequence of the low species richness recorded in the studied vegetation <b>physiognomies,</b> instead of the different anuran species compositions expected among them. on the other hand, a higher similarity on species composition was found among the most preserved areas at MDSP, which is related to preferential habitat use of some species in these areas. Three species were indicative of the studied vegetation physiognomies: Rhinella ornata as indicator of the Mature Forest, and Eupemphix nattereri and Physalaemus cuvieri as indicators of Forest in Advanced Regeneration Stage. The efficiency of pitfall traps for capturing the anurans in the studied area was also discussed...|$|R
