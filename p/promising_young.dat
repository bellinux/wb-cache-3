5|$|After {{beginning}} {{his career with}} Manchester United in 2011, Pogba joined Italian side Juventus in 2012, and helped the club to four consecutive Serie A titles, {{as well as two}} Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. During his time with the club, he established himself {{as one of the most}} <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> players in the world, and received the Golden Boy award in 2013, followed by the Bravo Award in 2014 and was named by The Guardian as one of the ten most <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> players in Europe. In 2016, Pogba was named to the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year as well as the 2015 FIFA FIFPro World XI, after helping Juventus to the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final.

5|$|By then, Brown had put {{his system}} into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> players from Massillon's junior high school football program. He {{paid no attention to}} race, and brought several African-American players onto the team {{at a time when many}} northern schools excluded them.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{depression}} in the 1930s and war in the 1940s caused Grotrian-Steinweg to decline severely and then lose its factory completely.

50|$|In 2010 and 11, {{the club}} {{continued}} in the London 3rds (or social) league and with the recruitment of some <b>promising</b> <b>younger</b> locals, began to develop into more of a competitive team, winning a majority of matches and contesting with their more experienced London peers. The team reached finals in both years, but were unable to take a full team to either and did not progress beyond the semi's.|$|R
5000|$|Taking {{a broader}} view of Martin's work, a picture emerges {{of the man}} as a quiet {{achiever}} par excellence. Through his skilled networking in support of <b>promising</b> <b>younger</b> architects, and his self-effacing work on committees, he strongly influenced the course of post-war British architecture. [...] "He was efficient, cooperative, impeccably well networked and calmly authoritative, justifying his advice with his immense architectural expertise and his scientific investigations of planning needs." ...|$|R

The couple sought Prus' help for the Polish National Museum, housed in the Rapperswil Castle, where Żeromski was librarian.|$|E
5|$|Jim White, {{the coach}} at Los Angeles Harbor College, had watched Johnson play street basketball; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White {{asked him to}} enroll. Johnson gave up his jobs and {{developed}} into a <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title. However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown off the team three times in two years.|$|E

With some <b>promising</b> <b>younger</b> players making an impact, Inveraray did better than many expected in the Premier League, finishing in 3rd position. There was frustration in the cup tournaments however as old rivals Kyles Athletic won 3 narrow encounters. Kyles defeated Inveraray 1-0 in the Camanachd Cup, followed by a win on penalties in the Celtic Society Cup final following a 0-0 draw. In the Macaulay Cup Kyles prevailed 4-2 in extra time.|$|R

5|$|Meredith {{found the}} net eight times in 38 {{games in the}} 1901–02 campaign, as City were relegated {{back out of the}} First Division. The club's secretary, Sam Ormerod, {{selected}} 29 different players as the club slumped to defeat in 13 of the opening 20 games. Ormerod was forced to step down, as new business figures took control behind the scenes and began to sign <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> Scottish players. New manager Tom Maley was more willing than his predecessor to confront Meredith over his tendency to stray out of position and attempt to dominate the City attack.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the excitement that surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, Trott again {{acted as a}} Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George Giffen and former captain Percy McDonnell. When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, Giffen used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, Walter. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number of <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> players, including Joe Darling and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with Middlesex and appeared for England in two Test matches against South Africa. The cricket historian David Frith records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging nods and kept walking.|$|E

5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada. The first was George Volkoff at the University of British Columbia, {{who had worked with}} Robert Oppenheimer on the physics of neutron stars. They also tried to recruit Harry Thode from McMaster University, but found that Harold Urey from the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories was also {{interested}} in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with mass spectrography, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. <b>Promising</b> <b>young</b> Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace and Leo Yaffe.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E
5|$|On {{completing}} his novitiate in 1518, Vermigli took the name Peter Martyr after the thirteenth-century Dominican Saint Peter of Verona. The Lateran Congregation had recently decided that <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> ordinands {{should be sent}} to the monastery of Saint John of Verdara in Padua to study Aristotle, so Vermigli was sent there. The University of Padua, with which Saint John of Verdera was loosely affiliated, was a very prestigious institution at the time. At Padua, Vermigli received a thorough training in Thomistic scholasticism and an appreciation for Augustine and Christian humanism. Vermigli was determined to read Aristotle in his original language despite the lack of Greek teachers, so he taught himself. He also made the acquaintance of prominent reform-minded theologians Pietro Bembo, Reginald Pole, and Marcantonio Flaminio.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{its role}} in catalyzing the team that season, the {{incident}} {{has been seen as}} {{the beginning of the end}} of the Yankees' 15-year postwar dynasty, since it also coincided with the announcement that the CBS television network was buying the team. Keane was never able to fully earn the respect of either the aging, injury-plagued stars or the few <b>promising</b> <b>younger</b> players, and in the 1965 season the team failed to win the pennant after recording its first losing season in 40 years. When the subsequent season started with even worse results, Keane was fired, though that did not prevent the Yankees from finishing in last place. They would not return to the World Series until 1976, after CBS had sold the team to George Steinbrenner.|$|R
5|$|Sullivan {{was born}} in London on 13 May 1842. His father was a {{military}} bandmaster, {{and by the time}} Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose anthems and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig, where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the Overture di Ballo, in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{agreed to}} the proposal, and the Montreal Laboratory was established in a house belonging to McGill University; it moved to permanent accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March 1943.

Bauer from Switzerland, Friedrich Paneth and Hans von Halban from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The Canadian contingent included George Volkoff, Bernice Weldon Sargent and George Laurence, and <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> Canadian scientists such as J.

5|$|The reserve team serves {{mainly as}} the final {{stepping}} stone for <b>promising</b> <b>young</b> players before being promoted to the main team. The second team is coached by Tim Walter, assisted by Rainer Ulrich and Tobias Schweinsteiger. Since {{the inception of the}} Regionalliga in 1994, the team played in the Regionalliga Süd, after playing in the Oberliga since 1978. In the 2007–08 season they qualified for the newly founded 3. Liga, where they lasted until 2011 when they were relegated to the Regionalliga. This ended 33 consecutive years of playing in the highest league that the German Football Association permits the second team of a professional football team to play.|$|E
5000|$|Eight {{straight}} wins in 1985 extended Preston's winning {{stretch to}} a record 23, the highest of any surviving V.F.L. club, but {{with the loss of}} Shaw to the Diamond Valley, retirement of a few experienced players and the movement of several <b>promising</b> <b>younger</b> players to League ranks, Preston's period of dominance was at an end. The club reached a further four finals series between 1985 and 1990, winning the minor premiership in 1990, but was eliminated from the finals by Williamstown on all four occasions. During this time, the club unearthed a new legend in Jamie [...] "Spider" [...] Shaw who kicked 106 in his first season and followed up with an astonishing 146 in 1986 before an unsuccessful stint at Fitzroy.|$|R
