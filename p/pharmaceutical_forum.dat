40|$|AbstractIn {{response}} to a recommendation from the <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Forum,</b> the European Medicines Agency and the European network for Health Technology Assessment initiated a collaboration with the aim to improve the contribution regulatory assessment reports can make to the assessment of relative effectiveness of medicinal products by health technology assessment bodies. This collaboration on improving European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) started in February 2010 and was performed over 2 years. As a result, the templates for preparing EPARs were revised to better {{address the needs of}} heath technology organizations. The better understanding of information needs was a key outcome of the collaboration. To ascertain whether these template changes led to the inclusion of relevant information, a review of a small set of EPARs for recently approved medicinal products was carried out in parallel by both the European network for Health Technology Assessment and the European Medicines Agency. This report provides an account of this project on improving EPARs, {{which is part of the}} ongoing dialogue between regulators and health technology assessment bodies on a European level to support policymaker decisions in the future...|$|E
40|$|Enhancing health {{literacy}} is increasingly {{seen as a}} strategy to combat poverty, eliminate social exclusion (European Union, 2008; High-Level <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Forum,</b> 2008) and reduce health inequalities (European Commission, 2010). The European Union 2008 â€“ 2013 Health Strategy asserts {{that it is a}} competence required for wellbeing and is in line with the European Framework of Key Com-petences for Lifelong Learning (Borg & Mayo, 2006). The field of {{health literacy}} emerged soon after the publication of the first waves of international surveys of adult literacy skills in industrialised nations in the 1990 s. Findings indicated that a majority of adults in most industrialised nations had difficulty in using commonly available print material and accomplishing every day tasks (Kirsch et al., 1993; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-opment, 1995). These analyses spurred health researchers to consider possible health consequences. Subsequent research established clear links between literacy skills and health outcomes (Berkman et al., 2004; Institute of Medicine. Commit-tee on Health Literacy, 2004; Rudd, 2003). Studies provide strong evidence of th...|$|E
40|$|When the new {{regulatory}} framework for medicinal products was adopted in 2004, the European Parliament overwhelmingly rejected the Commissions proposal to remove the ban on direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs by 494 votes to 42, even {{under the guise of}} "pilot project " (a) (2). However, already in 2005 the Commission undermined this choice notably by establishing the European <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Forum,</b> whose remit is, among others, to draft proposals within the framework of public private partnerships relating to information to patients. The pharmaceutical industry is over-represented in this group (2). During 2007, the European Commission, particularly the DG Enterprise and Industry, held numerous consultations on information to patients. The consultation published on 5 February 2008 was the fourth since May 2007 on this issue (3). In this consultation, the Commission proposes legal changes that would allow pharmaceutical companies to communicate directly to the public about prescription medicines. The Commission is maintaining its project to deregulate direct-to-consumer communication by pharmaceutical companies, ignoring the results of previous consultations Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs is banned worldwide except in two countries where it is increasingly being challenged (the USA and New Zealand) (4). This ban is one of the means of providing protection to citizens, guaranteed by the status of prescription drug. The results of the numerous consultations on information to patients held by the European Commission during 2007 clearly indicate that nearly all stakeholders are vehemently opposed to direct-to-consumer communication by pharmaceutical companies (3, 5, 6, 7). Third open letter to: Interested partie...|$|E
50|$|<b>FORUM</b> <b>Pharmaceuticals,</b> who {{currently}} is subjecting {{the drug to}} the FDA approval process, had all studies suspended until further notice in fall of 2015 due to rare, but serious gastrointestinal problems occurring in patients participating in the drug trial, potentially being a consequence of taking the drug. The trials were scheduled to be run until January 2017, but as of December 2016, they appear to still be on hold. There is speculation by <b>FORUM</b> <b>Pharmaceuticals</b> {{that this may be}} due to either the increased daily dose given in the phase III trial compared to earlier trials that showed promise. In previous trials, the highest dose given was 2 mg/day, with the most positive of effects having been realized in patients taking the largest dose (2 mg/day). In the phase III trial, all patients were treated with 3 mg/day doses of the drug. FORUM also speculates that the increase of gastrointestinal problems occurring in the phase III trial could be due to the increased demographic risk that elderly (the average age in the study was 75) and those with Alzheimer's disease have in regard to gastrointestinal issues, citing another study they conducted with a younger demographic (in which the average age was 35-40) for the treatment of schizophrenia of 1,500 individuals in which there were zero complains of gastrointestinal problems.|$|R
40|$|Pharmaco{{economics}} is {{a branch}} of health economics related to the most economical and efficient use of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacoeconomic research identifies, measures and compares the costs and outcomes (clinical, economic and humanistic) of pharmaceutical products and services. Pharmacoeconomic evaluation can {{play a significant role}} in the efficient allocation of resources in healthcare systems with constrained budgets. Countries are trying to control the rising costs of health care in their aging population. They are all asking the same question: Is the new drug good value for money; and if so, what is the society willing to pay for it? This article reviews the importance of, and the need for, adaptation of pharmacoeconomic analysis to the conditions in Saudi Arabia. It will shed some light on the important steps for converting the concept into practice, including the need for identifying the willing-to-pay (WTP) or the threshold cutoff, the existence of a real cost for each utility, the nonexistence of an pharmacoeconomic advisory <b>forum,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> budget allocation, and the impact of pharmaceutical marketing. It will also provide recommendations for easing any challenges that might jeopardize the conduct of such analysis in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of nanotechnology in healthcare is widely {{accepted as a}} potential driver of biomedical innovation. By exploiting the unique physical and physicochemical interactions {{at the molecular level}} nanotechnology based products (also known as nanomedicines) can monitor, repair and control biological systems in order to address diseases for which currently no or only insufficient diagnostic and therapeutic tools are available. Nanotechnology will also play an enabling role in the implementation of personalised medicine as it provides tools for a better prediction and early diagnosis, the design of personalised treatment as well as a close monitoring of the therapeutic success. However, the opportunities of nanotechnologies in the health sector are coming along with challenges in the regulation of this emerging product class. Sufficient knowledge on their quality, safety and efficacy must be gained and standardised methods must be made available to support the regulatory decision making and allow a smooth translation towards clinical applications. The current survey was performed within the "nanomedicine" working group of the International <b>Pharmaceutical</b> Regulators <b>Forum</b> (IPRF) with the aim to get a general overview on the status and regulatory needs of nanomedicines. The survey demonstrated strong regional differences in the regulation of nanomedicines and demonstrated that in the last years, the European authorities have received fewer applications of nanotechnology based pharmaceuticals as e. g. the USA. However, a future increase of market applications must be anticipated in Europe as other regions which have a better ecosystem for the marketing of nanomedicines are already facing challenges in the regulation of nanotech products. These expectations are supported {{by the fact that the}} last EC's framework programmes have invested hundreds of millions of Euro into nanomedicine development in order to make these promising products available to the patient. An intensive exchange of experience in the regulation of nanodrugs between regulatory bodies is now necessary to ensure harmonised regulation of products internationally. The respondents of the survey confirmed the need for the harmonisation of information requirements on nanospecific properties. A number of critical physicochemical properties have already been proposed in the scientific literature and their relevance for regulatory decisions was verified within the survey. Some regulatory agencies also indicated the need for additional (eco) toxicological testing triggered by the nanospecific property of the product. Finally, there was consensus among the regulatory agencies for a need of an independent nanocharacterisation testing facility that can support regulators in the evaluation of sophisticated material and the performance of new test methods before entering into clinical applications.
