40|$|The role {{of exotic}} tree <b>plantations</b> for {{biodiversity}} conservation is contested. Such <b>plantations</b> nevertheless offer various ecosystem service benefits, which include carbon storage and facilitation of indigenous tree species regeneration. To assess forest restoration potential in tropical exotic tree <b>plantations,</b> we assessed native cloud forest tree regeneration in 166 plots in ca. 50 -year-old <b>plantations</b> of five timber {{species that are}} widely used in tropical <b>plantations</b> (Pinus patula, Eucalyptus saligna, Cupressus lusitanica, Grevillea robusta and Acacia mearnsii). Differences in species abundance, diversity and composition were compared among <b>plantations,</b> and between <b>plantations</b> and disturbed and undisturbed indigenous Afromontane cloud forest (southeast Kenya) relicts after controlling for environmental variation between plots (i. e. altitude, distance to indigenous forest, soil depth, slope, aspect) and for environmental and stand structural variation (i. e. dominant tree height and basal area). Regenerating trees were mostly early-successional species. Indigenous tree species regeneration was significantly higher in Grevillea <b>plantations,</b> where the seedling community also included late-successional tree species. Regeneration under Eucalyptus was particularly poor. Acacia had an strong invasive nature, reducing its potential role and usability in indigenous forest restoration. Our study underlined that exotic tree <b>plantations</b> have differential effects on native tree species regeneration, with high potential for Grevillea <b>plantations</b> and low potential for the invasive exotic species. status: publishe...|$|R

We evaluated amphibian richness and diversity in 15 coffee <b>plantations</b> from three different regimes; organic coffee <b>plantations,</b> NPK coffee <b>plantations</b> and pesticide use coffee <b>plantations</b> in Kodagu District, Western Ghats, India.
