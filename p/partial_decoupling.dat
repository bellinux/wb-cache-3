40|$|The current {{industrial}} {{standard for the}} control of the induction motor is the so called vector control (VC) or field-orientated control (FOC) which transforms and controls the induction motor as a direct current (DC) motor. Besides its many advantages, such as fast and decoupled dynamics of speed and flux, {{it is well known that}} VC depends on the detailed system model and is very sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external disturbance (load torque). To clarify further the VC is a only a partial feedback linearising control which can achieve the decoupling of speed and flux asymptotically. The coupling still exists when flux is not kept in constant, i. e. when flux is weakened in order to operate the motor at a higher speed and keep the input voltage within saturation limits, or when flux is adjusted to maximize power efficiency of the motor with light load. The thesis will summarise research of advanced control approaches of induction motors in Chapter One. The Chapter Two starts on building a fifth-order nonlinear dynamic model of an induction motor and then recalls the principal of traditional VC of induction motors. The differential-geometric technique based nonlinear control has developed for induction motors, which can convert some intractable nonlinear problems into simpler problems by familiar linear system methods. The <b>partial</b> <b>decoupled</b> dynamic of the conventional VC has been investigated via feedback linearisation control (FLC) at first. Then input-output linearisation control is applied to design a fully decoupled control of the dynamics of speed and flux. To remove the weak robustness and the requirement of an accurate model of the VC and FLC, a novel nonlinear adaptive control of induction motor is designed based on feedback linearisation control and perturbation estimation. The induction motor will be represented as a two coupled interconnected subsystems: rotor speed subsystem and rotor flux subsystem, respectively. System perturbation terms are defined to include the lumped term of system nonlinearities, uncertainties, and interactions between subsystems and are represented as a fictitious state in the state equations. Then perturbations are estimated by designing perturbation observers and the estimated perturbations are employed to cancel the real system perturbations, assumed all internal states are measured. The designed nonlinear adaptive control doesn’t require the accurate model of the induction motor and has a simpler algorithm. It can fully decouple the regulation of rotor speed and rotor flux and handle time-varying uncertainties. The parameter estimations based on nonlinear adaptive controls can only deal with unknown constant parameters and are not suitable for handling fast time-varying and functional uncertainties. Nonlinear adaptive control based on output measurements is addressed in Chapter Five, assuming that the rotor speed and the stator volatge/currents are measurable. A sliding mode rotor flux observer has been designed based on the stator voltage and current. Moreover, two third-order state and perturbation observers are designed to estimate the unmeasured states and perturbation, based on the rotor speed and the estimated rotor flux. Simulation studies have been carried out for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed advanced controllers and compared with the conventional VC and model based FLC...|$|R

In contrast, VSWTs cannot naturally deliver any inertial power into the electrical grid due to <b>partial</b> or full <b>decoupling</b> between rotor speed and grid frequency via the power converter. Nevertheless, modern VSWTs are capable of providing an emulated inertial response that is superior to that of conventional generators, due to their faster, more accurate and flexible active power controls and the wide range over which the wind turbine rotor speed can vary [17, 23, 26, 33, 51].

We find that low-viscosity systems can spend a substantial period of time in a fully decoupled state, with the nuclear bar slowly tumbling in the gravitational field of the primary bar. Higher viscosity systems form nuclear bars which librate about the primary bar. The shape of a nuclear bar, i. e., its eccentricity, correlates strongly with the angle between the bars.

Terrigenous 'red beds' are developed throughout the sequence and represent three main depositional settings: (1) a braided fluvial system over a lower energy, river-dominated coastal plain, (2) a low-energy, barred lagoon or bight, and (3) a non- marine, playa lake. A significant component of the sequence consists of biostromal and biohermal columnar stromatolites accreted in shallow-water, low-energy, intertidal zones, barred evaporitic lagoons and peritidal evaporitic environments. Only {{a small portion of}} stromatolites might have been accreted in relatively 'open' marine environments. The red, flat-laminated, dolomitic and magnesite stromatolites formed in evaporative ephemeral ponds, coastal sabkhas and playa lakes. Tepees, mudcracks, pseudomorphs after calcium sulphate, halite casts, and abundant 'red beds' in the sequence suggest that (1) terrestrial environments dominated over aqueous, and (2) <b>partial</b> or total <b>decoupling</b> took place between the stromatolite-dominated depositional systems and the bordering sea.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of how one can combine theoretical and numerical modeling approaches with limited measurements from laboratory flow cell experiments to realistically quantify salient features of complex mixing-driven multicomponent reactive transport problems in porous media. Flow cells are commonly used to examine processes affecting reactive transport through porous media, under controlled conditions. An advantage of flow cells is their suitability for relatively fast and reliable experiments, although measuring spatial distributions of a state variable within the cell is often difficult. In general, fluid is sampled only at the flow cell outlet, and concentration measurements are usually interpreted in terms of integrated reaction rates. In reactive transport problems, however, the spatial distribution of the reaction rates within the cell might be more important than the bulk integrated value. Recent advances in theoretical and numerical modeling of complex reactive transport problems [12, 13] result in a methodology conducive to a simple exact expression for the space-time distribution of reaction rates in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous reactions in chemical equilibrium. The key points of the methodology are that a general reactive transport problem, involving a relatively high number of chemical species, can be formulated in terms of a set of <b>decoupled</b> <b>partial</b> differential equations, and the amount of reactants evolving into products depends on the rate at which solutions mix. The main objective of the current study is to show how this methodology can be used in conjunction with laboratory experiments to properly describe the key processes that occur in a complex, geochemically-active system under chemical equilibrium conditions. We model three CaCO 3 dissolution experiments reported in Singurindy et al. [48, 49], in which saltwater and freshwater were mixed in different proportions. The integrated reaction rate within the cell estimated from the experiments are modeled independently by means of (a) a state-of-the-art reactive transport code, and (b) the uncoupled methodology of [12, 13], both of which use dispersivity as a single, adjustable parameter. The good agreement between the results from both methodologies demonstrates the feasibility of using simple solutions to design and analyze laboratory experiments involving complex geochemical problems...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of faults that were repeatedly reactivated under changing stress fields. The investigations were carried out at the junction between the Upper Rhine Graben and the Jura Mountains. This area represents the intersection between part of the western European Cenozoic rift system and the northern Alpine foreland. It has been shaped by an interplay between extensional and compressional tectonic forces and involved the repeated reactivation of crustal-scale faults since the Late Palaeozoic. At present, it is characterised by increased seismicity, giving proof of ongoing tectonic activity. Therefore, studying the tectonic evolution of this area can improve the understanding of various tectonic precesses that shape the earth's crust. Extension in the Upper Rhine Graben initiated in the Late Eocene under W-E- to WNW-ESE-oriented extension. Its southern end connects into the Rhine-Bresse transfer zone. This transfer zone linked the simultaneous extension in both the Upper Rhine Graben and the Bresse Graben, another branch of the European Cenozoic rift system. The transition from mainly rift-perpendicular extension in the Upper Rhine Graben to sinistral transtensive movements in the Rhine-Bresse transfer zone was predetermined by ENE-trending basement faults delimiting a Late Palaeozoic trough system in the subsurface. Rifting involved the reactivation of these ENE-trending basement faults as sinistral transtensive strike-slip faults, simultaneously with normal faulting along NNE-oriented faults. In the sedimentary cover, this was manifested in simultaneous extensional flexuring above ENE-trending faults and growth faulting above NNE-oriented faults. The interaction of these differently oriented faults led to cumulative throw and localised depocenters in the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene. The formation of the thin-skinned Jura Mountains in the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene initiated under NW-SE- to N-W-oriented compression and was related to Alpine orogeny. In the study area, the detached sediments encountered a fault pattern inherited from Palaeogene rifting. While ENE- to E-trending faults led to the nucleation of frontal thrusts and anticlines, NNE-trending faults paralleling the Rhine Graben served as transfer zones. Along these transfer zones, sinistral oblique ramps developed and allowed the detached sediments to be transferred sinistrally to the north. As a result, the northern Jura Mountains reveal a geometry that largely mimics the structural pattern inherited from Palaeogene extensional tectonics. Thin-skinned Jura folding was followed by post-Late Pliocene thick-skinned fault reactivation, as evidenced in the spatial coincidence between subsurface faults and surface anticlines. This youngest tectonic phase characterised by horizontal shortening rates below 0. 1 mm/a, is most presumably ongoing at present, as evidenced by faulted Late Pliocene gravels and deflected rivers. Dynamically scaled sand-silicone models showed that within wrench systems, the reactivation of faults in a sand cover, separated from a basal discontinuity by a viscous décollement layer, is strongly controlled by the mechanical coupling between "basement" and "cover" across a décollement layer. The coupling in turn depends on the displacement rates applied to the basal plate. The experimental setup was inspired from the Rhine-Bresse transfer zone (RBTZ) that connected the Upper Rhine Graben with the Bresse Graben. This transfer zone bears evidence for the reactivation of basement-rooted structures in Neogene times. The experimental results suggest not only that fault reactivation i the RBTZ has occurred under low displacement rates, but they also provide an explanation for <b>partial</b> stress <b>decoupling</b> between cover and basement...|$|R

It is shown here that this approximation and further frequency approximations are not necessary and may lead to significant errors for some high-gain laser systems. A more exact analysis also reveals a <b>partial</b> <b>decoupling</b> of the electric and magnetic fields that occurs with fast transient phenomena. These ideas are illustrated in terms of well-known dynamical effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} gridfriendly ultrafast {{electric}} vehicle charging demonstrator. High charging power and short charging times impose peaks to an electricity distribution system, which necessitate over-dimensioning of the grid connection. A mitigation option lies in <b>partial</b> <b>decoupling</b> the load from the grid, achieved with the application of energy storage elements. A calculation methodology for energy storage elements is proposed and their interconnection possibilities to an ultrafast EV charging spot discussed. Index Terms — electric vehicles, energy storage, ultrafast charging. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} tree level ``resonant'' $N$ tachyon {{scattering}} amplitudes, which define a sensible ``bulk'' S [...] matrix in critical (super) string theory in any dimension, {{have a simple}} structure in two dimensional space time, due to <b>partial</b> <b>decoupling</b> of a certain infinite set of discrete states. We also argue that the general (non resonant) amplitudes {{are determined by the}} resonant ones, and calculate them explicitly, finding an interesting analytic structure. Finally, we discuss the space time interpretation of our results. Comment: 55 page...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe initial {{decoupling}} of the (6 √(3) x 6 √(3)) R 30 degrees {{buffer layer}} also called zero layer graphene (ZLG) on 6 H-SiC(00 0 1) by Si intercalation {{has been investigated}} by means of high resolution photoemission spectroscopy (HRPES) and microscopy imaging techniques. A combination of complementary techniques {{has shown that the}} annealing above 700 degrees C of amorphous Si deposited on ZLG leads to the diffusion of the silicon over the surface. Two competing processes are then observed. Part of the silicon contributes to a progressive decoupling of the ZLG from the substrate (<b>partial</b> <b>decoupling)</b> while the rest agglomerates at the surface to form oriented silicon clusters. After sequences of Si deposition, followed by annealing at 750 degrees C, complete decoupling is observed into quasi-free standing monolayer (ML) graphene. Investigation of the evolution of the C 1 s and Si 2 p core levels during the intermediate states shows that the appearance of the graphene contribution coincides with the creation of an extra SiC bulk component, indicating their electronic decoupling. At <b>partial</b> <b>decoupling</b> of the ZLG, we have the coexistence of structurally linked metal-semiconducting materials presenting mutual electronic interactions and composed of nanometric metal-semiconducting heterojunctions.
