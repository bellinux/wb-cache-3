5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a <b>part</b> <b>for</b> full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E

Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in <b>part</b> <b>for</b> what it reveals about how Victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings.|$|E
