50|$|In agriculture, a <b>pulper</b> is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to remove pulp (I.e. the soft flesh from agricultural produce). For example, in coffee growing the ripe, red cherries are picked from the coffee bushes and prior to fermentation and later drying the soft pulp {{needs to be}} removed (otherwise a potentially uncontrollable fermentation/rot will occur). In the case of coffee the pulping is normally done in a <b>pulper</b> that is either hand-cranked or engine-driven; the beans are emptied into an elevated hopper and then dropped through a narrow slot within which they {{come into contact with}} a rotating spiked drum that removes the pulp or flesh. Again in the case of coffee, the sticky beans that result from this process then have to be washed, fermented, washed again and dried prior to further processing (milling to remove the parchment) and then roasting.|$|E

5000|$|Within 24 {{hours of}} picking, the cherry is {{run through a}} <b>pulper.</b> The beans are {{separated}} from the pulp and then placed overnight in a fermentation tank. The fermentation time is about 12 hours at low elevation or 24 at higher elevation. The beans are rinsed and spread to dry on a hoshidana or drying rack. Traditional hoshidanas have a rolling roof to cover the beans in rain. It takes seven to 14 days to dry beans to an optimal moisture level of between 10 and 13% (by Hawaii Department of Agriculture regulations: 9.0-12.0%). Too much moisture content in coffee allows the growth of ochratoxin A, a harmful mycotoxin, hazardous to human health. From here, the beans are stored as [...] "pergamino" [...] or parchment.

The beans are periodically raked to ensure even drying. Once dried, the beans will form a thin, paper-like shell called parchment. Once formed, the parchment will increase the beans’ storage life considerably. When the beans are ready, the parchment is removed, and the beans are graded and sorted according size, weight and defects. The sorted beans are then stored in 60 or 70 kg sacks called sisal bags that help the beans retain moisture {{for a longer period of}} time. [...] The storage time cannot exceed one year for the beans to be considered a current crop. If the green coffee remains in storage for longer than a year, it is considered old crop, and is less valuable because of its drier state.|$|E

40|$|DE 19923108 A UPAB: 20010213 NOVELTY - Waste is {{comminuted}} {{and subjected}} to water flotation, separating sinks and floats. In addition, a suspended fraction is drawn off, including floating material. Any water-soluble and/or suspended components of the suspended fraction are dispersed or dissolved in a <b>pulper,</b> from which a floats fraction is withdrawn. A second suspension fraction is withdrawn from the <b>pulper</b> over a screen. A second sinks fraction is withdrawn from the <b>pulper.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred Features: Matting, floating materials from flotation, are drawn off from an upper region of the flotation tank. They are comminuted {{and sent to the}} <b>pulper</b> with the first suspension fraction. Comminution is dry, no water being added, and a shredder or crusher being employed. To largely remove or suspend the water soluble and/or suspended components in the <b>pulper,</b> one or more washing stages are effected. Each washing stage is carried out by drawing off each suspension in the <b>pulper</b> over the sieve, making up with additional water and renewed, brief mechanical energy input. Pretreatment of waste includes mechanical isolation of solids by breaking up pressed components, opening baling straps and removing any transport constraints, before comminution. Materials capable of causing blockage are removed before comminution. Following addition of water to the waste for flotation or pulping, temperature is raised to 70 deg. C- 90 deg. C for sanitation. Floats and/or the first and/or the second sinks are washed after separation. From floats, one or more plastic fractions are separated, by density-based separation or by selective dissolution. Plastic fractions are prepared for re-use or incineration by shredding, drying and/or granulation. The second suspension fraction is fed to an aerobic reactor.

40|$|The global poultry {{industry}} generates at least 2 million tonnes of chicken feather every year. Feathers are currently hydrolysed into meal used for animal feed and fertilizer. Feather consists of 91 % keratin, 1 % lipid and 8 % water. Raw feather also contains preen oil, offal, faecal matter and poultry processing water. Its morphology consists of barbs extending {{at an angle}} from a central hollow rachis. Impurities coat the entire feather, and particulates are trapped by layers of barbules and hooked barbicels holding adjacent barbs together. These substructures present an extensive and tortuous hydrophobic surface. Feather fibre is a multipurpose, cost effective reinforcement for polymer composites. Its incorporation in plastic, wood, concrete and cardboard makes the product lighter, insulate from heat loss and improve sound attenuation properties. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a process to produce clean fibre recovered from chicken feather. In the treatment process, the heterogeneous characteristics of feather had to be considered. Raw feather was suspended in 25 L water in a <b>pulper</b> to be decontaminated using 2 stages of 0. 1485 % sodium hypochlorite adjusted to pH 10. 0 with 1 M sodium hydroxide and cleaned in 3 stages of 0. 15 % hydrogen peroxide.

Oil-based four-color inks were separately printed as base printing on coated and uncoated white poster paper, and then extensive pulping and deinking processes were carried out. Standard offset printings were conducted on paper samples using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colors (CMYK), and the effects of deinking efficiency on the removal of each color were analysed. The pulps were made at Micro-Maelstrom Laboratory <b>Pulper</b> at specified conditions with and without bleaching agents.

40|$|The INGEDE {{methods have}} drawn much {{attention}} in the deinking field in recent years. However, many domestic researchers and engineers might confront some inconveniences and/or problems when applying these methods. Some of these matters {{are associated with the}} instruments that are not widely used in the US, such as a vacuum dryer. The others have found less effectiveness compared to the TAPPI standards; such as making filter pads for optical properties tests. In this paper, a complete test procedure has been performed by combining TAPPI test standards and the INGEDE evaluation methods. Since INGEDE didn’t release the differences between paper sheets (1. 2 g OD) and pads (4. 0 g OD) evaluations; both are prepared for each run to discover their correlation.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{detachment of}} ink from the fibre {{surface and the}} prevention of its redeposition onto the surface before its removal in the flotation cell is important in deinking old newsprint (ONP). Magnesium Oxide (MgO) {{has been found to}} be a suitable replacement for sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in flotation deinking in the laboratory but not as effective in mill trials. The reason for the poorer performance is discussed in this paper. The use of NaOH in the deinking cell was found to produce higher ISO brightness, due to its contribution to peroxide bleaching of the fibres, than when MgO is used as the alkali source. Traditional brightness measurements are thus a poor indication of the deinking efficiency. Measurements of R 700 or ERIC are needed to better assess the effect of the different alkalis and other factors on deinking efficiency. MgO has been found to cause more redeposition of ink onto the fibres than when NaOH is used as the alkali. To overcome this, the addition of soap to the <b>pulper</b> when using MgO is important. The addition of silicate and calcium were found to have a detrimental effect and appear to contribute to ink redeposition. Increasing the surface area of the MgO was found to increase its hydration and also improved the deinking efficiency of the MgO. The addition of the MgO as a hydrated slurry was also found to increase deinking efficiency...|$|E

Flotation deinking of high quality office paper, printed in a digital duplicating machine based on screen-printing system, was studied using a laboratory cell with a nominal capacity of 10 L. Formamidine sulfinic acid was used in a <b>pulper</b> and pulping conditions such as temperature, retention time, chemical dosage and consistency were held constant prior to flotation process. During the flotation process while pulp consistency, agitation speed, air flow rate and other conditions keeping constant, only flotation time were analyzed in terms of physical properties of resulting pulp quality, pulp yield, filler and fibre balance and waste water quality aspects at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 minutes. Increased flotation time substantially affected optical properties of pulp up to some point then became steady. Yield losses increased {{as might be expected}} with increasing flotation time by the 9 th minute as flotation sludge skimmed off on top of the flotation cell. Filler content of flotation sludge increased with increasing flotation time while fibre content was decreasing to a certain extent. Thanks to removal of ink and filler materials from pulp physical properties of evaluated handsheets enhanced. The overall results demonstrate that increasing flotation time increased physical and optical properties of resulting pulp. On the other hand flotation time should be increased up to critical point.

40|$|Abstract Stickies {{refer to}} tacky {{contaminants}} in recovered paper, excluding wood extractives. Stickies originate from adhesives, ink binders and coating binders. Stickies {{able to pass}} a sieve of 100 or 150 μm (depending on standard) are called micro stickies, whereas the particles retained on the screen are called macro stickies. Dissolved and colloidal stickies are called secondary stickies. There are standard methods for macro stickies, but a standard method measuring {{the total amount of}} stickies is lacking. Furthermore, the size distribution, and nature of stickies in the sense if they are free particles or agglomerated with some other substances, has not been previously known. The information on the removal of stickies in different unit operations was also not known very well except for macro stickies. The aim of this thesis was thus to develop an analysis method for the total amount of stickies, determine the size distribution and nature of stickies, and find ways to better remove stickies in the deinking process. Extraction with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with Size Exclusion Column (SEC) was used here to separate hydrophobic polymers (stickies) from the pulp suspension. An Evaporating solvent Light Scattering (ELS) detector was utilized to quantify the polymers after SEC. This analysis procedure was used in this thesis to measure stickies. Fractionation of pulp before the analysis was carried out if information of different-sized stickies was desired. The majority of stickies are micro stickies. A significant, although lower, portion of stickies are macrostickies, especially {{in the beginning of the}} deinking process. The dissolved and colloidal phase was found to contain wood extractives, and only trace amounts of stickies. Flotation is very effective in stickies removal. Ink and micro stickies were removed nearly equally in flotation, because they both are hydrophobic and are both in an optimal size range for removal in flotation. Ink measurements may be used for estimating the trends of stickies removal in flotation. The stickies removal in flotation may be enhanced by optimizing the <b>pulper</b> chemistry...|$|E

In order to understand the nutraceutical and medicinal characteristics of Physalis fruits cultivated in Egypt, the biochemical composition of the raw Physalis pubescens juice was determined. Materials and methods. Whole fresh fruits of Physalis pubescens from Egypt were preserved at – 20 °C for the duration of the experiment. The juice was extracted from Physalis fruits by using a fruit <b>pulper</b> then filtered on cheesecloth to separate seeds and skins. Contents of oil, fatty acids, protei ns, amino acids, sugars an d minerals of the juice were analyzed, and were compared and discussed in relation to the biochemical composition of other fruits and vegetable oils. Results. Yield of the juice was high (64 %) and it is a rich source of minerals such as potassium (11. 32 g· 100 g – 1 dm), phosphorus (5. 55 g· 100 g – 1 dm), zinc (0. 02 g· 100 g – 1 dm) and boron (0. 01 g· 100 g – 1 dm), polyphenols (76. 6 mg· 100 mL – 1) and carotenoids (70 μg·mL – 1). It contained good amounts of vitamin C (38. 77 mg· 100 mL – 1) and it could be a good potential source of essential amino acids such as isoleucine, valine and tryptophan [(4. 2, 3. 9 and 3. 9) g· 100 g – 1 protein], whose amounts were higher than those recommended by the FAO / WHO / UNU. Additionally, it contains a low amount of oil (1. 1 g· 100 g – 1 dm). Conclusion. Physalis juice should attract great interest because of its composition. Its potential nutraceutical quality could participate in the development of Physalis as a commercial crop. Certain molecule s such as antimicrobial molecules and bioactive withanolides, which have the famous ethnomedical and medical effects of Physalis juice, still have to be studied.

40|$|New market {{opportunities}} are now providing a still largely unexploited niche for smaller-scale food processing. These lie between the hive {{of activity in}} the informal sector and the large private or public African businesses, based on imported industrial technology. Whereas urban processors have undoubted advantages, especially their proximity to large markets, the backers of smaller enterprises often find advantage in setting up businesses in the industrial areas of large rural centres or in small towns. The conditions needed {{for the development of}} private businesses in the modern sector are still far from being satisfied in many ACP countries. These conditions include more or less stable and open markets; fixed regulations and rules within which businesses can operate; simultaneous presence of the competing and complementary modern and informal sectors; availability of credit and access to technical and commercial know-how. The additional problems of lack of infrastructure, water and electricity, need to be overcome in order for businesses to be set up outside the main urban areas (see Spore No 60 - What has rural life to offer). The tremendous opportunities for food processing do, however, offer many possibilities for setting up smaller plants in the rural areas, even though the potential for adding value to local resources through the processing of fruits, cereals, milk, oilseeds and fish depends very much on the locality. These 'village industries' contribute greatly {{to the development of the}} rural economy They provide added income to the small farmers who supply raw materials and create job opportunities for many other people. These industries also generally improve the quality of the raw material and reduce post-harvest losses. Making use, by definition, of local resources, they supply products in high demand, reduce the need for imports and contribute to the overall national economy Food processing industries already contribute considerably to African national economies. One of the conclusions of a workshop held in April, 1996 in Stuttgart in Germany under the auspices of Food-Net/RESAA (a network of NGOs and European institutions that promote appropriate technology) was that 'Food processing accounts for some 40 % of the value added by all manufacturing industries. ' These activities, which are 'for the most part small or informal businesses are a major source of rural employment because they create jobs and income for about 60 % of the sub-Saharan African labour force, most of whom are women, who thereby earn the money needed to support their families. ' This strong emphasis on women is a characteristic of the sector but may act as a brake on small business development in so far as women unfortunately also tend to have less access to improved technology, extension services and credit. Informal and urban markets The rapidly expanding urban areas and the informal urban food sector, provide opportunities for consumption of a large proportion of rural production. The difficulties of gaining access to profitable but highly competitive markets thus constitute a first set of problems. These limit the growth potential of food processing businesses that are not within the immediate neighbourhood of the major urban conurbations. Whilst already a long way from being negligible, the opportunities will increase as the proportion of the total population living in urban areas also increases. A perspective study by the Club du Sahel, the African Development Bank and CILSS estimates that 270 million of the expected total of 430 million people in West Africa in 2020 will be living in 6, 000 urban areas of more than 5, 000 people and that there will be more than 300 large centres with populations in excess of 100, 000 inhabitants. These will provide just as many opportunities for marketing rural products and will certainly be easier to access than the very large clues. Whether managed by an individual or a small group, a small business might well decide to start operations in the catchment area of a secondary urban zone. In addition to the necessary basic services, such a zone can potentially provide a profitable outlet for production. Initially demand may be limited but this need not be an impediment provided that the supply does not exceed the demand. By improving its technical ability, by broadening its range of products and by producing a variety of items from a single primary product (pasteurized milk making butter, yoghurt and cheese, for example) a small enterprise can expand its business in the local market. Capturing new and more distant but larger markets, possibly in the capital city or abroad, will then determine the rate of expansion of the business. This type of progression faces many obstacles but the chances of success are increased in relation to the nearness of the primary resources which it utilizes and which provide a comparative advantage over business competition located in the major towns. Advantages of rural processing A significant advantage can be gained by processing locally a highly perishable product and reducing losses through early treatment. Milk and fruit offer the best advantages and are much better for processing than, for example, cereals which store better as grain than as flour. Cassava also supplies a whole downstream chain of businesses which, while being largely informal in nature, are very active. It is thus logical that milk, fruit and cassava processing are now the main ventures of the modern food processing sector outside the major cities. Distance is certainly a handicap when it comes to gaining an awareness of, adapting to, and manipulating the market. This can be overcome to a large extent by organizing delivery and achieving savings in the cost of raw materials. For example, five small businesses in Haiti that produce guava and pineapple jam could triple the size of their businesses without any marketing problems if they were able to find sufficient supply (see Spore 61 - Fruit processing in Haiti). With the exception of the large export-oriented and intensively managed plantations, smaller scattered plantations are now facing considerable losses. Thus, for example, 80 % of the mangoes of the Bio Guinea Company at Kindia to the north of Conakry simply rot where they have fallen due to lack of a market. Building a processing plant near to the production site provides impetus for proper harvesting regimes, whose effect is enhanced if the processing enterprise pays at least part of the purchase price at the time of delivery. Using the products as collateral for credit Smaller businesses are limited by lack of funds and an almost total absence of credit. Even when only limited investment is needed to buy processing machinery, heavy operating costs must still be financed. Customer allegiance, which is a basic tenet of efficient modern marketing, demands that the products (fruit juices or jam, for example) be available on shop shelves at all times. To be able to fulfil this demand, and to provide goods throughout the year in spite of the seasonal nature of the primary product, a business and its partners must build up a stock of finished products at harvest time. Financing these stocks is a further heavy burden which is added to by the need for appropriate storage. Motorized <b>pulper</b> Providing a guarantee of payment to a potential lender is a basic condition for obtaining credit. In order to overcome the problem of restructuring the cereal markets PRMC (Programme de restructuration du marché céralier) established a system in Mali in 1982, that linked management of food aid with provision of credit to the large and small private businesses which took over cereal marketing from the state organization. With the exception of emergency assistance, food aid is sold to commercial businesses, which then further sell on the open market. The nominal value of the cereals and some external financing provide the collateral which, in the absence of any concern by the banking system, is needed for the merchants to obtain credit. As a guarantee the merchants' stocks are maintained in independent storage (which is paid for) under good conditions of hygiene and are released in blocks as and when the loan is repaid. Although it is restricted to cereals this system, known as 'third party storage', proves that a Government can stimulate efficient private sector activity through close collaboration with the businesses that it wants to promote. Market studies and business management Among factors limiting the activities of small-scale food processing businesses the FoodNet/RESAA workshop noted the lack of adequate market information and problems associated with selling the finished product. Many countries do, however, have universities or professionals that would be able to provide such information. The cost of procuring information and marketing might induce several businesses to group together to finance them, along with some national and international assistance. In order to remain close to the production base while marketing their finished product in distant markets, small businesses may seek some advantageous arrangement with a large wholesaler. In this way the final added value must be shared. For this to be equitable, the processor must have accurate information on the retail price and the real costs incurred by the wholesaler. The FoodNet/RESAA workshop proposed, however, an alternative and less dependent strategy which several small businesses could adopt by joining together to market their products communally. The proposal was to form an organization, which must as far as possible, be under the control of the processors and be paid for by charging a percentage of the final sale price. The need for public involvement Relieved of the need for routine business management by economic liberalization and privatization, governments now, more than ever, have the responsibility of ensuring that policies and legal frameworks encourage development of the private sector. There are several ways in which the public sector can act. To improve the advantages of processing plants being close to the production site and to encourage business investment, local authorities can offer a range of incentives. One such is to provide land free-of- rent and another is to reduce, or even eliminate, local taxes for these businesses for a short or long period. As yet, there has not been sufficient research on the ways by which the traditional processing methods of many smaller businesses may be improved. An expert in this field is Mathurin Coffi Nago of the National University of Benin, who emphasizes that 'improved processing methods can lead to reductions in losses of the primary product while improving the efficiency of labour' (see Spore 63 - Small business opportunities are there for the taking). Ultimately, the economic performance of small businesses will also vary with the amount of tax they have to pay. In Uganda, for example, there is no tax on industrial machinery whereas in Burkina Faso it is in the range of 50 - 80 %. Is local development likely to be encouraged when, as for example in Mauritania, a plant for processing camel milk into cheese has to pay 30 % import duty on its packaging material, whereas the same packaging on imported European cheese which competes with it is taxed at only 10 %? (see Spore 55 - Curds and why?) Equipment for juice extraction Whether supportive or discouraging, it is legal frameworks and sectoral policies that largely determine the success of a private business: applied correctly, they can help the development of the food processing industries on which the national economy and the rural areas are in so much need. New {{market opportunities}} are now providing a still largely unexploited niche for smaller-scale food processing.
