40|$|Abstract Deo & Piñango (2011) {{propose a}} novel account of measure adverbials like {{for an hour}} that focuses on their puzzling scopal behavior, their ability to shift predicates into {{iterative}} interpretations, and the higher processing cost that this shift engenders. The scopal behavior, though not the processing cost, had been previously modeled in classical accounts of for-adverbials (e. g., Dowty 1979; Krifka 1998). Unlike these accounts, D&P do not provide a semantic explanation of the aspectual sensitivity of for-adverbials. I argue that only a synthesis of D&P and classical accounts captures the full empirical <b>picture.</b> This <b>synthesis</b> both restores the explanation of the aspectual sensitivity, and improves on D&P’s account of the scopal behavior.

40|$|This {{document}} charts a painter’s {{intention to}} evolve ambiguous and geographically indeterminate spaces that are potentially neither inside nor outside, {{public or private}} that are constructed from two dimensional images, in an unremitting state of realisation, keeping our view in constant motion. Postmodern discourses relating to interiority and discussed in architecture and interior design were used as a lens to extend and challenge the context and content of this figurative painting practice. Architectural theorist Beatriz Colomina’s critique of Peter and Alison Smithson’s House of the Future (1956), {{laid the groundwork for}} the theoretical position of this project, by focusing upon how domestic conditions are dichotomous. Anthony Vidler’s writing on Architecture Cornered: Notes on the Anxiety of Architecture and the theories of Jeanette Budgett on the curtain designs of Petra Blaisse, appraise the domestic interior in new ways. they all draw attention to levels of discomfort in the representation of the domestic realm. To mine the notion of security versus disharmony in paintings of rooms, research began into potential and variable thresholds and boundaries of domestic spaces. 1960 ’s New Zealand modernist interiors, architecture and objects give regional resonance in the experimentation of subject matter. A critical shift from looking to an interior as subject, to a pivotal focus on the interiority of the practice resulted in a greater awareness of process in the construction of paintings. Clarification of key procedural approaches led to an apparent division of subject matter into the re-presentation of portraiture, and paintings of fabricated rooms. This strategy established a dialogue that sets up tensions between both subject and painting conventions in the manipulation of spatial ambiguity in the <b>picture</b> plane. <b>Synthesis</b> of theoretical and practical research culminates in populated painted aggregations of the domestic interior, paintings that make manifest a re-engineering of the familiar through technique, content, and context...|$|R

The vinylaziridines {{have been used}} as substrates in the base induced aza-[2, 3]-Wittig rearrangement to substituted 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridines. The influence of the anion-stabilising group on the reaction outcome has been investigated and it was found that tert-butyl ester enolate promotes a clean conversion to the cis- 2, 6 -disubstituted tetrahydropyridine whereas the use of a TMS-alkyne as anion-stabilising group gives a poor trans- 2, 6 -selectivity. A study on the rearrangement outcome when using disubstituted alkenes as substrates was perused and {{it was found that the}} stereochemical information in the substrate alkene moiety is transmitted to C 3 in the 2, 3, 6 -trisubstituted tetrahydropyridine product.

40|$|X-ray {{absorption}} spectroscopic {{studies from}} several different groups provide a consistent structural <b>picture</b> of methanol <b>synthesis</b> catalysts. Copper metal {{is the principal}} Cu species detected in all in-situ XAS studies. A small amount of Cu(II) persisted in many samples reduced below 600 K, but {{it appears to be}} catalytically irrelevant. Cu(I) was not detected in any of the in-situ XAS studies. The Zn structure did not change in response to chemical treatments in any of the ZnO-containing methanol synthesis catalysts. We conclude that the slow approach to steady-state rate of methanol synthesis from CO/H 2 mixtures cannot result from changes in the Cu metal component of Cu/SiO 2 catalysts. By eliminating this possibility, we provide indirect evidence for the proposal that initial induction periods reflect slow changes in the surface of the SiO 2 or ZnO component in the catalysts. A bifunctional mechanism involving the formation of formate from CO on support hydroxyl groups would increase methanol synthesis rates as OH groups are formed by hydrolysis of Si–O bonds using the H 2 O formed in slow methanation side reactions. The bifunctional mechanism is not required for the synthesis of methanol from CO 2 -containing mixtures, because formate can form on Cu directly from CO 2 and H 2. © 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} {{an effect of}} obesity on cognitive performance {{but there has been}} limited research considering how individual differences in eating behaviour are related to variation in cognitive processes. Differences in cognitive performance influence an individual’s ability to undertake behaviour change or maintain healthy behaviours. This thesis addressed a current gap in the literature by assessing the effect of Restraint, Emotional and External eating behaviour on the cognitive processes involved in undertaking causal reasoning judgements and the inhibition of distraction by food images. Study 1 (N= 176) examined how individual’s causal conditional reasoning (CCR) performance varied dependant on whether the reasoning tasks was based on general or obesity causal relationships. Participants made more accurate, logical reasoning decisions when undertaking obesity CCR tasks compared to general CCR tasks. However, individuals high in restraint did not show the same increase in reasoning ability for obesity tasks, but their performance for general tasks did not differ. Study 2 (N= 110) replicated key findings however, increased levels of restraint were associated with detrimental CCR performance across both conditions. Study 3 (N= 83) confirmed that a participants automatic belief in the causal relationships drove their CCR responses more than controlled, logical processing. Study 4 (N= 31) was the first of three flanker studies examining ability to inhibit distraction by food pictures. Results showed emotional eaters were slower to respond to target pictures, with external eaters displaying a significant reduction in distraction for palatable flanking pictures. Study 5 (N= 47) compared individual differences in cognitive control modulation (CCM) for food and non-food pictures. Results showed emotional and external eaters slower to respond to food pictures, with emotional eaters demonstrating significantly greater levels of CCM for food pictures only. Study 6 (N= 48) found when required to simultaneously process food and non-food pictures, participants respond more strongly to differences in valence of target stimuli. In addition participants were more distracted when responding to sweet targets foods. In summary, the thesis suggest a relationship between eating behaviour traits and cognitive processing when undertaking causal reasoning and inhibiting distraction by food <b>pictures.</b> The <b>synthesis</b> of results indicates emotional and external eating behaviour influences automatic cognitive processes more strongly, with increased levels of restraint influential on controlled cognitive processes. The implications of findings on the design and implementation of behaviour change or maintenance programs is apparent...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel solution-based chemical process to architect hollow spheres of β-Ni(OH) 2 with controllable sizes in submicrometer and micrometer regimes. In the synthesis, starting nickel salt (nitrate) is first converted to 6 -coordinated nickel ion complex [Ni(EDA) 3] 2 + (bidentate ligand EDA = C 2 H 4 (NH 2) 2) to avoid rapid solid formation. Hollow and core - shell β-Ni(OH) 2 spheres {{can be obtained}} with this template-free approach under one-pot conditions. The β-Ni(OH) 2 spheres are constructed from petal-like nanobuilding units which in turn are formed from even smaller nanocrystallites. The obtained porous β-Ni(OH) 2 spheres have a large specific surface area and show a unimodal pore-size distribution. Several preparative parameters have been examined and optimized. In particular, the concentration of divalent nickel in the starting solutions {{plays an important role}} in controlling thickness of the petal-like β-Ni(OH) 2 flakes and diameter of spheres. The β-Ni(OH) 2 flakes self-assemble into final spherical products through a donut-like structural intermediate. Furthermore, the β-Ni(OH) 2 hollow spheres can be used as solid precursors to synthesize other nanostructured derivatives. In this work, phase pure inorganic nanostructures, carbon nanotube (CNT) - inorganic nanocomposites, and inorganic - inorganic nanocom-posites (e. g., NiO, Ni, NiO/Ni, Ni/β-Ni(OH) 2, CNTs/NiO, CNTs/Ni, Ni@CNTs, Fe(OH) 3 /β-Ni(OH) 2, Co(OH) 2 /β-Ni(OH) 2, and Mg(OH) 2 /β-Ni(OH) 2) have been prepared via solid-state thermal decomposition, gas-phase reduction, solution-based reduction, surface oxidation, chemical vapor deposition, and liquid-phase deposition.

40|$|Where did the {{elements}} come from? Why are {{they found in}} the abundance that they are? These {{are two of the}} fundamental questions that the field of astrophysics has sought to answer. The first major studies of elemental synthesis were done in the 1950 's and 1960 's. Most notable among them was the Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle paper [Clayton 73]. This paper set forth the general theory of elemental synthesis in stars and supernovae by means of nuclear reactions. It remains the leading theory for elemental abundance today. As with most theories, the <b>picture</b> of elemental <b>synthesis</b> remains incomplete. While it is thought that the overall theory is correct, there are still many mysteries in the details. There are several kinds of nuclear reactions that occur in stars and supernova that create {{the elements}} heavier than iron. They include the r-process, s-process, and p-process, along with several others. However, there are some elements whose creation is not fully understood. There are a variety of reasons for this, which will be discussed. In our experiment we studied the nuclear reaction properties of an isotope of Copper (65 Cu). It is theorized that it is produced by the p-process during a supernova explosion. The p-process can be described simply as the collision of an alpha particle with a large atomic nucleus with a proton byproduct. Little actual experimental data has been taken involving the p-process, which is why we chose this reaction. The experiment was done using the Tandem Van de Graaff Accelerator at Ohio University.

40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} are attracting {{a lot of}} attention due to their promising potential applications in areas as diverse as catalysis, adsorption, separation, photovoltaics and thermoelectrics, et cetera. In the areas of photovoltaics and thermoelectrics, especially strong theoretical arguments exist which suggest that the use of nanostructured materials in these areas will allow construction of devices that are more efficient than the current devices that use bulk materials. For example, the quantum confinement effects seen at length scales smaller than 10 nm result in highly efficient carrier multiplication and enhanced thermoelectric figure-of-merit in semiconductor quantum dots and quantum wires, respectively. For realizing practical applications of nanostructured materials in abovementioned areas, it is necessary to establish synthesis methods that are scalable, easily reproducible and inexpensive. Further, there is need to characterize the resultant nanomaterials for their structural, electronic and optical properties and establish a mechanistic understanding of the synthesis process. ^ In this dissertation, we report on the synthesis of thin films of a variety of nanomaterials including metal oxides, metals and compound semiconductors having different nanostructures such as orthorhombic, rhombohedral and double-gyroid. Surfactant templating coupled with evaporation induced self-assembly was employed to synthesize starting metal oxide thin films. Particular attention was focused on the double-gyroid nanostructure, which has 3 -dimensionally continuous interpenetrating networks of inorganic walls and nanopores. By optimizing synthesis conditions, highly ordered and phase-pure double-gyroid silica films were synthesized and the synthesis process thoroughly characterized using 29 Si NMR and liquid-phase small angle X-ray scattering. A detailed mechanistic <b>picture</b> of the <b>synthesis</b> was constructed from this information. The nanopores in double-gyroid silica films were found to be highly open and accessible, unlike most other nanostructures. Taking advantage of the accessibility of the pore networks, a number of metals and compound semiconductors were electrodeposited in double-gyroid silica films to create their 3 -dimensional nanowire arrays. Silica films could be etched away to create self-supporting nanowire thin films of these materials. The nanowire arrays of semiconductors such as PbSe, CdSe and CuInSe 2 are of special interest for photovoltaic applications. The nanowire arrays we have synthesized are 3 -D analogs of semiconductor quantum dots and quantum rods that have been studied extensively in the literature. We also demonstrate that the double-gyroid semiconductor thin films do display quantum confinement effects. Double-gyroid PbSe films, for example, display well-resolved excitonic peaks in their reflectance spectra resulting from the discrete nature of electronic energy levels, while double-gyroid CdSe films display fluorescence in the visible spectrum that is absent in their bulk counterparts. The range of structures and compositions synthesized in this work and the easily scalable nature of the solution-phase syntheses employed opens up an array of opportunities to explore their potential in areas mentioned above. ...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{there is}} a global driving towards the concept of {{universities}} as protagonists of production of knowledge and generation of technological innovation for the society. To meet that new reality, universities have been challenged to change traditional structures and to seek new strategies which allow them to generate technologies useful to the government, productive sector and communities. When incorporated to the society, those technologies take over the status of "innovation", passing to generate appropriability (or appropriation) {{and a set of}} benefits both tangible and intangible. The objective of this research work is investigating the mechanisms of appropriation of the innovations in public. For such a purpose, a multicases study of qualitative nature was performed in three public universities traditionally turned to the "Innovation in Agrarian Sciences or Agrotechnologies": University of São Paulo (USP) - Piracicaba Campus, Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) and Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). The study concluded that the universities investigated performed a set of changes (policy, administrative, cultural, strategic, normative) in order to establish mechanisms of direct (legal assets) and indirect (complementary assets) appropriation and collect tangible and intangible benefits. An important finding is that the intangible benefits (patents, trade marks, licensings, organizational arrangements) are the generators of tangible benefits (material, physical, financial, human resources) and, at a second moment, the tangible benefits will be able to generate other intangible benefits (domain of new technologies, new operational arrangements, improvement of performance, new schedule of research, new market strategies) creating a vicious circle. However, the appropriation mechanisms and the benefits owing to it can only occur in a dynamic context which involves the setting external to the university (policies, laws, public and private financing of research, technological needs of market, competitors and users of technologies, expectative of the society, among others) and internal (managerial/technological/marketing view, standardization, culture, human resources, R&D structure, diverse resources). The study stressed that the benefits owing to the appropriation in the universities extrapolate the institutional setting and reach the society (government, enterprises, communities and persons). Such economic and social benefits (creation of jobs, increase and distribution of income, taxes, promotion of new productive arrangements, local or regional technological subside, technological subside to the National Innovation System, new public policies of development to P&D and C&T) can also be regarded as "forms of social appropriation". The study concludes with the proposition of a framework showing all the elements and formulations related to ownership and discussing the possibilities of a generalization of the <b>synthesis</b> <b>picture</b> with the application of it into other universities which also produce agrotechnologies. Such a generalization will also be able to contribute an analytical parameter to the universities which produce technologies different from agrotechnologies, although some adaptation is necessary.

40|$|Quantitative risk {{analysis}} in the offshore industry is mandated by the Norwegian legislation. A literature survey is carried out, related to the current legislation from the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) and supporting NORSOK standards. Process accidents on offshore installations, operating on the Norwegian continental shelf are emphasized. A risk <b>picture</b> is the <b>synthesis</b> of a risk assessment, describing the risk level. Requirements to the risk picture are discussed, and associated risk measures are presented. The risk measures represent the quantitative parts of a risk picture and the measures are evaluated against risk acceptance criteria. The evaluation can be performed with a mechanistic approach, or more flexibly by using the as low as reasonably practicable principle. Uncertainty is an important aspect that many quantitative risk analyses treat too briefly. Assumptions are always made in risk analyses, and uncertainty therefore becomes an important issue. To {{put it on the}} agenda, an introduction to the topic is given. The main purpose of a {{risk analysis}} is to support decision-making and the analysts should keep that in mind when performing the analysis. The field of quantitative risk analysis has received some criticisms, but some of it is unjust. To understand why, the scope of the quantitative risk analysis must be understood. Risk can be considered both from a strategic (long-term) and an operational (day-to-day) perspective. For quantitative risk analyses, a probabilistic view is used, dealing with probabilities and expected values. Strategic decision-making fits with this approach, but renders a day-to-day basis decision-making unsuitable. In addition, quantitative risk analysis copes with several types of hazards, with a long time span. The resources needed to handle all the hazards on an operational level of detail would be tremendous. Several methods can be used when performing a quantitative risk analysis. The approach used by Scandpower is explored in detail. The main method currently used is event tree analysis. This method has some challenges. A problem addressed is the treatment of dependencies, both within and between event trees. The answer is related to how RiskSpectrum, a fault and event tree software, calculates the end event frequencies. A second problem is the treatment of human reliability, and how it can be implemented in the event tree analyses. Large investments have been used on fire protection systems, to mitigate the consequences of process accidents. The thesis endeavors to study the importance of these safety systems. The emphasis is how the systems’ reliability is modeled and treated in a quantitative risk analysis. To investigate the effects of the safety systems on the risk measures, three quantitative risk analyses are explored in detail. This was executed by using sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analyses are performed by altering the failure probabilities to the far ends. Astonishing results arisen. An attempt has been made to understand the mechanisms leading to the results. Possible explanations are discussed, and the three most important are outlined. An input to the quantitative risk analyses is reliability data of the safety systems, but there can be nonconformity between the data. Vendor data seems to be too optimistic related to the field performance. Possible explanations are discussed in the thesis. A best practice is presented, formed as an extended conclusion. Topics considered are: - Challenges when modeling the event trees - How to include vulnerability of the safety systems - Uncertainties with the effect of deluge - Human factors - Dependencie...|$|R
