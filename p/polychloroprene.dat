50|$|Ozone-resistant {{elastomers}} include EPDM, fluoroelastomers like Viton and <b>polychloroprene</b> rubbers like Neoprene.

5000|$|The {{method was}} used to confirm the {{structural}} repeat unit in natural rubber as isoprene. It is also a serious problem, known as [...] "ozone cracking" [...] where traces of the gas in an atmosphere will cut double bonds in susceptible elastomers, including natural rubber, polybutadiene, Styrene-butadiene and Nitrile rubber. Ozone cracking creates small cracks {{at right angles to}} the load in the surfaces exposed to the gas, the cracks growing steadily as attack continues. The rubber product must be under tension for crack growth to occur.Ozone cracking is a form of stress corrosion cracking where active chemical species attack products of a susceptible material. Ozone cracking was once commonly seen in the sidewalls of tires but is now rare owing to the use of antiozonants. Other means of prevention include replacing susceptible rubbers with resistant elastomers such as <b>polychloroprene,</b> EPDM or Viton.|$|E
50|$|Plasticizers make it {{possible}} to achieve improved compound processing characteristics, while also providing flexibility in the end-use product. Ester plasticizers are selected based upon cost-performance evaluation. The rubber compounder must evaluate ester plasticizers for compatibility, processibility, permanence and other performance properties. The wide variety of ester chemistries that are in production include sebacates, adipates, terephthalates, dibenzoates, gluterates, phthalates, azelates, and other specialty blends. This broad product line provides an array of performance benefits required for the many elastomer applications such as tubing and hose products, flooring, wall-coverings, seals and gaskets, belts, wire and cable, and print rolls. Low to high polarity esters provide utility {{in a wide range of}} elastomers including nitrile, <b>polychloroprene,</b> EPDM, chlorinated polyethylene, and epichlorohydrin. Plasticizer-elastomer interaction is governed by many factors such as solubility parameter, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Compatibility and performance attributes are key factors in developing a rubber formulation for a particular application.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{commercial}} elastomers contain polysulfides as crosslinks. These crosslinks interconnect neighboring polymer chains, thereby conferring rigidity. The {{degree of}} rigidity {{is related to}} the number of crosslinks. Elastomers therefore have a characteristic ability to [...] "snap back" [...] to their original shape after being stretched or compressed. Because of this memory for their original cured shape, elastomers are commonly referred to as rubbers. The process of crosslinking the polymer chains in these polymers with sulfur is called vulcanization. The sulfur chains attach themselves to the [...] "allylic" [...] carbon atoms, which are adjacent to C=C linkages. Vulcanization {{is a step in the}} processing of several classes of rubbers, including <b>polychloroprene</b> (Neoprene), styrene-butadiene, and polyisoprene, which is chemically similar to natural rubber. Charles Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization, involving the heating of polyisoprene with sulfur, was revolutionary because it converted a sticky and almost useless material into an elastomer which could be fabricated into useful products.|$|E
50|$|Rubber {{products}} are often safety-critical parts of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents {{or loss of}} function. Failed products can be examined {{with many of the}} generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is vulcanized or cross-linked. Attenuated total reflectance infra-red spectroscopy is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the selenium crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific elastomer used in a product. Often the best technique is ESEM using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides elemental analysis, it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of chlorine indicates <b>polychloroprene</b> while the presence of nitrogen indicates nitrile rubber. The method is also useful in confirming ozone cracking by the large amounts of oxygen present on cracked surfaces. Ozone attacks susceptible elastomers such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber and polybutadiene and associated copolymers. Such elastomers possess double bonds in their main chains, the group which is attacked during ozonolysis.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{established}} {{a tradition of}} basic scientific research starting with hiring of Wallace Carothers in 1928 and his systemization of polymer science {{that led to the}} development of polyamides such as nylon-6,6 and <b>polychloroprene</b> (neoprene) in the early 1930s. [...] This tradition waned during World War II then underwent a renaissance in the 1950s. The establishment of Central Research in 1957 formalized a corporate commitment to basic research. The execution and publication of high quality research assisted recruiting and promoted the image of DuPont while raising morale among the CRD staff. The purpose of the research was to discover [...] "the next nylon", because Carothers' success and the resulting commercialization of nylon had driven the Company's profits through the 1950s. (This research objective that was never met.) Nonetheless, another important stated goal for CRD was “diversification through research,” and CRD produced a stream of scientific innovations that contributed to many different businesses throughout the corporation. CRD combined industrial and fundamental research, and the mix of the two features was often determined by the head of CR&D. The title expanded from Director of Research to Vice President of Technology to Chief Technology Officer with varying degrees of impact on research throughout the corporation as well as in CRD. The name of CRD also changed to reflect the times, starting with Chemicals Department and moving through Central Research Department (CRD), Central Research and Development Department (CR&DD), to the present Central Research and Development (CR&D).|$|E
40|$|Polyisoprene and <b>polychloroprene</b> {{have been}} {{cross-linked}} either in solution or in solid state using free radical initiators. In the comparable experimental conditions higher cross-linking density {{was observed in}} the solid state process. Independent of the cross-linking method, <b>polychloroprene</b> tended to give a higher gel content and cross-link density than does polyisoprene. Infrared characterization of the cross-linked materials showed cis-trans isomerization occurred in the polyisoprene initiated by benzoyl peroxide, whereas no isomerization {{was found in the}} samples initiated by dicumyl peroxide. Polyisoprene does not cross-link by heating in a thermal analyzer, whereas <b>polychloroprene</b> easily undergoes cross-linking in such conditions.

There is apparently some enhancement of the thermal and thermal oxidative stability of polyisoprene because of the cross-linking.

40|$|This {{research}} is an innovation proposal for magnetic conditioning of the aqueous-based <b>polychloroprene</b> contact adhesive {{with the purpose}} of increasing the adherence capacity between the adhesive and the substrate.
