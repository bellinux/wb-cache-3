5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time {{of changes}} in Ancient Egyptian {{religion}} and in the ideology of kingship, changes that are first demonstrable under Unas. A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> marked decline of {{the cult of the}} king during Unas' time on the throne. This continued under Unas' successor Teti, for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name. This trend reflects the lessening of the king's power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood.|$|E

Although the raid is not mentioned in Arabic sources, its description by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> major invasion, as it was confronted by the forces of the two most powerful Byzantine thematic armies, those of the Anatolic Theme itself and of the Opsician Theme.|$|E

5|$|After tearfully reuniting {{with his}} son and new daughter-in-law, Walter discovers the device uses a unique {{radioactive}} signature that they can track. The strongest source <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> used campground, where Peter discovers a key. He recognizes the key as from Walter's old home near Reiden Lake and travels there alone, and finds his biological father, Walternate, present. Walternate admits to being behind the End of Dayers group, as his revenge for Peter activating the doomsday device and destroying the parallel world that was his home. Walternate promises that Peter will face the same pain and suffering he has faced since crossing to the prime universe on a mission of mercy, one piece at a time. Peter realizes that Walternate is implying a threat to Olivia, and finds that Walternate was speaking to him remotely through a holographic simulation. In Central Park, where Moreau has set off another breach to expose an existing wormhole, Olivia is helping to cordon off the breach when Walternate approaches and shoots her. Peter {{and the rest of}} Fringe division struggle with her death at her funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 934 Æthelstan invaded Scotland. His {{reasons are}} unclear, and historians give {{alternative}} explanations. The {{death of his}} half-brother Edwin in 933 might have finally removed factions in Wessex opposed to his rule. Guthfrith, the Norse king of Dublin who had briefly ruled Northumbria, died in 934; any resulting insecurity among the Danes would have given Æthelstan an opportunity to stamp his authority on the north. An entry in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, recording the death in 934 of a ruler who was possibly Ealdred of Bamburgh, suggests another possible explanation. This <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dispute between Æthelstan and Constantine over control of his territory. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle briefly recorded the expedition without explanation, but the twelfth-century chronicler John of Worcester stated that Constantine had broken his treaty with Æthelstan.|$|E

Species of Lilium and Fritillaria then dispersed {{into the rest of}} Eurasia and North America. The second subclade, the Tulipeae arose in East Asia with subsequent colonisation of North America by Erythronium and Lloydia. On the other hand, Clintonia-Medeola (Medeoleae) may have appeared in North America but subsequently underwent intercontintental dispersal (although some evidence <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Eurasian origin). The Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae) appears to have evolved in western North America, with subsequent colonisation of East Asia by Streptopus and the ancestral Tricyrtis.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and {{participates in the}} meaning of a concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E
5|$|Revelations: The Demon Slayer, Last Bible II, and Last Bible III are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} which all have similar gameplay. Players explore the game world and fight {{various types of}} monsters. During battles, players choose commands for their characters to do from a menu. Players can attack with both physical attacks and magic spells; different kinds of magic are effective against different types of monsters. Characters in players' party learn new spells {{throughout the course of}} the game. By defeating monsters, players gain experience points and money. As characters gain more experience points, players get access to points which he or she can add to the characters' attributes; for instance, players can add <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> character's speed attribute, which allows that character to move earlier during battles. Players can use money that they've earned through battles to buy armor, weapons, and items, in shops found throughout the game world.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth guitarfish and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) and skates (Rajidae) while others have them basal to all other rays except sawfishes (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the sawfishes rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that {{it is part of}} the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina).|$|E
5|$|The name Book of Kells {{is derived}} from the Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, which was its home for much of the medieval period. The manuscript's date and place of {{production}} {{have been the subject of}} considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba, possibly even as the work of his own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> composition date 800, long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona, which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death.|$|E
