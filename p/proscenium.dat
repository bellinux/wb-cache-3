5|$|A {{few blocks}} walk from Main Campus on East Genesee St, the Syracuse Stage {{building}} includes two <b>proscenium</b> theatres. The Storch is used {{primarily by the}} Drama Department and the Archbold is used primarily by Syracuse Stage, a professional regional theatre.|$|E
5|$|Early {{resources}} conflicted on {{the size}} of the theatre: most sources suggest 1100 seats, but a 1982 program suggested 1200. The theatre is formatted as <b>proscenium,</b> and was considered 'ultra-modern' upon opening.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1921 {{interior decoration}} {{of the auditorium}} included fourteen large romantic French-themed murals surrounding the <b>proscenium</b> by Chicago artist Louis Grell (1887-1960), a common feature that Rapp and Rapp architects included in their movie palace designs.|$|E
5|$|London {{is home to}} the Grand Theatre, a {{professional}} <b>proscenium</b> arch theatre located in Central London. The building underwent renovations in 1975 to restore the stage's <b>proscenium</b> arch and to add a secondary performance space. The architectural firm responsible for the re-design was awarded a Governor General's award in 1978 for their work on the venue. In addition to professional productions, the Grand Theatre also hosts the High School Project, a program unique to North America that provides high school students an opportunity to work with professional directors, choreographers, musical directors, and stage managers. The Palace Theatre, located in Old East Village, originally opened as a silent movie theatre in 1929 and was converted to a live theatre venue in 1991. It is currently the home of the London Community Players, and as of 2016 is undergoing extensive historical restoration. The Original Kids Theatre Company, a nonprofit charitable youth organisation, currently puts on productions at the Spriet Family Theatre in the Covent Garden Market.|$|E
5|$|The Cullen Performance Hall is a 1,544 seat <b>proscenium</b> theater {{located near}} Entrance1. The hall {{offers a variety}} of events {{sponsored}} by departments and organizations at the university in addition to contemporary music concerts, opera, modern dance, and theatrical performances put on by groups in and outside the Houston area.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1877, Tyldesley Good Templars Band was the town's first brass band. Tyldesley Band is {{a member}} of the North West Brass Band Association and meets in the chapel on Milk Street. Tyldesley Little Theatre in Lemon Street is home to an amateur {{dramatic}} society, members of the Greater Manchester Drama Federation. The auditorium is a small 150-seat theatre with a traditional <b>proscenium</b> arch stage, stalls and balcony seating. The town's industrial landscape was recorded in the 1960s and 1970s in the paintings and prints of artist Roger Hampson.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the <b>proscenium.</b> In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the <b>proscenium</b> but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{atmosphere}} performers {{have disappeared}} from most {{sections of the}} park, including Medieval Faire. Two entertainment areas have remained constant in the section, a <b>proscenium</b> theatre and a stunt and acrobatic space surrounded by water. Currently named Wonderland Theatre, the indoor facility has hosted a variety of stage show revues, ice shows, and now an acrobatic production, Cirque Ambiente. A structure within Arthur's Baye initially featured a pirate diving and acrobatics show, which has changed now {{to have a more}} generic theme; it is currently branded Kinet–X.|$|E
5|$|The campus has the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Performing Arts, {{which houses}} the Lyndall Finley Wortham Theatre and Moores Opera Center. The Cullen Performance Hall is a 1,544 seat <b>proscenium</b> theater {{which offers a}} variety of events {{sponsored}} by departments and organizations at the university in addition to contemporary music concerts, opera, modern dance, and theatrical performances put on by groups in and outside the Houston area. The Blaffer Gallery exhibits the works of both visiting artists and those of students in the university's School of Art.|$|E
5|$|A {{partnership}} of the city, the arts community, private business and senior governments, the Evergreen Cultural Centre in the Town Centre {{area is a}} venue for arts and culture, a civic facility designed to host {{a wide variety of}} community events. It features a 264-seat black box theatre, rehearsal hall, art studios and art gallery. Evergreen serves as the home venue for the Pacific Symphonic Wind Ensemble, the Coastal Sound Music Academy, and the Stage 43 Theatrical Society. Nearby <b>proscenium</b> theatres include the 336-seat Terry Fox Theatre in Port Coquitlam, and the 206-seat Inlet Theatre in Port Moody.|$|E
5|$|Spears {{talked to}} CNN about her {{involvement}} {{during the development}} of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept. Spears worked with fashion designer Gia Ventola to create the costumes for her and the dancers. The <b>proscenium</b> stage was simple and had only one main prop, a staircase in the middle. The band was in both sides of the staircase and consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, that took the stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.|$|E
5|$|The Lethbridge Symphony Orchestra {{has been}} {{performing}} {{in the city}} since 1961. It has produced spin-off music groups, the Lethbridge Musical Theatre and the Southern Alberta Chamber Orchestra. Vox Musica, which traces its roots back to 1968, is a community choir based at the University of Lethbridge and has been performing since 1984. Theatrical productions are presented by the University of Lethbridge's theatre department and the New West Theatre, which produces seven shows annually. New West Theatre performs at the Genevieve E. Yates Memorial Centre using its two theatres: the 500-seat <b>proscenium</b> Yates Theatre and the 180-seat black box Sterndale Bennett Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The dragon motif is {{repeated}} in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by {{the symbol of the}} Empress, the Chinese phoenix (Fèng huáng), sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes. In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated <b>proscenium</b> arch and safety curtain maintain the Chinese design influence.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, <b>proscenium</b> and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although {{it is seen as}} a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups because it is more expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the <b>proscenium</b> design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a <b>proscenium</b> stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E

25|$|The Sandra Hall-Ray Fine Arts Centre on the Shelton State campus {{holds the}} Bean-Brown Theatre, a 450-seat <b>proscenium</b> theater, and the 100-seat Alabama Power Foundation Recital Hall.|$|E
25|$|The scenic {{stage was}} {{probably}} some 50’ deep and 30’ high. The <b>proscenium</b> arch {{may have been}} some 30’ wide and at least 25’ high to accommodate the scenery in operas such as Dioclesian, The Fairy-Queen, or The World in the Moon. Both the forestage and the scenic stage were raked. The music box above the <b>proscenium</b> arch could hold perhaps 8 to 10 musicians, to provide incidental music. A full orchestra would be sitting in the pit, {{just in front of the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Joan Sutherland Theatre: A <b>proscenium</b> theatre with 1,507 seats, the Sydney home of Opera Australia and The Australian Ballet. Until 16 October 2012 it {{was known}} as the Opera Theatre.|$|E

25|$|According to The Pioneer, The {{dynamism}} of TAW productions, their stylistic experimentation and directorial subtlety, were never in doubt {{on either side}} of the <b>proscenium.</b> But TAW's plays proved too radical in the context of existing provincial attitudes.|$|E
25|$|The current theatre has a <b>proscenium</b> stage, and {{accommodates}} {{a variable}} orchestra pit on 2 lifts - which reduces the stall seating. The audience is seated on four levels: stalls (501), grand circle (252), upper circle (249) and gallery (247).|$|E
25|$|It {{was adapted}} for <b>proscenium</b> {{presentation}} for subsequent performance in New York. However, Alan Ayckbourn considered the play to be unsuited to larger theatres, {{to the point}} of eventually declining a transfer to a Broadway venue he considered too big.|$|E
25|$|Until 1975, JANAM {{performed}} open-air <b>proscenium</b> {{and street}} plays for mass audiences. When Indira Gandhi imposed {{a state of}} emergency and made political theatre difficult, Hashmi began to work as a lecturer in English literature in universities in Garhwal, Kashmir, and Delhi.|$|E
25|$|Southwest of the Stadium Mall is the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music, one of {{the largest}} <b>proscenium</b> theaters in the world. Purdue's Student Concert Committee often invites famous entertainers to perform there for an {{audience}} of students, faculty, and the general public.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{in honor}} of the 50th anniversary of the {{creation}} of Candide, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris produced a new production under the direction of Robert Carsen. The production was to move to Milan's Teatro alla Scala in 2007 and to the English National Opera in 2008. The production transforms the <b>proscenium</b> into a giant 1950s-era TV set, and has Voltaire, appearing as the narrator, changing channels between certain scenes. Carsen sets the action in a 1950s/1960s world, with an American slant commenting on contemporary world politics. This production was filmed and broadcast on Arte. For an open-house day in French opera houses on February 17, 2007, this video was projected in high definition on a screen filling the <b>proscenium</b> of the Théâtre du Châtelet.|$|E
25|$|Also on the UA campus, Rowand-Johnson Hall {{holds the}} Marian Gallaway Theatre, a 305-seat <b>proscenium</b> theater, the Allen Bales 170-seat thrust theatre, and the 600-seat Morgan Auditorium. These {{facilities}} primarily host University sponsored performing arts shows, such as Dance Alabama and the University's theater productions.|$|E
