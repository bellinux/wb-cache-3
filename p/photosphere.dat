5|$|The <b>photosphere</b> is tens to {{hundreds}} of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because {{the upper part of}} the <b>photosphere</b> is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening. The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at about 6,000 K, interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the <b>photosphere.</b> The <b>photosphere</b> has a particle density of ~1023m−3 (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The <b>photosphere</b> is not fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of the <b>photosphere</b> is approximately 6,000K, whereas the {{temperature of}} the corona reaches 1,000,000–2,000,000K. The high {{temperature of the}} corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the <b>photosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the <b>photosphere</b> of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the <b>photosphere</b> emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
25|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{feature of}} red giants is that, unlike Sun-like stars whose <b>photospheres</b> {{have a large}} number of small convection cells (solar granules), red-giant <b>photospheres,</b> {{as well as those of}} red supergiants, have just a few large cells, the features of which cause the variations of brightness so common on both types of stars.|$|R

5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its {{chemical composition}} from {{the interstellar medium}} out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to the interstellar medium before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical composition of the <b>photosphere</b> is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the <b>photosphere.</b> Therefore, in today's <b>photosphere</b> the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The <b>photosphere</b> is {{that portion}} of a star that is visible to an observer. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes {{transparent}} to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space. It is within the <b>photosphere</b> that sun spots, regions of lower than average temperature, appear.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{surface of}} the Sun, the <b>photosphere,</b> is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Above the <b>photosphere</b> visible {{sunlight}} is free to propagate into space, {{and almost all of}} its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E

40|$|We present ISOCAM 7 µm and 15 µm {{observations}} of 12 nearby white dwarfs, 6 {{of which have}} been found to have metals such as Ca, Mg and Fe in their <b>photospheres.</b> Our purpose was to search for an excess of infrared emission above the stellar <b>photospheres.</b> We find that none of the white dwarfs other than G 29 − 38 shows a detectable infrared excess and this places strong constraints on the existence of a dusty disk around these stars. We conclude that ongoing accretion of the interstellar medium seems an unlikely explanation for the existence of metals in the <b>photospheres</b> of cool hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. The excess associated with G 29 − 38 is 3. 8 ± 1. 0 mJy and 2. 9 ± 0. 6 mJy at 7 µm and 15 µm respectively. The broadband spectrum of this star strengthens the hypothesis that the infrared excess arises from a disk of particulate matter surrounding the white dwarf rather than from a cool brown dwarf companion.

5|$|Sunspots {{are visible}} as dark patches on the Sun's <b>photosphere,</b> and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding <b>photosphere,</b> and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|E
5|$|The {{asymmetric}} gaseous envelope, another cooler region, extends {{for several}} radii (~10–40AU) from the <b>photosphere.</b> It is enriched in oxygen {{and especially in}} nitrogen relative to carbon.

40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>photospheres</b> of "failed" Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), whose bulk Lorentz factors are much lower than 100, can be outside of {{internal}} shocks. The resulting radiation from the <b>photospheres</b> is thermal and bright in UV/Soft X-ray band. The photospheric emission lasts for about one thousand seconds with luminosity about several times 10 ^ 46 erg/s. These events can be observed by current and future satellites. It is also shown that the afterglows of failed GRBs are peculiar at the early stage, which {{makes it possible to}} distinguish failed GRBs from ordinary GRBs and beaming-induced orphan afterglows.

5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere).

40|$|Abstract. A {{sequence}} of AR Lac seasonal light curves covering the period 1967 - 1992 is analysed {{in the framework}} of the starspot hypothesis to derive the spot distribution and evolution on the component stars. The adopted approach makes use of the Maximum Entropy and Tikhonov principles to compute maps of the stellar <b>photospheres</b> exploiting also the eclipse scanning technique. Reliable results on the distribution of the spotted areas can be derived through a critical comparison of the maps obtained by the above quoted regularizing criteria. Satisfactory fits are computed assuming that spots are located on the <b>photospheres</b> of both components and that their unspotted luminosity ratio in the V band is: L 1 L 2 = 0. 59 ± 0. 03.

5|$|Elemental abundances in the <b>photosphere</b> {{are well}} known from spectroscopic studies, but the {{composition}} of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>photosphere,</b> six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere have now been identified. They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere, a gaseous envelope, a chromosphere, a dust environment and two outer shells (S1 and S2) composed of carbon monoxide (CO).

5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its <b>photosphere</b> measured. Although {{interferometry}} was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced angular diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its <b>photosphere</b> might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{chemical}} abundance analysis of 19 upper main-sequence {{stars of the}} young open cluster NGC 6250 (log t ~ 7. 42 yr). This work {{is part of a}} project aimed at setting observational constraints on the theory of atomic diffusion in stellar <b>photospheres,</b> by means of a systematic study of the abundances of the chemical elements of early F-, A- and late B-type stars of well-determined age. Our data set consists of low-, medium- and high-resolution spectra obtained with the Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) instrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). To perform our analysis, we have developed a new suite of software tools for the chemical abundance analysis of stellar <b>photospheres</b> in local thermodynamical equilibrium. Together with the chemical composition of the stellar <b>photospheres,</b> we have provided new estimates of the cluster mean radial velocity, proper motion, refined the cluster membership, and we have given the stellar parameters including masses and fractional age. We find no evidence of statistically significant correlation between any of the parameters, including abundance and cluster age, except perhaps for an increase in Ba abundance with cluster age.

Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old.|$|E
40|$|The <b>photospheres</b> {{of stars}} hosting planets have larger {{metallicity}} than stars lacking planets.

We identified the dependence of the planet's eccentricity (e_p) and time scale of migration (τ) on the rate of infalling planetesimals. For very fast migrations (τ= 10 ^ 2 yr and τ= 10 ^ 3 yr) there is no capture in mean motion resonances, independently of the value of e_p.
