25|$|When the Ba'ath Party {{took power}} in Iraq, the new government, {{in order to}} end the Kurdish revolt, granted the Kurds their own limited autonomy. However, for various reasons, {{including}} the pro-Iranian sympathies of some Kurds during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, the regime implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a de facto civil war broke out. From March 29, 1987 until April 23, 1989, the infamous Al-Anfal campaign, a systematic genocide of the Kurdish <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> was launched. For this, Iraq was widely condemned by the international community, but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures, {{including the use of}} chemical weapons against the Kurds, which resulted in thousands of deaths.|$|E

I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window.

Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they – many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party.
