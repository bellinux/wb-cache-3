40|$|Interactive Narratives are {{systems that}} use {{automated}} narrative generation techniques to create multiple story variants {{which can be}} shown to an audience, as virtual narratives, using cinematic staging techniques. The focus of previous research has included aspects such as the quality of automatically generated narratives {{and the way in}} which audiences respond to them. However in this work we have developed a mechanism for control of interactive narratives that supports their use in experiments to assess story understanding. This is implemented in our demonstration system, which features two parts: an interface that allows high-level specification of criteria for story understanding experiments; and a <b>participant</b> <b>interface</b> in which virtual narratives, conforming to the experimental design, are presented as 3 D visualizations. The virtual narrative is based on a pre-existing children’s story, and features a cast of virtual characters...|$|E

They manifest themselves as perils {{which can be}} replicated as the new use cases on terrorist attack events in surprising sceneries and arenas. In this paper, the behaviour of the relevant entities is blazonry explained, modelled, analysed, evaluated and simulated using the DYVELOP method within the pertinent threat/peril life cycles. They are modelled on looping terrorist attack scenes in pertinent environments and their metamorphoses, operating at real threat/peril scenes. This article helps to clarify and identify the roles and processes of these scene entities, domains, actors, <b>participants,</b> <b>interfaces</b> and users. The DYVELOP method is a fundamental instrument for the objective analysis, understanding, evaluation, interpretation, development and computerized modelling & simulation of emergency/ societal security awareness, performance, continual planning, management, training and intervention.

40|$|Insufficient {{moisture}} control and climate adaptation {{in the building}} process is partially due to an increased centralisation and standardisation in the construction sector. Climate challenges and developments are not afforded sufficient attention in the building process. A fresh report from the SINTEF Building and Infrastructure programme “Climate 2000 ” concludes that {{the participants in the}} construction sector need and expect the development of multi-disciplinary guidelines in order to properly address process-related moisture problems. This paper discusses the development of multi-disciplinary guidelines and management tools in dealing with moisture challenges at the various stages of the building process. The principal basis of the paper is a qualitative survey in an ongoing PhD study by one of the authors. A large number of building defects occur {{in the early stages of}} the building process, often caused by incomplete or non-existent requirements, omissions, errors in the design phase or ignorance in the field of building physics. Other issues are related to management and organisation, <b>participant</b> <b>interfaces,</b> risk-assessment analysis, technical and functional requirements, material use, drying methods, micro-biological growth and indoor climate, related to the complexity of the construction process as a whole.

40|$|Modern {{industrial}} production systems demand {{the ability to}} perceive the interrelationships of presented facts in various, complicated datasets, collaboratively to guide action towards a desired objective. With the support of historical, current, and predictive aspects and benefiting from tools of analytics, data mining, business performance management, benchmarking, and predictive analytics, better performance in strategically decision making is tried to be achieved. In production systems, one such instance is the inventory and sales management, where collaboration and insight exchange of production and sales department is necessary on diverse datasets, such as demand patterns, inventory levels, risk of lost sales, inventory quality, and control charts (i. e. EWMA), etc. Collaboration and decision support is essential {{to make such a}} collaboration system scalable. ^ In this work, a “Human in the Loop” type collaboration framework is introduced with automated collaboration support features to enable the exchange of insights (Co-Insights Framework). The main contributions from this work are the development of a Coordination Network (Co-Net) model for Co-Insights, defining the task and participant models for Co-Insights; a Collaboration Resource Allocation Analysis mechanism for Task – Participant Matching; a <b>Participant</b> – <b>Interface</b> Matching mechanism and development of a prototype for a Collaborative Visual Analytics (Co-VA) Workspace (with PHP and MySQL based on HUBzero). Thus, by better matching tasks and tools to participants and enabling effective exchange of insights, improvement in multi-criteria decision making process is intended. ^ In the experiments, when comparing proposed Collaboration Resource Allocation Analysis (CRAA) with greedy selection algorithm (GrSA) and random selection algorithm (RSA), CRAA yielded up to 35 % improvements in the introduced relevance measure for the Task – Participant Matching. The proposed neural network based <b>participant</b> – <b>interface</b> matching algorithm yielded robust results with 4 % deviations for 10 % noise levels and with 16 % deviations for 30 % noise levels. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to provide guidelines for the conceptualization of audience experiences for site-based theatre [...] theatre events more commonly described as site-specific, site-responsive, or immersive. Creators of site-based theatre should design participative engagement for audiences that immerses participants in the site and interfaces with its contexts, and promotes a visceral and memorable experience of the performance. Following a definition of site-based theatre, this dissertation investigates conceptual practices of 20 leading practitioners of site-based theatre in contemporary Great Britain; Grid Iron Theatre, Punchdrunk, Pearson/Brookes, Common Wealth Theatre Company, Hydrocracker Theatre, Red Earth, and ZU-UK, among others. Based on interviews with these practitioners, and observations of eight site-based theatre productions in the U. K. between 2011 - 2013, this dissertation proposes and explores a two-step sequence for the conceptualization of visceral and memorable site-based theatre audience experiences, and derives a taxonomy of the essential qualities of site-based theatre. Chapter Three explores how site-based theatre benefits from an excited and engaged audience. Some audiences are attracted to site-based theatre’s egalitarian appeal that defies the power implications of the conventional theatre transaction. Chapter Four explains how real-world sites offer locational, societal, historical and cultural contexts to be perceived and interpreted by the spectator. Numerous considerations for performance and <b>participant</b> <b>interfaces</b> are explored including a range of possible responses to contextual information present in the site. Chapter Five explores the range of possible participative engagement available to creators of site-based theatre. Conceiving participative engagement requires attention to: inviting agency and active participation; engaging participants in roles in the performance; the usage and effects of immersion, proxemics, haptics and temporality, orientation and disorientation, and transitions; and methods for compelling movement through the performance and site. This study identifies and discusses two foundational considerations for the conceptualization of site-based theatre and considers the possibility for expanded site-based theatre activity in the United States in the future...|$|R

This paper examines the attitudes of five groups of respondents on the factors leading to the interface conflicts experienced on the Yadana Natural Gas Pipeline Project (YNGPP) in Thailand as a case study.
