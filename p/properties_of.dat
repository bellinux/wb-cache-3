40|$|Rene Descartes {{gives an}} ontological {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} God in his “Fifth Meditation. ” He claims to have a vivid and clear idea of God, and a vivid and clear idea of God having the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> perfection. Perfection entails the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> existence, because in order for something to be perfect, it has to actually exist. Therefore, God has the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> existence, that is, God exists. Descartes’ argument relies on his vivid and clear perceptions. Earlier in his Meditations, he argued that a vivid and clear perception is unquestionable, or self-evident. I argue that Descartes’ ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God does not prove the existence of God because Descartes could not have vividly and clearly perceived God to have the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> perfection. Given that a vivid and clear perception is unquestionable, if I prove that God’s <b>property</b> <b>of</b> perfection is questionable, Descartes’ ontological argument falls apart. The goal of my paper is to show that God’s <b>property</b> <b>of</b> perfection is inseparable from God’s <b>property</b> <b>of</b> infinity, God’s <b>property</b> <b>of</b> infinity is questionable, and thus God’s <b>property</b> <b>of</b> perfection is questionable.

40|$|Community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses - {{termination}} {{and settlement}} The topic of my thesis is called Community property between spouses, its termination and settlement. I have chosen this particular topic because I {{am interested in}} this area and in civil law in general and also I find it very important. Community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses is a specific type <b>of</b> <b>property</b> partnership, which can exist only between spouses. The community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses origins and terminates together with the marriage. Upon the termination <b>of</b> marriage, community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses also terminates and needs to be settled. The thesis is composed of six chapters which further include under-chapters and sections. At the beginning there is an introduction into the history and development of the legal regulations <b>of</b> community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Attention is given to the great amendment of the Civil Code carried into affect by Act No. 91 / 1998 Coll., which has brought many changes into the legal regulations <b>of</b> community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Chapter two defines the basic terms connected with the issue <b>of</b> the community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses, namely concept, establishment, subject <b>of</b> community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses, <b>property</b> assets and debits of the spouses, exclusive <b>property</b> <b>of</b> each of them and also community property in connection with [...] ...|$|R

After the short introduction which includes the survey of the development <b>of</b> community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses on Czech territory, thesis characterises the theoretical and practical analysis of the important items <b>of</b> the community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Generally spoken, thesis contains - besides introduction and conclusion - nine chapters. Each chapter is subdivided into several subchapters {{and some of them}} are subdivided into the parts. My thesis utilized achievements of the Czech expert literature as well as judicature of the Czech courts. Chapter One {{deals with the}} history <b>of</b> community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses on the Czech territory. Chapter Two is concerned with the explanation of the formation <b>of</b> the community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Chapter Three relates to the origin <b>of</b> community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Chapter Four is addressed to the object. Chapter Five describes the contents <b>of</b> community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Chapter Six examines the problems <b>of</b> the community <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses connected with business.
