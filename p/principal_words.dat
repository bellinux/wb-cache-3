2500|$|... "Jabberwocky" [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} into numerous languages, as the novel has {{been translated into}} 65 languages. The translation might be difficult because the poem holds to English syntax {{and many of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>words</b> of the poem are invented. Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the morphology of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, [...] "'Twas brillig" [...] becomes [...] "Il brilgue". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's lexicon, but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. Douglas Hofstadter noted in his essay [...] "Translations of Jabberwocky", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks [...] "what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? [...] ".|$|E

50|$|This arises {{where the}} <b>Principals</b> <b>words</b> or conduct {{reasonably}} cause the Agent {{to believe they}} have been authorised to act. This may be expressed as a contract or implied because what is said or done make it reasonably necessary for the person to assume the powers of an Agent.

This results even if, having actual authority, the Agent in fact acts fraudulently for his own benefit, unless the Third Party was aware of the Agents personal agenda. If there is no contract but the <b>Principals</b> <b>words</b> or conduct reasonably led the Third Party to believe that the Agent was authorised to act, or if what the Agent proposes to do is incidental and reasonably necessary to accomplish an actually authorised transaction or a transaction that usually accompanies it, then the Principal is bound.|$|R
60|$|All {{national}} literature everywhere {{begins with}} rude songs. From the earliest period {{at which the}} English and Saxon people existed as separate tribes at all, we may {{be sure that they}} possessed battle-songs, like those common to the whole Aryan stock. But among the Teutonic races poetry was not distinguished by either of the peculiarities–rime or metre–which mark off modern verse from prose, so far as its external form is concerned. Our existing English system of versification is not derived from our old native poetry at all; it is a development of the Romance system, adopted by the school of Gower and Chaucer from the French and Italian poets. Its metre, or syllabic arrangement, is an adaptation from the Greek quantitative prosody, handed down through Latin and the neo-Latin dialects; its rime is a Celtic peculiarity borrowed by the Romance nationalities, and handed on through them to modern English literature by the Romance school of the fourteenth century. Our original English versification, on the other hand, was neither rimed nor rhythmic. What answered to metre was a certain irregular swing, produced by a roughly recurrent number of accents in each couplet, without restriction as to the number of feet or syllables. What answered to rime was a regular and marked alliteration, each couplet having a certain key-letter, with which three <b>principal</b> <b>words</b> in the couplet began. In addition to these two poetical devices, Anglo-Saxon verse shows traces of parallelism, similar to that which distinguishes Hebrew poetry. But the alliteration and parallelism do not run quite side by side, the second half of each alliterative couplet being parallel with {{the first half of the}} next couplet. Accordingly, each new sentence begins somewhat clumsily in the middle of the couplet. All these peculiarities are not, however, always to be distinguished in every separate poem.|$|E
60|$|In {{the summer}} of the ensuing year, Jones {{accompanied}} his pupil to the school at Harrow. During his residence there he transcribed his Persian grammar. He had already begun a dictionary of that language, with illustrations of the <b>principal</b> <b>words</b> from celebrated writers, a work of vast labour, which he resolved not to prosecute without the assurance of an adequate remuneration from the East India Company. At the entreaty of Dr. Glasse, he now dedicated some portion of his time to religious inquiry. The result was a conviction of the truth of Christianity, in his belief of which, it is said, he had hitherto been unconfirmed. In the winter he made a second visit to the Continent with the family of his noble patron. After a longer stay at Paris, than was agreeable to him, they passed down the Rhine to Lyons, and thence proceeded by Marseilles, Frejus, and Antibes, to Nice. At the last of these places they resided long enough to allow of his returning to his studies, which were divided between the arts of music and painting; the mathematics; and military tactics; a science of which he thought no Briton could, without disgrace, be ignorant. He also wrote a treatise on education; and begun a tragedy entitled Soliman, on {{the murder of the}} son of that monarch by the treachery of his step-mother. Of the latter, although it appears from one of his letters that he had completed it, no traces were found among his papers, except a prefatory discourse too unfinished to meet the public eye. The subject has been treated by Champfort, a late French writer, {{and one of the best}} among Racine's school, in a play called Mustapha and Zeangir. I do not recollect, and have not now the means of ascertaining, whether that fine drama, the Solimano of Prospero Bonarelli is founded on the same tragic incident in the Turkish History.|$|E

50|$|The <b>principal</b> <b>word</b> {{order in}} Marathi is SOV (subject-object-verb). Nouns inflect for gender (masculine, feminine, neuter), number (singular, plural), and case. Marathi {{preserves}} the neuter gender found in Sanskrit, a feature further distinguishing it from many Indo-Aryan languages. Typically, Marathi adjectives do not inflect unless they end in long a, {{in which case}} they inflect for gender and number. Marathi verbs inflect for tense (past, present, future). Verbs can agree with their subjects, yielding an active voice construction, or with their objects, yielding a passive voice construction. A third type of voice, not found in English for example, is produced when the verb agrees with neither subject nor object. Affixation is largely suffixal in the language and postpositions are attested. An unusual feature of Marathi, as compared to other Indo-European languages, is that it displays the inclusive and exclusive we feature, that is common to the Dravidian languages, Rajasthani, and Gujarati.|$|R

5000|$|The word temple, however, is used {{frequently}} {{in the tradition of}} Eastern Christianity; particularly the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the <b>principal</b> <b>words</b> used for houses of worship are temple and church. The use of the word temple comes from the need to distinguish a building of the church vs. the church seen as the Body of Christ. In the Russian language (similar to other Slavic languages), while the general-purpose word for [...] "church" [...] is tserkov, the term khram (Храм), [...] "temple", is used to refer to the church building as a temple of God (Khram Bozhy). The words [...] "church" [...] and [...] "temple", in this case are interchangeable; however, the term [...] "church" [...] (ἐκκλησία) is far more common. The term temple (ναός) is also commonly applied to larger churches.

As to the former, when you offer a text as a proof of an illustration, we your hearers expect to be fairly used, and sometimes think we have reason to complain, especially of you younger divines, which makes us fear that some of you conceive you have no more to do than to turn over a concordance, and there having found the <b>principal</b> <b>word,</b> introduce {{as much of the}} verse as will serve your turn, though in reality it makes nothing for you.

The data was collected using observation methods accompanied by writing technique,then followed up using conversation methods accompanied by fishing technique and advanced technique that consists of interview technique and writing technique. Data on morphological processes analyzed by utilizingdistributional method with basic techniqueof immediate constituentsaccompanied expansion technique and paraphrasing technique. In addition, the data analysis to determine similarities and differencesasking word and synonyms using contrastive approach is evidenced through the substitution techniques. 	The result of the study found affix forming verbs the asking word and synonyms consists of a prefix, confix and combinationsaffix. All verb forming affixes are a productive affix consisting of (a) the prefix meN-, di-, ber-, and ter-, (b) the suffix -kan and -i, (c) the confix ke-an, and (d) the combination of affix meN-/-kan, meN-/-i), di-/-kan, and di-/-i. Reduplication forming verbs the asking word and synonyms include forms: full reduplication and partial reduplication. Reduplication partly marked by the form meN-, di-, me-/-kan, di-/-kan, and ber-/-an. The composition forming verbs the asking word and synonyms are not contained in all words, but only on the word ask and sue.

50|$|Where {{an agent}} {{does not have}} actual authority, the <b>{{principal}}’s</b> <b>words</b> or conduct may be such as to prevent the principal in law, or to estop the principal, from denying that the agent has authority. Where Arthur misleads Kallis by words or by conduct that could reasonably be expected to mislead into believing that Boucher has authority to act for Arthur, and Kallis, relying, reasonably {{where there is no}} intention or negligence on Arthur’s part, on Arthur’s representation, enters into a transaction with Boucher to Kallis’s prejudice, then Arthur will be precluded from denying that Boucher had authority. Arthur will be bound by the resulting contract as if Boucher had had the necessary authority to conclude such a transaction on Arthur’s behalf, even though Boucher did not actually have such authority. An example of such conduct would be if Arthur allowed Boucher to receive money for Arthur from Kallis on a number of occasions. If, then, on a subsequent occasion, Boucher again received money from Kallis, but failed to pay it over to Arthur, Arthur could not claim that amount from Kallis on the basis that it was owing because Arthur had not received payment. Arthur is precluded by Arthur’s previous conduct from denying that Boucher had authority to receive the payment on Arthur’s behalf. In other words, Arthur is estopped from denying that Boucher acted as Arthur’s agent in receiving the money from Kallis. In paying Boucher, Kallis is deemed to have paid Arthur and has discharged the obligation.|$|R

At {{the mouth of the}} Seine, or, rather, on the northern shore of the estuary which forms the mouth of the river, is a small inlet, which has been found to afford, on the whole, the best facilities for a harbor that {{can be found on the}} whole line of the coast. Even this little port, however, is so filled up with sand, that when the water recedes at low tide it leaves the shipping all aground. The inlet would, in fact, probably become filled up entirely were it not for artificial means taken to prevent it. There are locks and gateways built in such a manner as to retain a large body of water until the tide is down, and then these gates are opened, and the water is allowed to rush out all together, carrying with it the mud and sand which had begun to accumulate. This haven, being, on the whole, the best and most commodious on the coast, was called the harbor, or, as the French expressed it in their language, le havre, the word havre meaning harbor.
