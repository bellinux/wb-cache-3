40|$|A first {{space vehicle}} is {{attached}} {{with a second}} space vehicle which includes a rocket propulsion nozzle having a combustion chamber upstream from the nozzle throat. Apparatus 10 includes an elongate <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> 12 extending from the first space vehicle, a pair of inflatable bladders 16, 18 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> <b>for</b> engaging an inner surface of the combustion chamber upon inflation. {{and a pair of}} rear bladders 20, 22 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> <b>for</b> engaging an inner surface of the nozzle downstream from the combustion chamber upon inflation <b>for</b> aligning the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. A pressurized fluid source 24 is provided on the first space vehicle for supplying fluid pressure to the inflatable bladders. and a fluid control valve manifold 30 selectively controls the release of pressurized fluid to the bladders. According to the method of the invention. the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> is inserted into the rocket propulsion nozzle. and the control valves are actuated to first inflate the front bladders and thereby interconnect the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. The rear bladders are subsequently inflated to align a central axis of the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> with a central axis of the rocket propulsion nozzle. Inflation of the rear bladders provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front bladders. Attaching the vehicles in space may be controlled from the earth by activating the control valves to inflate the bladders. The cost of attaching space vehicles is significantly reduced by attaching a <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> on one vehicle with the existing rocket propulsion nozzle of another vehicle...|$|R
