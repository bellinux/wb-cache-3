This led to concerns about whether Department for Education (DfE) requirements not to teach creationism or intelligent design as science would be met. The other creationist schools included Exemplar-Newark Business Academy, whose <b>previous</b> <b>application</b> was rejected because of concerns over creationism, and a third school in Kent.

25|$|During the afternoon, {{the chief}} petty {{officers}} and petty officers {{were asked to}} confirm {{that they would not}} join the mutineers. Although they expressed similar concerns as the sailors (and {{because of the way the}} pay rates scaled for higher enlisted ranks, were worse off than before), and did not agree with the handling of the mutiny by the RNZN and the government, they all agreed to remain on duty. Over the following days, another 20 personnel who were sick or otherwise not present on 3 April applied to be discharged under similar conditions to the mutineers. Six were discharged: some were sailors whose <b>previous</b> <b>application</b> for demobilisation had been refused, the rest showed good reasons for ending their service on compassionate grounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of {{priority for the}} variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's <b>previous</b> <b>application</b> in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and {{because he did not}} contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.|$|E
25|$|The High Wycombe Society, a local {{conservation}} group, has {{campaigned for}} the last 14 years for the reinstatement of the line as Light rail, the feasibility of which was confirmed by an engineering survey of the route. In September 2008, Buckinghamshire County Council backed the proposal for reinstatement and called upon a private operator to finance the rebuilding work. The future of the route was raised at a planning hearing in November at which Wycombe District Council identified the prospect of reinstatement {{as a reason for}} refusing a planning application to construct housing over the trackbed at Wycombe Lane, Wooburn Green. A <b>previous</b> <b>application</b> for the same development was rejected in 2006 and the Council's decision was upheld on appeal to the planning inspector. In January 2009, the second attempt to build on the route of the railway line was rejected by the Planning Inspectorate which specifically cited the possible future reinstatement of the line as a reason for refusing consent.|$|E

2500|$|The Government stated that, {{unlike the}} Bail Act 1978, the new act {{is not based}} on a [...] "system of offence-based presumptions". Instead, {{it is based on the}} premise of whether the accused will present as an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] to society. The new act also allows for a further {{application}} if: the accused previously did not have legal representation, there is new relevant information, relevant circumstances have changed, or the accused is under 18 and the <b>previous</b> <b>application</b> was made on a first appearance for the offence. In May 2013, on the second reading of the Bail Bill, Attorney General and Minister for Justice Greg Smith described the Government's approach as one of [...] "risk-management". [...] The Bail Act 2013 adds an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test in regard to whether [...] "the accused will fail to appear in any proceedings for the offence, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or interfere with witnesses or evidence". One significant change is in consideration of [...] "the presumption of innocence and the general right to be at liberty." [...] Another important change is that [...] "once bail is granted, it will continue to operate until it is either revoked or the substantive proceedings concluded." [...] Under the Bail Act 2013, bail does not have to be formally continued by the court. When the bail authority determines that the accused poses an [...] "unacceptable risk", it must record the nature of the presumed risk and consider risk mitigation approaches. To determine whether there is an [...] "unacceptable risk", the bail authority can consider the person's background; the seriousness of the offence; the strength of the case; whether the person has a history of violence or non-compliance with bail requirements, apprehended violence orders, parole or good behaviour bonds; the likely length of the sentence if bail is not granted; and whether the person is of a disadvantaged group. It was noted by a member of the NSW Bar Association that, while they were not [...] "unusual or unfamiliar", not all of the factors the bail authority may consider are directly related to the [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test.|$|E
60|$|Besides this {{intercourse}} with Goethe, {{he was happy}} in a kindly connexion with many other estimable men, both in literary and in active life. Dalberg, at a distance, was to the last his friend and warmest admirer. At Jena, he had Schütz, Paul, Hufland, Reinhold. Wilhelm von Humboldt, also, brother of the celebrated traveller, had come thither about this time, and was now among his closest associates. At Weimar, excluding less important persons, there were still Herder and Wieland, to divide his attention with Goethe. And what to his affectionate heart {{must have been the}} most grateful circumstance of all, his aged parents were yet living to participate in the splendid fortune of the son whom they had once lamented and despaired of, but never ceased to love. In 1793 he paid them a visit in Swabia, and passed nine cheerful months among the scenes dearest to his recollection: enjoying the kindness of those unalterable friends whom Nature had given him; and the admiring deference of those by whom it was most delightful to be honoured,—those who had known him in adverse and humbler circumstances, whether they might have respected or contemned him. By the Grand Duke, his ancient censor and patron, he was not interfered with; that prince, in answer to a <b>previous</b> <b>application</b> on the subject, having indirectly engaged to take no notice of this journey. The Grand Duke had already interfered too much with him, and bitterly repented of his interference. Next year he died; an event which Schiller, who had long forgotten past ill-treatment, did not learn without true sorrow, and grateful recollections of bygone kindness. The new sovereign, anxious to repair the injustice of his predecessor, almost instantly made offer of a vacant Tübingen professorship to Schiller; a proposal flattering to the latter, but which, by the persuasion of the Duke of Weimar, he respectfully declined.|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} in “Introduction” section, a weakness in previously assumed ocean conductivity distributions was {{the difficulty in}} assessing the realism or associated errors in the estimates. With the climatology provided here, one may now assess these errors. Although some comments and comparisons are included here, {{it should be noted}} that with the climatology data now available there is little reason to justify the continued use of simplistic assumptions. The discussion here then serves only to address errors due to assumptions used in <b>previous</b> <b>applications.</b> As this is not the goal of this paper, the discussion here is kept brief. Because accuracy in the <b>previous</b> <b>applications</b> can depend on not just the values of the conductivity but also the gradients and integrals, it is also clear that such an error assessment would remain incomplete unless performed by the original investigators using the new conductivity data provided.|$|R
