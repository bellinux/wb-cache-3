40|$|Interaction {{between the}} host and {{pathogen}} determines {{the fate of}} both organisms during the infectious state. The host {{is equipped with a}} battery of immune reactions, while the pathogen displays a variety of mechanisms to compromise host immunity. Although bacteria alter their pattern of gene expression in host organisms, studies to elucidate the mechanism behind this are only in their infancy. We here examined the possibility that host immune proteins directly participate in the change of gene expression in bacteria. Escherichia coli was treated with a mixture of the extracellular region of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) -LC and the antimicrobial peptide attacin of Drosophila, and subjected to DNA microarray analysis for mRNA repertoire. We identified 133 annotated genes whose mRNA increased after the treatment, and at least four of them were induced in response to PGRP-LC. One such gene, lipoprotein-encoding nlpI, showed a transient increase of mRNA in adult flies depending on PGRP-LC but not <b>PGRP-LE.</b> NlpI-lacking <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> had a lowered growth rate and/or viability in flies than the parental strain. These results suggest that a host immune receptor triggers a change of gene expression in bacteria simultaneously with their recognition and induction of immune responses. Â© The Authors 2015.

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli EDL 933 {{is known}} to cause infection in the intestine. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 {{is used as a}} probiotic strain to prevent infection (63). When the mouse intestine is pre-colonized with <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 it prevents <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 from growing up in the intestine. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 is not eliminated from the intestine; it stays at the level in which it was fed to the mice. The P 41 L envZ missense mutation was previously shown to causes an increase in the level of phosporylated OmpR (OmpR~P) produced (67). <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 with the P 41 L missense envZ mutation is referred to as <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 mot- 1. These changes result in an improvement of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 colonization ability in the mouse intestine. The EnvZ/OmpR system positively regulates the small RNAs omrA and omrB (29). omrA and omrB were shown to negatively regulate a number of outer membrane genes including ompT, cirA, fepA, and fecA, (29). omrA and omrB work by hybridizing to mRNA thereby preventing translation from occurring (28). The mutant envZ gene was transferred to <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 to create <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1). The mutant envZ gene results in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 having improved colonization ability. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) grows slower than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype on many sugars and in cecal mucus. The <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) mutant grows slower on galactose than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype. When the ability to utilize galactose is eliminated from <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) it can no longer grow up in the mouse intestine in the presence of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype. This displays the importance of galactose utilization in the intestine for <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1). <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) may have access to a niche where galactose is being utilized that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 is unable to inhabit. If <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 was able to inhabit that niche then it would seem likely that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 would out compete <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) due to its superior ability to utilize galactose. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) was then colonized against <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 to see if its improved colonization ability also results in improved probiotic potential.

Here, mice were precolonized with any of three human commensal strains (<b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> HS, or <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917) and 10 days later were fed 105 CFU of the same strains. While each precolonized strain nearly eliminated its isogenic strain, confirming that colonization resistance can be modeled in mice, each allowed growth of the other commensal strains to higher numbers, consistent with different commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains using different nutrients in the intestine. Mice were also precolonized with any of five commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains for 10 days and then were fed 105 CFU of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933, an O 157 :H 7 pathogen. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EFC 1 limited growth of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 in the intestine (103 to 104 CFU/gram of feces), whereas <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> HS, and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EFC 2 allowed growth to higher numbers (106 to 107 CFU/gram of feces).

When <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 9 rfb was introduced into S. typhimurium strains possessing defects in rfb or rfc, they synthesized <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 9 LPS on their cell surfaces. The rfe-defective mutant of S. typhimurium synthesized only very small amounts of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 9 LPS after the introduction of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 9 rfb. These results confirmed the widely accepted idea that the biosynthesis of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 9 -specific polysaccharide does not require rfc but requires rfe. By using an rfbT mutant of the <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 9 rfb gene, the mechanism of transfer of the synthesized <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 9 -specific polysaccharide from antigen carrier lipid to the R-core of S. typhimurium was investigated.

40|$|Since {{the first}} step of the {{infection}} process is colonization of the host, {{it is important to understand}} how Escherichia coli patho-gens successfully colonize the intestine. We previously showed that enterohemorrhagic O 157 :H 7 strain <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 colonizes a niche in the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine that is distinct from that of human commensal strains, which explains how <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 overcomes colonization resistance imparted by some, but not all, commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains. Here we sought to determine if other <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> pathogens use a similar strategy. We found that uropathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> CFT 073 and enteropathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>E</b> 2348 / 69 occupy intestinal niches that are distinct from that of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933. In contrast, two enterohemorrhagic strains, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Sakai, occupy the same niche, suggesting that strategies to prevent colonization by a given pathotype should be effective against other strains of the same pathotype. However, we found that a combination of commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains that can prevent colonization by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 did not prevent colonization by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> CFT 073 or <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>E</b> 2348 / 69. Our results indicate that development of probiotics to target multiple <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> pathotypes will be problematic, as the factors that gov-ern niche occupation and hence stable colonization vary significantly among strains.

40|$|The {{relative}} colonizing {{abilities of}} Escherichia coli F- 18, {{isolated from the}} feces of a healthy human, and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 col-, a strain derived from it which {{does not make the}} <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 colicin, were studied. In a previous report, it was shown that when each strain was fed individually to streptomycin-treated mice, at approximately 10 (10) CFU per mouse, each colonized the large intestine at between 10 (7) and 10 (8) CFU/g of feces indefinitely. However, when simultaneously fed to mice, although <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 colonized at about 10 (8) CFU/g of feces, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 col- dropped to a level of 10 (3) CFU/g of feces within 3 to 5 days. In the present investigation, we show that when given enough time to establish a state of colonization, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 col- persists in feces in high numbers despite subsequent challenge by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18. Therefore, a major defect in the ability of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 col- to colonize in the presence of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 appears to be in initiating that state. In addition, when mucus was scraped from the cecal wall and, without further treatment, was inoculated with <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 or F- 18 col-, both strains grew well. However, when cecal mucus was inoculated with both strains simultaneously, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 grew far more rapidly than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 col-. Moreover, neither strain grew in cecal luminal contents. Together, these data suggest the possibility that both <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 and F- 18 col- must grow in mucus to colonize the streptomycin-treated mouse large intestine, that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 col- is eliminated by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 because it does not grow in mucus as well as <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18, and that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 col- can resist elimination by <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> F- 18 if it is allowed enough time to establish itself within the mucus layer...|$|R

Results: After successful colonization with the IBD associated <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains in mice the introduction of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle did not result in eradication of either IBD associated strains or an <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> from a healthy control, instead, co-colonization at high levels were obtained.
