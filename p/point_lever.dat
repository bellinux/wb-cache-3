50|$|The points {{failure was}} caused by the {{extremely}} cold weather that day freezing the point mechanisms. When the signalman had accepted the fish train from the previous signalbox to the North, he needed to swing the facing points (that allowed entry into the Up Platform Loop from the Up line) from reverse to normal. When he pushed the lever back into the frame he was able to engage the point lock and thus clear the signal. Unbeknown to him, the point rods had actually bent due to the mechanisms freezing up, which allowed him to place the <b>point</b> <b>lever</b> in the normal position, but actually left the points in reverse. This accident is one of the very rare occasions where mechanical interlocking has failed to work correctly.|$|E
50|$|The {{route to}} the north of Hardridge Hill is lifted, the rest of the route is largely intact, {{although}} the track itself is obscured by moor growth and can only be detected in places as a depression in the peat. The eastern triangular junction is largely complete and crossed by a recent dirt road. The points remain at all three corners, with the weighted <b>point</b> <b>lever.</b> The line to the south crosses a small viaduct built from two 'I' girders and a sleepers; the largest such structure on the railway. The western triangular junction is more overgrown than the eastern one. The western points here are overgrown completely, but the western and southern points can be found. The southern points still work. There is a siding at Lairds Seat.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere, signals {{controlling}} sidings {{were controlled}} by keys which simultaneously locked or unlocked the <b>point</b> <b>levers.</b> Thus {{there was no}} point rodding.|$|R
50|$|It {{was clear}} that the {{signalman}} had stood for some seconds with the <b>points</b> <b>lever</b> slightly out of its frame, moved it just as the sixth coach was passing over it, then returned it to its normal position. This would be a premeditated rather than an accidental act.|$|R
50|$|One {{characteristic}} of the locomotive was a design fault that caused it to derail. The problem would only occur when the locomotive was travelling smokebox first over facing hand operated points, usually {{to be found in}} colliery sidings, marshalling yards and the dock area. The rear coupled wheels, nearest the bunker, would force the tongue of the point open, causing the trailing bogie not to follow the driving wheels but to take the wrong road. These points had the disadvantage of not having a locking mechanism which could be found on facing points on the main line. At its worst, the result could be derailment, one example being that of No 147 which when entering Barry Sidings with a coal train from Coity, ended up on its side. Less severe but nonetheless serious damage could also be sustained. If the balancing pipe between the side and bunker tanks became fractured, the tanks would lose water rapidly and the fire would have to be dropped to prevent a boiler explosion. In practical terms, the crews would usually solve the problem by having the fireman hold on to the <b>point</b> <b>lever</b> while the driver took the locomotive through the point extremely slowly. Several engineering solutions were attempted both on the locomotive and on the track to overcome the problem but never fully successfully.|$|E

A huge array of parts with a vast range of applications.|$|R
25|$|The {{line has}} three passing loops, around 15 minutes {{travelling}} time apart. Going up the mountain, these are at Hebron, Halfway and Clogwyn stations. The {{operation of the}} Hebron and Halfway loops was converted to semi-automatic operation in the early 1990s. The Clogwyn loop is still staffed and retains the original mechanical <b>point</b> <b>levers.</b> Waterfall station had a siding but never a loop, and has been closed for many years.|$|R
50|$|During World War II {{women were}} {{employed}} on various duties to alleviate staff shortages; {{at one time}} on the BP&GV section {{there was a woman}} porter and several women signallers, and at one period there were women operating all the signal boxes except Ty Mawr and Cwmmawr. They found that some of the <b>point</b> <b>levers</b> were difficult to operate, especially those at Dock Junction and Kidwelly Junction boxes, with each lever working both the points and the locking.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Surprise station complex has {{the most}} intact group of railway buildings, and its station building, goods shed, small timber shed and water tank are all good {{examples}} of their type. Other elements, such as two railway houses, a trolley shed, sandbox, sidings, turning fork and signals and <b>points</b> <b>levers</b> all contribute {{to an understanding of}} how a rural railway station functioned. The shower under the water tank illustrates the past lifestyle of railway workers.|$|R

They were open-ended and painted in yellow and white. the tramcars were staffed by two men, a wattman, who drove the trams, and a ticket inspector, {{who was in}} charge of collecting fares, the trolley pole and <b>point</b> <b>levers.</b> The tramcars were modernised after World War I and their open ends closed as well as the replacing of the two motors by one more powerful.|$|R
25|$|On 26 August 1940, {{a bombing}} raid {{destroyed}} a goods shed at Bordesley, West Midlands. During the raid Peter Smout, an 18-year-old engine cleaner who was {{acting as the}} fireman on a shunter, volunteered to drive No. 7758 to pull wagons out of the blazing goods shed. He made three more trips. He was assisted by Frederick Blake, a wagon examiner and a navy veteran from World War I, who operated the <b>points</b> <b>levers.</b> When they finished, the right hand side of the footplate was too hot to touch, and Blake had to use his hat to work the <b>points</b> as the <b>levers</b> were also too hot to touch. Both men were awarded the George Medal for their courage.|$|R
50|$|Automatic signalling, using two-position signals, was {{provided}} in September 1919. The line also had sidings serving the Newmarket sale yards and other industries, {{and the line}} was operated as a siding most of the time, the points being connected to adjacent <b>point</b> <b>levers</b> and the signals being put out of use. When passenger services were operated on the line, the points were connected to the signal boxes and the signals were brought into use. This arrangement finished in the 1980s or 1990s when the sidings were closed.|$|R
25|$|The lever is a movable {{bar that}} pivots on a fulcrum {{attached}} to a fixed <b>point.</b> The <b>lever</b> operates by applying forces at different distances from the fulcrum, or a pivot.|$|R
50|$|A {{lever lock}} {{is made up}} of a set of 'levers' (typically between two and five) which are raised to {{different}} heights by the key when it is turned. Once all the levers have been moved to the correct height, the locking bolt is free to slide across and secure the door. The teeth or bittings of the key have flat tops rather than being <b>pointed.</b> <b>Lever</b> lock keys tend to be bigger and less convenient for carrying, although lever locks are considered to be harder to pick and so are recommended by most insurance companies.|$|R
50|$|A <b>points</b> <b>lever,</b> ground throw, or switchstand is a lever and {{accompanying}} linkages {{that are used}} to align the points of a switch manually. This lever and its accompanying hardware is usually mounted to a pair of long sleepers that extend from the switch at the points. They are often used in a place of a switch motor on infrequently used switches. In some places, the lever may be some distance from the points, as part of a lever frame or ground frame. To prevent the tampering of switches by outside means, these switches are locked up when not in use.|$|R
50|$|As {{the train}} {{passed over the}} first of two points, the {{embedded}} tyre slammed against the guide rail of the points, pulling it from the railway ties. This guide rail also penetrated the floor of the car, becoming embedded in the vehicle and lifting the axle carriage off the rails. At 10:59 local time (08:59 UTC), one of the now-derailed wheels struck the <b>points</b> <b>lever</b> of the second switch, changing its setting. The rear axles of car number 3 were switched onto a parallel track, and the entire car was thereby thrown into the piers supporting a 300 t roadway overpass, destroying them.|$|R

50|$|The Department of Transport inquiry {{found the}} {{accident}} {{to be due}} to the railwaymen failing to secure the points in the position in which they had set them. The report suggested that the signalman (though he had no recollection of doing so) had attempted to set the <b>points</b> <b>lever</b> in his cabin to the position matching that to which they had set them. This would have reset the circuit so that the points actually moved to the original position. The driver of the freight train was also held partially responsible, as he should have stopped his train at the signal box to receive further instructions.|$|R

50|$|Three of {{the unusual}} six-wheeled coaches survive {{on the island}} with one {{accompanying}} Thornhill in private ownership and two on the railway: one without its running gear and another in private ownership having spent 1976-1998 in the Port Erin Railway Museum. The unique Foxdale Coach survives in regular traffic on the south line, and a goods van (Gr. 12) was rebuilt in 1997 and remains in use on the line. As part of the annual transport festival a genuine Manx Northern Train has operated in recent times. Many smaller items survive in use on the railway today, such as signal <b>levers</b> and various <b>point</b> <b>levers</b> inherited in 1905 and transferred around the system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} station layout at Honeybourne was basic: a two platform {{station on}} the [...] to Worcester line which {{was connected to the}} single track line to Stratford via a double junction from which an east to north curve forked to the northeast. The curve, which was later known as the [...] "East Loop", was controlled by a single signalbox {{that was one of the}} first in the country to have an interlocking frame mechanically preventing conflicting signal and <b>point</b> <b>levers</b> being pulled. North of the platforms was a small goods yard comprising two sidings and a small engine shed, which was used to stable engines that banked goods trains over the steep incline to Campden.|$|R
50|$|Although both {{nature and}} human {{development}} have taken their toll on {{what remains of the}} railway, some remnants survive. Some of the formation has been destroyed by farming, but much of it can still be traced. Both goods shed and passenger shelter still stand at Kingston Crossing, while at the site of Waimea station two <b>points</b> <b>levers</b> are positioned by the old loading bank. Another loading bank exists at St Patricks, complete with a mounted nameboard. In Balfour, the sealed station platform is now a part of a children's playground, and in the former junction town of Lumsden, the station building is used as a tourist centre. The other junction station in Gore is still busy as a stop on the Main South Line between Dunedin and Invercargill, although its passenger service ceased in 2002.|$|R
50|$|On 21 June 1887, an {{excursion}} {{train from}} Sydney {{ran out of}} control down the steep Cowan Bank. There were two other trains full of holidaymakers standing at the platforms at Hawkesbury River railway station and disaster was only averted by the alert station master who could hear the roaring engine and frantic whistling. He dispatched a railway porter to throw the <b>points</b> <b>lever</b> open and divert the runaway down a siding {{that led to the}} new bridge site. The train lost speed along the railway causeway out to Long Island and collided with some empty wagons. The locomotive slid off the embankment and ended up partially submerged in the river.

50|$|Finally, {{the awkward}} layout of tablet instruments, signals and <b>points</b> <b>levers</b> at Abermule {{meant that it}} was {{possible}} for conflicting movements to be made. The inquiry recommended that tablet machines be placed in the signal box under the sole control of the signalman, and also that starting signals (which gave trains authority to leave the station) be interlocked with the tablet instruments, so that they could not be cleared until the correct tablet had been released. However, this would involve the rebuilding of the station buildings and signal boxes at Abermule and several other small stations, and it was suggested that alternate single-line sections use the electric tablet system and the older electric staff system; there would be no possibility of mistaking a staff for a tablet. The signalling method continued in use on the line until 1988, when it was replaced by the radio-controlled electronic token block system.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} three major railway {{accidents}} in Brooklyn over the years. On 21 June 1887, an excursion train from Sydney ran out of control down the steep Cowan Bank.

40|$|When using lever tools, {{subjects}} have to {{deal with}} two, not necessarily concordant effects of their motor behavior: The body-related proximal effects, like tactile sensations from the moving hand, and/or more external distal effects, like the moving effect <b>points</b> of the <b>lever.</b> As a consequence, spatial compatibility relationships between stimulus (S; at which the effect <b>points</b> of the <b>lever</b> aim at), responding hand (R) and effect <b>point</b> of the <b>lever</b> (E) {{play a critical role in}} response generation. In the present study we examine whether the occurrence of compatibility effects needs real tool movements or whether a similar response pattern can be already evoked by pure mental imaginations of the tool effects. In general, response times and errors observed with real and imagined tool movements showed a similar pattern of results, but there were also differences. With incompatible relationships and thus more difficult tasks, response times were reduced with imagined tool movements than compared with real tool movements. On the contrary, with compatible relationships and thus high overlap between proximal and distal action effects, response times were increased with imagined tool movements. Results are only in parts consistent with the ideomotor theory of motor control...|$|R
40|$|An accumulating body of {{research}} suggests that African Americans cast invalid ballots {{at a higher rate}} than whites. Our analysis of a unique precinct-level dataset from South Carolina and Louisiana shows that the black-white gap in voided ballots depends crucially on the voting equipment people use. In areas with punch cards or optically scanned ballots, the black-white gap ranged from four to six percentage <b>points.</b> <b>Lever</b> and electronic machines, which prohibit overvoting and make undervoting more transparent and correctible, cut the discrepancy by a factor of ten. Judging from exit polls and opinion surveys, much of the remaining difference could be due to intentional undervoting, which African Americans profess to practice at a slightly higher rate than whites. In any case, the use of appropriate voting technologies can virtually eliminate the black-white disparity in invalid ballots. An accumulating body {{of research}} points to a racial gap in voided ballots. African Americans, several studies suggest, cast invalid presidential votes at a higher rate than whites (e. g., Brady et al. 2001; Herron and Sekhon 2001; Posner 2001).

50|$|It {{could be}} {{regarded}} as having its distant origins in the escapement invented by Robert Robin, C.1792, which gives a single impulse in one direction; with the locking achieved by passive lever pallets, {{the design of the}} coaxial escapement is more akin to that of another Robin variant, the Fasoldt escapement, which was invented and patented by the American Charles Fasoldt in 1859.Both Robin and Fasoldt escapements give impulse in one direction only.The latter escapement has a lever with unequal drops; this engages with two escape wheels of differing diameters. The smaller impulse wheel acts on the single pallet {{at the end of the}} <b>lever,</b> whilst the <b>pointed</b> <b>lever</b> pallets lock on the larger wheel.The balance engages with and is impelled by the lever through a roller pin and lever fork. The lever 'anchor' pallet locks the larger wheel and, on this being unlocked, a pallet on the end of the lever is given an impulse by the smaller wheel through the lever fork. The return stroke is 'dead', with the 'anchor' pallets serving only to lock and unlock, impulse being given in one direction through the single lever pallet.As with the duplex, the locking wheel is larger in order to reduce pressure and thus friction.|$|R
50|$|The {{significant}} {{elements of}} Forsayth Station include: a semaphore signal frame with signal arm {{at the east}} end of the yards, south of the main line; a trolley shed south of the line at {{the east end of}} the station; a siding north of the main line, and a turning fork north of the main line; another trolley shed south of the main line near the start of the east arm of the fork; a sandbox and a <b>points</b> <b>lever</b> to the east of the second trolley shed; loading bank and a signal lever south of the main line; a station building to the south of the main line and west of the loading bank; a goods shed north of the siding and west of the station building; cattle yards west of the fork; a loading bank east of the apex of the fork; and a framed tent quarters east of the apex of the fork. The nearby station master's residence at Forsayth is separately listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Non-significant elements include: modern demountable buildings east of the station; modern toilets east of the fork line; a shelter shed for a DR2 diesel locomotive (one of a number which hauled stock on the Etheridge line) south of the main line; and a large modern steel shed {{on the west side of}} the cattle yards.|$|R
