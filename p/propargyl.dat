25|$|Starting {{point for}} the {{synthesis}} of ring A was methoxydimethylindol 3 synthesised by condensation of the Schiff base from m-anisidine 1 and acetoin 2.

25|$|Selegiline {{belongs to}} a class of drugs called phenethylamines. Selegiline is an L-methamphetamine {{derivative}} with a <b>propargyl</b> group attached to the nitrogen atom. This detail is borrowed from pargyline, an older phenethylamine MAO-B inhibitor.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to potentially toxic amphetamine metabolites caused by selegiline, another promising treatment is in MAO B <b>propargyl</b> amine inhibitor rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))). The oral bioavailability of rasagiline is 35%, it reaches T(max) after 0.5–1.0 hours and its half-life is 1.5–3.5 hours. Rasagiline undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by cytochrome P450 type 1A2 (CYP1A2). Rasagiline is initiated at 1-mg once-daily dose as monotherapy in early PD patients and at 0.5–1.0mg once-daily as adjunctive to levodopa in advanced PD patients.|$|E
