40|$|Abstract This study {{assessed}} the antimicrobial efficacy and surface tension of established irrigating solutions {{with a new}} experimental chelating solution in infected dentin tubes. Twenty-five specimens {{were randomly assigned to}} each of the irrigating solutions. Twenty specimens were used as negative and positive controls. After 21 days of contamination with E. faecalis, the irrigating solutions MTAD, QMiX and Tetraclean NA were delivered into each infected root canal. The solutions were removed and dentin samples were withdrawn from the root canals with sterile low-speed round burs with increasing ISO diameters. The dentin powder samples obtained with each bur were immediately collected in separate test tubes containing 3 mL of BHI broth. After that, 100 &# 956;L from each test tube was cultured on blood agar. The grown colonies were counted and recorded as colony-forming units (CFU). The surface tension of the irrigants was measured using a Cahn DCA- 322 Dynamic Contact Angle Analyzer. A Kruskal Wallis nonparametric ANOVA and a Friedman test were used (p< 0. 05). Tetraclean NA showed lower surface tension and CFU values than MTAD and QMiX. Better antibacterial action and low surface tension were observed for Tetraclean NA, probably due to the improved <b>penetration</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> canal and dentinal tube...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of applying fertilizers {{to the soil}} by adding the liquid form to the irrigation water is increasing in popularity. There are several advantages maintained for such a method of application. Some of the advantages are: (A) Ease of application (B) No special equipment is required for application. (C) The fertilizer can be applied at any stage of plant growth without physical disturbance of the plant. (D) <b>Penetration</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> zone may be greater than the dry fertilizers. Considerable phosphate fertilizer is used on soils of irrigated regions. If the behavior of liquid phosphoric acid after its incorporation with soil is such that it penetrates into the root zone and is otherwise as efficient as dry phosphate fertilizers in inducing favorable plant response, then it would seem practical to utilize the other advantages offered by applying the fertilizer in irrigation water. Commercial phosphoric acid (52 % available P 2 O 5) is produced by applying an excess of sulfuric acid to ground rock phosphate. This phosphoric acid is usually applied to an additional amount of phosphate rock to make concentrated superphosphate. A given quantity of phosphoric acid can yield more available phosphorus by applying it to rock phosphate than by using it directly as a fertilizer. Because of its potential value in producing concentrated superphosphate commercial phosphoric acid has been used very little as a fertilizer. There is insufficient research in which the comparative value of the acid as a fertilizer has been investigated {{the purpose of the}} studies reported in this paper are, to compare: (A) the value of commercial phosphoric acid and concentrated superphosphate as fertilizers when applied in equivalent amounts and, (B) the different methods of application and dilution of the phosphoric acid...|$|E

Out of eight described genes, potentially related to mechanisms of aluminium stress, only phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) revealed enhanced expression in roots of tolerant as compared to sensitive soybean cultivars under stress conditions. Additionally, two novel full-length cDNA sequences, homologous to translationally controlled tumour proteins (TCTP, clone 58, GenBank accession number AF 421558) and inosine- 5 ¢-monophosphate dehydrogenases (IMPDH, clone 633, GenBank accession number AF 421559) with enhanced expression of the corresponding genes only in roots of Al-tolerant soybean cultivar under stress conditions were isolated and characterized. For functional analysis fulllength cDNA 633 was transferred in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Under sole crops of maize and cowpea, respectively, P. sefaensis and M. javanica were three and two times as numerous as those under the crop mixtures; R. reniforntis was nine times more abundant under cowpea than under maize sole crop. In al 1 cases, mixed cultures significantly reduced soi 1 numbers of P. sefaensis relative to maize monoculture, and M. javanica and R. reniformis relative to cowpea sole crop with consequent benefits to both crops. Within cowpea roots, both P. sefaensisand R. renifonxiswere less in plants under mixed cultures, although R. renifomzis inside maize <b>roots</b> increased under <b>the</b> system. The nematodes in concomitance inhibited one another significantly, especially where the three occurred together.

40|$|International audienceHigher {{degree of}} soil {{penetrometer}} resistance can reduce forage yields {{and can lead}} to water and soil quality degradation due to increased runoff and soil structure destruction. <b>The</b> inability of <b>roots</b> to penetrate in soils with high penetrometer resistance will result in decreased yield. With less <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soil, <b>root</b> mass is reduced and plant's ability to take up nutrients is reduced. To test whether cattle congregation sites typical on most forage-based cow-calf ranches, such as mineral feeders, water troughs, and shaded areas are more compacted and have greater soil penetrometer resistance than in other pasture locations under Florida conditions, soil penetrometer resistance data around and beneath three cattle congregation sites in established (> 10 yr) grazed beef cattle pastures were collected in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Penetrometer readings were collected from two soil depths (0 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm) at different locations around the cattle congregation sites following radial (every 90 degrees: north, south, east, and west direction) sampling patterns at 0. 9, 1. 7, 3. 3, 6. 7, 13. 3, 26. 7 and 53. 3 m away from the approximate center of cattle congregation sites. Results showed that area around or near cattle congregation sites tended to have higher soil penetrometer resistance values than in other locations within pasture field because of the frequent concentration of cattle around the different cattle congregation sites. Soil penetrometer resistance decreases linearly with distance away from the center of mineral feeders and water troughs; however, soil penetrometer resistance at the shaded areas was showing slight increase with distance away from the center. The least soil penetrometer resistance in all years were observed from shaded areas (1 200 × 103 Pa) while soil penetrometer resistance at water troughs was about 1 600 × 103 Pa and at mineral feeders of 1 800 × 103 Pa. These values were in the "fair" range of root penetration.

40|$|Summary Plant-parasitic root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., {{can cause}} major damage to their host plants. They are {{globally}} widespread and their host range encompasses more than 250, 000 plants, including many economical important crops. For example, yield losses resulting from Meloidogyne incognita infestation can range between 50 to 100 %. The damage they cause, {{results from the}} fact that they influence that vascular system of their host plant in such a way, that it can take up less and less water and nutrients from the soil, eventually leading to death. Furthermore, root-knot nematodes make the plant more sensitive to secondary infections by other pathogens and abiotic stress, such as drought. The control of these nematodes is, however, problematic as they reside in the soil and are difficult to reach, they have a short life cycle and are able to produce many offspring, they can cause much damage and have a wide host range. Moreover, the use of traditional nematicides has been prohibited due to their toxicity for humans and environment. For example, the use of the fumigant methyl bromide {{was one of the most}} used control practice, but is now illegal in Belgium. This prohibition urges for research into alternative nematode control strategies, such as defense elicitors to replace the traditional chemical nematicides. Defense elicitors or elicitors, can induce systemic resistance in plants against plant-parasitic nematodes upon exogenous application. Some examples are chitosan (poly-D-glucosamine), the plant hormone or growth regulator methyl jasmonate and acibenzolar-S-methyl, the active component of the commercially available product Bion (Syngenta). These elicitors were selected based on literature reports. The state of the art concerning defense elicitation and root-knot nematodes is discussed in Chapter 1. In the study reported in Chapter 2, the three elicitors mentioned above are tested for their direct toxic effect on the root-knot nematodes. This has been investigated by an in vitro bio-assay. In this study, second-stage juveniles (J 2) of Meloidogyne incognita were incubated into a range of concentrations of the elicitors. The mortality percentage was noted at 24 and 48 h after incubation. After 48 h, an overload of water was added, in such that after 12 h it could be noted whether the nematodes were indeed dead or only temporarily sedated. Our results show that all elicitors can have a nematoxic effect. This means that in experiments the elicitors should be applied in such a way that they do not come in direct contact with the nematodes. Otherwise, this could influence results when investigating systemic defense elicitation. Our results did show that it would be interesting in the future to apply these elicitors through soil applications against root-knot nematodes. In the study reported in Chapter 3, the efficacy of the three selected elicitors was further investigated. Their efficacy was tested in several greenhouse experiments, in which the leaves of tomato plants (cultivar Marmande) were sprayed with the elicitors. Two days later, the plants were inoculated with root-knot nematodes. Every elicitor was also applied in three different concentrations. All tomato plants were then investigated in galling (“root-knots”), nematode reproduction and several plant growth variables. The results of these experiments were not according to expectations. Namely, there was no effect on the root-knot nematodes, not even at the application of the highest concentration of the elicitors, which only resulted in some cases in phytotoxicity. Therefore, a verification was needed that the plants were indeed elicitated after defense elicitor application before continuing the research. Through a quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), there was confirmation that the defense system was indeed elicitated at the time point where the nematodes were inoculated. Furthermore, it was clear that both methyl jasmonate and chitosan a systemic effect had. Namely, there was also defense induction in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> system of <b>the</b> plant when these elicitors were sprayed on the leaves. Our results did not indicate that Bion had a systemic effect, and this elicitor was then not included in the next experiments. Chitosan was also left out because of a limited knowledge on its effect on the plant and root-knot nematodes in particular. The next studies then focused on methyl-jasmonate. One reason why defense elicitation did not work in our study, could have been the pathogen pressure. To investigate this factor, we researched this in the study reported in Chapter 4 through a greenhouse experiment. In this experiment, we sprayed methyl-jasmonate on tomato plants and two days later, these plants were subsequently inoculated with root-knot nematodes in 4 different densities. At the termination of the experiment, the same variables were measured as mentioned in Chapter 3. The results pointed towards no effect of nematode inoculation densities on the efficacy of defense induction by methyl jasmonate. Interestingly, a facilitation effect was observed, as nematode reproduction was positively influenced by the presence of other nematodes. However, from a certain population density, nematodes started to compete with each other, probably for nutrients. Because inoculation density was not a factor influencing the efficacy of defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate, another factor was investigated, namely, repetitive application of the defense elicitor (Chapter 5). In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated whether weekly spraying could increase the efficacy of defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate. At the termination of the experiment, again, the same variables were measured as mentioned in Chapter 3. There was also a qRT-PCR coupled to this experiment, to try to elucidate what the influence was of the nematode infection on the elicitation of the defense system. Samples were therefore taken at 1 hour, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days after the first spray, and 2 days after the fourth and last spray. From the results emanating from the qRT-PCR, it became clear that the root-knot nematodes already down regulated the up regulated defense system of the plants. These results thus can explain at least part of the former results obtained in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. Furthermore, the results showed that the systemic effect manifested itself 1 day after spray, and that this lasted until at least 4 days, but no longer than 7 days after spray. Therefore, to have a continuous methyl jasmonate elicitated tomato plant, one should spray at least weekly. It also became clear that tomato plants indeed can be elicitated repetitively. However, our results showed that weekly spraying methyl jasmonate had an unexpected detrimental effect. Namely, the nematodes developed faster in weekly sprayed plants versus single sprayed plants or water sprayed plants. This resulted, however, not in a higher reproduction by the nematodes. This last observation could be explained by the competition for available nutrients between the nematodes. In the study reported in Chapter 6, the influence of the tomato genotype on the efficacy of the defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate was investigated. Therefore, four different tomato cultivars (Marmande, Money Maker, Tiny Tim and Roma) were selected based on the reports in which successful defense elicitation was observed. In our study, the four cultivars were sprayed a single time with methyl jasmonate or water, and were inoculated 2 days later with nematodes. At the termination of the experiment, the same variables as mentioned in Chapter 3 were measured. Only in cv. Roma plants, methyl jasmonate spray resulted in a significant decrease of egg masses. Therefore, to investigate whether this was a result of either less nematode <b>penetration</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>roots,</b> or a slower development or only an effect in the reproduction phase of <b>the</b> nematodes, <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of cv. Roma plants were further analyzed. The results pointed towards an effect of methyl jasmonate spray on all three of the phases, but was most apparent on the reproduction phase. Finally, in Chapter 7, all results were generally discussed in order to end up with a general conclusion. Several suggestions for future research were also stated. status: publishe...|$|R
