Total aluminium {{has a tendency to}} gradually increase from pH 6. 0 to about 4. 0, and then Altot is abruptly released. Almono occurs in soils of pH 5. 5 and lower. The percentage of Almono/Altot is lower in soils of Salaš and Jabučje and it reached 100 % at pH equal to 3. 09 and 3. 40, and in Kladovo and Arilje it accounted for 100 % at pH equal to 4. 10 and 4. 41. Above these pH values there are less toxic polymeric Al, which is important in assessing the adverse effects of Al on the plant.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of two-year model experiments on four soil types (red soil, pseurdogley, brown soil on calcareous and alluvial soil), the aim of which was to study the effects of soil compaction and fertilizing on the yield of winter wheat and soybean. The results obtained for winter wheat are shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4, and those for soybean in Tables 5, 6 and 7. The results show that the increased compaction (above 1. 6) of <b>pseudogley</b> and brown soil on calcareous loss leads to a significant yield decrease in both winter wheat and soybean, the latter responding more drastically to the compaction increase. On the other hand, neither crop, when grown on red and alluvial soils, responded with any significant changes of the yield to changed soil compaction. With the exception of <b>pseudogley</b> in case of soybean, fertilizing had a significant effect on both crops on all the other soil types. Increased fertilizer doses resulted in higher yields. The less favourable effect of fertilizing on soybean grown on <b>pseudogley,</b> although there was a tendency to increased yields at higher fertilizer doses, can be explained by unfavourable physical properties of <b>pseudogley</b> {{for the development of the}} soybean root system. When evaluating the interaction of compaction and fertilizing on the yield of winter wheat and soybean, the prevailing effect of fertilizing becomes evident. This also applies to their individual effects. The results also indicate that excessive compaction cannot be compensated by intensified fertilizing. However, the combination of less compaction and higher fertilizer doses brings out their full interaction on the yields of winter wheat and soybean. Soil compaction is one of the acute problems of modern agriculture, so that there is an increasing need to determine optimal compaction for particular crops. This may be achieved by model experiments, both under controlled conditions and in the field, which enable measurable regulation of different degrees of compaction...|$|E
40|$|Accepting {{the known}} {{advantage}} of lucerne, {{both in the}} biological and agrotechnical respect, an 8 -year experiment with lucerne {{was carried out in}} two phases. In the first phase, that is rotation, investigations covered the introduction of lucerne onto <b>pseudogley,</b> while in the second phase the possibilities were investigated of its repeated growing, as a further step in the complex consideration of the up-to-date agrotechnical and other problems in the growing of lucerne. In this connection, special attention was paid to the description of the climatic and edaphic characteristics of the region in which the experiment was laid out. The results of the first rotation of the experiment are presented in Table 1, and those of the second rotation in Tables 2 and 3. The results of the introduction of lucerne onto <b>pseudogley,</b> though only partially in this paper, show that, through application of certain agrotechnical practices, it is possible to introduce lucerne onto this soil type and that this measure presents a significant new quality in raising the production capacity of <b>pseudogley</b> to a higher level. The results also show that deep ploughing and mineral fertilizing, without application of organic fertilizers, are capable of preparing a substratum suitable for lucerne growing and that this development path of agrotechnical amelioration of <b>pseudogley</b> is not only shorter in time but also considerably cheaper in comparison with gradual deepening of the soil and cation of organic fertilizers. In the first rotation, fertilizing was fully expressed, even ensuring a mean 5 -year hay yield over 100 q/ha. In this respect, besides phosphorus and potassium, a significant part was played by boron and molybdenum, while liming was less justifiable. The successful completion of the first investigation phase created the basis for embarking upon the second phase, i. e. the investigation of possibilities of the repeated growing of lucerne, keeping in mind the early withering of lucerne and its intolerance to the repeated growing, related to the phenomenon of „soil fatigue“. As the introduction of lucerne to <b>pseudogley</b> is in itself a relatively costly practice (ploughing at the depth of 60 cm), one of the aims of investigating the possibilities of its repeated growing was to determine if the same productivity level can be maintained by less intensive agrotechnical practices (ploughing at the depths of 20 and 30 cm), as a compensation for the first rotation. Also here good results were obtained. Still, it is our opinion that the investigations of the repeated growing of lucerne should be continued in different ecological conditions, including also the other aspects of this problem...|$|E

According to [29] an average C storage of 96, 7 t/ha can be expected for the mineral soil and the humus layer in North Rhine-Westphalia which is 17.8 % lower than what was calculated in the investigation at hand. Scheffer [14] estimated about 183 mio t C to be stored in the forests of North Rhine-Westphalia. The difference of 36 mio t C {{may be due to}} the fact that [14] summed up information on the C storage in the root mass (14.6 t/ha), the herbaceous layer (1.1 t/ha) and the remains of the timber harvest (76.8 t/ha) together with the C storage of the living forest trees. C storage, 16.9 t/ha (15 mio t), was calculated for the humus layer which lies 2.4 t/ha lower than estimated by lognormal kriging based on forest inventory data. For the mineral soil, they estimated 93.7 t C/ha which is 3 t/ha higher than in the study at hand. Baritz and Strich [30] calculated a mean C content in the humus layer of 20.7 t C/ha for Germany which is slightly above the concentration calculated for the forests of North Rhine-Westphalia. In the same study a C average of 87.9 t C/ha was calculated for the mineral soil down to a depth of 0.9 m which is very close to the 81.5 mio t C calculated in this study. For the latter, the mineral soil layer was defined to a depth of 2 m. [31] claim that the C storage in mineral soils can highly differ due to different bedrocks: soils with calcareous bedrocks show the highest C contents (115 t/ha) whereas <b>pseudogleys</b> influenced by stagnant water show the lowest values (47 t/ha). Wirth et al. [32] found that the forests of Thuringia fix 27.7 ± 8.1 t C/ha in the humus layer.

40|$|The {{vegetation}} of the Sangha {{region in}} the North of the Congo Republic is composed of a mosaic of forest formations including semi-deciduous humid dense forests characterized by Ulmaceae and Sterculiaceae, evergreen forests with Gilbertiodendron dewevrei and woodland with Marantaceae. Palynological analyses proved that this region witnessed an arid phase 2500 years ago. This was associated with an important reduction of the forest cover and an equal extension of savannahs that could have facilitated the migrations of the Bantou people and the propagation of the shifting cultivation agriculture in the whole region which is, still at the moment, sparsely populated. In order to verify climatic and anthropological influences on the present composition of the forest vegetation, a pedological investigation {{has been set up}} in the region of Pokola (1. 5 ° N; 16. 5 °E) comprising 43 drillings and 12 pits along a gradient covering the different forest types. Charcoal has been found in 84 % of the cores in all the forest formations especially between 30 cm and 60 cm depth. Charred oil palm seeds (Elaeis guineensis), often a culture accompanying species, have been found in 60 % of the pits. C 14 analysis revealed dates between 600 and 2200 years BP. Pedological analyses showed the association between semi-deciduous humid dense forest and red ferralsols, between Marantaceae woodlands and ochre ferralsols (poorer than the former) and between Gilbertiodendron dewevrei stands and <b>pseudogleys</b> and gleysols. The identification of the botanical taxon of charcoal fragments from tropical regions deals with important limitations due to scarce reference collections that are far from being complete. Therefore it is crucial to combine a thorough knowledge of the different vegetation types and their character species with a wood anatomical study. Given the hypothesised strong influence of man induced perturbations and past climatic changes, these results emphasize the importance of edaphic factors in differentiating the forest stands in the North of the Congo Republic. They also permit a better understanding of a potential evolution of the forests in this region driven by the actual climatic changes...|$|R

Austrian pine forests in this region are an important and ecologically valuable community. The complexity of the geological structure and relief dynamics are dominant environmental factors that condition the expressed variability of soils in the study area.

Three tillage systems were evaluated during a long-term experiment in Central Croatia in a period from 2011 to 2014, {{in order to identify}} sustainable land management practices: control treatment (CT), ploughing and other seedbed layer preparation up and down the slope; ploughing across the slope (PA) – to 30 cm, other operations depending on the crop, also across the slope; and ploughing across the slope (30 cm) with subsoiling (SUB) to 50 cm. Penetration resistance and soil water content were measured each investigated season during five terms to a depth of 60 cm. Tillage systems significantly influence soil water content and penetration resistance, but the results showed great temporal and vertical variation in each investigated season. The results also showed that in low quality <b>Pseudogley</b> deep loosening is required because of the inability of these soils to recover naturally. The hardness of these soils decreases after tillage, or when the moisture content increases, so the period with potentially limiting soil impedance is shorter in systems with subsoiling than in conventionally tilled soils. Fallow has been effective in reducing soil strength in non-traffic areas and increasing soil moisture content. When comparing cropping variants it was established that only a system including subsoiling ensures higher moisture content. Results indicate that since soil water content and penetration resistance were adversely affected, subsoiling should be applied continuously in <b>Pseudogley</b> sites in the hills. Generally, soil resistance increased with time from the date of primary tillage. Although penetration resistance values increase after tillage, the differences were attributed to temporal variation of soil water content.

The <b>pseudogley</b> soils are the typical soils of the paddy lands in the Gilan and Mazanderan aeras which have been converted into land because of the recession of the sea. The abundance of the vegetation and the intensité of chemical weathering on Jurassic, cretaceous, and tertiary limestone and conglomerates, sandstone etc [...] . are responsible for the formation of thin cover of brown forest and yellow podzolic soils in the foot of Elburz mountains.

40|$|Heavy {{metals in}} lysimetric {{solution}} of <b>pseudogley</b> soils {{in the the}} Kupa and ^esma river areas Background and Purpose: The concentration of heavy metals in the en-vironment has increased due to, among other reasons, the influence of hu-man activity. An increase in concentration is not {{at the same level}} for all metals and depends mainly on the amount and the way of transmission, as well as the source of pollution. The way that any heavy metal moves within an ecosystem depends on the biogeochemical cycle. There are a number of ways of circulation between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere and biosphere. The transmission of heavy metals can be observed through atmo-spheric flows in the form of gases as well as sedimentation of dry and wet de-posits in the forest ecosystem Materials and Methods: The following heavy metals were monitored: lead (Pb) copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). Sampling was per...|$|E

Aurora planted in hop garden in Croatia, {{near the village of}} Gregurovec (close to Križevci), during the six {{vegetation}} years (2001 [*]–[*] 2006, Srečec et al. 2008). The soil type of examined hop garden is an eutric <b>pseudogley</b> or eutric podzoluvisol. Content of physiological active phosphorus and potash, analysed by the AL-method, was medium. Average content of P 2 O 5 and K 2 O during the all six experimental years was 19.1 and 15.4  mg per 100 grams of soil, respectively. Content of humus in soil was very low, only 1.48 %. Fertilization was provided on the basis of plant uptake for phosphorus and potash and in three splits of nitrogen (50 [*]+[*] 70 [*]+[*] 50  kg/ha N on 20 th May, 10 th June and 5 th July) in all 6 experimental years. Meteorological data in Croatia were collected in Agro Meteorology Station in Križevci, placed five kilometres far away from the hop garden.|$|E
40|$|A three-year field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} soybean on lessive <b>pseudogley</b> soil at Čačinci locality (P. P. Orahovica d. d.) in North-eastern Croatia {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of chemical weed control through single or multiple applications of post-emergence herbicides, alone or in combinations and their effects on soybean yields. Main weeds were summer annual species of Echinochloa crus-galli (140 - 269 shoots/m 2), Ambrosia artemisiifolia (8 - 56 plants/m 2) and Chenopodium album (3 - 12 plants/m 2). All herbicide treatments showed high efficacy in control of annual grass- and broad-leaved weeds, but were ineffective against perennial weeds. Multiple applications of post-em. herbicide combinations of oxasulfuron + imazamox (92 %), clethodim + fomesafen (93 %) and oxasulfuron + imazamox + thifensulfuron methyl (94 %) at reduced rates, provided better weed control compared to a single application of oxasulfuron (91 %) and imazamox (89 %) at recommended rates. No significant differences were observed in yields between herbicide treatments, ranging from 3395 kg to 3496 kg /ha, on average...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of metals}} in the {{behaviour}} of {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) is not well documented. Therefore, we investigated the influence of metals (Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd) on the dynamic of SOM in contaminated soils where maize (C 4 plant) replaced C 3 cultures. Three <b>pseudogley</b> brown leached soil profiles under maize with a decreasing gradient in metals concentrations were sampled. On size fractions, stable carbon isotopic ratio (d 13 C), metals, organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations were measured in function of depth. The determined sequence {{for the amount of}} C 4 organic matter in the bulk fractions: M 3 (0. 9) > M 2 (0. 4) > M 1 (0. 3) is in agreement with a significant influence of metals on the SOM turnover.

Until now it has been known only from Alsace in France. The community from Istria differs from that of France by the presence of some Illyrian, or submediterranean species (Ostrya carpinifolia, Carpinus orientalis, Sesleria autumnalis, Helleborus istriacus) and it is designated as subassociation ostryetosum.

40|$|Ten corn hybrids {{were grown}} on two soil types of Drava Valley in Slatina area (alluvial soil and <b>pseudogley)</b> during two growing seasons (1998 and 1999). The ear-leaf at the {{beginning}} of silking stage was taken for chemical analysis. Micronutrient concentrations in corn leave samples were measured by ICP-AES after their microwave digestion using concentrated HNO 3 +H 2 O 2. Mobile fraction of these elements in soils was also determined by ICP-AES after their extraction by ammonium acetate-EDTA. In both year of the testing, corn yields on acid soil were about 25 % lower in comparison with alluvial soil. Mean concentrations of tested elements in corn leaves found in our investigations (mg kg- 1) were 30. 4 (Zn), 129. 4 (Mn) and 190. 0 (Fe), respectively. In general, significant influences of growing season, soil type and genotype on Zn, Mn and Fe status in corn were found. For example, {{in the first year of}} testing higher Zn and Mn were found, as well as lower Fe concentrations in comparison with the second year. Corn growing on alluvial soil occurred due to lower Zn and Mn as well as higher Fe concentrations in plants compared to growing on <b>pseudogley.</b> However, these findings are not in coincidence with status of mobile fractions of Zn and Mn in the experimental plots. We presume that pH value near to neutral on alluvial soil could be responsible factor because low availability of Zn and Mn for plants occured under these conditions. An important role of heredity factors on Zn, Mn and Fe status in corn was found in our study because differences among the hybrids (mean values for two growing seasons and two soil types) under identical environmental conditions were in ranges (mg kg- 1) from 26. 8 to 36. 0 (Zn), from 98. 6 to 150. 4 (Mn) and from 168. 2 to 222. 4 (Fe), respectively. It is very indicative that the first-ranged hybrid concerning grain yield (OsSK 458 exp: 12. 34 t ha- 1) is in the group characterizing low concentrations of Zn, Mn and Fe in leaves...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pseudogley</b> is a {{soil type}} that is under natural {{conditions}} characterized by unfavorable properties, the most pronounced being insufficient amounts of basic plant nutrients. Using different amelioration measures, numerous researchers {{have tried to}} overcome the problems resulting from soil acidity (increased aluminum and manganese contents, deficiency of alkaline cations in the adsorption complex and reduced available phosphorus content). Calcification {{was the most common}} measure almost always producing the best results of all the measures. In order to determine the effect of some neutralization acidity materials derived from natural sources (bentonite zeolite, lifos, CaO and MgO) on the change in the available phosphorus and potassium contents, a trial was set up on extremely acid soil to determine the manner of change in the nutrients concentrations in maize leaf and grain. The results obtained show that all ameliorative measures used affected the soil phosphorus and potassium contents increase, depending on the reduction of acidity and the mobile aluminum content, resulting also in a better uptake of the nutrients from the soil...|$|E
