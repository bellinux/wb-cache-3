40|$|Gender-focused human {{resource}} <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> signal an organization’s perspective on gender diversity. The signal produces perceptions {{that the organization}} values gender diversity leading to a gender-diverse workforce. In turn, a gender-diverse workforce provides a firm with a competitive advantage which should result in higher performance. This paper tests the mediating effects of gender diversity (at non-management and management levels) {{in the relationship between}} gender-focused <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> performance. The findings indicate that non-management gender diversity partially mediates the relationship between gender-focused <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> productivity, and management gender diversity partially mediates the relationship between gender-focused <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> perceived market performance. The results have several theoretical, research and practical implications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} key {{cross-cultural}} issues that transnational corporations (TNCs) face when formulating and implementing Human Resource (HR) <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> in their Chinese affiliates. The {{aim of this}} study is two-fold. The first is to investigate how employees perceive HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> that have been transferred from parent enterprises of TNCs, and the second is to explore the extent to which Chinese cultural values influence these HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices.</b> These aims are addressed through an exploratory research design using in-depth qualitative interviews with seventy-six participants across twenty-one Western TNCs and two Chinese state-owned enterprises in China. By presenting the differences between the HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> with Western TNCs and Chinese companies, the distinctive Chinese cultural values can be interpreted against a more holistic background. This study contributes to international human resource management (IHRM) literature by empirically investigating the perceptions and views of both managerial and non-managerial employees on HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> within the participating companies. This study explores the contemporary Chinese cultural values and examines how these cultural values exert influence on the HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices.</b> The findings of this study demonstrate a variation between global HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> of TNCs <b>and</b> their implementation at the local level. Moreover, the researcher finds that there are three national cultural values with Chinese characteristics which can affect HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> within TNCs in China; these are: guan-xi, valuing seniority, and the importance of the „human factor‟. It is indicated that Chinese cultural values are far more sophisticated than the ones conceptualised in previous literature, as these three cultural values appear to be interlinked and be embedded within the Chinese culture of collectivism. More importantly, the study shows that these deeply embedded cultural values can not be easily „ironed-out‟ by organisational culture <b>and</b> global HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> of TNCs. Therefore, it is argued that TNCs need to acknowledge cross-cultural differences and consider these Chinese cultural values when implementing their global HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> in China. Organisational and managerial commitment to such an approach would require conscious steps to be taken towards adopting a closely monitored HR implementation process and more inclusive HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices,</b> rather than expecting Chinese employees to accept and adopt the global HR <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> which may be against their cultural values and norms...|$|R

Critics of the US effort charged {{that it was}} deliberately targeting civilians, but while several instances of collateral damage did occur, US <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> was concentrated on strategic military targets not the elimination of civilians. The Nixon regime forbid the bombing of dams for example, along with POW camps, hospitals and religious shrines. Precision munitions aided this mandate. For example, US F-4 aircraft destroyed power generators at the Lang Chi Hydroelectric Plant during Linebacker I, but left its dam 50 feet away untouched to minimize civilian collateral damage.|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to {{identify}} <b>and</b> examine the <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> of Pennsylvania School Boards, and identify what relationship these might have to patterns of district-level student performance. This study utilized a sequential mixed-methods approach in collecting data. First, quantitative data were secured using surveys sent to a large group of superintendents from similar-sized school districts across Pennsylvania. Then, for the qualitative aspect, a select few superintendents were interviewed in order to more closely analyze the <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> of school boards that were identified from the survey. The two research questions developed to guide the study were 1) What <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> does a school board engage in that influences student achievement? 2) How do those <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> of school boards compare in lower- and higher-achieving school districts?Even though school boards do not directly instruct students, their actions can have a profound effect on the quality of education they receive. Indicative of the study, school boards want their students to be academically successful; however, not all of the <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> they partake are beneficial in reaching that goal. The survey and interview data from the study indicates there are both similarities and significant differences between boards from lower- and higher-achieving districts in regards to the <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> they participate in, which ultimately influences student achievement. The findings from this study can help both school boards and superintendents utilize the most successful <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> to enhance board governance as well as provide the best opportunity to allow their students to be academically successful...|$|R
