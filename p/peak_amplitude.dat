25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned an EPR spectra is usually directly measured {{as the first}} derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field {{is applied to the}} external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100kHz. By detecting the peak to <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of {{the cosmic microwave background}} anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping (also called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the photon–baryon plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations, which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude.</b>|$|E

At moderate moisture loss, fresh, never-dried sapwood showed higher radial dimensional changes compared to re-wetted sapwood.

2500|$|Compression {{is often}} used to make music sound louder without {{increasing}} its <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude.</b> [...] By compressing the peak (or loudest) signals, it becomes possible to increase the overall gain (or volume) of a signal without exceeding the dynamic limits of a reproduction device or medium. The net effect, when compression is applied along with a gain boost, is that relatively quiet sounds become louder, while louder sounds remain unchanged.|$|E

Engineers can apply an increasingly high ratio of compression to a recording until it more frequently peaks at the maximum amplitude. In extreme cases, efforts to increase loudness can result in clipping and other audible distortion. Modern recordings that use extreme dynamic range compression and other measures to increase loudness therefore can sacrifice sound quality to loudness. The competitive escalation of loudness has led music fans and members of the musical press to refer to the affected albums as [...] "victims of the loudness war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{the most}} widely used {{experimental}} means of inducing LTP has been to deliver a tetanic stimulation to the presynaptic axon of a synapse or group of synapses. [...] The frequency of this tetanus is typically 100Hz, and the duration typically 1 s. [...] A single AMPAR-mediated EPSP has a rise time-to-peak of approximately 2–5 ms and a duration of approximately 30 ms. [...] If a synapse is being stimulated at 100Hz, the presynaptic neuron will be attempting to release glutamate once every 10 ms. [...] An EPSP occurring only 10 ms after a previous EPSP will arrive at a time when that previous EPSP is at its <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude.</b> [...] Thus, during a 100Hz stimulus train, each EPSP will add to the membrane depolarization caused by the previous EPSPs.

The full Navier-Stokes equations are solved in a two-dimensional box geometry. The BM motion is modeled by independent oscillators using an immersed boundary technique.

A comparison of the <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of the BM motion is presented and their dependence on the frequency and on the model geometry (stapes position and cochlear channel height) is investigated. It is found that the <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> for the RSM are lower and decrease as frequency decreases whereas those for the PSM increase as frequency decreases. This scaling behavior {{can be explained by}} the different mechanisms that excite the membrane oscillation.

2500|$|An evoked {{potential}} is the electrical {{response of the}} brain to a sensory stimulus. Regan constructed an analogue Fourier series analyzer to record harmonics of the {{evoked potential}} to flickering (sinusoidally modulated) light. Rather than integrating the sine and cosine products, Regan fed the signals to a two-pen recorder via lowpass filters. [...] This allowed him {{to demonstrate that the}} brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics (frequency components) of the response were approximately constant over time. By analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase. [...] Although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms, it is more helpful to define the SSEP in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform, because different frequency components can have quite different properties. [...] For example, the properties of the high-frequency flicker SSEP (whose <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> is near 40–50Hz) correspond to the properties of the subsequently discovered magnocellular neurons in the retina of the macaque monkey, while the properties of the medium-frequency flicker SSEP ( [...] whose amplitude peak is near 15–20Hz) correspond to the properties of parvocellular neurons. Since a SSEP can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient evoked potential.|$|E
2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the p-n junction diode (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total V over total I varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an AC signal having <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). [...] For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.|$|E

Most predictive models {{show that this}} dynamic topography has <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of about ± 2 km, dominated by wavelengths of 10 $^ 4 $ km. Here, we test these models against our comprehensive observational database of 2, 120 spot measurements of dynamic topography that were determined by analysing oceanic seismic surveys. These accurate measurements have typical <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of ± 1 km and wavelengths of approximately 10 $^ 3 $ km, and are combined with limited continental constraints to generate a global spherical harmonic model, the robustness {{of which has been}} carefully tested and benchmarked.

At longer wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 4 $ km), observed dynamic topography has <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of about ± 500 m. At shorter wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 3 $ km), significant dynamic topography is still observed. We show that these discrepancies can be explained if short-wavelength dynamic topography is generated by temperature-driven density anomalies within a sub-plate asthenospheric channel. Stratigraphic observations from adjacent continental margins show that these dynamic topographic signals evolve quickly with time. More rapid temporal and spatial changes in vertical displacement of the Earth's surface have direct consequences for fields as diverse as mantle flow, oceanic circulation and long-term climate change.
