5|$|In 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress Lída Baarová and by {{the winter}} of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long {{conversation}} with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938. Unwilling to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scandal involving {{one of his top}} ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship. Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October. Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with Kurt Ludecke in 1933 and Karl Hanke in 1938.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Radek Zelenka is {{a careful}} and precise {{scientist}} {{of the original}} Atlantis Expedition who often supplements the scientific decisions of the [...] "equally brainy" [...] Dr. Rodney McKay, {{with whom he has}} a friendly rivalry. He frequently appears in the control room with McKay and the leader of the Atlantis expedition for expository scenes to lay out an episode's premise to the audience, and is [...] "a key player in helping the Atlantis team stay {{one step ahead of the}} bad guys as well as solving some of its most perplexing scientific conundrums". GateWorld's David Read felt that while Zelenka may [...] "play second fiddle to Rodney", he is also [...] "the only one who even has the potential to put McKay down." [...] Actor David Nykl explained that Zelenka has [...] "reasonably well honed social skills" [...] and [...] "can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of stress [...] and a lot of pressure, particularly from McKay and the situations that he can get into", but he may be too focused and determined to get one thing done.|$|E

500|$|Willette Kershaw, an American {{actress who}} was staging banned plays in Paris, {{proposed}} a dramatisation of The Well of Loneliness. Hall accepted a £100 advance, {{but when she}} and Troubridge saw Kershaw act, they found her too feminine {{for the role of}} Stephen. Hall tried to void the contract on a technicality, but Kershaw refused to change her plans. The play opened on 2 September 1930. No playwright was credited, implying that Hall had written the adaptation herself; it was actually written by one of Kershaw's ex-husbands, who reworked the story to make it more upbeat. According to Janet Flanner, who reported on the opening night for The New Yorker, Kershaw [...] "made up in costume what she lacked in psychology", with designer boots, breeches and riding crop. Then she changed into a white dress for a final speech in which she [...] "begged humanity, 'already used to earthquakes and murderers', to try to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minor calamity like the play's and the book's Lesbian protagonist, Stephen Gordon". Hall threatened a lawsuit to stop the production, but the issue soon became moot, since the play closed after only a few nights. The public skirmish between Hall and Kershaw increased sales of the novel.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a degree}} of {{speculation}} in the press that Dunstan would call for a new election because of the adverse outcome. However, Dunstan realised the futility of such a move and instead sought to humiliate the LCL into bringing an end to malapportionment. Although Stott's decision to support the LCL ended any realistic chance of Dunstan remaining premier, Dunstan did not immediately resign his commission, intending to force Hall and the LCL to demonstrate that they had support {{on the floor of}} the Assembly when it reconvened. [...] He used the six weeks before the start of the new legislature to draw attention to malapportionment. Protests were held on 15 March in Light Square. There, Dunstan spoke to a crowd of more than 10,000: [...] "We need to show that the people of SA feel that at last the watershed has been reached in this, and that they will not continue to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> system which is as undemocratic as the present one in SA." [...] On 16 April, the first day of the new House's sitting, Dunstan lost a confidence vote. [...] With it now clear that the LCL had control of the House, Dunstan tendered his resignation to Governor Edric Bastyan. Hall was then sworn in as premier. [...] However, the six weeks of protesting had brought nationwide criticism of the unfairness of the electoral system and put more pressure on the LCL to relent to reforms; it has been seen as one of the most important political events of its time.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, Time Out {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "Zodiac isn't {{a puzzle}} film in quite that way; instead its subject is the compulsion to solve puzzles, and its coup is the creeping recognition, quite {{contrary to the}} flow of crime cinema, of how fruitless that compulsion can be." [...] Peter Bradshaw in his review for The Guardian commended the film for its [...] "sheer cinematic virility," [...] and gave it four stars out of five. In his review for Empire magazine, Kim Newman gave the film {{four out of five}} stars and wrote, [...] "You'll need patience with the film's approach, which follows its main characters by poring over details, and be prepared to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> couple of rote family arguments and weary cop conversations, but this gripping character study becomes more agonisingly suspenseful as it gets closer to an answer that can't be confirmed." [...] Graham Fuller in Sight & Sound magazine wrote, [...] "the tone is pleasingly flat and mundane, evoking the demoralising grind of police work in a pre-feminist, pre-technological era. As such, Zodiac is considerably more adult than both Seven, which salivates over the macabre cat-and-mouse game it plays with the audience, and the macho brinkmanship of Fight Club." [...] Not all British critics liked the film. David Thompson in The Guardian felt that in relation to the rest of Fincher's career, Zodiac was [...] "the worst yet, a terrible disappointment in which an ingenious and deserving all-American serial killer nearly gets lost in the meandering treatment of cops and journalists obsessed with the case." ...|$|E

50|$|However, this {{decision}} was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed {{at the time as}} to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.|$|R
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E

The police said: [...] "We're responsible for maintaining the law, and you can't take the law into your own hands even when it concerns a terrorist who murdered innocent people, even though he made a heinous terrorist act". Two suspects were subsequently released. There was general support for their arrest and even left-wing activist Yossi Beilin said: [...] "Israel can't <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lynch made on a handcuffed person even if his actions are heinous and unforgivable. It's a combined interest of both Jews and Arabs that Israel won't close its eyes to such behaviour". The Arab Knesset members however demanded their release and called their arrest a crime.|$|E
