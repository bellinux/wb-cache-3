In pouring rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets. Forbes felt so humiliated {{by the events}} that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff. In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure {{the survival of the}} haggard men. He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one <b>point</b> <b>set</b> up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition.|$|E

40|$|Matsumoto, Saito, and Matoba {{recently}} {{proposed the}} Walsh {{figure of merit}} (WAFOM), which is a computable criterion for quasi-Monte Carlo <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> using digital nets. Several algorithms have been proposed for finding low-WAFOM <b>point</b> <b>sets.</b> In the existing algorithms, the number of points is fixed in advance, but extensible <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> are preferred in some applications. In this paper, we propose a random search algorithm for extensible low-WAFOM <b>point</b> <b>sets.</b> For this, we introduce a method that uses lookup tables to compute WAFOM faster. Numerical results show that our extensible low-WAFOM <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> are comparable with Niederreiter [...] Xing sequences for some low-dimensional and smooth test functions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{registration}} of multi-view <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> {{is often used}} in surface reconstruction for complex parts, and many researchers are striving to improve its accuracy and efficiency. A popular algorithm for {{registration of}} 3 D <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> is the Iterative Closest Point (ICP). With the increase of overlapping ratios, the convergence accuracy and speed of ICP algorithm improves. In most cases of 3 D scanning systems, the overlapping regions of multi-view <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> often locate at the boundaries. Based on this characteristic, a new method for registration of multi-view <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> with low overlapping ratios is proposed. Firstly, two kinds of sampling strategies are introduced, and {{a great number of}} point pairs are constructed. Through surface classification, curvature and neighborhood curvature matching of point pairs, the overlapping regions are selected. Then a Levenberg-Marquardt ICP (LM-ICP) method is used to search optimal registration parameters with the points in the overlapping regions. Finally, experiments for registration of multi-view <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> are performed, and results show that the method can get good registration accuracy for <b>point</b> <b>sets</b> with low overlapping ratios...|$|R
