2500|$|Radomski was an [...] "Old Fighter" [...] of the Nazi Party, {{and one of}} {{the early}} companions of the feared {{security}} chief Reinhard Heydrich in Hamburg. However, he was considered as brutal even by his fellow SS officers. His <b>personal</b> <b>file</b> called him [...] "primitive", and as commander of the Syrets concentration camp near Kiev he led a terror regime, ordering severe punishments for the smallest infractions, and often personally shooting or whipping the inmates, a habit he carried over at Haidari.|$|E
2500|$|Burkard Freiherr von Müllenheim-Rechberg was {{monitoring}} the gunnery intercom, and {{reports on the}} last minutes of Schneider's life. Schneider reported the heavy and middle guns ready for combat, and gave the order to open fire. The first salvo was fired by Rodney at 08:47 followed by King George V at 08:48. Schneider fired a partial salvo at Rodney since the Bismarck rear turrets could not fire at the appropriate angle. Schneider's aim was good, and he reported the first three salvos as short, on target and over. Schneider continued firing at Rodney. King George V and a little later Rodney turned to pass Bismarcks port side, a maneuver which Bismarck couldn't counter due to the damaged rudders. Bismarck started oscillating around her center axis which threw Schneider's aim off and necessitated continuous lateral displacement corrections of the guns. Bismarck started receiving heavy hits. The main gun director was destroyed, then turrets Anton and Bruno malfunctioned. Schneider was killed at 09:02 when an 8-inch shell from [...] hit his combat position in the main gun director. Schneider was posthumously promoted to Senior Commander (...) with an effective date of 1 May 1941. However this promotion is not on his <b>personal</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
2500|$|From Aylesbury {{she went}} on to Beaulieu, where the {{security}} training was capped with a practice mission – in the case of wireless operators, to find a place in a strange city from which they could transmit back to their instructors without being detected by an agent unknown to them who would be shadowing them. The ultimate exercise was the mock Gestapo interrogation, intended to give agents a taste of what might be in store for them if they were captured and some practice in maintaining their cover story. Noor’s escaping officer found her interrogation [...] "almost unbearable" [...] and reported that [...] "she seemed terrified… so overwhelmed she nearly lost her voice", and that afterwards [...] "she was trembling and quite blanched." [...] Her finishing report, which the official historian of F Section found in her <b>personal</b> <b>file</b> long after the war, read: [...] "Not overburdened with brains but has worked hard and shown keenness, apart from some dislike of the security side of the course. She has an unstable and temperamental personality and it is very doubtful whether she is really suited to work in the field." [...] Next to this comment Maurice Buckmaster, the head of F Section, had written in the margin [...] "Nonsense." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>File</b> is the 92nd album by {{the late}} American music icon Johnny Cash. The two CD set was {{released}} on May 23, 2006 on the Legacy label. <b>Personal</b> <b>File</b> contains 49 unreleased tracks on 2 CDs recorded between 1973 and 1982. Given that all tracks on the album were previously unreleased <b>Personal</b> <b>File</b> is considered both a posthumous album and a compilation.

The album was compiled and produced by Gregg Geller with liner notes by Greil Marcus. On most of the tracks, Cash performs alone, accompanying himself on guitar, and on many tracks Cash prefaces the song with remarks about its history {{and what it means}} to him.|$|E
