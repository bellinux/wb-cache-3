2500|$|Very {{little is}} known of Kunimasa's {{personal}} details, including his birth and death dates. Art historians tend to date his activity to the early 1830s through the early 1850s. An 1835 'Who's who' type catalogue from the Naniwa area of Osaka describes him as [...] "a master" [...] of ukiyo-e, indicating that he was already a well-established artist by the early 1830s. Other manuscripts from the mid 1840s list him as living in the Senba [...] district of Osaka. In 1899, a brief biography by Meiji era historian Sekine Shisei (1868–1912) was included in a compendium of biographies. According to Sekine, Kunimasu was a moneyed property owner who studied <b>print</b> <b>design</b> under Utagawa Kunisada in Edo before himself mentoring several pupils and opening his own <b>print</b> <b>design</b> school. Others {{have suggested that the}} artist was born into wealth and owned a shipbuilding company. What is certain is that he enjoyed considerable financial freedom and used it to promote ukiyo-e and its producers within Osaka.|$|E
