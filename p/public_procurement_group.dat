The data on the participation of small business in the <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> are <b>grouped</b> by various characteristics depending on the analysis purpose. The groups of the data have been analyzed on 83 entities of the Russian Federation. It has allowed making a full-scale estimation of the efficiency of procurements from the economics point of view. To estimate the influence of procurements on the development of small business entities, three hypotheses have been put forward: an increase in a number of customers placing orders for the small business enterprises, and a decrease in a share of the customers who are not meeting the requirements of the law about the threshold of 15...|$|R

50|$|In Bulgaria, {{there are}} {{significant}} links between media owners and other actors operating in the economic landscape. According to expert Nelly Ognyanova, there are unregulated links between media, money and power. This fact became publicly known following a joint access to information request submitted by 11 biggest newspapers in 2010, which revealed that a media group owning newspapers, internet outlets and a TV station borrowed {{large amounts of money}} from a big bank, the Corporate Trade Bank. Also, the information disclosed showed that the same bank hosted a considerable amount of budget money of several ministers as well as bank accounts of relevant state-owned companies operating in the field of energy, public transport, defence and information service. The owner of such media group, Delyan Peevsky, also runs businesses in other sectors, such as construction, tobacco and newspapers distribution. Moreover, his businesses are allegedly involved in big <b>public</b> <b>procurements.</b> The <b>group</b> is also connected with the political party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) which has been influential for many years. Mr. Peevsky is the son of Irena Krasteva, the owner of many of the print media outlets within the New Media Group. Bulgarian press revealed the existence of connections between the New Media Group and political parties and other businesses. This is not the only case of political influence over the media in Bulgaria.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{the making of the}} Danish <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law, and treats the {{question}} of why a specific national law was created as an alternative to issuing a national decree of the European Union’s <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directive. The study concludes that first of all the arrival of the EU <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directive was greeted by <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> tenders as well as business interest organisations as a welcomed opportunity to revise <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> rules and to end the poor ambience between interest actors. They perceived the rules as inflexible and hostile towards innovation. Especially the public procurers and the businesses were fed up with situation were complaints imposed high transactions costs. As the above mentioned actors did not find the new <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directive to offer sufficient change, actions were taken especially by KL in order to establish a unique Danish <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law with clearer and less rigid rules. The result has been a process in which many compromises have been made, but where the <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> committee nonetheless has managed to create adjustments in regards to the <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directives and its shortcomings. Thus, based on the empirical findings the study concludes that somewhat fragile political compromise was created to cope with the poor procurement culture. The interest actors within the <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> arena find that the making of the Danish <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law has indeed led to the establishment of a more flexible and less bureaucratic and rigid culture within <b>public</b> <b>procurement.</b> Still, it is uncertain whether or not this compromise will last in the long run...|$|R
