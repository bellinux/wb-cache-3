25|$|The French automaker Renault began {{investing}} in AMC in 1979. However, by 1987, the automobile markets had changed and even Renault itself was experiencing financial troubles.

Analysts, including John Glass of Morgan Stanley and David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird & Co., part {{of the reasons for}} the company's slowed performance is its continue reliance on the super fan.

40|$|The <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> {{industry}} has grown tremendously {{in the past}} 20 - 30 years, and several studies {{have been made to}} examine the potential superior returns by <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> owned <b>companies.</b> However, there has been limited research on the performance of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> owned <b>companies</b> during extraordinary conditions, such as financial crises. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the performance of publicly traded companies to the performance of <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> owned <b>companies</b> during a four year period after the financial crisis, and examine what factors had impacted the companies’ profitability the most. It was hypothesized that increased growth, a higher debt level and decreased working capital would have had a positive impact on profitability. The results show that increased growth and higher debt levels had a positive significant impact on profitability for <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> owned <b>companies,</b> while having had a negative impact on profitability for publicly traded companies. Reduced working capital did not have a statistically significant impact on profitability. The interpretation of these results is that <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> owned <b>companies</b> were better at optimizing their capital structure, even under extraordinary conditions. Furthermore, the interpretation of the negative effect of increased growth on profitability for publicly traded companies is that they did not perform as well after the financial crisis as the <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> owned <b>companies.</b> The conclusion from this study is therefore that <b>private</b> <b>equity</b> owned <b>companies</b> did recover better than publicly traded companies, and that growth and debt level affected the companies’ profitability the most...|$|R
