In a typical CFS trial, the participants are shown two contrasting images, one to each eye {{and the image of}} greater signal strength will flash at a constant rate (7-10 Hertz). The target image will be shown to the other eye. Unlike Binocular Switch Suppression (BSS), the target image will remain stationary at the same spot on the screen and will not switch nor flash during the <b>presentation</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since {{the main}} {{objective}} of this implicit test is to assess priming effects, the WFC assessment is typically administered after a <b>presentation</b> <b>period</b> of the to-be-tested words. Subjects are typically presented with the items as read directly from a list by a test administrator or by the participants themselves. To ensure that implicit memory is being measured rather than explicit memory, participants can be given irrelevant tasks in this stage to distract them from attempting to memorize the to-be-tested words (E.g. Sort various squares by size). Participants in research studies often try to determine the experimenters' goals and respond in ways which would support their hypotheses, which makes distracter tasks crucial to the validity of studies. Another step to ensure participants are not relying on explicit memory is to place a time delay between the learning phase and the test phase. This interferes with primacy and recency effects because it interrupts the active rehearsal of the listed items.After being exposed to the items (learning phase), the participants enter the test phase. They are presented with fragments of the words that were shown in the learning phase, in addition to new words that serve as a baseline of performance (i.e. performance on non-primed words). Participants are then instructed to complete the fragments with the first word that comes to mind. Priming effects are evident when performance on the originally presented words exceeds performance on the new words. The types of words that are presented are typically ones that are used infrequently in everyday language. Words that are lower in frequency {{are more likely to}} be identified correctly in the WFC test because they are more distinct, which makes them easier to recall. Presented words also tend to be longer (7 or 8 characters) than words presented in other implicit memory tests and the fragments are presented in such a way that only 1 or 2 possibilities for completion exist.|$|E

Participants (nonexperts) were first presented with information about the life and attitudes of a fictitious artist. Subsequently, they were cued trial-wise to make an aesthetic judgment regarding an image depicting a piece of abstract art either from their own perspective or from the imagined perspective of the fictitious artist (i. e., theory of mind condition). Positive self-referential judgments were made more quickly and negative self-referential judgments were made more slowly than the corresponding judgments from the imagined perspective. Event-related potential analyses revealed {{significant differences between the}} two tasks both within the preparation period (i. e., during the cue-stimulus interval) and within the stimulus <b>presentation</b> <b>period.</b> For the theory of mind condition we observed a relative centro-parietal negativity during the preparation period (700 – 330 ms preceding picture onset) and a relative centro-parietal positivity during the stimulus <b>presentation</b> <b>period</b> (700 – 1100 ms after stimulus onset).

The current study examined hippocampal functional connectivity with prefrontal and striatal regions during a task that required participants to {{make decisions based on}} the contextual retrieval of overlapping sequential representations. Participants learned four sequences comprised of six faces each. An overlapping condition was created by having two sequences with two identical faces as the middle images. A non-overlapping condition contained two sequences that did not share any faces between them.

At the critical choice point of the overlapping condition, the left hippocampus showed stronger functional connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex.

Neuroimaging studies showed that numerous brain regions participate in this complex function. To study spatiotemporal aspects of the neural representation of facial emotion recognition we recorded neuromagnetic activity in 12 healthy individuals by means of a whole head magnetoencephalography system. Source reconstructions revealed that several cortical and subcortical brain regions produced strong neural activity in response to emotional faces at latencies between 100 and 360 ms that were much stronger than those to neutral as well as to blurred faces. Orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala showed affect-related activity at short latencies already within 180 ms after stimulus onset.

40|$|The {{functional}} role of human premotor and primary motor cortex during mental rotation {{has been studied}} using functional MRI at 3 T. Fourteen young, male subjects performed a mental rotation task {{in which they had}} to decide whether two visually presented cubes could be identical. Exploratory Fuzzy Cluster Analysis was applied to identify brain regions with stimulus-related time courses. This revealed one dominant cluster which included the parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that showed signal enhancement during the whole stimulus <b>presentation</b> <b>period,</b> reflecting cognitive processing. A second cluster, encompassing the contralateral primary motor cortex, showed activation exclusively after the button press response. This clear separation was possible in 3 subjects only, however. Based on these exploratory results, the hypothesis that primary motor cortex activity was related to button pressing only was tested using a parametric approach via a random-effects group analysis over all 14 subjects in SPM 99. The results confirmed that the stimulus response via button pressing causes activation in the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area while parietal cortex and mesial regions rostral to the supplementary motor area are recruited for the actual mental rotation process...|$|E

MethodsAfter board approval, the charts of all pediatric patients diagnosed with orbital complications secondary to sinusitis, seen at the Pediatric and at the ENT clinics of the HPEV, between 1985 and 2004, were evaluated. The data was analyzed considering gender, age, clinical <b>presentation,</b> <b>period</b> of hospitalization, image study, and treatment. Resultsfrom 1985 to 2004, 25 patients were diagnosed with OC secondary to sinusitis, presenting an incidence of 6 %.

40|$|AbstractPeriodic {{stereoscopic}} stimuli offer multiple viable {{solutions to}} the stereo correspondence problem. When viewing such stimuli for prolonged periods of time, observers continually switch their perceptual state between alternative correspondence solutions. We examine the temporal dynamics of this correspondence bi-stability. Participants were presented with an ambiguous stereogram comprised of regularly spaced dots. This stimulus was perceived as a fronto-parallel plane situated either behind or in front of fixation, depending on the achieved correspondence solution. The stimulus was presented continuously for one minute, with participants instructed to report {{the sign of the}} perceived depth at the sound of an auditory prompt presented, on average, every 2 s. Inter-ocular contrast and available disparities were varied so as to manipulate preferred correspondence. We find that participants are initially biased to perceive the stimulus as having an uncrossed disparity. Furthermore, we find that following an initial period of change, perceptual preference and perceptual stability (measured as the probability of an observer’s percept changing between consecutive responses) remain constant over the <b>presentation</b> <b>period.</b> Finally, we find that manipulations of matching preference affect both the transient preference for, and stability of, one percept over another.

40|$|International audienceWhen an obliquely moving {{sine wave}} grating is {{presented}} inside a square aperture, observers {{are faced with}} a conflict of local motion signals resulting from the "aperture problem". Motion signals along the grating contours on average have a diagonal direction (D) while those near the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) edges lie along these cardinal directions. We explored the temporal evolution of this perception, which shifts regularly between the cardinal directions H and V as the dominant neural population serving conscious direction perception changes over time. We use visual psychophysics with eye movement recordings to extract and characterise the temporal signatures of this phenomenon and our companion theoretical work (II) builds a mathematical description of these dynamics. As with other motion stimuli exhibiting the aperture problem, ocular following trajectories are shown to reflect perceived direction. We look at how stimulus input parameters relating to the motion signal strength influence the frequency of reported transitions (H-V or V-H) and estimate a minimum period between switches of about 5 s for slow moving stimuli (4 - 6 deg/sec) with relatively low contrast. We design a task to capture the passive ocular following patterns over this extended <b>presentation</b> <b>period</b> of the order of 20 s using frequent small amplitude saccades back to central fixation. The saccades avoid placing the fovea in close proximity of one of the edges and we find little evidence that they induce perceptual shifts. We describe ocular following patterns across observers, identifying alternative perceptual transition types which emerge in the companion theoretical treatment (II) and show varying extents of representation of D. The theoretical and experimental work converges to suggests an underlying dynamic adaptation of input strength dependent representations of the cardinal directions, H and V, which are mutually inhibitory and serve both eye movements and global direction perception...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} layer specificity of dynamical properties of ongoing neuronal activities in various cortical areas [1 - 3]. A common observation is that activities in the infra-granular layers exhibit pronounced slow oscillations (< 20 Hz). Among visual cortices, the layer specificity has been extensively studied for the primary visual cortex but remains largely unknown for other areas. To elucidate the laminar organization of ongoing neural activities and its functional relevance for visual object recognition, we examined spatio-temporal patterns of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the inferior temporal cortex of analgesized macaques using linear electrode arrays (32 probes spanning 1. 55 or 3. 1 mm across cortical layers). During the recordings the animals were presented with 128 visual objects (shapes, gratings, faces, fruits, etc.) on a gray background. Stimulus duration was 0. 5 s with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s. We found that during the ISIs the LFPs showed strong oscillatory fluctuations in the alpha-beta frequency band (10 – 20 Hz). These oscillations had the strongest power in the lowermost probes, supposedly located in infra-granular layers. These LFP oscillations were considerably suppressed during the stimulus <b>presentation</b> <b>period.</b> In the initial ~ 0. 3 s of stimulus presentation the LFPs showed a stimulus-evoked excitatory modulation that first occurred in deep layers and then propagated to the superficial layers (see Figure).

The observed suppression of ongoing oscillations during the stimulation period {{is consistent with the}} reported quenching of inter-trial variability by stimulus onset [4], which was argued as a mechanism to enhance reliability of stimulus processing.

40|$|We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to {{characterize}} the integrative neural mechanisms during viewing and subsequently copying nine geometrical shapes. Human subjects initially looked at a central fixation point ("rest" period), then looked at a geometrical shape ("visual" period) which they copied without visual feedback ("copying" period). BOLD signal was recorded from voxels in 28 cortical areas (14 from each hemisphere) using a 4 Tesla magnet. For each voxel, signal ratios of "Visual versus Rest" (VR), and "Copy versus Visual" (CV) were calculated and used to construct two sets of Euclidean distance dissimilarity matrices for the nine shapes, with separate matrices defined for each region of interest (ROI) across subjects. The relations of perceptual and motor aspects of the shapes to MDS dimensions and specific ROIs were assessed using stepwise multiple regressions. The optimal individually scaled (INDSCAL) solutions were 2 -dimensional. For the VR condition, MDS dimensions {{were significantly associated with}} the presence of crossing in a shape (Dimension 1), and with perimeter, height, cycles, peak segment speed, and horizontal symmetry (Dimension 2). ROIs most prominently associated with these dimensions essentially comprised the medial frontal lobe bilaterally, the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, and the left intraparietal sulcus (Dimension 1), and visual areas, including the calcarine sulcus and cuneus bilaterally (Dimension 2). These results document the expected involvement of visual areas and support the hypothesis advanced on the basis of previous findings (Lewis et al. 2003 a) that a motor rehearsal of the upcoming shape copying is occurring during this visual <b>presentation</b> <b>period.</b> For the CV condition, practically one motor feature (number of segments drawn) dominated both dimensions, with a secondary engagement of horizontal symmetry in Dimension 1. The right postcentral gyrus, right intraparietal sulcus, right superior parietal lobule and right inferior parietal lobule contributed mostly to Dimension 1; the superior frontal gyrus bilaterally, right middle frontal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule contributed mostly to Dimension 2; and the left superior parietal lobule and left intraparietal sulcus contributed to both dimensions approximately equally. CV BOLD activation of ROIs contributing to Dimension 1 (or to both dimensions) was significantly associated with the number of shape segments drawn. Since the direction of movement differs in successively drawn shape segments, the number of segments (minus one) equals the number of changes in the direction of movement. We conclude that this fundamental spatial motor aspect of drawing geometrical shapes is the critical variable, independent of the particular shape drawn, that dominates cortical activation during copying...|$|E
40|$|The way {{a system}} reacts to {{increased}} task demands can reveal information about its functional mechanism. We therefore assessed the question how non human primates process information about visual stimuli by driving two rhesus monkeys to their cognitive limits in a visual memory task. The monkeys were first trained to successfully perform the visual memory task (> 80 correct responses). Then {{the number of}} stimuli shown to the monkey (load) was increased to up to 4. The stimulus <b>presentation</b> <b>period</b> (SP) was 900 milliseconds long. Thus, in the load 4 condition each single stimulus was only shown for less than 225 ms. After a three second delay period, a test stimulus was shown. The task of the monkey was then to decide via differential button press, whether the test stimulus matched any of the previously shown stimuli. Neuronal firing rates were recorded using up to 16 multi electrodes placed in the prefrontal cortex. For every trial in which the monkey responded correctly, the average multi unit rate during the SP was estimated. We then assessed the question whether the firing rates in the SP during the distinct load conditions were significantly different. To minimize the effect of non-stationarities present in the data, we paired the data so that the trials of one pair were maximally 2. 5 minutes apart. We tested against the null-hypothesis that the firing rates during the SP {{did not differ significantly}} among the load conditions using the nonparametric Friedman-test for paired data. For every recording site where we could reject the null-hypothesis (p< 0. 05), we investigated in which direction the rates of the different load conditions differed, correcting for multiple tests using the Tukey-Kramer-correction. A total of 12681 correct trials were recorded with a total of 160 recording positions (6 to 16 per session). In total, 23 positions showed significant effects from which 20 were consistent. The firing rate differences were called consistent if the difference compared to load 1 were stronger the higher the load. Out of these 20 consistent recording sites 14 showed a firing rate which monotonically increased with the load, 6 showed a monotonous decrease. This means that 12 of the recording sites in prefrontal cortex show a significant modulation of firing rates with respect to the load condition during a delayed match to sample task. However this modulation is not necessarily excitatory. Interestingly, it seems that the majority of sites showed a load-consistent modulation i. e. the higher the load, the stronger the modulation. This could be a possible mechanism to code the number of stimuli or their sequence...|$|E

The students have to pass two tests until the semester the first on the 6 th- 7 th week the second on the 13 th- 14 th week. Between the tests the students may to participate on the presentations. My personal experience shows the big part of the students until the <b>presentation</b> <b>period</b> do not have learned the teaching material week in week out just have visited the presentations or simple stayed at home. The situation is unfortunately same by other subject too at the university and the colleagues have same experience from other universities and colleges in Hungary. The learning habit of the undergraduate mechanical engineering students could be following and analysing if we can see the details of the downloading of the teaching materials. The Students may download the teaching material of basic Computer Science from an own developed web based system. The material is accessible in the system just after the presentation, on the same day the students have the opportunity to save read and learn it. They get username and password to log into this system, which logs the download saving usernames and the time of each file transfer. A huge mass of data makes possible a statistical audit and the analysing based on. The analysing of the data made possible to draw conclusions regarding the learning habits of undergraduate mechanical engineering students. I analysed the saved data of downloads {{in the last five years}} to see the changing of the learning habits of the students if is it recognisable. We can draw the inference on learning habits analyzing the distribution of downloads before the test. The prepared two chart show frequency of downloads depending on time. On the first chart we can see the frequency of downloads before the first test, on the next chart the frequency of downloads before the second test. We can see one-one peak on the charts it means most downloads took place the day before the first test and the second test. The overwhelming part of students wanted to learn the material only one day before the test. On the days of tests we can see a little bit lower number of downloads. The result of the analysing shows the students downloaded the teaching material on the day of test or the previous day. It means these students did not have enough time to read, understand and learn the teaching material before the test and these habits do not have changed in the last five years. The earlier analysing showed the situation is same in the first semester and the undergraduate mechanical engineering students did not recognise the advantage of the learning earlier before the test. I have found strong correlation between the days before the test and the number of downloads of teaching material. It needs a didactical method to motivate the students to download the teaching material earlier and read it to pass the tests in higher percentage because this learning habit has influence on the results of the successful exams too...|$|E
