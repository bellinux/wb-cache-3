30|$|Some authors [68 – 70] have {{suggested}} that opening wedge HTO with emicallotasis and external fixator is the treatment that should be chosen to correct the malalignment; however, we prefer to use this technique with a circular external fixator (Taylor Spatial Frame; Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN) only in deformities that need correction greater than 12.5 °. If an external fixator is applied, the osteotomy is performed distal to the tibial tubercle and does not change patellar height; instead, medial opening wedge HTO is performed proximal to the tibial tubercle, and if the gap is too large, <b>patella</b> infera (<b>baja)</b> may occur. This circular external fixator has a computer program that aims to achieve triplanar correction of the deformity and correct also the tibial slope in the sagittal plane [108]. An external fixator enables slow correction of the deformity, improving consolidation of even large osteotomy gaps. An external fixator {{could also be used}} for treatment of failed medial opening wedge HTO [109].|$|R

Pseudo <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> was defined using the modified Insall-Salvati and the Blackburne-Peel ratios. A proximalisation of the tibial tubercle was performed in 13 patients with pseudo <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> who were matched with a control group of 13 patients for gender, age, height, weight, body mass index, length of surgery and Blackburne-Peel ratio. Outcome was assessed two years post-operatively using the Knee Society Score (KSS). RESULTS: The increase in KSS was significantly higher in the osteotomy group compared with the control group. The outcome was statistically better in patients in whom proximalisation of > 1 cm had been achieved compared with those in whom the proximalisation was < 1 cm.

30|$|Though {{a number}} of series have been {{published}} documenting good results after UKA, {{there has been a}} paucity of literature on the role of UKA on the length of the patella tendon or the incidence of <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> after UKA [1 – 4, 18]. In spite of indications for this procedure in unicompartmental arthritis having been established, there has been some controversy regarding the status of the patellofemoral joint [1, 2, 4, 5]. A recent study [5] had concluded that patellar height had no consistent major effects on early clinical outcome after UKA, and hence the patellar height might not be considered as a strict separate patient-selection criterion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the patients for a change in patellar height by ISR and BPI after UKA and to see if there is a difference in clinical and radiological outcomes for these patients. Before the study we had assumed that at mid-term follow-up a progression in patellofemoral arthritis may lead to progressive impingement, anterior knee pain and adversely affect the outcome in patients who develop <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> post-operatively. However, our results showed a significant decrease in only the stair-climbing component of the functional aspect of KSS for patients with <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> assessed with ISR while this decrease was not significant in patients with <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> assessed with BPI, and hence we had to reject our previous hypothesis.|$|E
30|$|Unicompartmental knee {{arthroplasty}} (UKA) {{is used as}} a modality in {{the management}} of single compartment arthritis [1 – 4]. The evolution of patient selection, surgical technique and implant design over the past 30 years has refined the indications and improved the clinical outcome [1 – 5]. Occurrence of patella infera or baja after total knee arthroplasty has been well reported in the literature, wherein patellofemoral mechanics may be altered, resulting in a decreased post-operative range of motion, extensor lag, anterior knee pain, anterior polyethylene impingement and wear, and diminished outcomes [5 – 10]. <b>Patella</b> <b>baja</b> can occur in a relative fashion after a TKA because of elevation in joint line or can occur directly because of excessive scar formation, contracture and shortening of the patellar tendon, such as reported after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, high tibial osteotomy, fractures about the knee etc. [5 – 10]. In spite of the surge in literature of results after UKA, the status of patellar height has been infrequently discussed in the literature. Weale et al. [10] reported an infrequent occurrence of <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> after UKA, while Naal et al. [5] reported that though <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> occurred with UKA it had no consistent major effect on the clinical outcome at short-term follow-up.|$|E
30|$|Though {{a number}} of series with {{long-term}} results have been published, {{there is still a}} paucity of literature on the role of patellar height after unicompartment knee arthroplasty (UKA). The present study was conducted with a hypothesis that <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> may lead to a poor outcome at follow-up.|$|E
30|$|Patients with a {{decrease}} in patellar height as per ISR have {{a decrease}} in stair climbing score at mid-term follow-up while the overall KSS, and pain scores are not affected by a change in patellar height and neither is there a significant progress in patellofemoral osteoarthritis among patients with <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> compared to normal patella.|$|E
30|$|Though {{there was}} a {{decrease}} in overall function score at 5  years, there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between patients with <b>patella</b> <b>baja,</b> normal patella and patella alta with both BPI and ISR.

30|$|Thus {{the present}} study was {{conducted}} (1) to assess the patellar height in patients before and after UKA, (2) to see if the amount of pre-operative deformity has any influence on patellar shortening, and (3) to investigate if there is any association between patellar height and clinical outcome at mid-term follow-up.

30|$|Meneghini et al. [9] studied over 1, 000 {{patients}} with TKA {{and concluded that}} a decrease in patella tendon length occurs; stair and function scores after TKA are adversely affected compared with patients in whom the ISR is not decreased. Other studies have associated patella infera after TKA with decreased post-operative range of motion, extensor lag, anterior knee pain, anterior polyethylene impingement and wear, and diminished outcomes [5 – 9]. In contrast, after UKA no consistent major effects on early clinical outcome were seen and a weak negative correlation between lower pre-operative BP values and the post-operative knee extension, and a weak negative correlation between lower pre-operative IS values and post-operative knee scores were seen [5]. Our results did show a significant difference only in stair-climbing scores at final follow-up for {{patients with}} post-operative patellar baja. However, when the scores were compared between those patients who had pre-operative <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> according to both ISR and BPI, who became normal after surgery, and those who remained <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> after surgery, {{there was no significant}} difference between them.

Methods: A radiographic review of the lateral radiographs of 736 Middle-Eastern knees were performed. Patellar tendon length (TL) and the patellar length (TP) was digitally measured and the ratios of these measures was used to calculate the Insall-Salvati ratio. Results: The overall mean TL/PL ratio was 1. 20 ± 0. 17. The Insall-Salvati ratio was higher (p= 0. 0013) in males (1. 22 ± 0. 12) than in females (1. 18 ± 0. 17). According to our measurement, the recommended levels for defining abnormal patellar position should be 0. 86 for <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> and 1. 54 for patella alta.

30|$|<b>Patella</b> <b>baja</b> {{refers to}} an {{inferior}} position of the patella in the sagittal plane and can be determined with numerous radiographic measurements [13, 14, 19]. Most involve a ratio between a measure of patellar length and {{a measure of the}} distance between an aspect of the patella and a landmark on the tibia. The use of a ratio rather than an absolute length compensates for variations in patients’ height. We used both the ISR and BPI to measure the patellar height after UKA. The BPI takes the joint-line into consideration. In contrast, the ISR ignores the joint-line and relates more to the patellar-tendon length. Grelsamer [7] described a decrease in BPI values and non-decreased ISR values to indicate an elevation of the joint-line, defined as pseudo-patella baja. However, an elevation of the joint-line is hardly possible after UKA, since the contralateral compartment is not affected by the surgery [5]. It may nevertheless be that UKA created a “step” in the joint-line from the medial to the lateral compartment, and referring to the upper polyethylene border for the measurements, BP values might be decreased by such a step [5]. Finally, BPI values might have been decreased by a true decrease of the patellar height. The decrease in patellar height after TKR has been reported in more than 50 – 64  % [8, 9] of cases and <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> develops in 9 – 25  % of patients without lateral release, and all patients with patellar release [9, 10]. Weale et al. [10] reported that there was no significant change in patellar height after UKA at 8 months or 5  years after surgery, while Naal et al. [5] did observe a significant decrease in patellar height as per BPI and no significant decrease as per ISR at short-term follow-up. Our results at mid-term follow-up are also in agreement with these results of Naal et al. [5] which they observed at short-term follow-up. Also, in contrast to a study by Weale et al. [10] we observed an overall decrease in patellar tendon length and that this change was not progressive over the follow-up period. In contrast to TKA, fewer patients develop <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> after UKA and {{this may be due to}} the minimally invasive incision, avoiding patellar eversion and minimal trauma to Hoffas’ fat pad and extensor mechanism. Much of the literature concerning UKA has advocated relative under-correction of the alignment of the knee with the presumption that overcorrection increases the risk of failure by progression of arthritic change of the lateral compartment [20 – 22]. Scott et al. [23] reported that overcorrection of alignment increases the risk of degenerative change in the contralateral compartment. However, progression of arthritis in the lateral compartment could be simply caused by the natural progression of the underlying arthritic disease [24]. Barrett and Scott [25] reported that under-correction of alignment increases the wear of polyethylene implants and the recurrence of the deformity. Kennedy and White [16] reported that the best result can be obtained when the mechanical axis runs through the center of the knee joint or slightly medial from the center of knee joint, and we aimed for the same in our cases. The position of the implant did not affect the development of <b>patella</b> <b>baja.</b> This may be because limited exposure and careful soft tissue resection prevented damage to the patellar tendon. In spite of a small incision, it was observed that a large proportion of implants were placed in an acceptable position. Moreover, as UKA involves only the medial compartment, it does not effectively change the position of the joint line [17].|$|E
40|$|BackgroundHigh tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is {{a well-established}} treatment for unicompartmental gonarthrosis of the knee, but its durability and complications remain controversial. We previously introduced a novel dome-shaped HTO, {{and the long-term}} follow-up results using this technique are analyzed in this study. MethodsWe treated 25 varus knees in 22 patients with medial gonarthrosis, using a specially designed calibrated cutting jig along with rigid external fixation and early joint motion postoperatively. A total of 16 patients (19 knees) completed the study protocol and were followed up for 13 - 16 years (mean, 15 years). ResultsThe surgery attempted to obtain 8 ° valgus; the actual postoperative alignment averaged 12. 4 ° valgus, which decreased significantly to 7. 8 ° valgus after 5 years. The outcome as assessed by the Hospital for Special Surgery knee score was excellent or good in 18 knees at 5 years postoperatively, and in 13 knees at the final follow-up, showing a significant deterioration with time. Loss of correction with time was not correlated with the postoperative alignment achieved: at 5 years, loss greater than 2 ° was found in 12 knees, but their mean corrected angle (11. 8 ° valgus) was {{not significantly different from}} that of the others (13. 3 ° valgus). Nor was the loss of correction correlated with the knee scores. The mean amount of joint motion after surgery did not change significantly with time: 124 ° preoperatively and 114 ° at the final follow-up. The patellar position also did not change from preoperative values during postoperative follow-up: mean Insall-Salvati index was 0. 88 before and 0. 90 5 years after surgery, neither showing <b>patella</b> <b>baja.</b> ConclusionDome-shaped HTO is a durable time-buying procedure for patients with unicompartmental medial gonarthrosis, and can avoid subsequent development of <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> that may complicate further prosthetic arthroplasty...|$|E

30|$|Abnormal {{positioning}} of the patella is another pathology reported in patients with intraarticular adhesions (Noyes and Barber-Westin 2017). The {{results of the current}} study suggest that adhesions in the suprapatellar pouch may lead to proximal translation of the patella, most prominently at 0 degrees of flexion. A proximal position of the patella relative to the trochlear groove is known as patella alta (Insall and Salvati 1971). This condition predisposes the affected knee to patellofemoral dislocation due to decreased contact with the femur, especially at lower flexion angles (Fox et al. 2012). The current study also observed distal translation of the patella with anterior interval adhesions, which aligns well with the results of Ahmad et al.’s study (Ahmad et al. 1998). Distal {{positioning of}} the patella in the trochlear groove is known as <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> and is associated with anterior knee pain, extensor lag, and a reduction in range of motion (Fox et al. 2012; Flören et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the patellar height and degenerative changes of the knee by radiographic assessment after patellar tendon recon-struction for chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency. Methods: This series included 44 patients (44 knees) with an average age of 31 years and an average follow up of 58 months. The central one third of the patellar bone-tendon-bone was used to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament in all patients. Radiographic assessment of the patellar height was measured using the Insall-Salvati method, and the degenerative changes of the knee using the Ahlback classification.

30|$|As the HTO {{is often}} a stop-gap {{procedure}} before a knee arthroplasty, there is always concern when managing HTO non-unions as to what effect treatment {{will have on the}} outcome of a future arthroplasty. The long-term results of total knee replacement (TKR) in limbs that have had a previous proximal tibial osteotomy {{have been shown to be}} slightly inferior [18]. This is possibly related to malalignment, previous skin incisions, <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> and bone abnormalities, which could significantly reduce the bone available during the TKR. The IEF should have minimal impact on future TKR, as it is a percutaneous application; the bone stock is preserved as the pseudarthrosis is left in situ and the underlying deformity is corrected through angular distraction and a normal Insall–Salvati ratio for the patella position maintained. There is a theoretical concern that the thin proximal tibial fragment may lead to the intra-articular placement of wires, leading to an increased risk of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis [19]. This did not occur in any of the patients in this study. However, single episodes of superficial pin site infections were seen in four of the five knees in our series. All were treated successfully with 7 -day courses of flucloxacillin.|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} joint-line level is still debated. Epicondiles {{are a good}} {{anatomical}} reference in joint-line restoration as described by Griffin. In unaffected knees, the medial epicondile is 27.4  ±  2.9 and 29.7  ±  2.7  mm from the joint line in coronal and axial planes, respectively. Lateral epicondile is 24.3  ±  2.6 and 25.0  ±  2.6  mm from the joint line in coronal and axial planes, respectively [49]. Excessive joint-line elevation leads to a <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> and to loose collateral ligaments in flexion. Figgie et al. [19] state that an elevation up to 8  mm has no major consequences for the postoperative result. Unfortunately, in revision surgery, the epicondiles are not always clearly detectable; thus, {{the evaluation of the}} joint-line height may be difficult. Therefore, the distance from the inferior pole of the patella to the joint line has been proposed as a measure, and values greater than 1  cm are necessary to restore a proper height [19]. Component malpositioning in the frontal, sagittal, and coronal plane should be corrected to avoid stiffness recurrence. Frontal malalignments and rotational tibial and femoral errors should be corrected, as they affect both patellofemoral kinematics and soft-tissue balance. Postoperative results are unpredictable both in terms of articular recovery and clinical improvement.|$|E
40|$|Background: Little {{information}} is available regarding the results and complications of total knee arthroplasty in limbs affected by poliomyelitis with severe knee degeneration. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart and radiograph review of patients {{with a history of}} poliomyelitis involving a limb that subsequently underwent primary total knee arthroplasty between 1970 and 2000. Sixteen total knee arthroplasties were performed in limbs affected by poliomyelitis in fifteen patients. Eleven patients were followed for a minimum of two years, one (two knees) died before the minimum two-year follow-up could be completed, and three were followed for less than two years. No patient was lost to follow-up. Results: There were two periprosthetic fractures, one peroneal nerve palsy, one avulsion of the patellar tendon, and four cases of recurrent instability. These complications were related to the poor bone quality, valgus deformity, <b>patella</b> <b>baja,</b> poor musculature, and attenuated soft tissues commonly found in knees affected by poliomyelitis. Knee Society pain and knee scores were improved postoperatively for all nine knees with a two-year follow-up that had had at least antigravity quadriceps strength prior to surgery.

We describe a case of negative TPA associated with partial cranial and caudal ligament rupture treated with a center of rotation of angulation (CORA) based cranial tibial opening wedge osteotomy and tibial tuberosity transposition. A 13 kg, mixed breed dog was presented for right pelvic limb lameness. Radiographically a bilateral <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> and a malformed tibia tuberosity along with a bilateral TPA of - 8 degree were detected. Arthroscopically a partial rupture of the cranial and caudal {{cruciate ligament}}s were found. A cranial tibial opening wedge osteotomy of 23 degree and a fibular ostectomy were performed. The osteotomy was fixed with a 8 holes ALPS 9 (KYON, Switzerland) and a 3 -holes 2. 0 mm UniLock plate (Synthes, Switzerland). Then a proximal tibial tuberosity transposition of 10 mm was performed and fixed with a pin and tension band construct. The postoperative TPA was 15 degree. The radiographic controls at 6, 10 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after surgery revealed an unchanged position of the implants and progressive healing of the osteotomies. At the 6 and 12 months recheck evaluation the dog had no evidence of lameness or stifle pain and radiographs revealed complete healing of the osteotomy site and no implant failure. The diaphyseal CORA based osteotomy allowed accurate correction of a proximal tibial deformity associated with negative TPA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Static antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers {{have been}} used widely to treat chronically {{infected}} total knee arthroplasties with a high success result. However, difficulty in surgical exposure during revision has been encoun-tered. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical results of two-stage reimplantation of an infected total knee arthroplasty using a static antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer. Methods: Thirty-one patients (32 knees) with infected total knee arthroplasty had a two-stage reimplantation using a static antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer. Twelve (37. 5 %) of 32 knees required a V-Y quadricepsplasty and five (15. 6 %) required a quadriceps snip for surgical exposure at revision. One patient was lost to follow-up and three patients died of unrelated causes. The remaining 27 patients (28 knees) returned at a mean of 68. 3 months (8 - 197 months) for clinical evaluation. Results: Four knees (14 %) had recurrent infection. The mean Knee Society score improved from 40 points preoperatively to 82 points postoperatively. The mean functional score improved from 10 points preoperatively to 60 points postoperatively. The mean range of knee motion improved from 57 ° preoper-atively to 88 ° at the latest follow-up. Three knees with V-Y quadricepsplasty developed an extension lag from 20 ° to 45 ° and three knees had a <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> postoperatively. Conclusion: Two-stage reimplantation of an infected total knee arthroplasty using a static antibiotic-cement spacer achieved an infection control rate of 86 % and improvement in the clinical results. However, weakness of the extensor mechanism of the knee associated with a V-Y quadricepsplasty, which was required in a high percentage of patients during revision surgery in our series, is of great concern...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the patellar height and degenerativechanges of the knee by radiographic assessment after patellar tendon reconstructionfor chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency. Methods: This series included 44 patients (44 knees) with an average age of 31 yearsand an average follow up of 58 months. The central one third of the patellarbone-tendon-bone was used to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament inall patients. Radiographic assessment of the patellar height was measuredusing the Insall-Salvati method, and the degenerative changes of the kneeusing the Ahlback classification. Results: After harvesting the mid-third of the patellar tendon, 28 of 44 cases (64 %) showed a shortening with an average of 9. 1 %, whereas 12 cases (27 %) showing a lengthening of the patellar tendon with an average of 9. 4 %. Fourpatients (9 %) showed no change in patellar tendon length. Despite thechanges in patellar tendon length, the pre- and post-operative patellar heightchanges were only marginally significant (p = 0. 061). <b>Patella</b> <b>baja</b> was notedin eight knees (18. 2 %) and patella alta in four (9. 1 %). Of the 12 knees withpatella alta or baja, knee pain was observed in one patient (8. 3 %). The incidenceof degenerative changes was 74 % in knees with anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) reconstruction plus meniscectomy, versus 41 % with ACL reconstructionwithout meniscectomy (p = 0. 031). Conclusion: Harvesting of the mid-third of the patellar tendon resulted in changes in thepatellar tendon length, however, it only marginally affected the patellarheight. Meniscectomy was associated with a higher rate of degenerativechanges, however, ACL injury alone significantly contributed to the developmentof degenerative changes of the knee...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} clinical outcome of open ACL reconstruction using central-third bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts with a follow-up average of 13, 7 years. Between 1980 and 1991 a total of 57 patients with traumatic ACL rupture and resulting instability underwent ACL reconstruction using central-third bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts. 39 patients of these cohort (mean age 27 years) could be reached for follow-up and underwent clinical and radiological follow-up examination. Two groups were matched: group I (n= 19) with an isolated ACL rupture while group II (n= 20) showed intraoperatively an additional meniscal leasion. Clinical evaluation included physical examination using the IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegener score, KT 1000 test and a subjectiv satisfaction evaluation using Visual Analog Scales (VAS). In the IKDC score interpretation only 4 patients (10 %) performed an A rating, 17 (44 %) a B rating and 13 (33 %) a C rating. 5 patients (13 %) had to be rated with D in IKDC evaluation. Group A performed a slightly better result than group B. Also the Lysholm score showed no significant differences between both groups with a total value of 72 points. According to the Tegner score the total value was 4, 5 points and therefore in both groups significant lower than evaluated preoperative activity level. In radiologic evaluation a considerable mismatch of femoral tunnel placement and a <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> tendency was detected. Additional meniscal leasions increase probability of secondary osteoarthritis even in ACL reconstructed knees especially if meniscal tissue was totally or partial resected. Tunnel mismatch results in lag of range of motion followed by secondary cartilage and meniscal leasions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Medial opening wedge high tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is a well-described {{treatment in}} early medial compartmental osteoarthritis of the knee. However, two undesirable sequelae may follow –patella baja {{and changes in}} the posterior tibial slope (TS). Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in patients who underwent HTO in our center between September 2009 and February 2017. Preoperative and 6 -week postoperative long-leg weight bearing films and lateral knee radiographs were assessed. Pre- and postoperative radiological measurements include the Caton-Deschamps Index (CDI), the mechanical axis deviation (MAD), and the posterior TS. Independant t-test and Pearson correlation test were performed. Results: A total of 106 knees were recruited. The mean age was 48. 8 ± 10. 8 years. 66 (62. 3 %) and 40 (37. 7 %) knees were from males and females, respectively. The mean pre- and postoperative measurements was (− 9. 70 ° ± 3. 67 ° to 0. 08 ° ± 2. 80 °) (−varus; +valgus) for the MAD, (7. 14 ° ± 1. 78 ° to 8. 72 ° ± 3. 11 °) for posterior TS, and (0. 93 ° ± 0. 084 ° to 0. 82 ° ± 0. 13 °) for CDI (P ≤ 0. 001 for all). The association between patella height change and the level of osteotomy (supra-tubercle vs. infra-tubercle) was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). A supra-tubercle osteotomy cut significantly lowering patella height (P = 0. 011). There was otherwise no statistically significant correlations between patella height changes and the correction angle (P = 0. 187) or posterior TS change (P = 0. 744). Conclusions: A medial opening wedge HTO above the tibial tubercle was significantly associated with lowering patella height or reducing CDI postoperatively. Based on our results, we would recommend the use of an infra-tubercle osteotomy during the corrective surgery to prevent the complication of <b>patella</b> <b>baja...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background High tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is a {{well established}} technique {{for the treatment of}} medial osteoarthritis of the knee with varus malalignment. Results of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) after previous HTO are still discussed controversially. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the clinical and radiological results as well as perioperative data of prior HTO on TKA. Methods Forty-one TKA after HTO were compared to 41 primary TKA at minimum of six years follow-up. Patients were matched according to age, gender, follow-up, etiology, and prosthetic design. Surgical data and complications were evaluated. Clinical outcome was assessed using a number of clinical scores and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. X-rays were evaluated by the method of the American Knee Society. The patellar position was measured by the Insall-Salvati ratio. Results There was no significant difference in mean operation time (p = 0. 47) and complication rate (p = 0. 08). The Knee Score of the KSS (p = 0. 0007) and the ROM (p = 0. 006 for extension and p = 0. 004 for flexion, respectively) were significantly better in the control group. Mid-term results of the VAS, WOMAC, Lequesne, UCLA, Feller's Patellar Score and SF- 36 showed no significant difference. Femoral and tibial component alignment were similar in both groups. One tibial component showed suspect radiolucencies in the HTO group. The Insall-Salvati ratio showed three patients with patella alta and one patient with <b>patella</b> <b>baja</b> in the HTO group. At latest follow-up all implants were still in place. Conclusions Evaluating the clinical and radiological outcome, significant differences were only detected for range of motion and the Knee Score of the KSS. The present study suggests that the results of TKA with and without prior HTO are mainly identical. Although patients with a previous HTO had more complications, no statistically significant differences were noted with this group size. </p...|$|E
30|$|High tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is {{a procedure}} designed {{to change the}} alignment of the knee. It is indicated {{for the treatment of}} symptomatic medial compartment osteoarthritis in varus malaligned knees as well as patients with osteonecrosis in the medial condyle. The HTO procedure results in significant pain relief and restoration of function as the weight-bearing load is transferred to the intact compartment of the knee to alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression and defer subsequent total knee arthroplasty (Kim et al. 2009). In fact a study using bone densitometry has demonstrated changes in loading distribution before and after HTO (Agneskirchner et al. 2004). A known difficulty with the procedure is demonstrated intraobserver variability and low reproducibility, even with regards to coronal plane alignment correction (Coventry 1979; Cullu et al. 2005; Engel and Lippert 1981; Hernigou et al. 1987). Thus, conventional HTO technique has shown a high degree of alignment variability when measuring post-operative alignment (Agneskirchner et al. 2004; Bae et al. 2009; Coventry 1979; Cullu et al. 2005; Engel and Lippert 1981; Hernigou et al. 1987). It is essential that the correct alignment be achieved with the HTO as under- or overcorrection can have significant mechanical complications. In addition, multi-planar deformity may be present and can be either under or overcorrected during the procedure. While undercorrection leads to progression of medial joint arthritis and patient dissatisfaction, overcorrection leads to patellar subluxation, <b>patella</b> <b>baja,</b> medial joint opening and rapid degeneration of the lateral cartilage (Agneskirchner et al. 2004; Billings et al. 2000; Brouwer et al. 2005; Chae et al. 2008; Coventry 1979; Coventry et al. 1993; Flecher et al. 2006). Thus, to prevent overcorrection and undercorrection in HTO, the desired correction angle should be calculated exactly in preoperative planning (Kim et al. 2009). HTO may change the tibial slope in the sagittal plane, altering the tension of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (Gebhard et al. 2011; Gunes et al. 2007). Also, an increase in tibial slope increases anterior–posterior instability of the knee and may lead to increased contact pressure in the posterior femorotibial compartment in the case of ACL deficiency (Coventry and Bowman 1982; Cullu et al. 2005; Fujisawa et al. 1979).|$|E
