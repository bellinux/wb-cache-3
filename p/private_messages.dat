5|$|The game {{is played}} online {{in the same way}} as over the board, but some aspects are unique to online bughouse. In games over the board, {{communication}} is heard by all players, while in online bughouse it is usually done via <b>private</b> <b>messages</b> between two partners. This makes communication a more powerful weapon. It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board. The time aspect is altered due to existence of premove and lag. The latter can influence the diagonal time difference significantly, and it is good sportsmanship to restart the game when this difference gets too large.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I extend <b>private</b> <b>messaging</b> {{systems by}} {{designing}} multi-party <b>private</b> <b>messaging</b> models {{and contribute to}} the implementation of a distributed <b>private</b> <b>messaging</b> system. <b>Private</b> communication is of increasing interest yet current state-of-the- art adopted solutions are inadequate in providing both scale and privacy. Most current communication methods leak metadata or are susceptible to traffic analysis in spite of end-to-end encryption. Vuvuzela is a foundational <b>private</b> <b>messaging</b> system helps reconcile these two concerns. This project builds on Vuvuzela by introducing three group messaging models. These models tradeoff support for multi-party messaging with network bandwidth and latency. Additionally, this work describes the implementation and evaluation of key aspects of a distributed <b>private</b> <b>messaging</b> system, Stadium. This new system scales to more users while keeping server costs down to promote the adoption of <b>private</b> <b>messaging</b> as a more feasible practice. Keywords.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the <b>private</b> <b>message</b> service {{described}} in [4] we show efficiency improvements of that <b>private</b> <b>message</b> {{service in the}} computational setting. Regarding an attacker which may control {{all but one of}} the queried servers we describe a <b>private</b> <b>message</b> service with a total communication complexity of blinded read between client and <b>private</b> <b>message</b> service of n bit upstream and k bit downstream, where n denotes the number of cells in the database and k the size of one cell. Apart from a registration mechanism, the communication complexity between client and service is independent of the number of queried servers. Our improvement of the <b>private</b> <b>message</b> service is not only extremely efficient in terms of communication, but also in terms of computation. Further we describe how to use the message service in case of messages which are addressed using visible implicit addresses. After that we prove that at least parts of messages which are addressed using invisible implicit addresses must be broadcasted. We generalize the message service to operations in ZZN (N ≥ 2) and prove the security of blinded read. ...|$|R

25|$|The FidoNet system officially {{referred}} only {{to transfer}} of Netmailthe individual <b>private</b> <b>messages</b> between people using bulletin boardsincluding the protocols and standards {{with which to}} support it. A netmail message would contain {{the name of the}} person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer. It was common, however, for system operators to reserve the right to review the content of mail that passed through their system.|$|E
25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised {{that it would be}} nice if there was some way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled <b>private</b> <b>messages.</b> The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria {{paused for}} a period at York, where she was entertained in some style by the Earl of Newcastle. Henrietta Maria took the {{opportunity}} to discuss the situation north of the border with Royalist Scots, promoting the plans of Montrose and others for an uprising. She also supported the Earl of Antrim's proposals to settle the rebellion in Ireland and bring forces across the sea to support the King in England. Henrietta Maria continued to vigorously argue for nothing less than a total victory over Charles' enemies, countering proposals for a compromise. She rejected <b>private</b> <b>messages</b> from Pym and Hampden asking her to use her influence over the King to create a peace treaty, and was impeached by Parliament shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, Parliament had voted to destroy her private chapel at Somerset House and arrest the Capuchin friars who maintained it. In March, Henry Marten and John Clotworthy forced their way into the chapel with troops and destroyed the altarpiece by Rubens, smashed many of the statues and made a bonfire of the Queen's religious canvases, books and vestments.|$|E

Love describes the game as [...] "not really my best work", as dating simulations are not her strong point. Nevertheless, proceeds from the game were enough to support her financially for a while, and showed Love that creating games and visual novels could be a full-time profession. In 2011, she spent the month of March working on another visual novel: Don't Take It Personally, Babe, It Just Ain't Your Story, which was released as a free download on 4 April 2011.
