It {{can be used}} in the differential diagnosis between functional and organic bowel disease. Moreover, it correlates with endoscopic organic bowel disease activity. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate a recently launched quantitative immuno-chromatographic point-of-care test: Quantum Blue Calprotectin (Buhlmann Laboratories AG, Schonenbuch, Switzerland) in comparison to an established ELISA method (Buhlmann Laboratories AG). Methods: We included 142 samples, either archived (- 80 degrees C) faecal extracts or fresh routine samples. Both the normal range cartridges as well as the high range cartridge from the <b>point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> were used. The ELISA was compared with the <b>point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> and the optimal the <b>point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> cut-off values were searched for using Microsoft (R) Excel 2002 and MedCalc Software version 10. 0. 0. 0 (Mariakerke, Belgium). Results: In the method comparison a determination coefficient (R- 2) of 0. 89 was found. The Passing Bablok regression analysis showed a significant deviation from linearity (y = - 40. 8 + 1. 0 x). The use of a cut-off value of 30 mu g/g faeces and a grey zone of 30 - 110 mu g/g faeces resulted in the best agreement between the ELISA interpretation and the <b>point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> interpretation, with 89. 4 % (127 / 142) agreement and 10. 6 % (15 / 142) mismatches.

40|$|Abstract <b>Point-of-care</b> <b>tests</b> are {{biomedical}} {{tests on}} patients' specimens like blood, saliva, urine or faeces, {{which can be}} used near the patient, without interference of a laboratory. The use of these tests, many of which have been recently developed, is increasing in general practice, where they add to the GP's set of diagnostic instruments. The question is, however, whether they always contribute to an effective and high-quality diagnostic process by GPs. We present a set of criteria that can be used by guideline developers, regional primary care organizations and individual GPs to evaluate a new <b>point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> in a practice setting. These criteria do not relate only to their use and quality. A <b>point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> needs to be evaluated in the right population and for the right indications, and GPs then need to use them for the indications for which they were evaluated.

40|$|International audienceAccording to the Global Burden of Diseases, chronic viral {{hepatitis}} B and C {{are one of}} the most challenging global health conditions that rank among the first causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Low and middle income countries are particularly affected by the health burden associated with HBV or HCV infection. One major gap in efficiently addressing the issue of {{viral hepatitis}} is universal screening. However, the costs and chronic lack of human resources for using traditional screening strategies based on serology and molecular biology preclude any scaling-up. <b>Point-of-care</b> <b>tests</b> have been deemed a powerful potential solution to fill the current diagnostics gap in low-resource and decentralized settings. Despite high interest resulting from their development in recent years, very few point-of-care devices have reached the market. Scaling down and automating all testing steps in one single device (e. g. sample preparation, detection and readout) is indeed challenging. But innovations in multiple disciplines such as nanotechnologies, microfluidics, biosensors and synthetic biology have led to the creation of chip-sized laboratory systems called “lab-on-a-chip” devices. This review aims to explain how these innovations can overcome technological barriers that usually arise for each testing step while developing integrated <b>point-of-care</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> prototypes rarely meet the requirements for mass production, which also hinders their large-scale production.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Syphilis <b>point-of-care</b> <b>tests</b> {{may reduce}} {{morbidity}} and ongoing transmission {{by increasing the}} proportion of people rapidly treated. Syphilis stage and co-infection with HIV may influence test performance. We evaluated four commercially available syphilis point-of-care devices in a head-to-head comparison using sera from laboratories in Australia. METHODS: <b>Point-of-care</b> <b>tests</b> were evaluated using sera stored at Sydney and Melbourne laboratories. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated by standard methods, comparing point-of-care results to treponemal immunoassay (IA) reference test results. Additional analyses by clinical syphilis stage, HIV status, and non-treponemal antibody titre were performed. Non-overlapping 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were considered statistically significant differences in estimates. RESULTS: In total 1203 specimens were tested (736 IA-reactive, 467 IA-nonreactive). <b>Point-of-care</b> <b>test</b> sensitivities were: Determine 97. 3 %(95 %CI: 95. 8 - 98. 3), Onsite 92. 5 %(90. 3 - 94. 3), DPP 89. 8 %(87. 3 - 91. 9) and Bioline 87. 8 %(85. 1 - 90. 0). Specificities were: Determine 96. 4 %(94. 1 - 97. 8), Onsite 92. 5 %(90. 3 - 94. 3), DPP 98. 3 %(96. 5 - 99. 2), and Bioline 98. 5 %(96. 8 - 99. 3). Sensitivity of the Determine test was 100 % for primary and 100 % for secondary syphilis. The three other tests had reduced sensitivity among primary (80. 4 - 90. 2 %) compared to secondary syphilis (94. 3 - 98. 6 %). No significant differences in sensitivity were observed by HIV status. Test sensitivities were significantly higher among high-RPR titre (RPR ≥ 8) (range: 94. 6 - 99. 5 %) than RPR non-reactive infections (range: 76. 3 - 92. 9 %).
