5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating <b>peace</b> treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a <b>peace</b> was made at this time, and the more logical date for any <b>peace</b> treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating <b>peace</b> with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a <b>peace</b> treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed {{by these}} Athenian successes, the Persians stopped backing the allies and began {{supporting}} Sparta. This defection forced the allies to seek <b>peace.</b> The King's <b>Peace,</b> {{also known as}} the <b>Peace</b> of Antalcidas, was signed in 387 BC, ending the war. This treaty declared that Persia would control all of Ionia, and that all other Greek cities would be independent. Sparta was to be the guardian of the <b>peace,</b> with the power to enforce its clauses. The effects of the war, therefore, were to establish Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's hegemonic position in the Greek political system.|$|E
5|$|At the 1991 Madrid Conference, Jordan {{agreed to}} {{negotiate}} a <b>peace</b> treaty sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union.

Israel provided {{an antidote to the}} poison and released dozens of political prisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin after King Hussein threatened to annul the <b>peace</b> treaty.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} the <b>Peace</b> of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a <b>peace</b> between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the <b>peace),</b> and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{attacks from}} both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups quickly {{realized}} the futility of their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began <b>peace</b> negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of <b>peace</b> talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, <b>peace</b> talks continued. This time of relative <b>peace</b> eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E

40|$|This paper focuses upon David <b>Peace’s</b> crime writing, {{specifically}} the sequence {{known as the}} Red Riding Quartet, four novels published between 1999 and 2002 which deal with police and press investigations of murders and sex crimes in the North of England in the period from 1974 to 1983. I reflect upon <b>Peace’s</b> claim that these books constitute an ‘occult history’ of the North. I explore this claim through discussion {{of one of the}} novels in particular, 'Nineteen Seventy-Seven'. It is in this novel that the ‘occult’ in ‘occult history’ unfolds most fully. I argue that <b>Peace’s</b> novel can be understood in the context of social and cultural developments in our increasingly digitalized and ‘semio-capitalist’ (Berardi) life in the twenty-first century. In my final section I will bring to bear some Deleuzian concepts to better frame <b>Peace’s</b> significance and ‘occult’ modus operandi...|$|R

5|$|When the Athenians {{received}} this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae {{could no longer}} be defended, then Athenian security {{could no longer be}} guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss <b>peace</b> between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the <b>peace</b> settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement. The Athenians debated the <b>peace</b> treaty in April and tried to propose a common <b>peace</b> in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of <b>peace)</b> persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a <b>peace,</b> and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they {{had little choice but to}} accept Philip's terms. On 23 April, the Athenians made swore to the terms of the treaty which is now known as the <b>Peace</b> of Philocrates in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to Amphipolis.|$|E
