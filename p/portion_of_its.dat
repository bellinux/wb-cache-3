5|$|Catawissa Creek {{starts in}} Luzerne County, {{not far from}} Hazleton. It flows west and {{slightly}} south into Schuylkill County before flowing north into Columbia County and then west to the Susquehanna River, which it flows into at Catawissa.

5|$|During the Jacobite rising {{known as}} the Forty-Five, Arbroath was a Jacobite town. A large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> able bodied men joined the Jacobite army. It {{was one of the}} {{principal}} ports where men and supplies could be landed from France. It and other Jacobite ports along the north-east coast collectively formed ‘an asset of almost incalculable value’ to the Jacobite cause.|$|E

5|$|Infrastructure in Hyogo {{was also}} {{significantly}} {{damaged by the}} earthquake. The underground Daikai Station collapsed and brought down National Route 28 that runs above it. The loss of lives and infrastructure saw Hyogo lose a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population; the ward's population has failed to return to its 1994 level twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, {{and there is no}} evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> range with Hartmann's mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae).|$|E

5|$|US-62 {{has been}} part of the Oklahoma highway network since 1930. With the advent of the Interstate system, the <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> route through Oklahoma City was revised several times to adapt to the {{presence}} of the new freeways. The present-day route of US-62 includes concurrencies with I-44, I-240, I-35, and I-40.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Loukyam and Govindudu Andarivadele, Aagadu lost major <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> screens. In its lifetime, Aagadu {{collected}} a distributor share of 342.5 million and was declared a box office bomb due to the high costs involved. It however managed to perform better than the year's other commercial failures 1: Nenokkadine and Rabhasa. Aagadu final distributor share figures of AP/Nizam, Karnataka, {{and the rest of}} Indian box office stood at 214 million, 37.5 million and 16 million respectively. It also collected 62.5 million at the United States box office and 12.5 million at the other international markets in its full run.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} had {{weakened}} to a depression when it moved inland, Cindy's effects were still significant across the final <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> track. The day after its landfall in southeastern Louisiana, Tropical Depression Cindy reached central Alabama. There its rainbands produced heavy rainfall and eight tornadoes. Damage was mostly limited to trees and powerlines, but an F1 tornado in Macon county injured one man, destroyed an auto-repair shop, and damaged several nearby cars. About 35,000 residences in Alabama and 7,000 in both Florida and Mississippi were left without power following the storm.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> range.|$|E
5|$|Little Fishing Creek is {{considered}} to be an Exceptional Value stream for part of its length.

It was extended south to Rye , then rerouted to follow Westchester Avenue east to Port Chester by the following year. Most of NY120's former routing to Rye became part of New York State Route119A at that time. NY120 was rerouted to serve Rye again in October1960, replacing NY119A.|$|E

5|$|NY33 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s to the <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> modern alignment east of NY5 in Batavia. West of Batavia, {{what is now}} NY33 was unnumbered and only partially state-maintained. At the time, state maintenance of this segment began at the Buffalo city line and ended at current NY77 in Corfu. The Corfu–Batavia segment {{was taken over by}} the state of New York in the late 1920s, and NY33 was extended west over the now entirely state-maintained Genesee Street to Main Street (NY5) in downtown Buffalo as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
5|$|One of Loring's major {{secondary}} missions included {{serving as}} the headquarters for the 45th Air Division from 8 October 1954 to 18 January 1958, and on 20 November 1958. The host wing at Loring was the 42d Bombardment Wing for all but a small <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> early existence. Loring was primarily home to active duty units, although this changed in the 1980s, when the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 101st Fighter Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. As the base was the closest in the U.S. to Europe, it also functioned as an important stopover point.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Route 42 follows Little Fishing Creek for a {{significant}} <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> length. However, the creek is relatively far from it between Millville and Eyers Grove. Major communities in the watershed of the creek include Millville, Iola, Eyers Grove, and Mordansville. Between its headwaters and Talmar Road, 6 percent of the creek's length is on open public land. 44 percent is on closed private land and 50 percent is on open private land.|$|E
