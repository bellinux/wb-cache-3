40|$|Background: Peritoneal {{metastasis}} (PM) {{is considered}} a terminal and incurable disease. In the last 30 years, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) radically changed the therapeutic approach for these patients and {{is regarded as the}} standard of care for pseudomyxoma peritonei from appendiceal cancer and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>mesotheliomas.</b> Improved survival has also been reported in treating PM from ovarian, gastric, and colorectal cancers. However, PM often seriously complicates the clinical course of patients with other primary digestive and non-digestive cancers. There is increasing literature evidence that helped to identify not only the primary tumors for which CRS and HIPEC showed a survival advantage but also the patients who may benefit form this treatment modality for the potential lethal complications. Our goal is to report our experience with cytoreduction and HIPEC in patients with PM from rare or unusual primary tumors, discussing possible “unconventional ” indications, outcome, and the peculiar issues related to each tumor. Methods: From a series of 253 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis and treated by CRS and HIPEC, we selected only those with secondary peritoneal carcinomatosis from rare or unusual primary tumors, excluding pseudomyxoma peritonei, <b>peritoneal</b> <b>mesotheliomas,</b> ovarian, gastric, and colorectal cancers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{give the}} {{observed}} and expected deaths due to cancer at all separate sites in asbestos workers in east London, and to analyse these for overall effect and exposure-response trend.  METHODS—The mortality {{experience of a}} cohort of over 5000  men and women followed up for over 30  years since first exposure to asbestos has been extracted.  RESULTS—There was a large excess of deaths due to cancer (537  observed, 222  expected). Most of these were due to cancer of the lung (232  observed, 77  expected) and pleural (52) and <b>peritoneal</b> (48) <b>mesothelioma.</b> The exposure-response trend for all these three causes was highly significant. There was also an excess of {{cancer of the colon}} (27  observed, 15  expected) which was significantly related to exposure. There were significant excesses of cancer of the ovary, of the liver, and of the oesophagus but with no consistent relation to exposure.  CONCLUSIONS—The excess risk of cancer after exposure to asbestos was mainly due to cancer of the lung and mesothelioma.

In general, parallelism of probit lines is considered an indication of a common mode of action. Analysis of the shape of the dose-response relationship, with one apparent exception, shows virtually linear or superlinear behavior, i. e., from these data, there is no indication of a decrease in carcinogenic potency of an elementary carcinogenic unit at lower doses.

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to asbestos dust {{is the cause}} of asbestosis, one of the most severe pneumoconioses. This disease is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis surrounding the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli and leads to permanent impairment of lung function. Asbestosis is also associated with a high incidence of pleural and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> (1) and bronchogenic carcinomas (2). Macrophages, a cell type present both in normal alveoli and in chronic inflammatory reactions, are often conspicuous in asbestos-induced lesions (3), and investigation of the effects of asbestos particles on these cells might provide insights about the pathogenesis of asbestosis. Peritoneal macrophages obtained from mice that have received inflammatory stimuli such as thioglycollate, endotoxin, mineral oil, etc., produce plasminogen activator (4, 5), whereas the resident peritoneal macrophages from unstimufated animals do not; hence a correlation between the production of this enzyme and the inflammatory response can be established.

There have been not so many cases of malignant mesotheliomas reported, so far. In the cohort of chrysotile miners, 4 cases of pleural mesothelioma were observed.
