SANDAG did not support the development of a cross-border terminal as it sought to again revive its efforts to create a bi-national airport on San Diego’s Otay Mesa. In 1993, efforts to develop a regional bi-national airport failed [...] and a recession during that same period also caused the collapsed of land values in San Diego. The selected site for the Aerocharter cross-border terminal on the U.S. side was foreclosed. Efforts to build the cross-border terminal were then suspended.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Land <b>parcel</b> <b>numbering</b> is an {{important}} part of the Land Administration. As the land parcels are not of uniform size, different in shape and not presenting simple geometric arrangement, using artificial code means heavy workload, low efficiency and error-prone. This paper develops a new program of land <b>parcel</b> automatic <b>numbering,</b> using C # and ArcGIS Engine components, which gets a good result in the practical projects. C # is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft, which is object-oriented and running on the NET Framework.

50|$|Based on the SCT's {{recommendation}} to the San Diego delegation {{to create a}} cross-border airport terminal rather than a binational airport, on December 12, 1990, Guillermo Martinez Garcia, General Director of Mexicana de Aviación drafted a letter of intent addressed to Ralph Nieders/Malcolm and Associates with the terms and conditions under which Mexicana would acquire property in San Diego to develop a cross-border terminal for the Tijuana airport. An acquisition price of $8 million U.S. dollars had been negotiated for a 62-acre property (Marinez Ranch <b>parcel</b> <b>number</b> APN 667-050-07) on Otay Mesa, San Diego, but as Mexico was unwilling to consider SANDAG's binational airport proposal, SANDAG was equally unwilling to consider {{the development of a}} cross-border terminal for the Tijuana airport. Unable to garner support at SANDAG, on January 8, 1991, Ralph Nieders met with San Diego's Deputy Mayor and Councilman Bob Filner and submitted the Mexicana de Aviación letter of intent and the concept rendering/design for a cross-border airport terminal (image 1- Mexicana de Aviación cross-border terminal proposal 1990). In April 1991, Councilman Filner suggested the limited use of the Tijuana airport, but without clear support in San Diego, Mexicana de Aviación had already decided not to pursue the Tijuana cross-border airport terminal project.|$|E

The change in both the management of GAP and the Mexican strategic partner at AMP led to a change in development strategies for the Tijuana airport. GAP opted not to pursue the FAA grant application and did not reply to Caltrans' requests for traffic data required to redesign the Britannia Blvd. and La Media Road access ramps on State Route 905 to support the development of cross-border terminal. As the cross-border passenger terminal {{was not part of the}} original GAP airport concession and development plan approved by the SCT (Mexico's Ministry of Communications and Transportation) and ASA (Mexico's airport authority) in 1999, Holdinmex and the Spanish concession holders at GAP were not required to pursue or develop the project.

Through a pedestrian bridge, the U.S. passenger terminal would have connected directly to the Tijuana passenger terminal, while an underground conveyor system would have moved light cargo between U.S.-Mexico custom warehouses to service freight carriers such as United Parcel Service, DHL and FedEx. Supporting the concept for a cross-border terminal was the approval of a Free Trade Zone on Otay Mesa in August 1988. But the Mexicana proposal fell between two competing proposals.

News of the delegation's trip was published on November 29, 1998 and immediately impacted prices of the three selected sites. Because of cost, both Martinez Ranch and Britannia Commerce Center were dropped from consideration.
