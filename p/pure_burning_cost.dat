The new approach is inspired from Mack (2000). Two advantages over the Mack method are worthwhile to be mentioned. First, a pragmatic estimation of the required parameters leads to a straightforward calculation of the optimal credibility weights and mean squared errors of the credible reserves.

The focus of this paper is the utilization of a GAG 3 A jet engine system to combat either large out-of-control fires or to render an entire mine inert when access to problem areas is difficult or impossible. This system is based upon a Soviet designed agricultural jet engine which consumes aviation fuel with oxygen (O 2) from the intake air and exhausts combustion gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O), along with the nitrogen (N 2) from the air and small amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2). The system is designed to approach stoichiometric combustion (ideally, <b>pure</b> <b>burning</b> that scavenges all the oxygen from the intake air). Therefore, these exhaust gases are almost entirely inert gases - i. e., gases which do not contribute to, and in fact, can suppress the combustion process due to the lack of oxygen. Other methods to inert mine areas have been used in the US and internationally, but these methods usually use low flow inertisation equipment or methods. Use of these low-flow inertisation equipment and methods has been successful in proactively rendering gob areas inert and has the ability to inert the entire mine workings.

Water molecules have very little emission in the visible portion of the spectrum at any temperature (c.f. spectral absorption of water). The temperature of the hydrogen flame is more than 2000 degrees Celsius. If a piece of platinum is placed in the flame, the platinum will become [...] "white hot" [...] and give out a bright light.

Reinsurance plays nowadays a crucial role in insurance industry as it does not only reduce the reinsured's exposure, but it can also significantly reduce the required solvency capital. In past few decades various approaches to reinsurance actuarial modelling were published and many actuaries are nowadays just reinsurance specialized. The thesis provides an overview of the actuarial aspects of modelling a non-life per risk and for motor third party liability per event excess of loss reinsurance structure, according to the author's knowledge no study of such wide scope exists and various aspects have to be found in various fragmented articles published worldwide.

40|$|We {{solve for}} the {{evolution}} of the vertical extent of the convective region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I X-ray burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of nuclear burning and its extent determines the rise time of the burst light curve. Using a full nuclear reaction network, we show that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region during photospheric radius expansion (RE) bursts can be sufficiently great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected by the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some ashes of burning are exposed at the neutron star surface following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~ 30 - 60 are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate the expected column density of ejected and surface ashes in hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the resulting photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron star surface. We find that these can exceed 100 eV and are potentially detectable. A detection would probe the nuclear burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron star gravitational redshift. In addition, we find that in bursts with <b>pure</b> helium <b>burning</b> layers, protons from (alpha, p) reactions cause a rapid onset of the 12 C(p, gamma) 13 N(alpha, p) 16 O reaction sequence.

The evolution {{is driven by the}} loss of angular momentum through gravitational wave radiation (GWR), and both stars are modeled using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The donors have masses of M_ He= 0. 35, 0. 4, & 0. 51 M_ and accrete onto WDs of mass M_ WD from 0. 6 M_ to 1. 26 M_. The initial orbital periods (P_orb) span 20 to 80 minutes. For all cases, the accretion rate onto the WD is below the stable helium burning range, leading to accumulation of helium followed by unstable ignition. The mass of the convective core in the donors is small enough so that the WD accretes enough helium-rich matter to undergo a thermonuclear runaway in the helium shell before any carbon-oxygen enriched matter is transferred. The mass of the accumulated helium shell depends on M_ WD and the accretion rate. We show that for M_ He≳ 0. 4 M_ and M_ WD≳ 0. 8 M_, the first flash is likely vigorous enough to trigger a detonation in the helium layer. These thermonuclear runaways may be observed as either faint and fast. Ia SNe, or, if the carbon in the core is also detonated, Type Ia SNe. Those that survive the first flash and eject mass will have a temporary increase in orbital separation, but GWR drives the donor back into contact, resuming mass transfer and triggering several subsequent weaker flashes.
