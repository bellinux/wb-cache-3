25|$|Initially, {{graduate}} students usually rotate through the laboratories of several faculty researchers, {{after which the}} student commits to joining a particular laboratory {{for the remainder of}} his or her education. The remaining time is spent conducting original research {{under the direction of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>investigator</b> to complete and publish a dissertation. Unlike undergraduate and professional schools, there is no set time period for graduate education. Students graduate once a thesis project of significant scope to justify the writing of their dissertation has been completed, a point that is determined by the student's <b>principal</b> <b>investigator</b> as well as his or her faculty advisory committee. The average time to graduation can vary between institutions, but most programs average around 5–6 years.|$|E
