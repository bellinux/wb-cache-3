40|$|AbstractThere is {{currently}} a considerable effort to evaluate the performance of <b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> Ecosystem Services <b>as</b> an environmental management tool. The research presented here contributes to this work by using an experimental design to evaluate <b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> Ecosystem Services <b>as</b> a tool <b>for</b> supporting biodiversity conservation {{in the context of}} an African protected area. The trial employed a ‘before and after’ and ‘with and without’ design. We present the results of social and ecological surveys to investigate the impacts of the trial in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and equity. We find the scheme to be effective at bringing about additional conservation outcomes. However, we also found that increased monitoring is similarly effective in the short term, at lower cost. The major difference – and arguably the significant contribution of the <b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> Ecosystem Services – was that it changed the motives for protecting the park and improved local perceptions both of the park and its authority. We discuss the implications of these results for conservation efficiency, arguing that efficiency should not be defined in terms of short-term cost-effectiveness, but also in terms of the sustainability of behavioral motives in the long term. This insight helps us to resolve the apparent trade-off between goals of equity and efficiency in <b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> Ecosystem Services...|$|R

40|$|Blood is scarce, and {{ensuring}} a sufficient blood supply remains difficult <b>for</b> many countries. <b>Payment</b> <b>for</b> blood <b>as</b> {{a strategy to}} increase donations has remained highly controversial for decades, and the debate about ethical issues in paying donors has become somewhat stuck.

In this paper, such a compromise is developed both from a theoretical and empirical perspective, namely implementing well-designed non-cash incentives which cut across the rigid dichotomy of altruistic donations versus <b>payment</b> <b>for</b> donations. In order for this compromise to work, more attention to donation motives, the choice architecture, and the setting in blood donation needs to be paid...|$|R

40|$|A {{political}} and social recognition of ecosystem services is increasingly complementing that of services generally expected from agriculture. It is {{in this context that}} this chapter discusses the role of <b>payments</b> <b>for</b> environmental services in regulating agricultural and forestry activities. We first show how the initial representation of <b>payments</b> <b>for</b> environmental services <b>as</b> "market instruments", designed to ensure the internalization of environmental externalities, has evolved over almost 20 years of implementation characterized by the funding and management primarily by the State of <b>payments</b> <b>for</b> environmental services. <b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> environmental services are now widely recognized as transfers aimed at influencing private and/or collective use of land, and addressing {{political and}} institutional concerns regarding the management of natural resources.
