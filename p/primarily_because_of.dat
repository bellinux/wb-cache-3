5|$|In November 1996, Bhutto's {{government}} was dismissed by Leghari <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> corruption and Murtaza's death. Zardari {{was arrested in}} Lahore while attempting to flee the country to Dubai.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualties}} at Fort Donelson were heavy, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the large}} Confederate surrender. Union losses were 2,691 (507 killed, 1,976 wounded, 208 captured/missing), Confederate 13,846 (327 killed, 1,127 wounded, 12,392 captured/missing).|$|E
5|$|Whereas bismuth is most {{available}} {{today as a}} byproduct, its sustainability is more dependent on recycling. Bismuth is mostly a byproduct of the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> scattering.|$|E
50|$|Đinđić {{had made}} many enemies {{domestically}} throughout {{his political career}} <b>primarily</b> <b>of</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his regard as being pro-Western and his hard-line policies on organized crime. Đinđić extradited Slobodan Milošević to the ICTY in 2001.|$|R

5|$|As Ophelia was {{predicted}} to pass near southeast New England, the NHC issued tropical storm warnings {{for much of}} the south Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastlines. In Atlantic Canada, considerable preparations were taken for Ophelia, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> memories of Hurricane Juan of the 2003 season, which had caught the authorities off-guard. Ophelia prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre's first ever tropical storm warnings which were canceled when Ophelia became extratropical.|$|E
5|$|He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November {{in hopes}} of obtaining {{financial}} aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies {{as part of a}} broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{influence}} of Playford's mother Elizabeth that contributed to his relative Puritanism and social habits. She was a devout Baptist Christian, and it was <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her that he publicly abstained from alcohol, smoking, and gambling throughout his lifetime. However, despite her influence on his social habits, he did not regularly attend church like his family.|$|E

50|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} other elements, <b>primarily</b> carbon. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> its high tensile {{strength}} and low cost, {{it is a major}} component in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|R
50|$|Pachaug State Forest was {{the first}} state forest in Connecticut and grew quickly in acreage <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> the farmers and landholders in the area {{realized}} that their soil was poor for farming and sold their land to {{the state in the}} 1920s and 1930s.|$|R
5|$|<b>Primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog {{contributed to}} the console's {{popularity}} in North America. During October–December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by a two-to-one ratio, and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 {{percent of the market}} for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega, {{this was the first time}} since December 1985 that the company did not lead the console market.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. It {{results in a}} decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|After their 1908–12 trip, {{the couple}} stopped {{exploring}} {{and turned to}} writing and lecturing, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the onset of World War I in 1914. Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of}} the first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena. She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club, Royal Asiatic Society, Club Alpino Italiano, Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Club alpin français. She was very proud of these achievements, listing them on the title pages of her books.|$|E
30|$|Finally, Bucher (2017) {{remarks that}} the FEARS index is <b>primarily</b> {{interesting}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its cross-sectional features at daily and weekly horizons.

50|$|The {{only known}} {{occurrence}} of Marrite {{is the type}} locality of the Lengenbach quarry in Binntal, Valais, Switzerland. It is <b>primarily</b> formed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> hydrothermal activity, which involves water and high temperatures. Marrite is predominately found in dolomite along {{with a variety of}} other sulfosalts.|$|R

5|$|Ajay {{ends up in}} Yuma's {{mountain}} prison, {{from which}} he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other {{to prevent them from}} starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1916, {{the ships}} of the Braunschweig class were {{withdrawn}} from active service, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> manpower shortages. Braunschweig {{was used as}} a training ship, and on 20 August 1917, was converted into a barracks ship in Kiel. Elsass was also used as a barracks and training ship in Kiel, having been withdrawn from active service on 25 July 1916. Hessen was converted into a depot ship in Brunsbüttel in 1917, while Preussen became a depot ship in Wilhelmshaven that same year. Lothringen was withdrawn from service in 1917 and used as an engineer training ship in Wilhelmshaven. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1916 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low capital formation, {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistence progress in {{quality of life and}} income of people cutting across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has been not much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center.|$|E
50|$|Urine {{analysis}} is <b>primarily</b> used <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its low cost. Urine drug testing {{is one of}} the most common testing methods used. The enzyme-multiplied immune test is the most frequently used urinalysis. Complaints have been made about the relatively high rates of false positives using this test.|$|R
5000|$|Ethal is <b>primarily</b> known <b>because</b> <b>of</b> how Ailill mac Máta and Dagda went to {{war with}} him to marry his {{daughter}} Cáer to Aengus, son of Dagda.

50|$|Runway 07 is {{equipped}} with ILS CAT I, and despite the name, is directed at 047° East of North. The single runway has a 1.5% gradient, sloping up towards the South-West end of the runway; despite this gradient, the preferred landing direction is from the South, landing on Runway 07. This is <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> winds <b>of</b> the Highveld of South Africa are usually Northerly winds, blowing South.|$|R
5|$|The {{ships were}} very stable, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their wide beam. The ships {{suffered}} from only slight pitching and rolling, {{even in the}} heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Bismarck and Tirpitz were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder deflections as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|When the {{operation}} was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, {{but he was in}} his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.|$|E
5|$|As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined by {{an allergy}} to chlorine. As a result, {{he did not}} swim in his first race until a school {{carnival}} {{at the age of}} seven. The allergy forced Thorpe to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his significant size advantage. Thorpe gradually overcame the ailment and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools Championships in 1994. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the New South Wales Short Course Age Championships in September of the same year. In 1995, Thorpe started his secondary education at East Hills Boys Technology High School and switched coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of Doug Frost. It was a busy year for the family; Christina was selected for the Australian team to compete at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Atlanta. Now six feet tall, Ian competed at his first Australian Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200m and 400m freestyle. He won all ten events at the New South Wales Age Championships.|$|E
50|$|The Cape Fear shiner's {{intestines}} are {{adapted to}} help the fish digest plants and they were initially suggested to be <b>primarily</b> herbivorous <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this adaptation.

5|$|The Greater Montreal Area is {{predominantly}} Roman Catholic; however, weekly attendance in Quebec {{is among the}} lowest in Canada. Historically Montreal has been a centre of Catholicism in North America with its numerous seminaries and churches, including the Notre-Dame Basilica, the Cathédrale Marie-Reine-du-Monde, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. Some 65.8% {{of the total population}} is Christian, largely Roman Catholic (52.8%), <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> descendants of original French settlers, and others of Italian and Irish origins. Protestants which include Anglican Church in Canada, United Church of Canada, Lutheran, owing to British and German immigration, and other denominations number 5.90%, with a further 3.7% consisting mostly of Orthodox Christians, fuelled by a large Greek population. There is also a number of Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox parishes. Islam is the largest non-Christian religious group, with 154,540 members, the second-largest concentration of Muslims in Canada at 9.6%. The Jewish community in Montreal has a population of 90,780. In cities such as Côte Saint-Luc and Hampstead, Jewish people constitute the majority, or a substantial part of the population. As recently as 1971 the Jewish community in Greater Montreal was as high as 109,480. Political and economic uncertainties led many to leave Montreal and the province of Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{range in}} the Soviet Union {{encompassed}} nearly the entire territory of the country, being absent only on the Solovetsky Islands, Franz-Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and the Karagin, Commander and Shantar Islands. The species was exterminated twice in Crimea, once after the Russian Civil War, and again after World War II. Following the two world wars, Soviet wolf populations peaked twice. 30,000 wolves were harvested annually out of a population of 200,000 during the 1940s, with 40,000–50,000 harvested during peak years. Soviet wolf populations reached a low around 1970, disappearing over much of European Russia. The population increased again by 1980 to about 75,000, with 32,000 being killed in 1979. Wolf populations in northern inner Mongolia declined during the 1940s, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> poaching of gazelles, the wolf's main prey. In British-ruled India, wolves were heavily persecuted because of their attacks on sheep, goats and children. In 1876, 2,825 wolves were bountied in the North-Western Provinces (NWP) and Bihar. By the 1920s, wolf extermination remained a priority in the NWP and Awadh. Overall, over 100,000 wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 1916.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} built by the Castellammare di Stabia shipyard. Her keel was laid down on 30 January 1899, and the {{completed}} hull was launched on 7 November 1901 {{in the presence of}} the King and Queen of Italy, government officials, and the whole Italian Mediterranean squadron. Fitting out work lasted for the next four years, and she was completed on 1 September 1905. It took so long <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> non-delivery of material, particularly the heavy armor. After she entered active service, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. The Squadron was usually only activated for seven months of the year in peacetime, which was occupied with training maneuvers, and the rest of the year the ships were placed in reserve. In 1907, the Mediterranean Squadron consisted of Benedetto Brin, her sister , and three of the s. The ships participated in the annual maneuvers in late September and early October, under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti. Benedetto Brin remained in the active duty squadron through 1910, by which time the fourth Regina Elena-class ship was completed, bringing the total number of front-line battleships to six.|$|E
