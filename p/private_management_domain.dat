However, existing conceptualizations of the project <b>management</b> <b>domain</b> have limited scope. Therefore, this paper proposes to elaborate a comprehensive conceptual model of the project <b>management</b> <b>domain</b> to be used for development of XML schema for configuration of project management information systems. Development of the comprehensive concept model is based on analysis and integration of existing conceptualizations of project management and conceptual model integration.

Therefore, a full debate of this issue is required, taking into consideration the fact that, in ouropinion, this process involves more than just the replacement of a manager with another. The implementationof <b>private</b> <b>management</b> in companies of national strategy, currently in state ownership, is desired to be aprofound and also very complex process, aiming to change organizational culture in depth, both verticallyand horizontally, so as to increase efficiency in these companies. Implementation of <b>private</b> <b>management</b> could be a good opportunity for an efficient development ofthese companies, for an increasing level of competitiveness on the international market, but only in terms ofa leadership team chosen on performance criteria, with a coherent set of objectives and a high independencelevel of decision. There are some opinions from people with experience in managing both private and statecompanies. They believe that the idea of establishing a <b>private</b> <b>management</b> in state companies, is, in themain, good, but it is essential to take into consideration the idea of a team trained to lead the company,instead of one person as a general manager. Another element to be taken into account, so that this idea of <b>private</b> <b>management</b> may have thedesired effect, is to precisely determine companies where <b>private</b> <b>management</b> teams should be installed. Notall companies are suitable for the same <b>private</b> <b>management</b> strategy. This type of leadership is better forcompanies with a real international perspective, such as Tarom, while strategic companies should be ratherreformed, including management privatization, and kept as state strategic areas. However, strict criteria ofstate intervention in decision-making process should be established, a striking question concerning thecircumstances under which such a management team could be successful, given that state firms are stronglypoliticized...|$|R

In particular, we show that, in certain situations, there might be little difference in operating costs. Thus, in terms of total costs (production and transaction costs), no systematic advantages should be expected from <b>private</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

It uses a rich city-level dataset of water utilities in France for several years. We find evidence that <b>private</b> <b>management</b> is associated with higher prices on average ceteris paribus. This pattern {{is consistent with the}} study of units switching from an organization to another. We find that municipalities switching from public to <b>private</b> <b>management</b> face increased price but the effect is not always significant. Our results also show that switching from <b>private</b> to public <b>management</b> does not always foster decreasing prices. We finally discuss several reasons for the price gap between public and <b>private</b> <b>management</b> using extra-samples. We also present some methodological implications for researchers working on the link between organization and efficiency. JEL Codes: L 14 -L 33 -L 95.
