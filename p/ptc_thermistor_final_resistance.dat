40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the design of sensors with {{automatic}} self-control. A <b>PTC</b> <b>thermistor</b> was se-lected, which {{is used as a}} level sensor to prevent overfill of liquids in tanks. In self-heated mode, the I-V characteristic is basically dependent on the unloading resistance value RT of the PTC sensor itself, the thermal resistance RW and the temperature TM of the medium that is surrounding it. This I-V characteristic of the sensor in thermally steady state in still air is modelled. Problems in detecting the liquid level occur for liquids with high temperature and/or high viscosity (e. g. Indonesia’s crude oil). A solution to this worst-case scenario is to continu-ously determine RW from the I-V characteristic of the <b>PTC</b> <b>thermistor</b> with the sensor in function.

40|$|Delamination {{fracture}} of {{positive temperature coefficient}} <b>PTC</b> <b>thermistors</b> is a mode of thermal shock failure which manifests itself by cracking of the ceramic along a plane approximately parallel to the electrodes. This mode of failure is observed in high-power switching applications. It results from the build-up of thermal stresses whose amplitude is governed by {{a large number of}} geometrical, electrical and thermomechanical parameters. An experimental procedure is proposed for the quantitative evaluation of the thermal shock resistance of <b>PTC</b> <b>thermistors.</b> This resistance is characterized by a 'fracture voltage' defined as the voltage causing an increase by more than 10 % of the room-temperature resistance after less than 25 switching cycles. The crack trajectory during the successive cycles is revealed by microscopic observation of the fracture surfaces. These experimental results are interpreted by comparison with the temperature and stress distributions computed using a newly developed three dimensional model. This modelling allows evaluation of the relative importance of the parameters affecting failure.

50|$|Thermistors can be {{classified}} into two types, depending on the classification of ''''.

If '''' is negative, the resistance decreases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. Resistors that are not thermistors are designed to have a '''' as close to 0 as possible, so that their resistance remains nearly constant over a wide temperature range.|$|R

25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (<b>PTC)</b> <b>thermistors</b> to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|R

40|$|Thermistors are temperature-measuring devices {{based on}} the {{principle}} that the thermistor material exhibits a change in electrical resistance with a change in temperature. By measuring the resistance of the thermistor material, one can then determine the temperature. Thermistors are generally a piece of semiconductor made from metal oxides such as those of manganese, nickel, cobalt, etc. These pieces may be made into a bead, disk, wafer, etc depending on the application. There are two types of thermistors – negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and positive temperature coefficient (<b>PTC)</b> <b>thermistors.</b> For NTCs, the resistance decreases with temperature, while for PTCs, the resistance increases with temperature. It is the NTCs that are generally used for temperature measurement. Why would we want to use thermistors for measuring temperature as opposed to other choices such as thermocouples? It is because thermistors have high sensitivity giving more accuracy, a fast response to temperature changes for accuracy and quicker measurements, and relatively high resistance for decreasing the errors caused by the resistance of lead wires themselves...|$|R

The liquid level is reached if the resistance of the sensor decreases sufficiently.

A solution to this problem based on modelling the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of the sensor instead of relying on the model of resistance-temperature (R-T) characteristic proposed in this paper. The model presented is phenomenological, but it is based on physical models published by Heywang and Mallick. The modelling of current-voltage characteristic takes into consideration the temperature dependence of the thermal resistance Rth of the medium as decision threshold (e. g., the thermal resistance of silicon oil is 35 % different to that in air) and the model enables a continuous monitoring of sensor parameters in order to identify slow changes due to contamination on the sensor surface by soil or dust or ageing. The model has been verified by fitting its response to several R-T and I-V characteristic with a typical maximum relative current error at room temperatures about 1, 2 %.
