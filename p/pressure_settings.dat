This suggests that such strategies are still sub-optimal for some ARDS patients. For these patients, tailored use of ventilator settings should be considered, including: further reduction of tidal volumes, administration of neuromuscular blocking agents if the patient’s spontaneous breathing is incompatible with mechanical ventilation, and adjusting positive end-expiratory <b>pressure</b> (PEEP) <b>settings</b> based on transpulmonary pressure levels...|$|R
50|$|Some {{pressure}} cookers {{have a lower}} {{or higher}} maximum pressure than 1 bar/15 psi (gauge) or can be adjusted to different pressures for some recipes; cooking times will increase or decrease accordingly. This is typically done by having different regulator weights or different <b>pressure</b> <b>settings.</b> If the recipe is devised for a higher pressure and the pressure cooker does not reach that pressure, the cooking time can be increased slightly to compensate. Electric pressure cookers operate at lower pressures than stovetop pressure cookers.|$|E

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain's decision not to follow approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Different output <b>pressure</b> <b>settings</b> on the fuel boost pumps coupled with the open crossfeed valve resulted in both engines drawing fuel from the left tank. All of the fuel from the airplane's left tank that was not used by the engines was transferred into the right tank due to the pressure differential between the boost pumps. During the airplane's descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank became exhausted. Both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the exhausted left tank into the fuel system, resulting in a dual-engine flameout.|$|E

DESIGN [...] Re-examination of standardised data from the Intersalt study, an international, multicentre study on the determinants of blood <b>pressure.</b> <b>SETTING</b> AND SUBJECTS [...] Samples of adults representing 52 populations in 32 countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The relations, expressed as correlation coefficients, between the mean population values for blood pressure, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and sodium intake and the prevalence of, respectively, hypertension ({{greater than or equal to}} 140 mm Hg), obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2), high alcohol intake (greater than or equal to 300 ml/week), and high sodium intake (greater than or equal to 250 mmol/day). RESULTS [...] There were close and independent associations between the population mean and the prevalence of deviance for each of the variables examined: correlation coefficients were 0. 85 for blood pressure, 0. 94 for body mass index, 0. 97 for alcohol intake, and 0. 78 for sodium intake. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings imply that distributions of health related characteristics move up and down as a whole: the frequency of "cases" can be understood only in the context of a population's characteristics. The population thus carries a collective responsibility for its own health and well being, including that of its deviants...|$|R
50|$|These {{operate with}} a {{spring-loaded}} valve {{that is often}} hidden from view in a proprietary mechanism. This generation is characterized by two or more <b>pressure</b> <b>settings.</b> Some of these pressure cookers do not release any steam during operation (non-venting) and instead use a rising indicator with markings to show the pressure level. These only release steam when the pan is opened, or as a safety precaution if the heat source is not reduced enough when the pan reaches the required cooking pressure. Others use a dial that the operator can advance by a few clicks (which alters the spring tension) to change the pressure setting or release pressure; these release steam during operation (venting).|$|E
50|$|In many countries, PAP {{machines}} are only available by prescription. A sleep study at an accredited sleep lab is usually necessary before treatment can start.

A sleep medicine doctor, who may also be trained in respiratory medicine, psychiatry, neurology, paediatrics, family practice or otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat), will interpret {{the results from the}} initial sleep study and recommend a pressure test. This may be done in one night (a split study with the diagnostic testing done {{in the first part of}} the night, and CPAP testing done in the later part of the night) or with a follow up second sleep study during which the CPAP titration may be done over the entire night. With CPAP titration (split night or entire night), the patient wears the CPAP mask and pressure is adjusted up and down from the prescribed setting to find the optimal setting.

A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted at the Iowa State University farm at Boone, Iowa for two tire inflation pressure levels on Dual Front (Firestone IF 420 / 85 R 34) and Dual Rear (Firestone IF 480 / 80 R 50) tires on a John Deere 8310 R MFWD tractor, and transport tires (Super single 445 / 50 R 22. 5) on a John Deere DB 60 planter. Soil compaction was measured using Stress State Transducers (SSTs) buried at 15 -cm and 30 -cm depths beneath the untrafficked soil surface. The soil cone index depth profile was measured at tire-centerline, tire-edge and 20 cm laterally outboard of the tire edge before and after tractor-planter tire passes. Peak Octahedral Normal Stress (ONS) and the corresponding Octahedral Shear Stress (OSS) values in soil were calculated from the SST data. The peak ONS and corresponding OSS values from the road tire inflation <b>pressure</b> <b>settings</b> were statistically higher (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the field tire inflation <b>pressure</b> <b>settings.</b> The maximum ONS was observed at 15 cm soil depth from the road tire inflation pressure setting of the rear tractor tires (179 kPa tire inflation pressure and 33 kN load per tire). The ONS from the front tractor tires (138 kPa tire inflation pressure and 17 kN load per tire) and planter transportation tires (620 kPa tire inflation pressure and 16. 5 kN load per tire) were similar. Cone index data also showed significant differences, comparing before and after tires passes, at the tire-centerline.

In addition to this, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) banned the practice of swapping the left- and right-side tyres around on the cars, which teams had discovered increased the life expectancy of each tyre.
