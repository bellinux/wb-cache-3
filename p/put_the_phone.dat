25|$|In July 2009, Gough {{revealed}} {{himself to}} be a supporter of the Conservative Party and offered his support to Nigel Adams' parliamentary campaign for Selby and Ainsty. He was invited by David Cameron to be the Conservative Party candidate in the Barnsley Central by-election in February 2011, but declined due to other commitments. Initially Gough thought the invitation was a hoax and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> down. Cameron had to call again to confirm the invitation was genuine. Gough turned down the invitation, but made himself available to support the Tories during the by-election campaign.|$|E
25|$|However, the Phone Pals {{suffered}} three succeeding losses, prompting {{team officials}} to land Ren-Ren Ritualo from Air21 for Leo Avenido and a future first round draft pick, Don Allado from Alaska for Willie Miller, John Ferriols and a future first round pick on May 8. The move saw the Phone Pals {{as a potential}} title contender with the squad boasting a group of star players from their past teams along with Taulava, Alapag, Cardona and Carey. Even with a strong lineup, the trade <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>Phone</b> Pals in a deeper hole, losing three more games before a win against Coca-Cola gave them a disappointing 6–10 card.|$|E
500|$|On 4 October 1990, Peter Taylor died {{suddenly}} of pulmonary fibrosis while on holiday in Costa De Los Pinos, Majorca, {{at the age}} of 62. When told of Taylor's death by Ron Fenton, Clough apparently did not speak, <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> down on him and cried heavily. He also, while very upset, made a phone call to the Taylor family. Clough attended the funeral eleven days later and dedicated his 1994 autobiography to Taylor saying [...] "To Peter. Still miss you badly. You once said: 'When you get shot of me there won't be as much laughter in your life'. You were right".|$|E

2500|$|Osbourne's {{relationship}} with her mother was also damaged. According to a 2009 article in The Guardian, Hope Arden was a cold woman who became even stranger after a serious car accident, something which Osbourne said [...] "unhinged her".

2500|$|The cast were reunited in 1975 for a BBC radio {{adaptation}} of series 1, transmitted on Radio 4 from July to October that year. In 1976, {{a feature film}} spin-off was made. Around {{the time of its}} release, however, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam fell out over a misunderstanding involving the press and have not spoken since. This long-suspected situation was finally confirmed by Bewes while promoting his autobiography in 2005. Unlike Bewes, Bolam is consistently reluctant to talk about the show, and has vetoed any attempt to revive his character.The final breach, as Bewes told it, occurred after Bolam's wife, Sue, announced to her husband, while he was driving, that she was pregnant. He almost crashed the car. Bewes repeated this story in a newspaper interview, thinking that it was already public knowledge, then got a frosty reaction when he rang Bolam to forewarn him. [...] "There was this dreadful silence. He <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> down. I called him back. He didn't answer. He hasn't spoken to me since", Bewes claimed. }} ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Blackman had an {{opportunity}} to work with Lenny Kravitz. From New York, Blackman talked over the phone with Kravitz in Los Angeles, and played drums for him as he listened. Kravitz immediately asked Blackman to fly out to LA. [...] "Lenny asked me can you play something for me over the phone", Blackman says. [...] "So I <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> down and I started playing something like, BOOSH-bat-bat, BOOSH-BOOSH-BOOSH-bat, and I went back to the phone and I said, 'Can you hear that?' He said, 'Yeah. Can you fly out to L.A. right now?'" [...] "I flew out the next morning. While I'm downstairs waiting for the instruments to come from the studio, these people started coming in. First 12, and then like 30 more. I was like, 'whoa, this is an audition'. I ended up playing and instead of staying for one or two days, I stayed for two weeks and did the first video that I did with him, [...] "Are You Gonna Go My Way". Apart from 2004, I played with him ever since." ...|$|E

50|$|This phone has a known LCD screen defect {{that causes}} the screen to cease functioning. T-Mobile was aware of this and only {{temporarily}} halted sales before <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> back on <b>the</b> market, regardless of the problem never being fixed. Upon further investigation, it appears as though the connector to the LCD becomes worn down and the protective layer breaks due to friction from operation of the slider.|$|R
50|$|The Slvr has {{an almost}} {{identical}} software user interface (UI) to the RAZR which {{is regarded as}} clumsy and ill-designed. Other criticisms are when the battery is low: The Slvr emits a loud beep every few minutes, causing problems when people are sleeping or in business meetings. The beeping can only be disabled by <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> in silent mode, vibrate, switching it off, or plugging it in for battery recharging.|$|R
2500|$|Roberts {{had asked}} the CIGS John French {{to come and see}} him at Ascot on 19 March; French had been too busy but invited Roberts to visit him when next in London. On the morning of 21 March Roberts and French had an acrimonious {{telephone}} conversation in which Roberts told French that he would share the blame if he collaborated with the Cabinet's [...] "dastardly" [...] attempt to coerce Ulster, and then, after French told him that he would [...] "do his duty as a soldier" [...] and obey lawful orders, <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> down on him. Soon after, Roberts received a telegram from Hubert Gough, purporting to ask for advice, although possibly designed to goad him into further action. Roberts requested an audience with King George V, who told him that Seely (Secretary of State for War), to whom the King had recently spoken, had complained that Roberts was [...] "at the bottom" [...] of the matter, had incited Gough, and had called the politicians [...] "swine and robbers" [...] in his phone conversation with French. Roberts indignantly denied this, claiming that he had not been in contact with Gough for [...] "years" [...] and that he had advised officers not to resign. Roberts' claim may not be the whole truth as Gough was on first name terms with Roberts' daughter and later gave her copies of key documents relating to the Incident.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the record with Rolling Stone she discussed her selection of producers for the record, {{with a goal}} to create [...] "a unique record" [...] becoming the basis of her selection. After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going to send you the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> down, thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it meant so much to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.|$|E

She <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> on silent, which causes Bob to send several multi-media messages, one of which Tina identifies as a picture of Mr. Fischoeder's buttocks. Linda then deduces that Bob and Mr. Fischoeder are together and probably just drunk. Bob attempts to text and call them again but <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> falls into <b>the</b> water. Linda and the rest try to break the almost unrecognizable text, and start genuinely worrying about Bob. They look for him all over town until they end up at Wonder Wharf, where they see the guilt-ridden Felix.
