5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and <b>pillows,</b> <b>and</b> eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Club Europe is the short-haul {{business}} class on all short-haul flights. This class allows {{for access to}} business lounges at most airports. Club Europe provides seats in a 2–2 configuration on narrowbody aircraft, with the middle seat not used. Instead, a table folds up from under the middle seat on refurbished aircraft. <b>Pillows</b> <b>and</b> blankets are available on longer flights.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are used}} as {{construction}} materials. Living cactus fences are employed as barricades. The woody parts of cacti, such as Cereus repandus and Echinopsis atacamensis, are used in buildings and in furniture. The frames of wattle and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of Carnegiea gigantea. The very fine spines and hairs (trichomes) of some cacti were used {{as a source of}} fiber for filling <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> in weaving.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E

25|$|Her tomb {{was created}} by Pietro Torrigiano, who {{probably}} arrived in England in 1509 and received the commission in the following year. The gilded bronze sculpture on the tomb depicts Margaret with her head resting on <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> her hands raised in prayer, wearing garments characteristic of widowhood; the face was probably sculpted from a death mask. The black marble tomb is embellished with heraldic bronze insignia, including a yale, her heraldic badge, at her feet.|$|E
25|$|Buckwheat hulls {{are used}} as filling {{for a variety of}} {{upholstered}} goods, including <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> zafu. The hulls are durable and do not conduct or reflect heat as much as synthetic fills. They are sometimes marketed as an alternative natural fill to feathers for those with allergies. However, medical studies to measure the health effects of buckwheat hull pillows manufactured with unprocessed and uncleaned hulls, concluded such buckwheat pillows do contain higher levels of a potential allergen that may trigger asthma in susceptible individuals than do new synthetic-filled pillows.|$|E

25|$|Continental {{offered a}} {{modified}} BusinessFirst service on flights from the United States mainland to Hawaii. All flights offered the same suite of EliteAccess ground services, {{along with a}} similar main meal service on board. Amenities such as <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> headsets also were the same, but no amenity kits were offered. On flights from Newark and Houston to Honolulu, Continental operated Boeing 767-400ER aircraft with typical recliner-style BusinessFirst seats. On flights from Los Angeles and Orange County to Honolulu/Kahului with Boeing 737 equipment, domestic First Class seats were substituted. Nonstop flights from Guam to Honolulu were exempt from most of these modifications and more closely resembled the standard BusinessFirst service.|$|E
25|$|Mythological {{scenes are}} {{frequently}} depicted, especially Heracles and figures {{relating to the}} Trojan War. But the imagery on Corinthian vases does not have as wide a thematic range as do later works by Attic painters. Gods are seldom depicted, Dionysus never. But the Theban Cycle was more popular in Corinth than later in Athens. Primarily fights, horsemen and banquets were the most common scenes of daily life, the latter appearing {{for the first time}} during the early Corinthian period. Sport scenes are rare. Scenes with fat-bellied dancers are unique and their meaning is disputed up to the present time. These are drinkers whose bellies and buttocks are padded with <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> they may represent an early form of Greek comedy.|$|E
25|$|In the {{era when}} long {{distance}} trips took several days, sleeping accommodations were {{an essential part}} of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the inn or ryokan, which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include sleeping cars on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys in lieu of paying for a hotel. The ability to get additional sleep {{on the way to work}} is attractive to many commuters using public transport.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of this tiny group of islands {{lies in its}} marine biodiversity, its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced storm-petrel (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic little shearwater (500), Madeiran storm-petrel (1000), yellow-legged gull, the roseate tern and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Crybaby" [...] live during {{every show}} on the Rainbow World Tour. For the song's performances, {{the stage was set}} with a large bed, <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> comforters, as well as a small desk and homely props. Carey, dressed in pajamas, sang while re-enacting segments of the video. During her performance at Madison Square Garden on April 11, 2000, she threw the audience small stuffed bears and completed the song while lying in the bed on stage. After the song's bridge, Snoop's pre-recorded verse was played over the background vocals. [...] The song was also performed on select nights of The Elusive Chanteuse Show tour in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Once on the island, they {{determined}} that all residents {{needed to be}} evacuated [...] "...whether they like or not". The first to be evacuated from the island were the infant and six people in the family; the infant {{was taken to a}} hospital on Saipan as a precaution. On nearby Agrihan, it was determined that the residents on the island also needed to be evacuated. Prior to their evacuations, they were given relief supplies, mainly food and water, to survive for five days. Roughly 260 gallons of fresh water, 50lbs of rice and other health or comfort supplies were delivered by Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 25 to both islands. On September21, the Salvation Army announced that residents displaced by the storm would be received donated items, such as clothing, toys, <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> baby formula.|$|E

[...] Chandler joked that due to his game-winning field goal, Morten Andersen [...] "gets to keep his green card," [...] referring to Andersen's Danish nationality, while running back Jamal Anderson felt vindicated for the media's continuous focus on the Vikings {{in the days leading up}} to the game, which made him feel disrespected.|$|E
500|$|Also, down {{feathers}} or plumulaceous feathers. The down of birds—their plumulaceous feathers, {{as opposed}} to —are a layer of fine, silky feathers found under the tougher exterior feathers, that are often used by humans as a thermal insulator and padding in goods such as jackets, bedding, <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> sleeping bags.

500|$|The {{authorities}} were initially wary {{of opening the}} London Underground for shelter, fearing the effect on morale elsewhere in London and hampering normal operations. On 12 September, having suffered five days of heavy bombing, {{the people of the}} East End took the matter into their own hands and invaded tube stations with <b>pillows</b> <b>and</b> blankets. The government relented and opened the partially completed Central line as a shelter. Many deep tube stations remained in use as shelters {{until the end of the}} war. [...] Aerial mines were deployed on 19 September 1940. These exploded at roof top height, causing severe damage to buildings over a wider radius than the impact bombs. By now, the Port of London had sustained heavy damage with a third of its warehouses destroyed, and the West India and St Katherine Docks had been badly hit and put out of action. Bizarre events occurred when the River Lea burned with an eerie blue flame, caused by a hit on a gin factory at Three Mills, and the Thames itself burnt fiercely when Tate & Lyle's Silvertown sugar refinery was hit.|$|E
