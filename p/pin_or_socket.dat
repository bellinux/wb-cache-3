5000|$|Solder Contact is a <b>pin</b> <b>or</b> <b>socket</b> contact that {{accepts a}} {{conductor}} (wire) which is soldered onto the [...] "solder cup," [...] not crimped into the wire barrel.|$|E
50|$|Crimp Contact is a {{connector}} <b>pin</b> <b>or</b> <b>socket</b> whose back portion (wire barrel) is a hollow cylinder into which a stripped wire (conductor) is inserted. The sidewalls {{of the wire}} barrel are then mechanically compressed (uniformly deformed) using a crimping tool to captivate the conductor..|$|E
50|$|For this reason, D-sub-to-modular {{adapters}} {{are typically}} shipped with the D-sub contacts (<b>pins</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets)</b> terminated but not {{inserted into the}} connector body, so that the D-sub-to-modular contact pairing can be performed by the equipment maker.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for storing and providing numerous coaxial lines for mounting on coaxial connectors, whereby the coaxial lines {{are placed in}} a row in parallel adjacent to each other on a support provided with grooves, and a handling unit and a controller are provided for inserting the coaxial lines in the support. The device consists of two parts and can be moved apart by said two parts. One part of the device is designed as a coaxial line receiving unit and the other part as a transport unit, whereby the transport unit for the coaxial lines is pressed onto the coaxial line placed in the coaxial line receiving unit by means of contact pressure. The coaxial line receiving unit is simultaneously designed as a displacement unit and is moved synchronously with the transport unit. The thickness of the coaxial line receiving unit is designed to be lower than the distance between at least two adjacent rows of contacts, <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets</b> of a coaxial connector, thus pe rmitting the assembly of coaxial connectors by the withdrawability of the coaxial line receiving unit, said coaxial connectors having several contacts, <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets</b> arranged in rows above each othe...|$|R
50|$|Connectors usually {{consist of}} (i) a mating pair (plug and receptacle) each {{equipped}} with male (<b>pin)</b> <b>or</b> female (<b>socket)</b> contacts; note {{that at least}} one of the connector halves, or its contacts, should be floating to minimize mechanical stresses.|$|R
50|$|The D-sub {{series of}} {{connectors}} {{was introduced by}} Cannon in 1952. Cannon's part-numbering system uses D as the prefix for the whole series, followed by one of A, B, C, D, or E denoting the shell size, followed {{by the number of}} <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets,</b> followed by either P (plug <b>or</b> <b>pins)</b> <b>or</b> S (<b>socket)</b> denoting the gender of the part. Each shell size usually (see below for exceptions) corresponds to a certain number of <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> sockets: A with 15, B with 25, C with 37, D with 50, and E with 9. For example, DB-25 denotes a D-sub with a 25-position shell size and a 25-position contact configuration. The contacts in each row of these connectors are spaced 326/3000 of an inch apart, or approximately 0.1087 in, and the rows are spaced 0.112 in apart; the pins in the two rows are offset by half the distance between adjacent contacts in a row. This spacing is called normal density. The suffixes M and F (for male and female) are sometimes used instead of the original P and S for plug and socket.|$|R
50|$|A D-sub {{contains}} {{two or more}} parallel rows of <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets</b> usually surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support, ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector <b>or</b> <b>socket.</b> The socket's shield fits tightly inside the plug's shield. Panel mounted connectors usually have threaded nuts that accept screws on the cable end connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a cable end connector if {{it is expected to}} connect to another cable end (see the male DE-9 pictured). When screened cables are used, the shields are connected to the overall screens of the cables. This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole cable and connector system.|$|R
40|$|A {{protective}} cover assembly {{for an end}} of a cable connector having a cable housing that encloses a plurality of connective <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> <b>sockets</b> and that satisfies all requirements for space applications. A connector body flange is formed at the extremity of a cable and is positioned so that it may register with a corresponding connector body flange {{on the end of}} a companion cable to which a connection is to be made, one cable end having cable lead pins and the companion cable end having lead sockets with which the pins register. A latch mechanism having a latch housing is received in the connector body flange and a crank connected to a manually rotatable cap actuates a spring-loaded latch element that is engageable with a connector body flange to secure or to release the cover assembly with the simple twisting motion of the cap, thereby simplifying the task of effecting coupling and decoupling of the cable ends...|$|R
50|$|Like most {{integrated}} circuits {{of the period}} 1963-1990, commercial TTL devices are usually packaged in dual in-line packages (DIPs), usually with 14 to 24 <b>pins,</b> for through-hole <b>or</b> <b>socket</b> mounting. The DIPs were usually made of epoxy plastic (PDIP) for commercial-grade parts or of ceramic (CDIP) for military-grade parts.|$|R
25|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} is one which {{suddenly}} makes the vacuum tube unusable. A {{crack in the}} glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> impacts; tube <b>sockets</b> must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.|$|R
50|$|Higher voltage {{transmission}} lines usually use modular suspension insulator designs. The wires are suspended from a 'string' of identical disc-shaped insulators that attach {{to each other}} with metal clevis <b>pin</b> <b>or</b> ball and <b>socket</b> links. The advantage of this design is that insulator strings with different breakdown voltages, for use with different line voltages, can be constructed by using different numbers of the basic units. Also, {{if one of the}} insulator units in the string breaks, it can be replaced without discarding the entire string.|$|R

5000|$|To make {{it easier}} to {{identify}} individual conductors in a cable; ribbon-cable manufacturers introduced rainbow ribbon cable, which uses a repeating pattern of colors borrowed from the standard resistor color code (Brown is <b>pin</b> 1 <b>or</b> <b>pin</b> 11 <b>or</b> <b>pin</b> 21, etc. Red is <b>pin</b> 2 <b>or</b> <b>pin</b> 12 <b>or</b> <b>pin</b> 22, etc.).

40|$|Abstract: Introduced {{gearless}} {{power transmission}} arrangement used for skew shafts. In this transmission system no. of <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> links used must be odd [...] 3, 5, 7, 9 … [...] & centers of any two <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> links hole {{must not be}} on that line which represent the diameter of shaft. If more <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> links used motion will be smoother, but increase in no. of <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> links not {{at the cost of}} strength of shaft. <b>Pins</b> <b>or</b> links are fixed (may be permanent of temporary) in the drilled holes at the both shaft ends due to which motion is transferred. The dimensions of the <b>pins</b> <b>or</b> links and angle for the all pins are given very precisely, holes drilled very accurately. Proposed arrangement used for skew shafts at any angle & if there is a need we can change the angle between shafts during motion or during intermittent motion with any profile of shafts having rotational motion along its own axis. Working of this arrangement is very smooth & use very effectively with very minimum amount of power losses...|$|R
