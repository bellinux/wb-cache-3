500|$|According to Consumer Reports in December 2011, the Chevrolet Volt {{fuel cost}} in {{electric}} mode was 3.8¢/mile, while the Nissan Leaf had {{a cost of}} 3.5¢/mi. The Volt's higher cost per mile was attributed to its heavier weight.

When comparing the Volt in range-extended mode with the four most fuel efficient gasoline-powered cars as tested by the magazine, the plug-in hybrid had a cost of 12.5¢/mi (using premium gasoline) while the Toyota Prius had a cost of 8.6¢/mi., the Honda Civic Hybrid 9.5¢/mi., the Toyota Corolla 11.9¢/mi., and the Hyundai Elantra 13.1¢/mi.

50|$|The beam tetrode {{was invented}} in Britain by two EMI engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, {{as an attempt to}} {{circumvent}} the power pentode, whose patent was owned by Philips. It was patented in 1933.Although the beam-plates (when present) could be counted as a fifth electrode (as in a pentode), this type of tube is nevertheless classified as a tetrode, perhaps to underline the difference in principle from that employed in true pentodes, which rely upon the effect of a suppressor grid. Beam tetrodes were widely used as audio power amplifying tubes in consumer and industrial electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. Low <b>power</b> <b>consumer</b> beam tetrodes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio power amplifier devices such as tube guitar amplifiers; the KT66 and KT88 are popular examples in audio equipment, while QY4-400 is an example having 400W anode dissipation, capable of applications in radio transmitters up to 100 MHz.

40|$|Abstract.
