5000|$|The statute says {{little about}} the {{substantive}} standards for judging a notice of contest. [...] Under the FCEA, the candidate contesting the election must file a notice of contest within thirty days of state certification of the election results. [...] The only substantive requirements for the notice are that the contestant must “state grounds sufficient to change {{the result of the}} election” and must “claim the right to the contestee’s seat” in Congress. [...] The contestee then has thirty days either to file an answer or to move for dismissal. The burden of proof rests with the contestant, who “must overcome the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> an election, and its results, evidenced by the certificate of election presented by the contestee.” [...] The FCEA also sets forth procedures for an adversarial system of taking depositions and other discovery. Traditionally, the Committee on House Administration appoints a bipartisan three-member task force to investigate and report on an FCEA proceeding. [...] Generally, the task force investigates the contest and makes a recommendation to the Committee on House Administration, which then issues a report and sends a resolution to the full House regarding the disposition of the contest. “The committee may recommend, and the House may approve by a simple majority vote, a decision affirming the right of the contestee to the seat, may seat the contestant, or find that neither party is entitled to be finally seated and declare a vacancy.” ...|$|R

He emphasised the distinction between an act which is entered into for an improper purpose (which is not beyond the capacity of a company, or void) and an act which is wholly outside a company's objects (and hence ultra vires and void). However, it was unenforceable because British Steel, with knowledge of the irregularity, could not rely on a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>regularity</b> in the company’s internal management.

50|$|Traditionally, {{notarial}} instruments {{trigger a}} præsumptio veritatis et solemnitatis entailing two consequences—regularity and probativity. First, being an official act, a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>regularity</b> {{attaches to the}} instrument, meaning all prescribed formalities have been carried out, including the reading over of the instrument. Second, a notarial instrument is self-authenticating and probative, i.e., it constitutes full proof of the agreement it contains, as against the parties, their heirs, and successors. It also means the notary's firsthand (ex propriis sensibus) narrations of fact are conclusively presumed true and correct, whereas secondhand narrations (appearers' representations) are merely assertio notarii which are rebuttably presumed valid. While all notarial instruments are official documents, they are not all necessarily public; most instruments are in public form, meaning an original is retained in publica custodia by the notary {{in his or her}} protocol or recorded with a public registry, but some are in private form, that is, a single original is issued directly to the appearer(s). In either case, the appearer always walks away with an instrument that is self-executing, that is, it requires no further implementing action to be effective and enforceable, just like a court order. Finally, notarial instruments have a fixed effective or signature date (data certa) that cannot be ante- or postdated, or left blank and filled in after signing.|$|E

40|$|There has {{recently}} been a proliferation of case law dealing with potential inroads into the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in the criminal law of England and Wales, {{in the light of}} article 6 (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The first is how the courts should address the question <b>of</b> when the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is interfered with. The second {{is the extent to which}} interference with the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence may be justified on the grounds of proportionality.

40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized. It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R
50|$|In his dissenting opinion, Justice Villarama {{argued that}} the claim of Webb {{that he could not}} have {{committed}} the crime because he left for the United States on March 9, 1991 and returned to the Philippines only on October 26, 1992 was correctly rejected by the Regional Trial Court and Court of Appeals. Given the financial resources and political influence of his family, it was not unlikely that Webb could have traveled back to the Philippines before June 29-30, 1991 and then departed for the US again, and returning to the Philippines in October 1992. Webb's travel documents and other paper trail of his stay in the US are unreliable proof of his absence in the Philippines {{at the time of the}} commission of the crime charged. Webb's reliance on the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>regularity</b> of official functions, stressing the fact that the US-INS certifications are official documents, is misplaced. The presumption leaned on is disputable and can be overcome by evidence to the contrary. In this case, the existence of an earlier negative report on the NIIS record on file concerning the entry of appellant Webb into and his exit from the US on March 9, 1991 and October 26, 1992, respectively, had raised serious doubt on the veracity and accuracy of the subsequently issued second certification dated August 31, 1995 which is based merely on a computer print-out of his alleged entry on March 9, 1991 and departure on October 26, 1992. Villarama noted that the alleged Passport, Passenger Manifest of United Airlines Flight and United Airline ticket of accused Webb offered in evidence were mere photocopies of an alleged original, which were never presented. He adds, this Court takes judicial notice of reported irregularities and tampering of passports in the years prior to the recent issuance by the Department of Foreign Affairs(DFA) of machine-readable passports.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Marshall {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court, stating that [...] "When constitutional error calls into question the objectivity of those charged with bringing a defendant to judgment, a reviewing court can neither indulge a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>regularity</b> nor evaluate the resulting harm. Accordingly, when the trial judge is discovered to have had some basis for rendering a biased judgment, his actual motivations are hidden from review, and we must presume that the process was impaired. Similarly, when a petite jury has been selected upon improper criteria or has been exposed to prejudicial publicity, we have required reversal of the conviction because the effect of the violation cannot be ascertained. Like these fundamental flaws, which never have been thought harmless, discrimination in the grand jury undermines the structural integrity of the criminal tribunal itself, and is not amenable to harmless-error review". Marshall then went on to say [...] "The opinion of the Court in Mitchell ably presented other justifications, based on the necessity for vindicating Fourteenth Amendment rights, supporting a policy of automatic reversal in cases of grand jury discrimination...The six years since Mitchell have given us no reason to doubt the continuing truth of that observation." [...] The opinion also was against adopting a time limit for habeas corpus and regarding the stare decisis doctrine, Marshall said that [...] "its lesson is that every successful proponent of overruling precedent has borne the heavy burden of persuading the Court that changes in society or in the law dictate that the values served by stare decisis yield in favor of a greater objective. In the case of grand jury discrimination, we have been offered {{no reason to believe that}} any such metamorphosis has rendered the Court's long commitment to a rule of reversal outdated, ill-founded, unworkable, or otherwise legitimately vulnerable to serious reconsideration." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maryland {{state courts}} may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either errors of fact or errors of law. The Maryland Court of Appeals {{provided}} the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Maryland (Citations and quotes removed): A convicted petitioner {{is entitled to}} relief through the common law writ of coram nobis if and only if::# The petitioner challenges a conviction based on constitutional, jurisdictional, or fundamental grounds, whether factual or legal;:# The petitioner rebuts the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>regularity</b> that attaches to the criminal case;:# The petitioner faces significant collateral consequences from the conviction;:# The issue as to the alleged error has not been waived or [...] "finally litigated in a prior proceeding, absent intervening changes in the applicable law"; :# The petitioner is not entitled to another statutory or common law remedy (for example, the petitioner cannot be incarcerated in a State prison or on parole or probation, as the petitioner likely could then petition for post-conviction relief.)In 2015, the Maryland Code (2014 Supp.), § 8-401 of the Criminal Procedure Article ("CP § 8-401") clarified that the failure to seek an appeal {{in a criminal case}} may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of coram nobis.A writ denied in a lower state court may be appealed. A writ of coram nobis remains a civil action in Maryland, independent of the underlying action from which it arose. As a coram nobis case is an independent civil action, an appeal from a final judgment in such an action is authorized by the broad language of the general appeals statute, Code § 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. An appeal under the general appeals statutes would lie from a final trial court judgment in a coram nobis proceeding. Although the Post Conviction Procedure Act precludes appeals in coram nobis cases brought by an incarcerated person [...] "challenging the validity of incarceration under sentence of imprisonment," [...] neither the Post Conviction Procedure Act nor any other statute which has been called to our attention restricts the right of appeal for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation, who is suddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence of his or her conviction, and who can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds. Such person should be able to file a motion for coram nobis relief regardless of whether the alleged infirmity in the conviction is considered an error of fact or an error of law.|$|E

5000|$|Puno SC summit {{called for}} truce, talks with insurgents, as the two-day summit ended: [...] "Let us rather {{engage in the}} {{conspiracy}} of hope…and hope for peace." [...] Puno said he would forward the summit's recommendation to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the Senate and House of Representatives. [...] "In the clash of arms, the laws are silent. We need to reduce violence, create conditions conducive to less violence based on the rule of law", Associate Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales said in the report. One group recommended that Republic Act 9372 or the Human Security Act be declared unconstitutional. All the groups agreed that insurgency {{is not only a}} military but also a political problem and said a ceasefire would be a sign of the government's goodwill and sincerity in forging genuine peace agreements with all rebel groups. They also recommended the use of the third-party approach to peace negotiations. Among the other recommendations of the summit are: -- for the Supreme Court to reexamine the case of Umil v. Ramos, which said rebellion and related crimes are continuing offenses, thus allowing the warrantless arrest of suspects; to carefully study the possibility of creating a new offense for the killings and assaults on journalists, judges and activities, akin to the law penalizing violence against woman and children; the establishment of sanctuaries where victims and witnesses can take refuge; for the President to certify and the Senate to ratify the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, and Protocol 1 of the Geneva Convention, which addresses the issue of making civilian populations or individual civilians the object of attacks; the enactment of a law addressing and accurately defining extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances; a study {{on the use of the}} writ of Amparo for greater protection of Constitutional rights, and a more creative and resourceful application of the writ of habeas corpus; suspending the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>regularity</b> in the performance of official duty in cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearance; studying whether the government can continue invoking its immunity from suspension in cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances; allowing petitioners for the writ of habeas corpus to seek court orders to search the premises of police and military camps and stations in the presence of a representative from the Commission on Human Rights; requiring the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to take DNA samples of unidentified cadavers for preservation in the Philippine National Police laboratory; the adoption of international standards of command responsibility; the enhancement of moral, ethical and constitutional values that put a premium on tolerance and the rule of law.|$|E
40|$|The hearsay {{exception}} for 2 ̆ 2 public records 2 ̆ 2 was recognized at common law {{and has been}} further developed in most jurisdictions by statute. The reliability of public records is said to derive from the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>regularity</b> and accuracy that attends the recording of events by public officials. As with the hearsay {{exception for}} recordsmade in the regular course of a private business, the reliability of many public records is enhanced by the routine and repetitive circumstancesunder which such records are made. An additional justificationfor the admission of public records is public convenience: If government employees are continually required to testify in court with respect to matters they have witnessed or {{in which they have}} participated in the line of duty, the efficiency of public administration will suffer. It has also been observed that a public official 2 ̆ 7 s writtenreport of an event may be more reliable than his memory, as revealed through in-court testimony, because of the volume and repetitiousness of his work. As a result, there may be no appreciable benefit to the factfinding process by requiring the courtroom appearance and cross-examination of the public official. Accordingly, public records have generally been held admissible regardless of the public employee 2 ̆ 7 s availability to testify. If a report were prepared by government agents in anticiaption of a criminal prosecution, however, the foregoing assumptions concerning the inherent reliability of the report as evidence against the accused are subject to serious dispute because of the adversarial posture of the parties. Moreover, the use of such records in some cases may contravene the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. In enacting rule 803 (8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Congress intended to minimize such problems by excluding from the public records exception, in respect to a criminal prosecution, reports of 2 ̆ 2 matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel and factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law. Courts have not, however, reached a consensus as to the proper scope of the exclusions. In this regard, several significant interrelated issues have arisen. One problem is whether the exclusions should be given literal effect or whether some degree of flexibility may properly be read into the rule to permit admissibility in certain cases. A second problem is whether rule 803 (8) exclusively governs the hearsay status of public records or whether admissibility may be premised on other hearsay exceptions. Additional issues include whether an objectionable report may be rendered admissible by the courtroom appearance of its author, and whether it may properly serve as the basis of an expert witness 2 ̆ 7 trial testimony. This Article analyzes both the conceptual background and the legislative history of rule 803 (8) 2 ̆ 7 s exclusions in order to suggest the proper approach to these issues...|$|E
