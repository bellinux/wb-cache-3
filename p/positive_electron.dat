5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits <b>positive</b> <b>electron</b> affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E

40|$|A {{determination}} of the specific ionization of cosmic-ray particles, first, by a count {{of the number of}} drops per cm along cosmic-ray tracks on cloud-chamber photographs and, second, by measurements of the energy loss in lead has shown that the great bulk of the cosmic-ray particles of positive charge are <b>positive</b> <b>electrons.</b> The primary ionization was found to be about 31 ion-pairs per cm in air at S. T. P., but the total energy loss represents about 120 ion pairs per cm in air. Approximately the same values of specific ionization were found for the positives as for the negatives. <b>Positive</b> and negative <b>electrons</b> were found to occur in nearly equal numbers and to have similar distributions in energy. Energy distribution curves are given for the positives and negatives. A brief description of the experimental procedure is given, and several track photographs are shown. In view of the discovery that hard gamma-rays of Th C′′ give rise to positives and negatives in pairs, similar to the effects found in cosmic-ray studies, it is concluded that the absorption of the Th C′′ rays {{is due in part to}} that by free negative electrons and in part to a nuclear effect which results in the production of pairs of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>electrons,</b> the former effect accounting for the greater part of the absorption of the Th C′′ rays. The symmetry in occurrence of the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>electrons</b> found in the cosmic-ray studies shows that the nuclear effect which results in the production of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>electrons</b> in pairs represents the predominant part of the absorption for the range of energies as high as those of the cosmic rays and that the absorption by free negative electrons is relatively small...|$|R

5000|$|In the example, {{the lower}} roller (6) is metal, which picks {{negative}} charge off the inner {{surface of the}} belt. The lower comb (7) develops a high electric field at its points that also becomes large enough to ionize air molecules. In this case the electrons are attracted to the comb and positive air ions neutralize negative charge on the outer surface of the belt, or become attached to the belt. The exact balance of charges on the up-going versus down-going sides of the belt {{will depend on the}} combination of the materials used. In the example, the upward-moving belt must be more positive than the downward-moving belt. As the belt continues to move, a constant [...] "charging current" [...] travels via the belt, and the sphere continues to accumulate positive charge until the rate that charge is being lost (through leakage and corona discharges) equals the charging current. The larger the sphere and the farther it is from ground, the higher will be its peak potential. In the example, the wand with metal sphere (8) is connected to ground, as is the lower comb (7); electrons are drawn up from ground due to the attraction by the positive sphere, and when the electric field is great enough (see below) the air breaks {{in the form of an}} electrical discharge spark (9).

40|$|AbstractThe {{ionization}} {{mechanism in}} the novel atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (APPI-MS) in negative ion mode was studied thoroughly by the analysis of seven compounds in 17 solvent systems.

Other theoretical concepts that use electron affinity include electronic chemical potential and chemical hardness.

50|$|However, {{tunneling}} {{does require}} {{that there be}} an empty level of the same energy as the electron for the electron to tunnel into {{on the other side}} of the barrier. It is because of this restriction that the tunneling current can be related to the density of available or filled states in the sample. The current due to an applied voltage V (assume tunneling occurs sample to tip) depends on two factors: 1) the number of electrons between Ef and eV in the sample, and 2) the number among them which have corresponding free states to tunnel into {{on the other side of}} the barrier at the tip. The higher the density of available states the greater the tunneling current. When V is <b>positive,</b> <b>electrons</b> in the tip tunnel into empty states in the sample; for a negative bias, electrons tunnel out of occupied states in the sample into the tip.|$|R
50|$|Thermal energy {{appears as}} {{the motion of}} atoms and molecules: the higher the {{temperature}} {{of a collection of}} particles, the greater is their velocity and the more violent are their collisions.

When this began to happen, protons combined into deuterium and then helium, with some protons changing in the process to neutrons (plus positrons, <b>positive</b> <b>electrons,</b> which combine with electrons and are both destroyed). This released nuclear energy now keeps up the high temperature of the Sun's core, and the heat also keeps the gas pressure high, keeping the Sun at its present size, and stopping gravity from compressing it any more.
