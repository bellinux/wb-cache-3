The proposed model has been employed to size and design the test machine, named VAMPIRE and equipped with a six-bladed radial impeller, a vaneless diffuser and a single-spiral volute. The pumping and suction performance of the machine have been determined {{in a series of}} tests in Alta’s Cavitating Pump Rotordynamic Test Facility (CPRTF). The measured pumping characteristic proved to be in excellent agreement with the model predictions, thus effectively validating the design model.

40|$|To {{fill the}} lack of {{literature}} in the numerical study of Positive Displacement (PD) pumps in cavitating condition, a comprehensive and transient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of a PD <b>pump,</b> simulating the <b>cavitation</b> arising during the suction stroke, was created. The “full” cavitation model was utilised to study its capability on PD <b>pumps</b> <b>cavitation.</b> A set of three plunger speeds were simulated. Using the highest plunger speed an assessment {{was made of the}} effect of 1. 5, 3, 4. 5 and 15 ppm of air mass fraction on <b>pump</b> performance and <b>cavitation.</b> An experimental test rig, replicating the CFD model, was designed and built in order to validate the numerical model and find its weaknesses. CFD modelled, in a consistent way, the fluid dynamics phenomena related to cavitation (chamber pressure approaching the vapour pressure, the vaporization/condensation and the pressure spike occurrence {{at the end of the}} suction stroke marking the end of cavitation). On the other hand the CFD pressure trends calculated appeared stretched along the time axis with respect to the experimental data and this highlighted issues in the multiphase and cavitation models: the vaporization/condensation rate calculated by CFD did not follow the real dynamics correctly because the non-condensable gas expansion was overestimated. This was seen when comparing the CFD/experiments where the simulated pressure drop gradient, at the beginning of the suction stroke and the pressure peaks as the valve closed, exhibited a delay in their occurrence. The simulation results were sensitive to the dissolved air mass fraction as the delay depended on the amount of air dissolved in the water. Although the influence of the air mass fraction was considered consistent, the 3 ppm CFD case was the closest to the experiment results whereas the analyst expected the 15 ppm case to be more accurate...|$|R
50|$|A {{submersible}} pump (or sub pump, electric {{submersible pump}} (ESP)) is a device {{which has a}} hermetically sealed motor close-coupled to the pump body. The whole assembly is submerged in the fluid to be pumped. The main advantage {{of this type of}} pump is that it prevents <b>pump</b> <b>cavitation,</b> a problem associated with a high elevation difference between pump and the fluid surface. Submersible pumps push fluid to the surface as opposed to jet pumps having to pull fluids. Submersibles are more efficient than jet pumps.|$|E
50|$|Air, {{or other}} gas, may collect within plumbing. For water {{delivery}} systems to taps and basins, this air is flushed {{through with the}} water flow and does not cause a problem. In a closed heating system though, it has no other means of escape and builds up. An air bubble trapped within a radiator means that no hot water circulates in the upper part and so the heating power of the radiator is reduced. If air is trapped within the boiler this may cause <b>pump</b> <b>cavitation</b> or boiling and overheating within the heat exchanger.|$|E
50|$|Another {{case where}} {{two-phase}} flow can occur is in <b>pump</b> <b>cavitation.</b> Here a pump is operating {{close to the}} vapor pressure of the fluid being pumped. If pressure drops further, which can happen locally near the vanes for the pump, for example, then a phase change can occur and gas will {{be present in the}} pump. Similar effects can also occur on marine propellors; wherever it occurs, it is a serious problem for designers. When the vapor bubble collapses, it can produce very large pressure spikes, which over time will cause damage on the propellor or turbine.|$|E
40|$|In {{professional}} warewashing machines, as {{for example}} the model of Electrolux Rack Type, the working conditions of the pump {{are affected by the}} operating fluid properties, which are different from those of pure water. In fact, the actual trend in this kind of professional appliances is to reduce both energy consumption and time needed for cleaning process: this involves short washing cycles conducted at low temperatures with a solution of water and highly concentrated chemistry. Detergents contain different components and additives, as polymers and surfactants, which can affect the performance of the <b>pump,</b> including <b>cavitation</b> inception conditions. Cavitation leads to flow instabilities, affecting pump performances and inducing an increment in the level of vibrations and noise. While cavitation phenomena in Newtonian fluids is well known, particularly as far as pure water is concerned, in literature there are also various studies on cavitating flows in presence of diluted solutions of polymers additives in water, but only few studies are available regarding the effect of detergent components on <b>pumps</b> <b>cavitation</b> and, in general, on pumps performances.

The technique of using 2 -phase accumulators for loop control was first applied in satellite cooling. Two accumulator controlled loops have been successfully developed at NIKHEF. One CO 2 loop for cooling the AMS particle detector which will study cosmic radiation onboard the International Space Station and a second CO 2 loop is developed for cooling the LHCb-VELO particle detector which will study CP-violation at the CERN laboratory in Geneva (Switzerland).

It is therefore possible to create as much sub-cooling for the pump as desired. It is even possible to operate the loop in single phase, a feature which turns out to be very convenient during start-up and cooling-down procedures.

Thus, as available knowledge and information is obtained incompletely or inexactly from the measurements; an exploration into the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to overcome these uncertainties and limitations was done. A methodology integrating the feature extraction efficiency of the wavelet transform with the classification capabilities of neural networks is developed for signal classification {{in the context of}} detecting incipient system disturbances. The synergistic effects of wavelets and neural networks present more strength and less weakness than either technique taken alone. A wavelet feature extractor is developed to form concise feature vectors for neural network inputs. The feature vectors are calculated from wavelet coefficients to reduce redundancy and computational expense. During this procedure, the statistical features based on the fractal concept to the wavelet coefficients play a role as crucial key in the wavelet feature extractor.

40|$|Most {{types of}} {{problems}} which arise {{in connection with}} the use of a hydrofoil operating in water can be solved simply by treating it as an airfoil operating in air. For this purpose, use can be made of the great wealth of theoretical information and experimental data which can be found in the literature. There are, however, regimes of operation of the hydrofoil which are not duplicated by the airfoil excepting possibly under very special conditions. These regimes are identified by one of the following: (a) cavitation (b) ventilation (c) proximity to a free surface Cavitation is characterized by the presence of water vapor bubbles at regions in the flow where the pressure is less than the vapor pressure corresponding to the existing water temperature. Although most commonly observed on the blades of propellers or on the vanes of axial flow <b>pumps,</b> <b>cavitation</b> can also be present on fins used to stabilize high speed underwater missiles, on hydrofoils used as lifting surfaces, or on support struts of various kinds. Allied to this problem is ventilation, a condition which is like cavitation in that it results in discontinuities in density in the fluid surrounding the hydrofoil, although the initiating mechanism is fundamentally different and the lighter medium is air or gas instead of water vapor. A third type of flow regime which may be very important is that associated with a hydrofoil which approaches or intersects a water-vapor or water-gas interface. In this case the flow must satisfy the constant pressure boundary condition on that interface. The effect of gravity may or may not be important, and the hydrofoil can be oriented in any direction. A lifting hydrofoil would most likely be parallel, or nearly parallel, to the water surface, whereas a support strut or a stabilizing fin would inter sect the water surface nearly at right angles. It is this last mentioned type of ope ration which is investigated in this report, and which, as will be seen later, also implies a study of the effects of air ventilation. Among the specific fundamental questions which arise in considering a vertical hydrofoil piercing a flat water surface and which is at an angle of attack to the flow, are the following: (a) How does the presence of the air-water interface affect the apparent aspect ratio of the hydrofoil as compared with its geometrical value? (b) What is the effect of air ventilation on the value of cross-force developed by the hydrofoil, and what observations can be made regarding the inception of this phenomenon? Since no previous hydrofoil studies had been performed in the Free Surface Water Tunnel, it was also of interest to determine the suitability of that facility and its associated equipment for doing work of this kind. On the other hand, the investigation was intended only as a preliminary one and was, therefore, undertaken with limited resources...|$|R
