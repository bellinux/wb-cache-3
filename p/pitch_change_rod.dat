Investigation showed that the failure occurred due to pitting corrosion on the internal surface of the rod. Chlorine {{was found to be}} responsible for promoting pitting corrosion. Evidences suggest that the corrodants were carried through the lubricant. Hence contamination of the lubricant with chlorine ion appears to be the most probable reason for the failure. In view of this, it is recommended that the oil drained out from the TGB be chemically analyzed to look for chlorine and water, present, if any. No material abnormalities were found responsible for the failure...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} examines optimization {{methods for}} minimizing undesired vibrations in a helicopter. An iterative weighting system for adjusting emphasis of different flight conditions is implemented {{as an extension}} of current weighting schemes and performance results are discussed. Next, a cascaded method of least squares optimization is applied to incorporate minimization of vibrations at higher harmonics. A real coded genetic algorithm to prescribe integer-valued rotor modifications is then executed. Optimization methods are simulated using a linear sensitivity model to demonstrate the effects of rotor adjustments, specifically modifications in <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> <b>rod,</b> outboard tabs, and hub weights on the Sikorsky S- 76 C++ aircraft. Applying an iterative flight condition weighting scheme with integer-bounded rotor adjustments while extending the range of harmonic frequencies included in the analysis develops a robust prescription of rotor adjustments. By virtue of their integer-based properties, these prescribed adjustments are more realistic and eliminate previously occurring loss of accuracy in implementation. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{subjective}} tinnitus {{is characterized}} by abnormal neuronal synchronization in the central auditory system. As shown in a controlled clinical trial, acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation causes a significant relief of tinnitus symptoms along with a significant decrease of pathological oscillatory activity in a network comprising auditory and non-auditory brain areas, which is often accompanied with a significant tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Here we studied if the tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> correlates with a reduction of tinnitus loudness and/or annoyance as assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) scores. Furthermore, we studied if the changes of the pattern of brain synchrony in tinnitus patients induced by 12 weeks of CR therapy depend {{on whether or not}} the patients undergo a pronounced tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Therefore, we applied standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) to EEG recordings from two groups of patients with a sustained CR-induced relief of tinnitus symptoms with and without tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> We found that absolute changes of VAS loudness and VAS annoyance scores significantly correlate with the modulus, i. e., the absolute value, of the tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Moreover, as opposed to patients with small or no <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> we found a significantly stronger decrease in gamma power in patients with pronounced tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> in right parietal cortex (Brodmann area, BA 40), right frontal cortex (BA 9, 46), left temporal cortex (BA 22, 42), and left frontal cortex (BA 4, 6), combined with a significantly stronger increase of alpha (10 - 12 Hz) activity in the right and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA 32, 24). In addition, we revealed a significantly lower functional connectivity in the gamma band between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46) and the right ACC (BA 32) after 12 weeks of CR therapy in patients with pronounced <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Our results indicate a substantial, CR-induced reduction of tinnitus-related auditory binding in a pitch processing network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study aims to {{identify}} the neural substrate involved in prosodic pitch processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging {{was used to test}} the premise that prosody pitch processing is primarily subserved by the right cortical hemisphere. Two experimental paradigms were used, firstly pairs of spoken sentences, where the only variation was a single internal phrase <b>pitch</b> <b>change,</b> and secondly, a matched condition utilizing <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> within analogous tone-sequence phrases. This removed the potential confounder of lexical evaluation. fMRI images were obtained using these paradigms. Results Activation was significantly greater within the right frontal and temporal cortices during the tone-sequence stimuli relative to the sentence stimuli. Conclusion This study showed that <b>pitch</b> <b>changes,</b> stripped of lexical information, are mainly processed by the right cerebral hemisphere, whilst the processing of analogous, matched, lexical <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> is preferentially left sided. These findings, showing hemispherical differentiation of processing based on stimulus complexity, are in accord with a 'task dependent' hypothesis of pitch processing. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{complex tone}} {{composed}} of only higher-order harmonics typically elicits a pitch percept {{equivalent to the}} tone's missing fundamental frequency (f 0). When judging the direction of residue <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> between two such tones, however, listeners may have completely opposite perceptual experiences depending on whether they are biased to perceive changes based on the overall spectrum or the missing f 0 (harmonic spacing). Individual differences in residue <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> judgments are reliable and {{have been associated with}} musical experience and functional neuroanatomy. Tone languages put greater pitch processing demands on their speakers than non-tone languages, and we investigated whether these lifelong differences in linguistic pitch processing affect listeners' bias for residue pitch. We asked native tone language speakers and native English speakers to perform a pitch judgment task for two tones with missing fundamental frequencies. Given tone pairs with ambiguous <b>pitch</b> <b>changes,</b> listeners were asked to judge the direction of <b>pitch</b> <b>change,</b> where the direction of their response indicated whether they attended to the overall spectrum (exhibiting a spectral bias) or the missing f 0 (exhibiting a fundamental bias). We found that tone language speakers are significantly more likely to perceive <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> based on the missing f 0 than English speakers. These results suggest that tone-language speakers' privileged experience with linguistic pitch fundamentally tunes their basic auditory processing...|$|R

40|$|This paper focuses {{specifically}} on {{the control of the}} propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanisms and their associated dynamics. The subject of this article is restricted to the mechanisms using a hydraulic single acting actuator. They function asymmetrically and are subject to important varying external loads under the full flight envelope. This phenomenon has an impact on their dynamic response. The question of the dynamics of these systems is rarely dealt with because, usually for aircraft applications, there is no real requirement for propeller pitch dynamic control. But, in the case of some applications, such as the Eurocopter X 3, this dynamic control aspect and the safety aspect of the propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanism are particularly important, because this mechanism is fully involved in aircraft safety, control and handling qualities. Firstly, this paper gives an explanation of the phenomena applied to the propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanism and their contributions to its dynamic response. Then, a model of the dynamic response is proposed. Finally, an experimental identification of the <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanism dynamics concludes this article.

40|$|As {{auditory}} displays {{become more}} common it is increasingly {{important to understand the}} perception of complex and dynamic auditory stimuli and how the information contained in the various dimensions of these stimuli influences performance. In the present study listeners made keypress responses to dynamic sound stimuli which started high or low in pitch and became higher or lower in pitch during each trial. The results showed that <b>pitch</b> and <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> interacted in an asymmetrical manner, with pitch information intruding more on judgments of <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> than vice versa. Neither <b>pitch</b> nor <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> interacted with vertically arranged responses to produce the strong spatial S-R compatibility effects that were expected based on previous research and on descriptions of pitch in everyday language.

Adaptive-tracking procedures established separate thresholds for both of these abilities in musically untrained participants across nine age-groups (5 -, 6 -, 7 -, 8 -, 9 -, 10 -, 11 -, 13 -year-olds, and adults). The use of an odd-one-out paradigm avoided the need for participants to use semantic labels when determining the direction of a <b>pitch</b> <b>change,</b> and screening of the adaptive-staircase profile plots permitted the exclusion of inattentive performers. Although adults achieved equivalent thresholds for pitch-change detection and pitch-direction discrimination, there were age-related improvements for pitch-direction discrimination but not pitch-change detection in {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 11 years.

40|$|Previous ERP {{studies have}} shown that musicians detect a <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> in spoken {{sentences}} better than non-musicians in both native (French, Schön et al., 2004) and unfamiliar (Portuguese, Marques et al., 2007) language. The aim {{of the present study was}} to further investigate differences between musicians and non-musicians in processing <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> in spoken sentences. To study the effects of familiarity of intonational contour and of the presence of meaningful context, behavioral and electrophysiological data from Italian musicians and non-musicians were compared in a pitch incongruity detection task using sentences in the native (Italian) and foreign (French) language and in jabberwocky (meaningless sentences formed by pseudowords). Moreover, to examine whether these differences depend on enhanced auditory sensitivity to pitch, the frequency discrimination threshold (FDT) for tones was obtained using a psychophysical procedure. Musicians were more accurate than non-musicians in detecting small <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> in all languages showing a smaller response bias, as well as much lower FDTs than non-musicians. The ERP data revealed shorter latencies of a late positivity over parietal sites in musicians than in non-musicians for weak and strong incongruities. Overall results confirmed musicians' advantage in detection of subtle <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> not only with tones but also with speech sentences in both native and unfamiliar languages.

40|$|People with {{congenital}} amusia {{have difficulty}} with melodic contour processing, even when the <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> involved exceed their threshold for pitch discrimination. Patel et al. (2005) proposed the “Melodic Contour Deafness Hypothesis”, which posits that congenital amusia results from insensitivity to the direction of pitch movement rather than impaired processing of <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> detection. Given that melodic processing requires both accurate perception of <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> direction {{as well as the}} capacity to represent a succession of contour changes, it is unclear whether impairments in melodic contour processing observed in individuals with congenital amusia occur at a perceptual stage or at a stage of representing a contour pattern in memory. To disentangle these two stages, the present study examined cross-modal mapping using an audio-visual mismatch detection task. Twelve participants with congenital amusia and 12 matched controls were presented with tone sequences (tonal and atonal) and visual contours that corresponded to the melodic contour of the tones (i. e., sequences of dots that vary in spatial height corresponding to <b>pitch</b> <b>changes).</b> Participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible when they detected an audio-visual mismatch. Compared with control participants, amusic individuals made more errors in both tonal and atonal sequences. The finding suggests that individuals with congenital amusia are impaired in perceiving the up-down pattern of a melody. Furthermore, all participants showed a better performance on tonal sequences than atonal ones. In other words, tonal structure facilitated melodic contour processing. 4 page(s...|$|R

While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, {{it does not seem to}} include speech intonation.

40|$|International audienceNormal {{listeners}} {{are often}} surprisingly poor at processing <b>pitch</b> <b>changes.</b> The neural bases of this difficulty were explored using magnetoencephalography (MEG) by comparing participants who obtained poor thresholds on a pitch-direction task {{with those who}} obtained good thresholds.

In a passive listening task, a mismatch response (MMNm) was identified for pitch-glide direction deviants, with a tendency to be smaller in the poor listeners. The results imply that the difficulties in pitch processing are already apparent during automatic sound processing, and furthermore suggest that left hemisphere auditory regions are used by these listeners to consciously determine the direction of a <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> This is in line with evidence that the left hemisphere has a poor frequency resolution, and implies that normal listeners may use the sub-optimal hemisphere to process <b>pitch</b> <b>changes...</b>|$|R

An alternative way of reconstruction proposed here reveals additional features which should be taken in to account as well. Measurements of prosodic parameters (i. e. pitch range, shape and vowel length) show that tones differ in terms of rate of <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> and duration.
