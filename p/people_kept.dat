5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1859 {{there was}} no {{standard}} colour, although {{there is evidence that}} the lettering and Royal Cypher were sometimes picked out in gold. In 1859, a bronze green colour became standard until 1874. Initially, it was thought that the green colour would be unobtrusive. Too unobtrusive, as it turned out — <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> walking into them. Red became the standard colour in 1874, although ten more years elapsed before every box in the UK had been repainted.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Korean houses can be {{structured}} into an inner wing (안채, anchae) and an outer wing (사랑채, sarangchae). The individual layout largely {{depends on the}} region and the wealth of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the outer wing for receptions, poorer <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> cattle in the sarangchae. The wealthier a family, the larger the house. However, it was forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 kan. A kan is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses.|$|E

Upon winning, she tells them of the legend: [...] "There are Magicite Shards scattered all over the world. It used to be one large Magicite Crystal...But <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> fighting each other over it. So the founder of Mysidia, the great magician Ming-Wu, broke the Crystal into eight pieces. He then scattered the shards to the four winds. He did so to assure later restoration of the Magicite Crystal...when all eight pieces are brought together again." ...|$|E
500|$|Townsend {{became a}} {{defendant}} during his prison term {{in what would}} {{become known as the}} [...] "Great Sedition Trial". The trial arose from [...] Roosevelt's conviction, against advice from his Attorney-General Francis Biddle, that the most vocal in defending Nazi Germany be tried for subversion. On 23 July 1942 Townsend and 27 other Americans were charged under the Smith Act and the Espionage Act with having participated in a German-backed conspiracy to publish seditious literature seeking to undermine the morale of members of the United States military. The indictment cited the following statement of Townsend's, which he had written in 1941 prior to US entry into the war, as proof that he had committed sedition: With a fifth of the earth's <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> under their rule by force, [...] bleat of fighting to liberate subject populations.

2500|$|Cotton became {{dominant}} in the lower South after 1800. [...] After {{the invention of the}} cotton gin, short staple cotton could be grown more widely. [...] This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation, especially in the frontier uplands of Georgia, Alabama {{and other parts of the}} Deep South, as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta. [...] Migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century, when county population figures rose and fell as swells of <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> moving west. [...] The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor, and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South's economy.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{different}} versions {{on how the}} shooting began: some say it began when [...] "Mama Maquín" [...] -an important peasant leader- pushed a soldier who was in her way; others argue that it started because <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> pushing {{trying to get into}} the municipality, which was interpreted by the soldiers as an aggression. The mayor at the time, Walter Overdick, said that [...] "people of the middle of the group pushed those who in front."

2500|$|Before the {{widespread}} urban growth caused by industrialization, <b>people</b> <b>kept</b> dairy cows even {{in urban areas}} and the short time period between production and consumption minimized the disease risk of drinking raw milk. As urban densities increased and supply chains lengthened to the distance from country to city, raw milk (often days old) became recognised {{as a source of}} disease. For example, between 1912 and 1937 some 65,000 people died of tuberculosis contracted from consuming milk in England and Wales alone. Because tuberculosis has a long incubation period in humans, it was difficult to link unpasteurized milk consumption as the cause to the effect of disease. [...] In 1892, chemist Earnest Lederle experimentally inoculated milk from tuberculosis-diseased cows into Guinea pigs, which caused them to develop the disease. [...] In 1910, Lederle, then in the role of Commissioner of Health, introduced mandatory pasteurization of milk in New York city.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{mention of}} {{reservation}} describes the original and, arguably, primary purpose. In the Apology of Justin Martyr, a 2nd-century Christian writer, {{he describes the}} Eucharist ending with the distribution by the deacons to the parishioners [...] "and {{to those who are}} absent, they carry away a portion." [...] Reservation for distribution of the Communion to the sick is mentioned subsequently in the writings of Tertullian, St. Cyprian, and St.Basil. <b>People</b> <b>kept</b> the sacrament in their homes and carried on their person as being a safe place. After the conversion of Constantine in the early 4th century, the more common place for reservation was in a church. [...] Indeed, a Council of Toledo in 480 denounced those who did not immediately consume the sacred species when they received them from the priest at the altar, {{but at the same time}} numerous decrees of synods and penalties entered in penitential books impose upon parish priests the duty of reserving the Blessed Sacrament for the use of the sick and dying, and at the same time of keeping it reverently and securely and providing by frequent renewal against any danger of the corruption of the sacred species.|$|E
