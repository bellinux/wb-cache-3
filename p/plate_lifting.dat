40|$|This thesis explores how {{to develop}} new lifting {{equipment}} for the membrane and filter plates of the VPA (Metso) machine satisfying all the safety requirements. The VPA is a heavy duty machine {{with a number of}} plates, developed for filtration of minerals. The plates must be replaced or removed immediately once the wear has reached a given value or an error has been detected. The new lifting system differs to a great extent from conventional system in which a fiber strap was used; the designed lifting equipment comprises of a variety of parts resulting in a higher capacity to be used ín different situations safer and satisfies the vital requirements such as being a secure and cost-effective method, issued by the customers. Several solution proposals have been developed to offer better proposals before the final candidate has been selected and theoretically motivated with FEM analysis as well as analytical calculations.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the flow induced by a rigid flat plate of finite length, {{initially}} touching a horizontal water surface, when it starts to move upwards with constant acceleration. In the present model, negative hydrodynamic pressures on the lower (wetted) surface of the plate are allowed, and thus, the water follows the plate due to the resulting suction force. The acceleration of the plate and the plate length are such that gravity, surface tension and viscous effects can be neglected {{during the early stages}} of the motion. Under these assumptions, the initial two-dimensional, potential flow caused by the <b>plate</b> <b>lifting</b> is obtained by using the small-time expansion of the velocity potential. This small-time solution is not valid close to the plate edges, as it predicts there singular flow velocities and unbounded displacements of the water-free surface. It is shown that close to the plate edges the flow is nonlinear and self-similar to leading order. This nonlinear flow is computed by the boundary-element method combined with a time-marching scheme. The numerical time-dependent solution approaches the self-similar local solution with time...|$|E
40|$|The coolant outlet {{temperature}} in VVER- 440 type nuclear reactors is measured using thermocouples. In the Loviisa nuclear power plant, the thermocouple readings {{are used in}} the evaluation of the fuel assembly power. The assembly power is needed as an input for the reactor core performance monitoring system. However, since the coolant is not perfectly mixed in the assembly head, the thermocouple reading might differ from the real average temperature of the flow in the fuel assembly. In order to study the coolant mixing in the fuel assembly head, a 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is conducted. The CFD model describes the head parts of the fuel assembly, including the ends of the fuel rods, a central tube, a top flow <b>plate,</b> <b>lifting</b> bars, a catcher and the thermocouple. The computation grid is a tetrahedral and hexahedral hybrid mesh consisting of 22 - 32. 5 million cells. Following The Best Practice Guidelines, the model's sensitivity to boundary conditions, turbulence models and grid resolution is assessed. The CFD analysis provides information on the coolant mixing in the assembly head and thereby helps to define the average coolant {{outlet temperature}} from the thermocouple reading. 1...|$|E

40|$|A RANS ((Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes)) {{free surface}} flow solver {{has been used}} to model the flow around a 2 -Dplaning plate ((Fn = 1. 596)).

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new assay that differentiates between indoleacetic acid (IAA) -producing and -nonproducing bacteria on a colony <b>plate</b> <b>lift.</b> Medium supplemented with 5 mM L-tryptophan is inoculated with isolates of interest, overlaid with a nitrocellulose membrane, and then incubated until bacterial colonies reach 1 to 2 mm in diameter.

The colorimetric reaction to IAA {{is limited to a}} region immediately surrounding each colony, is specific to isolates producing IAA, occurs within 1 h after the membrane is placed in the reagent, and is sensitive to as little as 50 pmol of IAA in a 2 -mm 2 spot. We have used this assay for quantifying epiphytic and endophytic populations of IAA-producing isolates of Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi and for detecting IAA-producing colonies of other pseudomonads and Erwinia herbicola.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a spanwise vortex {{with a flat}} plate was investigated experimentally in a wind tunnel. The vortex was produced by a vortex generator airfoil pitching in a tailored nonsinusoidal schedule. The smoke-wire visualization technique and unsteady surface pressure measurements were {{used to examine the}} interaction for plates having different leading-edge configurations. The results focus on transient variations of the flow structure and pressure distribution over the plate with the vortex position during the interaction. In comparison with the sharp and elliptical leading-edge plates, {{it was found that the}} passage of the vortex has a much stronger effect on the amplitude of unsteady loading for the plate with a square leading edge, primarily due to the deformation of the leading-edge separation bubble. For the examined range of vertical separation distance between the incident vortex and the test plate, it was also found that the amplitude of <b>plate</b> <b>lift</b> variation during the interaction decreases approximately linearly with the separation distance.

40|$|This master thesis {{examines}} {{a sandwich}} <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> for cargo trucks {{in order to}} propose an option for existing lift platforms in aluminium or steel. The wish {{is to make it}} lighter but not less stiff or weak. Two different cores in Divinycell with different density; H 130 and H 250 is examined. Calculations are made with respect to deflection and max stress in both core and faces for the whole plates. But also more local calculations are performed to see how the faces and core behaved on local point loads from pallet lift wheels. The analytical results successfully meet the deflection requirements causing only 30 mm deflection in the worst scenario with 33 % overload on a <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> built up by 3 mm aluminium faces and H 130 Divinycell core measuring a total (incl. faces) 20 mm thickness in the top. Nor did the von Mises stresses exceed 50 % of ultimate strength for the aluminium parts or the Divinycell core. The choice between the lighter (H 130) and heavier (H 250) core only appears to affect the deflection 1 - 2 mm and the von Mises face stress for point loads are in the order of 10 MPa. The objective regarding the mass of the <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> was not met. This is however a matter of further optimisation and is considered to be solved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{surgical}} procedures for ectropion correction are compared: the widespread “lateral tarsal strip” {{and the more}} recently introduced “tarsal belt” techniques. A retrospective interventional patient series of 40 patients with mono or bilateral ectropion are investigated. Distances of lower lid margin from interpupillary line before surgery and after 1, 6, 12, and 24 months in tarsal belt and lateral tarsal strip surgical procedure are compared. The postoperative distance is reduced in both the groups of patients, but as regard the tarsal belt the amount of correction is greater and more stable over time and this difference is statistically significant. The ideal surgical technique for ectropionʼs correction must be focused simultaneously on the lid and on the canthal region because it is mandatory to tight and elevate the lower lid, rotate the tarsal <b>plate,</b> <b>lift</b> the lateral canthal ligament fixing it in a sure fashion. The tarsal strip technique {{can result in a}} more vulnerability to relapse. In fact, all the lower eyelid is maintained through the little strip that is assured with a single stitch to the orbital rim periosteum. The tarsal belt technique allows a more uniform distribution of the tissue excess. The suture, with its multiple intratarsal stitches, produces a real reinforcement of the eyelid. The double passage is an added value because it is the element that assures a precise regulation of the tarsal plate rotation. Thus, the tarsal belt technique guarantees a better result over time...|$|R

The shape of the clip and the plates meant that rotating the boot {{in relation to the}} ski would force them outwards.

In a direct-forward fall, the <b>plate</b> would <b>lift</b> up, acting against the angled shape of the clips, again forcing them outward and eventually releasing. The tension could be adjusted for skier weight or skill level via a large screw knob at the extreme rear, and several springs were provided for different release forces.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{have been}} many case series advocating the {{potential}} benefits of PFLCP for fixation of intertrochanteric fractures. But these studies are lacking in terms of guidelines regarding the type of fractures in which PFLCP has an upper hand over the gold standard implant that is the DHS. Moreover there have been very few control studies comparing these two implants. Therefore, we performed a case control study to assess: (1) If PFLCP offers better functional results and fewer complications than dynamic hip screws (DHS) ? (2) Which kind of extracapsular femoral fractures would benefit from PFLCP fixation? PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were recruited. Thirty patients underwent PFLCP fixation, and thirty patients underwent DHS fixation. Patient information, type of fracture, functional level (as assessed by Harris hip score), bone union, and implant complications were compared for the two treatment groups. RESULTS: The Mean duration for union in PFLCP group was 17 Weeks (12 - 24 weeks). The Mean duration for union in DHS group was 16 Weeks (12 - 28 weeks). Although there were better functional results (Harris Hip Score) in PFLCP group when compared to DHS group the difference was not statistically significant (P value= 0. 06) in our study. The complications like fracture of the lateral cortex, shortening > 2 cm, rotational deformity, varus mal-union screw cut off phenomenon, <b>plate</b> <b>lift</b> off were more in DHS group when compared to PFLCP. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there was no major difference between DHS and PFLCP for stable intertrochanteric fractures and PFLCP is a better alternative in fixing osteoporotic and unstable intertrochanteric fractures. Further large case control studies are needed in this regard...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} an overview {{on the results}} obtained during the spoiler noise wind tunnel test conducted in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig 1. The scope of this test was to identify and rank order the effectiveness of different techniques for spoiler noise reduction such as e. g. spoiler side edge fences or fractal spoilers. Noise tests were conducted on a scaled high lift system with one spoiler deployed. The results presented in this report indicate that the most effective device in terms of noise reduction is a splitter plate that retains the original fixed wing trailing edge and therefore shields the spoiler generated noise with respect to noise radiation towards the ground. The noise reduction potential of spoiler side edge fences {{was determined to be}} in the order of 2 dB while fractal spoilers provide a noise reduction potential of about 1 dB. From the aerodynamic point of view all tested spoiler configurations without splitter <b>plate</b> provide a <b>lift</b> degradation of about 0. 5 *CL and a drag increase of about 0. 10 to 0. 12 *CD. By application of a splitter <b>plate</b> the <b>lift</b> decrease is reduced to about 0. 4 *CL while the drag increase remains in the order of 0. 10 *CD. This in fact means that a splitter plate is able to provide a better lift over drag ratio...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of varying}} jet decay rate on jet-induced loads {{on a flat}} plate located in {{the plane of the}} jet exit {{perpendicular}} to the jet axis were investigated using a small-scale laboratory facility. Jet decay rate has been varied through use of two cylindrical centerbodies having either a flat or hemispherical tip, which were submerged various distances below the flat plate jet exit plane. Increased jet decay rate, caused by the presence of a center-body or plug in the jet nozzle, led to an increased jet-induced lift loss on the flat <b>plate.</b> Jet-induced <b>lift</b> losses reached 1 percent of the jet thrust for the quickest jet decay rates for plate areas equal to 100 times the effective jet exit area.

5000|$|Revere {{entered the}} 2014 season healthy, and, amidst chaos and {{position}} battles elsewhere, {{he was the}} preeminent starter in center field. Before the season, Pat Egan of Phillies Nation published an article declaring the Phillies as the clear winners of the trade that brought Revere to Philadelphia. Though initially writers thought the Twins received a terrific return {{and it was a}} terrible trade for the Phillies, Worley was ultimately outrighted of the Twins' roster and traded, and May's status as a top prospect languished, whereas Revere had emerged as a viable everyday center fielder who was under contract with the Phillies through 2018. On April 1, 2014, Revere set a new MLB record for most plate appearances without a home run (1,410) by a non-pitcher. Despite his initial preeminence, because of sore ribs (caused by a diving catch in the outfield), backup Tony Gwynn, Jr. started four consecutive games in center field (beyond the time Revere needed to recover from his injury due to Gwynn's success at the plate) while Revere, who had recently struggled at the plate, was on the bench. However, a few days later, Revere came up to bat in the eighth inning in a scoreless game, and hit an RBI single, which re-implanted him atop the Phillies' starting lineup. As for Gwynn, Revere commented, [...] "We're kind of the same player. He's like my older brother. If I do something wrong, he's right there telling me how to correct myself. I'm the same way with him. If I see something, I tell him. He's definitely a great motivator for me. I just learn from him, since he's been in the game for a while. I'm still learning.

This self-folding technique using cells is highly biocompatible and does not involve special material requirements for the microplates and hinges to induce folding. We successfully produced various 3 D cell-laden microstructures by just changing the geometry of the patterned 2 D plates. We also achieved mass-production of the 3 D cell-laden microstructures without causing damage to the cells.
