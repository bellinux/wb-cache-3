5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
25|$|To {{keep the}} {{notation}} uniform, {{call this a}} ray transformation. This terminological distinction is not made in the literature, but is necessary here since both <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> covered while in the literature one possibility is chosen.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the known}} scripts, {{there are three}} main {{candidates}} for being related to the Disc's script, all of them partly syllabic, partly logographic: Linear A, Anatolian hieroglyphs and Egyptian hieroglyphs. More remote <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> comparison with the Phoenician abjad or the Byblos syllabary.|$|E
50|$|A further <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} {{distinction}} between real and remote <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> not relevant to foresight, but rather to the enquiry into recklessness.|$|R
50|$|A third <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> {{that there}} was a wholly {{separate}} epic called the Thesprotis; and yet a fourth <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the Telegony and Thesprotis were two separate poems that were at some stage compiled into a single Telegony. Most scholars at present tend to regard the third and fourth possibilities as unlikely, or at least worthless hypotheses, since neither <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> demonstrable or falsifiable.|$|R
50|$|Townsend likely had a son, Robert Townsend, Jr., and it {{is unclear}} who the child's mother <b>was.</b> One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> Townsend's housekeeper, Mary Banvard, whom Robert Sr. left $500 in his will. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that the mother was a Culper Ring member known today only as Agent 355, however this <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> unlikely. Questions remain about whether Robert, Jr. was indeed Townsend's son. Solomon Townsend once claimed that Townsend's brother, William, was {{actually}} the father.|$|R
25|$|Both painted handscrolls and {{illustrated}} erotic books (empon) often presented an unrelated sequence of sexual tableaux, {{rather than a}} structured narrative. A whole variety of <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> shown—men seduce women, women seduce men; men and women cheat on each other; all ages from virginal teenagers to old married couples; even octopi were occasionally featured.|$|E
25|$|Why the Ancestral Puebloans {{left their}} {{established}} {{homes in the}} 12th and 13th centuries is not clear. Factors examined and discussed include global or regional climate change, prolonged periods of drought, cyclical periods of topsoil erosion, environmental degradation, deforestation, hostility from new arrivals, religious or cultural change, and influence from Mesoamerican cultures. Many of these <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> supported by archaeological evidence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, {{one-dimensional}} (over the complex numbers) complex manifold, sometimes called the complex line. However, this viewpoint contrasts sharply with the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all conformal bijections of the complex plane, but the only <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} for Hamiltonian matrices {{can be extended}} to complex matrices in two ways. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> {{to say that a}} matrix [...] is Hamiltonian if , as above. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> to use the condition [...] where [...] denotes the conjugate transpose.|$|R

25|$|<b>Possibilities</b> <b>are</b> also {{emerging}} as some {{developing countries are}} experiencing rapid economic growth, {{they are able to}} provide their own expertise gained from their recent transition. This knowledge transfer can be seen in donors, such as Brazil, whose $1 billion in aid outstrips that of many traditional donors. Brazil provides most of its aid in the form of technical expertise and knowledge transfers. This has been described by some observers as a 'global model in waiting'.|$|E
25|$|Using a lattice basis, neither {{orthogonality}} nor unit {{length is}} guaranteed, only independence. However, the trace {{is the same}} with respect to any basis. (Trace is a similarity invariant.) In a lattice basis, because the rotation must map lattice points to lattice points, each matrix entry — and hence the trace — must be an integer. Thus, for example, wallpaper and crystals cannot have 8-fold rotational symmetry. The only <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> multiples of 60°, 90°, 120°, and 180°, corresponding to 6-, 4-, 3-, and 2-fold rotations.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of artifacts that are identifiably North Germanic along the coastal areas between the Humber Estuary and East Anglia indicates that Scandinavians migrated to Britain. However, {{this does not}} suggest that {{they arrived at the}} same time as the Angles: they may have arrived almost a century later, and their status and influence upon arrival is uncertain. In particular, regarding a significant Swedish influence in association with the Sutton Hoo ship and a Swedish origin for the East Anglian Wuffinga dynasty, both <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> now considered uncertain.|$|E

25|$|The {{fate of the}} Triangulum Galaxy is unclear, {{but seems}} {{to be linked to}} its larger {{neighbor}} the Andromeda Galaxy. Suggested future scenarios for M33 include being torn apart and absorbed by the greater companion, fueling the latter with hydrogen to form new stars; eventually exhausting all of its gas, and thus the ability to form new stars; or participating in the collision between the Milky Way and M31, most likely ending up orbiting the merger product of the latter two galaxies and fusing with it much later. Two other <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> a collision with the Milky Way before the Andromeda Galaxy arrives or an ejection out of the Local Group.|$|E

25|$|Piece {{names with}} a grey {{background}} are {{present at the}} start of the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion. Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move possibly followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' ("vertical", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> specified explicitly. U denotes the universal leaper, a piece which can jump to any square on the board except the one that it is on.|$|E

Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move possibly followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' ("vertical", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> specified explicitly. Thus while aK moves twice as a king and can capture on both its moves, mKaK moves twice as a king but must stop when it captures.|$|E
25|$|A {{resulting}} trust {{will also be}} found where the purposes of a trust have been completed, but there is excess property left over; for example, a trust by a settlor to provide for his children's university education. Judges and academics disagree over what should happen to the property; <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> {{that it should be}} held for the donors, that it should be held for the beneficiaries (as the donors intended to make an irrevocable gift) or that it should be given to the Crown as bona vacantia. A fourth suggestion is that the trustees take the surplus, as in Re Foord. The general rule was set out in Re Trusts of the Abbot Fund, where it was decided that excess funds will be held on {{resulting trust}} for the settlor. There are exceptions to this rule; the general rule is put aside if the court can find intention to benefit specific individuals, as in Re Osoba.|$|E
25|$|Pieces are {{arranged}} in this section so that, if they promote, they promote into the piece above them. Piece names with a grey background are present {{at the start of}} the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion. Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move possibly followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a', or by numbers: thus a3K means a piece that can take up to three steps of a king. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' ("vertical", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> specified explicitly. Thus mKa3K means a piece that takes up to three steps of a king, but must stop when it first captures. Square brackets are used to make it clear what legs the a modifier chains together: thus DaK would denote a dabbaba move followed by a king move, but D would denote a piece that can move as a dabbaba, or twice as a king.|$|E
50|$|A 1995 {{panel of}} 13 {{scientists}} reviewing {{studies on the}} carcinogenicity of 2,4-D had divided opinions. None of the scientists thought {{the weight of the}} evidence indicated that 2,4-D was a “known” or “probable” cause of human cancer. The predominant opinion indicated that it is possible that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans, although not all of the panelists believed the <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> equally likely: one thought the <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> strong, leaning toward probable, and five thought the <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> remote, leaning toward unlikely. Two panelists believed it unlikely that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans.|$|R
50|$|Tacen was attested {{in written}} sources in 1283 as Taezzen (and as Taezen in 1299, Taczen in 1368, Taczn and Taczen in 1431, Däczen in 1456, Tatzen in 1477, and Täznim in 1642). The {{origin of the}} name <b>is</b> uncertain. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> {{derivation}} from Slovene *tac 'tax, tribute', referring to a settlement that had some role in collecting or paying taxes. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> derivation from tast 'father-in-law', referring {{to some kind of}} family relationship. A third <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> derivation from the personal name *Tatьcь, referring to an early inhabitant. In the past the German name was Tazen.|$|R
40|$|When {{we discuss}} about MHD effects in {{planetary}} nebulae (PNe), it naturally appears a basic question, which magnetic field do we study? One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> the ISM magnetic field (e. g. Heiligman 1980), even more {{if we are}} concerned with moving PNe (e. g. Soker & Dgani 1997).

25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of {{thinking}} about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E
25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do {{not add up to}} 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now {{an integral part of the}} software that runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} such {{prolonged}} absences cannot be ascertained with certainty today, {{but at least}} four <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> likely: poor health, the need to visit his Catalan territories, the demands of military campaigns elsewhere, or the loss of royal favour. In 1139 Ponce {{took part in the}} successful Siege of Oreja, where Alfonso reconquered the city from the Muslims. On 22 February 1140, Ponce was at Carrión de los Condes to witness the treaty between Alfonso VII and Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, which treaty is preserved in the Liber feudorum maior. The next year (1141), Ponce joined the punitive expedition Alfonso led against his cousin Afonso Henriques, who had proclaimed himself King of Portugal in contravention to a treaty he had signed with Alfonso. His presence in Portugal is attested in the Chronicon Lusitanum, which reports that he was captured at the Battle of Valdevez, and in a charter given by Alfonso at Santiago de Compostela on 23 September 1141. It is possible that the Catalan fought with distinction in these two wars in Andalusia and Portugal, since shortly afterwards he became a prominent figure at court. As a tenant (tenente) of the crown, he would have been expected to raise a contingent of knights (milites) and infantry (pedites) for the campaigns. In the fall of 1142 Ponce's relationship with the court permanently changed. He confirmed 376 of the 543 charters issued by Alfonso VII after that date, making him the most regular curial attendee among the counts of the kingdom.|$|E
30|$|The {{relationship}} between {{rule of law}} and NPLs is negative as expected. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that in developing countries, financial firms do not abide by the rule of law because of political influence or corruption. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> that while financial sectors follow standards, other dimensions of governance are worse, which weaken overall governance.|$|R
40|$|The {{limits of}} {{applicability}} of Planck’s constant are brought into {{question in the}} context of the framework of quantum mechanics. The <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> raised that gravitational quanta may be scaled by a more diminutive “action ” whose detection requires sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. An experiment that could unequivocally test this <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> suggested...|$|R
30|$|The other <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> the {{weakness}} of abdominal wall caused by two transvaginal deliveries. Although she underwent abdominoplasty due to separated linea alba, abdominal wall rupture occurred. The last <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> that {{the resistance of the}} abdominal pressure could not be maintained by sacrificed intercostal nerve. Spontaneous rupture in our case is considered the complex of these elements.|$|R
