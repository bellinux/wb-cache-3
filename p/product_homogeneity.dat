50|$|The {{use of the}} {{assumption}} of perfect competition {{as the foundation of}} price theory for product markets is often criticized as representing all agents as passive, thus removing the active attempts to increase one's welfare or profits by price undercutting, product design, advertising, innovation, activities that - the critics argue - characterize most industries and markets. These criticisms point to the frequent lack of realism of {{the assumption}}s of <b>product</b> <b>homogeneity</b> and impossibility to differentiate it, but apart from this the accusation of passivity appears correct only for short-period or very-short-period analyses, in long-period analyses the inability of price to diverge from the natural or long-period price is due to active reactions of entry or exit.|$|E

50|$|A modern {{example of}} decartelization is the {{economic}} restructuring of Germany {{after the fall}} of the Third Reich in 1945. To truly understand the term “decartelization” requires familiarity with the term “cartel”. A cartel is a formal (explicit) agreement among firms. Cartels usually occur in an oligopolistic industry (oligopoly), where there are a small number of sellers, and usually involve homogeneous <b>products</b> (<b>Homogeneity</b> and heterogeneity). Cartel members may agree on such matters as price fixing, total industry output, market shares, allocation of customers, allocation of territories, bid rigging, establishment of common sales agencies (sales agents), and the division of property or profits or combination of these. The aim of such collusion is to increase individual member's profits by reducing competition. Competition laws forbid cartels. Identifying and breaking up cartels is an important part of the competition policy in most countries, although proving the existence of a cartel is rarely easy, as firms are usually not so careless as to put agreements to collude on paper.|$|R

40|$|Beldona, SrikanthThe U. S. lodging {{industry}} is largely {{considered to be}} highly matured and intensely competitive {{to the extent that}} the lodging product itself is believed to be sliding down the path of commoditization. Commoditization as a phenomenon occurs when competing firms offer products and/or services that consumers deem as having limited differential attributes (Riemann, Schilke, & Thomas, 2009). Consumers and firms alike depend on price to indicate the differentiation between the offerings. This study examines perceptions of lodging executives regarding commoditization as well as evaluating operational /strategic initiatives being undertaken to negate the effects of commoditization. Adapted from previous research by Riemann, Schilke, and Thomas, this study examines the phenomenon based on the four dimensions of commoditization namely, <b>product</b> <b>homogeneity,</b> price sensitivity, switching cost, and industry stability. The value disciplines of operational excellence, product/service leadership, and customer intimacy have been determined as initiatives that seek to negate the effects of commoditization. The study further examines managerial perceptions’ on their firm’s implementation of these initiatives. Findings show that high price sensitivity is the strongest driver of commoditization as perceived by lodging executives. This was closely followed by low switching costs for consumers and <b>product</b> <b>homogeneity</b> at a distant third. Interestingly, when it came to operational / strategic initiatives to negate the effects of commoditization, operational excellence (focuses on cost control practices) ranked the highest. At a distant second stood customer intimacy which focuses on building greater customer loyalty and is more effective towards combating commoditization. This combined finding clearly indicates that firms seek to attribute the phenomenon of commoditization more on the consumer (price sensitivity and low switching costs) as opposed to firm related factors namely <b>product</b> <b>homogeneity.</b> Additionally, firms focus relatively more on operational excellence as opposed to reaching out the customer and leveraging service superiority as way of combating the phenomenon more directly. The findings serve as a pointer for industry to reprioritize, while simultaneously working towards differentiating their core offerings through greater innovation.

Despite Ti 3 Al and TiAl receiving {{the vast majority of}} this interest, less work has been conducted on the Al???Ti intermetallics. In the present work, titanium aluminide (Al???Ti) has been reactively processed from elemental powder using a combined mechanical and electrical activation approach. The effect of mechanical activation and electric current intensity on the ignition and phase development is discussed. An increase in current intensity was found to result in an increase in <b>product</b> <b>homogeneity</b> and product porosity. A secondary reaction and sustained glow was found to occur only at the higher current intensity used, which in turn increased the <b>product</b> <b>homogeneity.</b> Ignition was not possible when powders were milled for short durations, while prolonged milling resulted in mechanical activation that promoted a self-propagating type ignition event. The time to reaction (where the whole compact was engulfed with the reaction wave) was found to decrease with an increase in current intensity.

It was confirmed that water chamber geometry has a slight effect on water pressure distribution.

By using EDAMM, nano-crystalline precursors for transformation into high di-electric constant ceramics could be formed in as little as 0. 1 % of the processing time required for conventional solid-state techniques while ball milling using the magneto method also resulted in nano-structural precursors powders suitable for reaction by heat treatment to form oxide supercapacitor.

The studies involve implementation of a His-tagged heterologous expression system under conditions of auto-induction and mediated by molecular chaperone-expressing plasmids. A high yield of human cyclin A 2 was obtained in natively folded and soluble form, through co-expression with groups of molecular chaperones from E. coli in various combinations. A one-step affinity chromatography method was utilized to purify the fusion protein <b>products</b> to <b>homogeneity,</b> and the biological activity confirmed through ligand-binding affinity to inhibitory peptides, representing alternatives for the key determinants of the CDK 2 substrate recruitment site on the cyclin regulatory subunit. As a whole, obtaining the active cyclin A without the CDK partner (referred to as monomeric in this work) in a straightforward and facile manner will obviate protein production issues with the CDK 2 /cyclin A complex and enable drug discovery efforts for non-ATP competitive CDK inhibition through the cyclin groove.
