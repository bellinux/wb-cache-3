The name red-shouldered parakeet was incorrectly applied to this species, as it was an alternative name for the <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{settlement}} of Australia by Indigenous Australians between 48,000 and 70,000 years ago [...] (research in 2011 using DNA suggesting an arrival around 50,000 years ago), and by Europeans from 1788, has significantly affected the fauna. Hunting, {{the introduction of}} non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to numerous extinctions. Some examples include the <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot,</b> pig-footed bandicoot and the broad-faced potoroo. Unsustainable land use still threatens the survival of many species. To target threats {{to the survival of}} its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established numerous protected areas.|$|E

50|$|<b>Paradise</b> <b>parrots</b> {{lived in}} pairs or small family groups, making their nests in hollowed-out termite mounds and similar places, often {{at or near}} ground level, and feeding, so far as is known, almost {{exclusively}} on grass seeds.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the Ambai Islands {{region has}} its own {{characteristics}} and includes part of the biodiversity on the Yapen islands, including forests and hills, as well as trees species such as boat trees (pohon kayu perahu), trees to make traditional wooden drums and traditional guitar including ukulele & string bass, ironwood, bitangur, palm, katapang, coconut trees. Some of the bird species in the islands include: the bird of <b>paradise,</b> <b>parrots,</b> kakatua raja, kakatua, taun-taun, eagle, wood pigeon, cassowary, forest chicken and others. Some of the other fauna found includes: wild pig, kuskus, snake, lizard, butterfly and others. The life within coral reefs has hundreds of species of fish and other marine life local to the islands.|$|R

50|$|Gilbert soon {{returned}} to Australia to collect again for Gould. He discovered the <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> {{and thought it}} 'without exception the most beautiful of the whole tribe I have ever yet seen in Australia.' He begged Gould to name it after him, saying, 'I know of no species that would delight me more to see gilbertii attached to than this beautiful bird.' Gould declined, saying {{he did not like}} naming species after people, and anyway, he had just recently named another species after him. Apparently, Gould saw no contradiction in this explanation and though the <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> is now extinct, Gilbert is remembered in the Gilbert's whistler.|$|E
50|$|Before European {{settlement}} {{many areas}} on the Darling Downs were fertile wilderness. For example, around Ma Ma Creek, rich swampy wetlands provided a haven for many animal species not currently found on the downs. The Darling Downs hopping mouse and <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> have both become extinct since cattle farming begun.|$|E

5000|$|Loro Parque (Spanish for [...] "parrot park") or 'Loro Park' is a 13.5 ha zoo on the {{outskirts}} of Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife, Spain where it houses an extensive and diverse reserve of animal and plant species. The park was conceived as a <b>paradise</b> for <b>parrots</b> and has developed over the years into one of the biggest attractions of the Canary Islands, with over 40 million visitors. The park keeps orcas, which has attracted criticism from some organisations.|$|R
50|$|Meek {{was born}} on 26 October 1871 in Bow, London, {{the son of a}} {{merchant}} in natural history. In 1893 he travelled to Australia and spent some time at George Barnard’s cattle station at Coomooboolaroo, the only place in Australia where the now-extinct <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> had occurred. It is not known if Meek ever saw this species.|$|E
50|$|The {{golden-shouldered parrot}} (Psephotellus chrysopterygius) {{is a rare}} bird of {{southern}} Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland, Australia. A small parrot related to the more common red-rumped parrot, it {{is considered to be}} a superspecies with the hooded parrot (P. dissimilis) of the Northern Territory and the apparently extinct <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> of Queensland and New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{specimens}} {{include a}} male and female huia, bones of the dodo, an elephant bird egg, the only known egg of the slender-billed curlew, two study skins, a mount and several eggs of the passenger pigeon, bones of the great auk, {{a male and}} female ivory-billed woodpecker, three specimens of the <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> and a warbler finch collected by Charles Darwin.|$|E
50|$|The {{first decade}} of the new {{millennium}} saw the opening of Texas Wild! in 2001 to showcase native Texas animals, <b>Parrot</b> <b>Paradise</b> in 2004, Great Barrier Reef in 2005 as part of a renovated Australian Outback exhibit, and the penguin exhibit in 2008. This decade also saw the closing of the original Herpetarium in 2009 to be replaced by the Museum of Living Art in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Monkey Island {{was built}} in 1937 with funds from the Works Progress Administration. In 1949, this exhibit became a sea lion pool, and by 1970, it had been {{converted}} to house small South American mammals.

It is currently being used as the <b>Parrot</b> <b>Paradise</b> exhibit.|$|R
40|$|Spoken-word {{recognition}} involves multiple {{activation of}} alternative word candidates and competition between these alternatives. Phonemic confusions in L 2 listening {{increase the number}} of potentially active words, thus slowing word recognition by adding competitors. This study used a 70, 000 -word English lexicon backed by frequency statistics from a 17, 900, 000 -word corpus to assess the competition increase resulting from two representative phonemic confusions, one vocalic (ae/E) and one consonantal (r/l), in L 2 versus L 1 listening. The first analysis involved word embedding. Embedded words (cat in cattle, rib in ribbon) cause competition, which phonemic confusion can increase (cat in kettle, rib in liberty). The average increase in number of embedded words was 59. 6 % for the vowel and 48. 3 % for the consonant contrast. The second analysis concerned temporary ambiguity. Even when no embeddings are present, multiple alternatives are possible: para- can become <b>parrot,</b> <b>paradise</b> etc., but also pallet, palace given /r/-/l/ confusion. Phoneme confusions (vowel or consonant) in first or second position in the word approximately doubled the number of activated candidates; confusions later in the word increased activation by on average 53 % in third, 42 % in fourth and 25 % in fifth position. Thus phonemic confusions significantly increase competition for L 2 compared with L 1 listeners...|$|R
50|$|The <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psephotellus pulcherrimus) was a {{colourful}} medium-sized parrot {{native to}} the grassy woodlands of the Queensland - New South Wales border area of eastern Australia. Once moderately common within its fairly restricted range, the last live bird was seen in 1927. Extensive and sustained searches {{in the years since}} then have failed to produce any reliable evidence of it, and it is believed to be extinct.|$|E
5000|$|The Darling Downs {{hopping mouse}} (Notomys mordax) is almost {{certainly}} extinct and is known only from a single skull collected somewhere on the Darling Downs of south-east Queensland in the 1840s, apparently from a creature similar to Mitchell's hopping-mouse. The introduction of cattle to the Darling Downs has greatly changed {{the ecology of the}} region, and seen several other species exterminated or seriously threatened. (See <b>Paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> and Northern hairy-nosed wombat.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons for}} the sudden decline of the <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> remain speculative. Possibilities include overgrazing, land clearing, changed fire regimes, hunting by bird collectors, and {{predation}} by introduced mammals like cats and dogs. It became rare {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and was thought extinct by 1915. A series of searches turned up a few more individuals over the next decade, but the last confirmed sighting was on 14 September 1927.|$|E
50|$|The H. L. White Collection is a {{collection}} of Australian birds’ eggs originally accumulated by wealthy pastoralist, amateur ornithologist and oologist Henry Luke White (1860-1927). On White's death it passed to the National Museum of Victoria in Melbourne. The eggs of most of Australia’s native bird species, including the extinct <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot,</b> are represented in the collection, which comprises some 4200 clutches totalling 13,000 eggs. It is housed in the original custom-built Queensland maple cabinets commissioned by White.|$|E
50|$|When Gilbert {{arrived in}} Sydney on 30 April, {{he found his}} {{employer}} gone. To rub salt in his wound, his trunk had been ransacked {{and many of the}} possessions that Gould had promised to protect, had been stolen. Gilbert had provided Gould with thousands of specimens of every description, from quadrupeds to insects, from shells to crustacea, from plants to reptiles, but mainly and most importantly, birds and eggs. He had provided Gould with over 60 new species of birds, including the extinct <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot</b> which he first discovered in the Darling Downs in June 1844.|$|E

50|$|A field {{experiment}} conducted in Heirisson Prong (Western Australia) compared small mammal populations in areas cleared of both foxes and cats, of foxes only, and a control plot. Researchers {{found the first}} solid evidence that predation by feral cats can cause a decline in native mammals. It also indicates that cat predation is especially severe when fox numbers have been reduced. Cats {{may play a role}} in Australia's altered ecosystems; with foxes they may be controlling introduced rabbits, particularly in arid areas, which themselves cause ecological damage. Cats are believed to have been a factor in the extinction of the only mainland bird species to be lost since European settlement, the <b>paradise</b> <b>parrot.</b> Cats in Australia have no natural predators except dingoes and wedge-tailed eagles, and as a result they are apex predators where neither the dingo or the eagle exist.|$|E
5000|$|The {{consultant}} {{editor of}} the 616-page first edition was H.J. Frith. A review by Simon Bennett in the Emu, {{the journal of the}} Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, said”The Reader's Digest book is a co-operative effort, combining contemporary expertise in Australian ornithologywith the photographic excellence of the National Photographic Index of Australian Birds.””Almost every species is illustrated by one or sometimes two colour photographs. These are of high quality and no doubt represent the best published assemblage of photographs of Australian birds. The few poor quality and black-and-white photographs can be excused; the picture of the <b>Paradise</b> <b>Parrot,</b> for example, is the only one known and is of considerable historic interest. Although not all photographs were taken in the field, the techniques used convey a natural setting.””The text accurately summarizes much that is known of Australian birds. The list of contributors is like a Who's Who of Australian ornithology, which makes the reviewer's job difficult. The information is presented in an easily read style, free from jargon. It is good to see many ecological and conservational concepts in the text. The only major criticism relates to the information on distribution. Some of the maps are not consistent with the text (e.g. Black Butcherbird and Noisy Miners) or with published information.” ...|$|E

40|$|This {{aim of this}} {{exhibition}} was to generate reflection about the extinction of the <b>Paradise</b> <b>Parrot</b> and to highlight the tragedy of this loss. The <b>Paradise</b> <b>Parrot</b> was once common in New South Wales and Queensland. The parrot was rare {{by the turn of}} the 20 th Century and the last reliable sightings occurred in 1927. The extinction of this beautiful species is likely to have resulted from a combination of factors including the annual burning of native grasses at a crucial time when the grass was setting seeds, severe and prolonged drought, overgrazing, trapping for aviaries, predation by feral cats, the loss of habitat due to widespread ring barking of trees and the loss of habitat due to a prickly pear infestation. Paradise Parrots nested and laid eggs in termite mounds. This habitat was lost when the termite mounds were collected and used for rammed earth ant-bed tennis courts. These factors contributed to the extinction of this species, which has created an impoverished environment and eliminated the possibility of relationships between living entities...|$|E

40|$|In 1788 Europeans {{arrived here}} to stay. Since then, between {{eighteen}} and twenty mammal {{species have been}} lost, depending on who‘s counting. Gone, too, are the <b>Paradise</b> <b>Parrot</b> and the Dwarf Emu. Alarmingly high numbers of animal (and plant) species hover just this side of oblivion. Not infrequently in Australia‘s natural history the first sighting of an animal by a colonial collector is followed fairly swiftly by a long disappearance. Very few come back. For the most part, expanding populations of exotic predators and feral competitors, combined with shrinking islands of natural habitats mean that the average Australian has few chances to experience firsthand even the commonest creatures of this continent. These days, the closest many people come to direct contact with an indigenous mammal is via the roo bars on their oversized four-wheel-drive vehicles. I suspect that the repercussions of this loss are greater than we can imagine...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{history museum}} {{collections}} represent a vast source of ancient and historical DNA samples from extinct taxa {{that can be}} utilized by high-throughput sequencing tools to reveal novel genetic and phylogenetic information about them. Here, {{we report on the}} successful sequencing of complete mitochondrial genome sequences (mitogenomes) from eleven extinct bird species, using de novo assembly of short sequences derived from toepad samples of degraded DNA from museum specimens. For two species (the Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes migratorius and the South Island Piopio Turnagra capensis), whole mitogenomes were already available from recent studies, whereas for five others (the Great Auk Pinguinis impennis, the Imperial Woodpecker Campehilus imperialis, the Huia Heteralocha acutirostris, the Kauai Oo Moho braccathus and the South Island Kokako Callaeas cinereus), there were partial mitochondrial sequences available for comparison. For all seven species, we found sequence similarities of > 98 %. For the remaining four species (the Kamao Myadestes myadestinus, the <b>Paradise</b> <b>Parrot</b> Psephotellus pulcherrimus, the Ou Psittirostra psittacea and the Lesser Akialoa Akialoa obscura), there was no sequence information available for comparison, so we conducted blast searches and phylogenetic analyses to determine their phylogenetic positions and identify their closest extant relatives. These mitogenomes will be valuable for future analyses of avian phylogenetics and illustrate the importance of museum collections as repositories for genomics resources.
