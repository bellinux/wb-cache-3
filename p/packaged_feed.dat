40|$|Objectives This study {{assesses the}} risk of {{exposure}} to hazardous chemical residues in pork meat, liver, and kidney collected at wet markets in Nghe An and Hung Yen provinces and discusses health impact implication. Methods 514 pig feed, kidney, liver, and pork samples were pooled and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, sulphonamide, chloramphenicol, β-agonists, and heavy metals. We compare the results with current regulations on chemical residues and discuss health implications. Results Legal antibiotics were found in feed. Tetracycline and fluoroquinolones were not present in pork, but 11 % samples were positive with sulfamethazine above maximum residue limits (MRL); 11 % of <b>packaged</b> <b>feed</b> and 4 % of pork pooled samples were positive for chloramphenicol, a banned substance; two feed, two liver, and one pork samples were positive for β-agonists but did not exceed current MRL; 28 % of pooled samples had lead, but all were below MRL; and all samples were negative for cadmium and arsenic. Thus, the health risks due to chemical hazards in pork in Hung Yen and Nghe An seemed not as serious as what were recently communicated to the public on the mass media. Conclusions There is potential exposure to sulphonamide, chloramphenicol, and β-agonists from pork. Risk communication needs to focus on banned chemicals, while informing {{the public about the}} minimal risks associated with heavy metals.

40|$|Introduction: In {{patients}} with autoimmune skin blistering diseases (ABDs), the diagnostic gold standard has classically been {{direct and indirect}} immunofluorescence (DIF and IIF), despite inherent technical problems of autofluorescence. Aim: We sought to overcome autofluorescence issues and compare the reliability of immunofluorescence versus immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the diagnoses of these diseases. Methods: We tested via IHC for anti-human IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, Kappa light chains, Lambda light chains, Complement/C 3 c, Complement/C 1 q, Complement/C 3 d, albumin and fibrinogen in 30 patients affected by a new variant of endemic pemphigus foliaceus in El Bagre, Colombia (El Bagre-EPF), and 30 control biopsies from the endemic area. We also tested archival biopsies from {{patients with}} ABDs whose diagnoses were made clinically, histopathologically and by DIF/IIF studies from 2 independent dermatopathology laboratories in the USA. Specifically, we tested 34 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), 18 with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), 8 with pemphigus foliaceus (PF), 14 with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and 30 control skin samples from plastic esthetic surgery reduction surgeries. Results: The diagnostic correlation between IHC and DIF-IIF was almost 98 % in most cases. IHC revealed evidence of autofluorescence around dermal blood vessels, dermal eccrine glands and neurovascular <b>packages</b> <b>feeding</b> skin appendices in ABDs; this autofluorescence may represent a non-specific immune response. Strong patterns of positivity were seen also in endothelial-mesenchymal cell junction-like structures, {{as well as between}} dermal fibrohistiocytic cells. In PV, we noted strong reactivity to neurovascular packages supplying sebaceous glands, as well as apocrine glands with edematous changes. Conclusions: We suggest that IHC is as reliable as DIF or IIF for the diagnosis of ABDs; our findings further suggest that what has previously been considered DIF/IIF autofluorescence background may be of relevance in ABDs. Our discovery of reactivity against edematous dermal apocrine glands {{may be related to the}} fact that PV has a vegetant form, with lesions present in anatomic areas where these glands exist...|$|R

The series was then picked up by Network Ten. After the usual break in broadcast over the summer non ratings period the series made its debut on Ten in 1986. Ten revamped the show, adding several new, younger cast members including Jason Donovan as Scott Robinson and Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell. When the show began on Ten it initially attracted low ratings, so the Network worked hard to publicise the series. Ten's publicity drive was designed to promote the show in a star-focused campaign recalling that of the Hollywood star system where stars were <b>packaged</b> to <b>feed</b> into a fan culture. This paid off {{and by the end}} of 1987 ratings had improved for the show. The episode featuring Scott and Charlene's wedding achieved the highest ever ratings for Neighbours and it became one of the highest rating soap episodes ever in Australia. The same episode attracted 19.6 million viewers when it was aired in the United Kingdom. By the early 1990s, Australian audiences had decreased although viewing figures had recovered slightly by the end of the decade.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{study the}} {{packaging}} of DNA into a bacteriophage capsid using computer simulation, specifically {{focusing on the}} potential impact of twist on the final packaged conformation. We perform two dynamic simulations of packaging a polymer chain into a spherical confinement: one where the chain end is rotated as it is fed, and one where the chain is fed without end rotation. The final packaged conformation exhibits distinct differences in these two cases: the <b>packaged</b> conformation from <b>feeding</b> with rotation exhibits a spool-like character that is consistent with experimental and previous theoretical work, whereas feeding without rotation results in a folded conformation inconsistent with a spool conformation. The chain segment density shows a layered structure, which is more pronounced for packaging with rotation. However, in both cases, the conformation is marked by frequent jumps of the polymer chain from layer to layer, potentially influencing the ability to disentangle during sub-sequent ejection. Ejection simulations with and without Brownian forces show that Brownian forces are necessary to achieve complete ejection of the polymer chain in the absence of external forces...|$|R

5000|$|Beef {{and dairy}} cattle can be {{particularly}} high in their levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Feed is a significant contributor to emissions from animals raised in Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) or factory farms, as corn or soy beans must be fertilised, irrigated, processed into animal <b>feed,</b> <b>packaged</b> and then transported to the CAFO. In 2005, CAFOs accounted for 74% of the world's poultry production, 50% of pork, 43% of beef, and 68% of eggs, according to the Worldwatch Institute. Proportions are significantly higher in developed countries, but are growing rapidly in developing countries, where demand is also growing fast. [...] However, in the US, only about 11 percent of soybean acres and 14 percent of corn acres are irrigated; in contrast, about 66 percent of vegetable acres and 79 percent of orchard acres are irrigated. [...] In 1995, commercial fertilizer inputs averaged 11 pounds per acre for US soybean production, versus 157 pounds per acre for US potato production. [...] Soybean meal for livestock feed is commonly produced after extraction of soybean oil (used for cooking, food products, biodiesel, etc., so that {{only a fraction of}} processing is assignable to feed. Such examples illustrate that issues relating to irrigation, fertilization and processing for meat production should also be of concern with regard to production of other foods.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-eight Red Sokoto does were {{supplemented}} with crop residue-based and concentrate rations at 1 and 2 % {{of body weight}} in a 7 -treatment completely randomised block design experiment. Average daily milk yield, total milk yield, total lactation length and milk composition were monitored and subjected to least squares analysis to test the effect of treatment. Results indicated that Ration 1 C which comprised of mainly crop residue with much lesser protein levels than the concentrate rations (1 A and 2 A), produced 54 kg of milk over a 90 -day lactation period averaging 0. 60 kg per day. At the other extreme, the negative control ration (Green grass and Digitaria hay) contained the least protein and dams that fed on it had the shortest lactation length (41 days), and therefore least total and average daily milk yields (10. 2 and 0. 25 kg, respectively). It was evident that in absolute terms, milk from does on Ration 2 A contained the highest percentages of fat (6 %), protein (6. 33 %), total solids (21. 85 %) and SNF (15. 85 %). As expected, milk from does on the negative control ration ranked least with respect to all the parameters studied. It was concluded that Ration C fed at 1 % level is a good supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>package</b> for increased milk production in Red Sokoto goats because it competes favourably with conventional concentrate rations.

40|$|Availability {{and access}} to feed {{resources}} are important constraints to livestock productivity in East Africa. This study examined the production and marketing of livestock feeds in Central and North Rift regions in Kenya. Looking at existing fodder value chains to assess constraints and opportunities using the value chain approach, a rapid reconnaissance survey was conducted in which 93 actors were interviewed along the value chain in November 2010. Fodder marketing takes place at two levels: location (a cluster of 2 - 3 villages) and district. Trading at location level involved input sellers, producers selling directly to rural retailers, rural consumers, or if they were near major district towns, to wholesalers. District level trading involved traders who sourced for fodder outside the district and retailed to wholesalers in major consumer markets within districts {{and to a lesser}} extend retailed in local areas. Service providers such as transporters and feed processors operated at all levels. Input providers comprised of agrovet and general retail shops. Traders comprised of individual traders and cooperative societies. Feed trading is seasonal commonly occurring during the dry season with seasonal price variations at all levels. Feed price have increased by about 15 % within the past year. In all the sites, local feed markets are dominated by livestock keepers selling excess fodder. There are few “specialized” fodder sellers, i. e. non livestock keepers who grew fodder as a source of income. Commonly traded feeds in the dry season were Rhodes grass, maize stovers, oat straws and Lucerne hay that were preferred due to longer storage period. Others forages were Napier grass and roadside harvested grass. Most traded fodder had low gross margins (GM) although foodfeed crops such as oats, sweet potato, etc tended to have higher GM. Actors reported an increasing demand for purchased fodder although they all operated in uncoordinated manner. Cooperative societies {{played a key role in}} linking buyers and sellers, stimulating demand and providing credit. Lack of input capital is perceived as a major constraint more than lack of market because demand for feed is strong during the dry season. This study concludes that there is need to promote feed marketing as a <b>package</b> alongside <b>feed</b> conservation, feed processing as well creating platform for that provide linkages for all actors to operate in coordinated way. Processing of feed is important to reducing bulkiness and handling costs hence easy storage and transportation.

It is {{of great interest to}} develop novel, practical, and cost-effective methods or processes to reduce or if possible completely eliminate fungus before aflatoxins are proceed during storage. The contaminations of nuts by toxic fungal species, and consequently the presence of aflatoxins are unavoidable [1]. Low-pressure cold plasma (LPCP) using air and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) was developed and tested for anti-fungal efficacy against Aspergillus parasiticus on various nut samples [2]. There are several works on spores deactivation by atmospheric pressure plasma. For example, Iseki et al. [13] used plasma of argon gas, Lim et al. [20] used Ar/O 2 plasma discharge and Uhm et al. [27] utilized argon gas plasma for spore deactivation. Recently, Connolly et al. [5] used Helium/air plasma at atmospheric pressure for antimicrobial efficacy against E.coli in a plastic package. However, deactivation of fungal spores inside a sealed package is very important and to our knowledge, it has not been investigated by cold plasma streamers, yet. It is {{one of the goals of}} this research to develop a room temperature instrument for A. flavus spores deactivation on pistachio surface inside a closed glass <b>package</b> without any <b>feed</b> gas. To lead the goal, we developed cold plasma streamer generator to change neutral air molecules that trapped in the package into reactive neutral species, positive- and negative-charged particles. In this regard, we adapted the electric power supply to produce cold streamers to penetrate into the package and cover the pistachio sample. We examined temperature, color, moisture and pH of raw pistachios before and after plasma exposure, too.|$|R

The investigation was done by developing a model of the process with the aid of Aspen Plus of the reactive distillation process using RadFrac column that had 21 stages including the condenser and the reboiler. The developed Aspen Plus model of the process was simulated with Wilson model as the property <b>package,</b> and the <b>feed</b> of the process was passed into the column at a temperature and a pressure of 25 oC and 1 atm respectively at the rate of 0. 035 L/min. The metathesis reaction occurring in the reaction (middle) of the column was an equilibrium type, and its equilibrium constant was calculated from Gibbs energy. After developing the olefin metathesis reactive distillation process model using the Aspen Plus, it was simulated by varying the feed stage from stage 2 (the stage below the condenser) to 21 (the reboiler). The results of the simulations showed that the highest mole fraction of the products (trans- 2 -butene and trans- 2 -hexene) were obtainable from the reactive distillation process when the feed (trans- 2 - pentene) was fed at the reaction section of the column. Therefore, it has been discovered that the feed stage of trans- 2 -pentene was affecting the purities of the trans- 2 -butene and trans- 2 -hexene obtained as the main products of the metathesis process considered because as the feed stage was varied, their mole fractions were also discovered to vary...|$|R

40|$|Questions {{such as what}} is the {{contribution}} of road traffic emissions to climate change? or what {{is the impact of}} shipping emissions on local air quality? require a quantification of {{the contribution}} of specific emissions sectors to the concentration of radiatively active species and air-quality-related species, respectively. Here, we present a diagnostics package, implemented in the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy), which keeps track of the contribution of source categories (mainly emission sectors) to various concentrations. The diagnostics package is implemented as a submodel (TAGGING) of EMAC (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts – Hamburg (ECHAM) /MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). It determines the contributions of 10 different source categories to the concentration of ozone, nitrogen oxides, peroxyacytyl nitrate, carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, hydroxyl, and hydroperoxyl radicals ([*]=[*] tagged tracers). The source categories are mainly emission sectors and some other sources for completeness. As emission sectors, road traffic, shipping, air traffic, anthropogenic non-traffic, biogenic, biomass burning, and lightning are considered. The submodel obtains information on the chemical reaction rates, online emissions, such as lightning, and wash-out rates. It then solves differential equations for the contribution of a source category to each of the seven tracers. This diagnostics <b>package</b> does not <b>feed</b> back to any other part of the model. For the first time, it takes into account chemically competing effects: for example, the competition between NO x, CO, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) in the production and destruction of ozone. We show that the results are in-line with results from other tagging schemes and provide plausibility checks for concentrations of trace gases, such as OH and HO 2, which have not previously been tagged. The budgets of the tagged tracers, i. e.  the contribution from individual source categories (mainly emission sectors) to, e. g., ozone, are only marginally sensitive to changes in model resolution, though the level of detail increases.

40|$|Background: Strategies {{to improve}} infant and young child {{nutrition}} in low and middle-income countries {{need to be}} implemented at scale. We contextualised and packaged successful strategies into a feasible intervention for implementation in rural Tanzania. Opportunities that can optimise delivery of the intervention and encourage behaviour change include mothers willingness to modifying practices; support of family members; seasonal availability and accessibility of foods; established set-up of village peers and functioning health system. The primary objective {{of the study is}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a nutrition education <b>package</b> in improving <b>feeding</b> practices, dietary adequacy and growth as compared to routine health education. Methods/Design: A parallel cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in rural central Tanzania in 9 intervention and 9 control villages. The control group will receive routine health education offered monthly by health staff at health facilities. The intervention group will receive a nutrition education package in addition to the routine health education. The education package is comprised of four components: 1) education and counselling of mothers, 2) training community-based nutrition counsellors and monthly home visits, 3) sensitisation meetings with health staff and family members, and 4) supervision of community-based nutrition counsellors. The duration of the intervention is 9 months and infants will be recruited at 6 months of age. Primary outcome (linear growth as length-for-age Z-scores) and secondary outcomes (changes in weight-for-length Z-scores; mean intake of energy, fat, iron and zinc from complementary foods; proportion of children consuming 4 or more food groups and recommended number of semi-solid/soft meals and snacks per day; maternal level of knowledge and performance of recommended practices) will be assessed at baseline and ages 9, 12 and 15 months. Process evaluation will document reach, dose and fidelity of the intervention and context at 8 and 15 months. Discussion: Results of the trial will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the nutrition education package in community settings of rural Tanzania. They will provide recommendations for strengthening the nutrition component of health education in child health services...|$|R
40|$|Variations {{in weight}} gain, milk yield, milk composition, {{nutrient}} intake and digestibility of Red Sokoto goats supplemented with crop-residue based rations during the long-dry period were investigated. Ration A, the conventional concentrate ration, {{was used as}} the positive control, Rations B and C were the two crop-residue test diets, while Ration D the unsupplemented treatment, {{was used as the}} negative control. Each of the supplementation rations was fed at 1 and 2 % of the goats body weight (designated as 1 A, 2 A, 1 B, 2 B and 1 C, 2 C respectively). The supplemented group of goats had significantly higher (P< 0. 05) dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) intakes as well as nutrient digestibilities than the unsupplemented groups. DM digestibility improved with supplementation by a range of 4. 1 to 27. 9 %, while CP digestibility improved by 17. 1 to 42. 2 %, the highest value being in does on Ration A. It was evident that supplementation significantly (P< 0. 01) influenced weight gains and milk yield of dams. Goats on ration 2 C recorded the highest average daily gains of 39. 29 g/day while their counterparts fed rations 1 B and D lost 28. 57 and 92. 86 g/day respectively. Ration 1 C which comprised mainly of crop residue with much lesser protein levels than the concentrate ration, produced 54 kg of milk over a 90 -day lactation period averaging 0. 60 kg per day. Goats on Ration D had the shortest lactation length of 41 days and the least total and average daily milk yields of 10. 2 and 0. 25 kg respectively. Milk from does on ration 2 A contained the highest percentages of fat (6 %), protein (6. 33 %), total solids (21. 85 %) and solids-not-fat (15. 85 %). Milk from goats on ration D ranked least with respect to all parameters studied. It was concluded that the goats made appreciable gains in the long dry season on crop-residue based diets that compared favourably with the conventional concentrate rations. Ration C fed at 1 % level was a good supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>package</b> for increased liveweight gains and milk production in Red Sokoto goats...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Bure District of the Amhara National Regional State (ANRS) with objectives of characterizing the milk production & marketing systems and evaluating the effect of feed supplementation on milk yield & milk composition of local cows. A single-visitmultiple- subject survey was used to collect data on milk production & marketing systems. A total of 181 milk households were individually interviewed. On-farm feeding trial was conducted on twenty lactating cows of uniform parity and stage of lactation using a Randomized Complete Block Design (5 treatments & 4 replications). Average body weight and initial milk yield of cows were 231. 7 ± 36. 7 kg & 1. 08 ± 0. 11 kg/cow/day respectively. The treatment groups included grazing (T 1), noug seed cake (T 2), adlib urea treated wheat straw (T 3), noug seed cake+ adlib urea treated wheat straw (T 4) and concentrate comprising 74 % maize grain+ 25 % noug seed cake + 1 % salt (T 5). From the survey, rural small-holder, periurban, and urban milk production systems were identified. Milk and butter were found to be marketed mainly through informal marketing systems. Indigenous and Fogera-Friesian crossbreds were the dominant cattle breeds. The major livestock feed resources are natural pasture, crop residues and aftermaths. Trypanosomiasis, pasteurolosis, anthrax and black leg were the major reported cattle diseases. The main problems of milk production & marketing were lack of feed, disease outbreak, lack of improved cattle breeds and distance to marketing points. The on-farm feeding trial result showed a significant difference (P 0. 05), for increased milk protein, solids-not-fat and ash contents. The highest and the lowest milk yield per day was recorded for cows fed urea treated wheat straw and the control group, respectively. The intervention diets increased the net profit/cow/day by ETB 3. 40 (T 2), 6. 33 (T 3), 3. 58 (T 4), and 3. 84 (T 5) over the control (T 1). In general, despite the untapped milk potential of the district, the existing milk production (mainly extensive) & marketing (mainly informal) systems are found to be interwoven by many constraints. Urea treated wheat straw supplementation improved milk yield, weight gain and economic return. Therefore, further works are needed in areas of milk nutrition, health, product marketing, input delivery and services and scaling up the <b>feeding</b> <b>package</b> developed in this study considering the respective milk production systems to capitalize the market oriented milk industry in the district.
