25|$|The {{cosmetic}} {{benefits in}} (1) reported pro-forma diluted earnings per share, (2) debt gearing (for a while) and (3) pro-forma consolidated pre-tax profits (for convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares)</b> led to UK convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> being the largest European class of convertibles {{in the early}} 1980s, until the tighter terms achievable on Euroconvertible bonds resulted in Euroconvertible new issues eclipsing domestic convertibles (including convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares)</b> from the mid 1980s.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{consequences}} of {{international accounting standards}} are likely to reach beyond the impact on financial statements. This paper demonstrates one of the economic implications of international standards. We focus {{on the impact of}} the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) regulation on <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> (IAS 32) in the Netherlands. IAS 32 causes most <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> to lose their classification as equity and these shares will hence be classified as liabilities. We document that for Dutch firms with preferred stock outstanding, the reclassification will on average increase the reported debt ratio by 35 %. We find that 71 % of the firms that are affected by IAS 32 buy back their <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> or alter the specifications of the <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> {{in such a way that}} the classification as equity can be maintained. The main determinant of the decision whether to give these consequences to IAS 32 is the magnitude of the impact of IAS 32 on a firm's debt ratio. We conclude that IFRS does not only lead to a decrease in the use of financial instruments that otherwise would have added to the capital structure diversity, but also changes firms' real capital structure. ...|$|R

50|$|In May 1896 {{the firm}} became a public limited company, the Mazawattee Tea Company Ltd, which {{acquired}} the Mazawattee Ceylon Tea Company and Densham & Sons (the wholesale tea and coffee dealing {{part of the}} business). The capital was £550,000 (= £21.4 million in 2009 terms) in 5% cumulative <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> of £5 each and 350,000 ordinary shares of £1 each (= £13.6 million in 2009 terms). The four brothers received 13,333 <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> and 116,666 ordinary shares, a total of £183,333 (= £7.1 million in 2009 terms). The remainder of the 26,667 <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> and 233,334 ordinary shares were offered for sale.

40|$|Since late 2012 the Chinese {{government}} has been endeavouring to reintroduce <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> This article studies the revival of <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> in China and its strengths and dangers as a viable investment/financing tool. Its main strength is to help Chinese banks meet new capital adequacy requirements and to stimulate the stagnant stock market, and its core danger is its potential misuse by dominant shareholders to expropriate profits from minority common shareholders {{in the context of}} weak minority shareholder protection and insufficient cash dividends in the Chinese stock market. Empirical evidence gives partial support to this understanding of its danger because the impact of <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> on existing common shareholders is mixed and differs among different types of companies. This article also shows that the current regulatory regime in China provides comprehensive protection for preference shareholders and that compared with minority common shareholders, preference shareholders are in an advantageous position. ...|$|R
