40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} {{magneto-optical}} measurement of GaAs quantum wire lattices of 0. 7 micrometer period grown on GaAs(111) B substrates {{by using the}} selective-area MOVPE technique. We measure the photoluminescence (PL) spectra at 60 mK from the triangular and the Kagome lattice patterns {{as well as from}} the unpatterned single quantum well (SQW) as a reference. While the PL from acceptors is dominant in all the samples, the PL spectra have a different peak between the wire structures and the SQW. When we apply a perpendicular magnetic field to the samples, the PL intensities slightly decrease up to 100 mT and then increase at higher magnetic fields with periodic oscillations in the triangular and the Kagome lattices. This oscillation is possibly attributed to the interference effect of electrons in the lattice <b>patterns</b> <b>threaded</b> by the magnetic flux. 1...|$|R

Fault-detection tools in this area find data-access <b>patterns</b> among <b>thread</b> interleavings, but they report benign patterns as well as actual faulty patterns. Traditional fault-localization techniques {{have been successful in}} identifying faults in sequential, deterministic programs, but they cannot detect faulty data-access <b>patterns</b> among <b>threads.</b> This paper presents a new dynamic fault-localization technique that can pinpoint faulty data-access patterns in multi-threaded concurrent programs. The technique monitors memory-access sequences among <b>threads,</b> detects data-access <b>patterns</b> associated with a program’s pass/fail results, and reports dataaccess patterns with suspiciousness scores. The paper also presents the description of a prototype implementation of the technique in Java, and the results of an empirical study we performed with the prototype on several Java benchmarks.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of patterning on the stress distribution in the bone tissue using the finite element analysis (FEA) model. Materials and Methods: For optimal comparison, it was assumed that the implant was axisymmetric and infinitely long. The implant was assumed to be completely embedded in the infinitely long cortical bone and to have 100 % bone apposition. The implant-bone interface had completely fixed boundary conditions and received an infinitely big axial load. von Mises stress and maximal principal stress were analyzed. Conventional thread and 2 or 3 patterns on the upper and lower flank of the thread were compared. Result: The surface areas of patterned implants were increased up to 106 ~ 115 %. The <b>thread</b> with <b>patterns</b> distributed stress better than conventional <b>thread.</b> <b>Patterning</b> in <b>threads</b> may produce more stress in the implant itself, but reduce stress in the surrounding bone. Stress patterns of von Mises stress were favorable with patterns, while the maximal principal stress was increased with patterns. Patterns in the lower flank showed favorable stress distribution. Conclusion: The <b>patterns</b> in implant <b>thread</b> reduce the stress generated in surrounding bone, but the number and position of patterns were crucial factors in stress distribution...|$|R

40|$|Cotton cloth is a {{commonly}} encountered material in everyday life, and a realistic model for its appearance {{is needed for}} rendering clothing and environments in many computer graphics applications. For realism {{it is important to}} produce the correct texture when the <b>pattern</b> of <b>threads</b> is resolved in the image, but cloth must also be rendered efficiently in more distant views when the <b>thread</b> <b>pattern</b> is not resolved. This paper introduces a simple model that, for any view and illumination directions, reproduces both the smallscale texture (BTF) and the large-scale reflectance (BRDF) of woven cloth within a single framework. The model is simple and fast, and it can handle any weave pattern using only a small set of parameters. The model is validated against measurements, and it qualitatively matches both the texture and reflectance observed in real cloth. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Success {{of dental}} implant {{treatment}} depends on number of patient related and procedure dependent parameters. Various {{studies have shown}} that bone quality and implant design are two important factors in the success of dental implant treatment. Today, many implant systems are coming up with variable <b>thread</b> <b>patterns.</b> There is not much literature available on the effects of such variable <b>thread</b> <b>patterns</b> within different bone densities. Aim: The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of two different implant <b>thread</b> <b>patterns</b> in two different bone densities using three dimensional finite element analyses. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional finite element model of a mandibular section of bone and an implant was developed. 4. 2 x 12 mm screw type dental implants with two different thread designs (buttress thread design and variable thread design) and a metal ceramic crown using Co-Cr and feldspathic porcelain were modelled. The model was developed with finite element software and two types of bone qualities were prepared (D 2 and D 4). A load of 450 N was applied in a vertical direction and in an oblique direction to the central fossa, buccal cusp and distal fossa of the mandibular first molar crown. Results: For the variable thread design, von Mises stresses developed within bone were 109. 89 MPa and 257. 46 MPa for vertical and oblique loading respectively, in D 2 type of bone. While in D 4, the stresses were 243. 91 MPa and 371. 81 MPa for vertical and oblique loading respectively. Similarly, for buttress thread design, stresses were 113. 51 MPa and 176. 14 MPa for vertical and oblique loading respectively in D 2 type of bone; while in D 4 type of bone the stresses were 290. 99 MPa and 481. 27 MPa respectively within the bone. Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} showed that the von Mises stresses were more in D 4 type of bone as compared to D 2 type of bone for both, the variable and buttress thread designs. The study also compared the two thread designs. Less stresses were seen with the variable <b>thread</b> <b>pattern</b> than in the buttress <b>thread</b> <b>pattern</b> particularly in D 4 type of bone...|$|R
