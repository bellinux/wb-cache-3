40|$|International audienceUntil now, {{molten salts}} (nitrate-based salts) {{are the main}} {{materials}} for sensible heat storage at industrial scale. The working temperature range of these materials is limited below 500 °C. There {{is not yet a}} solution for sensible heat storage at high temperature. This paper aimed to investigate alkali polyphosphates ((MPO 3) n, with M = Li, Na or K) as new promising materials for sensible heat storage at high temperature. Alkali polyphosphates could be formed by dehydration of monoalkali dihydrogenphosphates (MH 2 PO 4, with M = Li, Na or K), which occurs below 400 °C. Alkali polyphosphates resulted from this dehydration melted at 628, 657 and 812 °C for sodium, lithium and <b>potassium</b> <b>polyphosphate,</b> respectively. All these liquids evaporated above 900 °C but no destruction of their chemical structure was recorded. Sodium polyphosphate seemed to be the most promising material for sensible heat storage at high temperature because of its large potential working temperature (628 – 900 °C), its availability and its low cost compared to lithium and potassium polyphosphates. The results open new prospects {{for the development of the}} thermal energy storage field...|$|E
40|$|Combinations of <b>potassium</b> sorbate and <b>polyphosphate,</b> in {{conjunction}} with vacuum or modified atmosphere packaging, were assessed for their preservative effects on morwong fillets (pH 6. 75) stored at 4 °C. Vacuum packaged and/or frozen fillets were used as comparisons for microbiological and taste panel analysis. A combination of <b>potassium</b> sorbate, <b>polyphosphate</b> and 100 % CO 2 was the most effective packaging regime. Potassium sorbate on vacuum packaged fish was more effective than a 100 % CO 2 atmosphere alone. Polyphosphate had no apparent additional effect on fillets stored under vacuum with or without potassium sorbate...|$|R

5000|$|Disodium {{pyrophosphate}} {{and other}} sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>polyphosphates</b> {{are widely used}} in food processing; in the E number scheme, they are collectively designated as E450, with the disodium form designated as E450(a). In the United States, it is classified as {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) for food use. In canned seafood, it is used to maintain color and reduce purge during retorting. Retorting achieves microbial stability with heat. [...] It is an acid source for reaction with baking soda to leaven baked goods. In baking powder, it is often labeled as food additive E450. In cured meats, it speeds the conversion of sodium nitrite to nitrite (NO2−) by forming the nitrous acid (HONO) intermediate, and can improve water-holding capacity. Disodium pyrophosphate is also found in frozen hash browns and other potato products, where it is used to keep the color of the potatoes from darkening.|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of KEu(PO 3) 4, <b>potassium</b> europium(III) <b>polyphosphate,</b> {{were obtained}} by solid-state reactions. This monoclinic form is the second polymorph described for this composition and belongs to type IV of long-chain polyphosphates with general formula A I B III(PO 3) 4. It is isotypic with its KEr(PO 3) 4 and KDy(PO 3) 4 homologues. The crystal structure is built of infinite helical chains of corner-sharing PO 4 tetra­hedra with a repeating unit of eight tetra­hedra. These chains are further linked by isolated EuO 8 square anti­prisms, forming a three-dimensional framework. The K+ ions are located in pseudo-hexa­gonal channels running along [01] and are surrounded by nine O atoms in a distorted environment...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of {{the title}} compound, <b>potassium</b> praseodymium(III) <b>polyphosphate,</b> were obtained by solid-state reaction. The monoclinic non-centrosymmetric structure is isotypic with all other KLn(PO 3) 4 analogues from Ln = La to Er, inclusive. The crystal structure of these long-chain polyphosphates is built up from infinite crenelated polyphosphate chains of corner-sharing PO 4 tetrahedra with a repeating unit of four tetrahedra. These chains, running along [100], are arranged in a pseudo-tetragonal rod packing and are further linked by isolated PrO 8 square antiprisms [Pr&# 8212;O = 2. 3787 &# 8197;(9) &# 8211; 2. 5091 &# 8197;(8) &# 8197;&# 197;], forming a three-dimensional framework.

40|$|The {{condensed}} phosphates such as ammonium pyrophosphate, <b>potassium,</b> metaphosphate, ammonium <b>polyphosphates</b> {{are among the}} newest achievements {{in the domain of}} fertilizers (5, 6). Results of various experiments have shown that these fertilizers increase the yield in wheat, barley, maise, potato, sugar beat, bean and others (2, 3, 5). However, experiments in this field are few (3). In Lolium multiflorum the reactions of these forms of phosphorus were not illustrated in many cases, because the experiments had been carried out with salts of NH 4, K and Ca, where the effect was combined. The objective of this report is to present results of a series of greenhouse pot experiments...|$|R
40|$|Three {{approaches}} {{to the study of}} hydration of polymeric ions in relation to that of analogous simple ions have been made as follows: In {{the first part of the}} thesis, information in sought regarding the hydration of polyions by evaluating the degree of dielectric saturation near the charged particles. Previously, this had been done only in the ease of isolated simple ions assumed to be point charges. Since the ionic atmosphere can never be removed from the polyions, even in very dilute solutions, the simple electrostatic field cannot be used in the evaluation of the extent of dielectric saturation. The dielectric constant has therefore been obtained directly as a function of the distance from the polyion from a solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and previously published relations between dielectric constant and field intensity. The solutions have been obtained by numerical methods using a digital electronic computer. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved by this method for the following models: simple ions, cylindrical polyions, spherical polyions and planar colloidal ions. The relative degrees of dielectric saturation were calculated and related to the relative extents of primary hydration for the different ionic models. The effect of dielectric saturation on the field and potential functions is also discussed for the various ion models. The second part of the thesis deals with solvent electrostriction and the determination of salting-out by polyelectrolytes. In order to interpret the experimental data obtained on the salting-out of non-electrolytes (argon, ethylene, d- 1 leucine and benzamide) by polyelectrolytes (sodium <b>polyphosphates,</b> <b>potassium</b> polymethacrylate and poly- 4 -vinyl-N-n-butylpyridinium bromide), it was first found necessary to modify the existing salting-out theories for simple ions and a proposed theory for polymeric ions, by taking into account the effect of dielectric saturation of the solvent near the ions. Such effects are shown to be important in determining salting-out constants and, in fact, lead to the recognition of the necessity for taking into account the specific structure (e. g. effective radius) of the primary hydration shell. Other modifications to the theory are also suggested. In the modified salting-out theory referred to above, the radius of the primary hydration shell in required. The third part of the thesis therefore describes the evaluation of this parameter from experimentally measured apparent molar volumes for simple and polymeric ions. The significance of these apparent molar volumes in relation to the hydration of this polymeric and simple ions is also discussed...|$|R
