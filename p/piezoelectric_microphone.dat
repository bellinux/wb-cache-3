This work presents a closed form solution for the sensitivity of a cantilever based microphone without making the small piezoelectric coupling assumption and provides criteria for determining the validity of this assumption. The complete microphone model includes {{a model of the}} amplifying electronics as well and, after examining the complete system, an optimization parameter is presented for the optimization of the MEMS transducer which can be applied to any amplifying electronics. This optimization parameter is then used to determine the optimal device material and geometry for a <b>piezoelectric</b> MEMS <b>microphone.</b> This optimization is used to design two generations of devices. The first generation device was a simple, 4 mask device used to work out processing issues mostly associated with aluminum nitride, the selected piezoelectric material.

50|$|However, {{burning fuel}} {{with a lower}} octane rating than that for which the engine is {{designed}} often results in a reduction of power output and efficiency. Many modern engines are equipped with a knock sensor (a small <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>microphone),</b> which sends {{a signal to the}} engine control unit, which in turn retards the ignition timing when detonation is detected. Retarding the ignition timing reduces the tendency of the fuel-air mixture to detonate, but also reduces power output and fuel efficiency. Because of this, under conditions of high load and high temperature, a given engine may have a more consistent power output with a higher octane fuel, as such fuels are less prone to detonation. Some modern high performance engines are actually optimized for higher than pump premium (93 AKI in the US). The 2001 - 2007 BMW M3 with the S54 engine is one such car.

We establish that for detection of leaks it is purposeful to use the frequencies ranging from 30 to 100 kHz. In this range good sensitivity, directivity and S/N ratio of microphones can be achieved. The intensity of acoustical signal depends on the leaks size and pressure in the system. We have investigated characteristics of the acoustical signals at various pressure values and configurations of holes. Sound intensity, power spectrum of the acoustical signal were measured.

40|$|Abstract Objectives Many {{microphones}} {{have been}} developed to meet with the implantable requirement of totally implantable cochlear implant (TICI). However, a biocompatible one without destroying the intactness of the ossicular chain still remains under investigation. Such an implantable floating <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>microphone</b> (FPM) has been manufactured and shows an efficient electroacoustic performance in vitro test at our lab. We examined whether it pick up sensitively from the intact ossicular chain and postulated whether it be an optimal implantable one. Methods Animal controlled experiment: five adult cats (eight ears) were sacrificed as the model to test the electroacoustic performance of the FPM. Three groups were studied: (1) the experiment group (on malleus) : the FPM glued onto the handle of the malleus of the intact ossicular chains; (2) negative control group (in vivo) : the FPM only hung into the tympanic cavity; (3) positive control group (Hy-M 30) : a HiFi commercial microphone placed close {{to the site of the}} experiment ear. The testing speaker played pure tones orderly ranged from 0. 25 to 8. 0 kHz. The FPM inside the ear and the HiFi microphone simultaneously picked up acoustic vibration which recorded as. wav files to analyze. Results The FPM transformed acoustic vibration sensitively and flatly as did the in vitro test across the frequencies above 2. 0 kHz, whereas inefficiently below 1. 0 kHz for its overloading mass. Although the HiFi microphone presented more efficiently than the FPM did, there was no significant difference at 3. 0 kHz and 8. 0 kHz. Conclusions It is feasible to develop such an implantable FPM for future TICIs and TIHAs system on condition that the improvement of Micro Electromechanical System and piezoelectric ceramic material technology would be applied to reduce its weight and minimize its size. </p...|$|E
40|$|Modern car {{alarm systems}} are {{equipped}} with smart sensors implemented using various physical principles. These sensors have to ensure high {{reliability and validity of}} monitored parameters with a lack of false operations. First of all, shock sensor, which is a part of, essentially, entire alarm systems, as well as tilt and motion sensors are referred to the smart sensors. Shock sensors with the sensitive elements (SE) of <b>piezoelectric,</b> <b>microphone,</b> and electromagnetic types possess a number of the essential shortcomings caused by the type of SE. It is, first of all, a narrow band of the sensitive elements, which does not allow true differentiation of shocks to the autobody from false actions, as well as a various sensitivity of sensors depending on the SE axis orientation. Tilt sensors of electromagnetic type implemented as separate devices were seldom used because of their high cost and imperfect characteristics. Though there is still a need for such sensors. The specified shortcomings can be hardly overcome through improvement of sensitive element hangers of considered sensors. The use of the three-axial accelerometers made by MEMS technology seems to be the most perspective here. The article presents results of pilot studies of the accelerations reached when auto-body is under shock and a car is inclined and runs. When measuring, the test board STM 32 F 3 DISCOVERY with the MEMS accelerometer LSM 303 DLHS is used. A level of noise and vibrations has been analysed when mounting a board on the plastic panel of the car and when operating the engine in the range from 700 to 4000 rpm. The article presents accelerations implemented under the following conditions: light shocks {{in different parts of the}} auto-body (wing, trunk, hood); strong shock (closing a door); slow and fast acceleration to the speed of 20 km/h with the subsequent braking and passage of obstacles such as "sleeping policemen". Research results enabled us to make justification for selecting the range of accelerometer operation, as well as the accuracy of measuring acceleration, frequency of signal poll, and algorithm of filtration. The article gives recommendations for selecting the MEMS accelerometers to be used in combined shock, tilt, and motion sensors of modern car alarm systems. </p...|$|E
40|$|Existing shock sensors for car {{protection}} {{using the}} sensitive elements (SE) of <b>piezoelectric,</b> <b>microphone</b> and electromagnetic types and the analogue circuitry of signal processing, {{have a number}} of essential shortcomings: - piezoelectric sensitive elements have no characteristics repeatability that complicates their use in mass production; - microphone sensors are structurally complicated and demand difficult information signal processing; - sensitive elements of electromagnetic sensors demand individual control (a specified clearance to be set between a magnet and the coil). Use of analogue elements (resistors, capacitors) in the amplifier and filter circuits reduces temporary and temperature stability of characteristics. An adjustment of the sensor operating zones via variable resistors on a printed circuit is extremely inconvenient and doesn't allow to change quickly the sensor sensitivity depending on an external situation (for example, to increase quickly an operating zone of the sensor with an alarm system of a key fob when securing a car in the country or in the woods, or to reduce it in the street with heavy traffic streams). An analogue circuit–based sensor design disables its automatic adaptation to such external impacts as a rain, a stream passing by cars, etc. The article considers how to solve some of above problems while designing the two-zone digital shock sensors with a SE of electromagnetic type. It shows the SE design developed by the authors as a module containing the coil and a magnet, secured on the coil axis in a silicone extension. The circuitry solution and algorithms of signals processing allowed authors to realize a remote control of the prevention and alarm zones (with 16 gradation of sensitivity). The algorithm of self-adaptation to the repeating external impacts is proposed. The developed method to form the basic levels of digital comparators for each gradation of sensitivity enables the sensor to have the straight-line adjusting characteristic. The developed shock sensor is implemented as stock-produced items included in the car alarm systems of the trademark “Excellent” (made by JSC Magic Ring Ltd.). Operating experience (about 40 thousand pieces realized now) allows a proper adjustment of sensors to be possible on cars with any body type. A sufficient level of the sensor sensitivity proves it. The reliability of sensors is confirmed by failures statistics in use (0, 08 %). Failures are, usually, caused by the SE coil wire break in a soldering point of the coil leads to the printed circuit. However a number of shortcomings are also revealed. Experimental data processing of a test batch of sensors has shown that existing SE of electromagnetic type have the frequency of free vibrations f  80  5 Hz and a decay constant of transient under shock   0, 2 s. At these parameters a SE pass-band makes only f  1, 5 Hz, and the sensor responses only to the shock front, rather than to the secondary vibrations of a body. It is an essential drawback of the narrow-band sensors. The experiments conducted on test batch of sensors (10 samples) have shown essentially different sensitivities of sensors under shock {{in the direction of the}} sensitivity axis and perpendicular to it. This difference reaches 4 - 6 gradations of sensitivity. It means that when mounting a sensor on the particular car the orientation of sensitivity axis of the sensor will be of crucial importance that is also a shortcoming. It is shown that overcoming the specified drawbacks is hardly because of the improvement of sensitive elements suspension of electromagnetic sensors. Three-axial accelerometers implemented using MEMS technologies seem to be the most perspective application here. </p...|$|E
