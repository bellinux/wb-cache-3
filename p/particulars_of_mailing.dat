25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any <b>particular</b> piece <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> does not affect the arrival times of future pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> i.e., if pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number <b>of</b> pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|R
50|$|This symbology, {{derived from}} the RM4SCC system used by the British Royal Mail, uses a series of bars, each of which can {{individually}} have one of four possible states, to encode information used in automated sortation and delivery onto each piece <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> Each bar can either be short and centred (known as a tracker), medium and elevated (an ascender), medium and lowered (a descender), or full height. This symbology also uses an element known as a Data Content Identifier (or DCI), which specifies what types of information are encoded into each barcode, such as postal codes, customer information, and exact delivery points. The information that goes into each barcode is obtained from the address printed {{on the front of}} the envelope it is ultimately printed on, as well as the physical dimensions of each piece <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> This code also uses a Reed-Solomon error correction technique, so that in case a <b>particular</b> piece <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> is mishandled, the information encoded in the barcode can still be correctly decoded.|$|R

From a perspective of Internet research ethics, judgements about the potential <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>mailing</b> lists to cause more harms than benefits should be made by a Research Ethics Committee (or an Institutional Review Board), {{rather than by the}} researchers themselves.|$|R
50|$|The film {{utilizes}} three contrasting {{techniques to}} convey its meaning. First, Night Mail portrays the daily {{activities of the}} postal staff on a human scale, with colloquial speech and naturalistic vignettes, like sipping beer and sharing inside jokes. This was the approach favored by Harry Watt, who apprenticed under ethnographic filmmaker Robert Flaherty. Second, Night Mail uses expressionistic techniques like heavy back-lighting and the lyric poetry of Auden to convey the grand scale of the postal endeavor. These techniques were championed by Basil Wright, a lover of experimental European cinema. Finally, the film occasionally employs narration to explain the <b>particular</b> marvels <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> system. This factual exposition was promoted by John Grierson.|$|R
5000|$|The usual {{form of the}} {{denomination}} is a number, optionally preceded or followed by a currency symbol. Many early stamps wrote {{the denomination}} out in words, but the Universal Postal Union later required that stamps on international mail use Arabic numerals, {{for the benefit of}} clerks in foreign countries. A number of recent stamps have substituted a textual description of the rate being charged, such as [...] "1st" [...] for first-class letters, or [...] "presorted ZIP+4" [...] to indicate a <b>particular</b> type <b>of</b> bulk <b>mail.</b> Another form <b>of</b> nonnumerical denomination is that used for rate change stamps, in which the timing and politics of the rate-setting process is such that the stamps must be printed before the rate is known. In such cases, the preprinted stamps simply state [...] "A", [...] "B", etc., with the equivalent rate being announced just before they go on sale.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} highlights one of {{the typical}} and actual problems of the Albanian culture: {{the phenomenon of the}} so called bloodthirsty “revenge”. The revenge is subordinate to the lex talionis “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”, a traditional law in the Albanian culture, which mantains its power since the laws of the Albanion State do not have the due authority to controlthe tradition of the “kanun” which signifies “canon” of the mountains, which encourages the global destruction of the person till her total elimination, the death penalty.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two threads in {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art: a networking approach dedicated to open participation and a crafted approach dedicated to the art object. It then follows these two threads across three generations. Mail art is an international phenomenon that evolved over the past sixty odd years due {{to the efforts of}} a dedicated and growing group of individuals. American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network, making it a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art today...|$|R
