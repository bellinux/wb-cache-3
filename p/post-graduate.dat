40|$|One {{important}} {{incentive for}} a regional, decentralised university- and college structure is that {{higher education institutions}} should supply the local labour markets with sufficient high-educated labour. Local and regional recruitment to studies {{is expected to increase}} the probability that <b>post-graduates</b> will stay in the regions after studies. The main aim of the paper is to investigate the function of the higher education institution due to the local, regional and national recruitment to high education and the local, regional and national distribution of the supply of <b>post-graduates.</b> The investigation is first based on the geographical recruitment to university and college graduation in the year of 2002 by the regional residential background of students defined by categories of regions by distance from the region of study. Second, the regional distribution of the supply of <b>post-graduates</b> is based on all students in the year of 2004 that were not in education in the year of 2005 and their regional settlement in the years of 2007 and 2010 measured relatively to their region of study. National average indicates a higher local supply of <b>post-graduates</b> compared with the local recruitment. Small deviation in the geographical distribution of <b>post-graduates</b> between the years of 2007 and 2010 indicates that regional adjustments among <b>post-graduates</b> mostly take place during their studies or just after their graduation. It is detected small gender deviation between the share of recruitment and supply of <b>post-graduates</b> within the regions of study, while the female percentage increases when extending the local area to cover the remaining local county. Furthermore, it is observed higher local recruitment to studies and higher local supply of <b>post-graduates</b> among older than younger students. The local supply of <b>post-graduates</b> is higher among students finishing a short higher graduation compared with those obtaining a master or a doctoral degree. Business and administration, humanities and arts, education and health, welfare and sports are the fields of education that show the highest local recruitment, while the highest local supply of <b>post-graduates</b> is found in the fields of education of social science and low and humanities and arts, while health, welfare and sports and education increase their local importance when including the remaining local county as part of the local area. There are observed strong variations in local recruitment and local supply of <b>post-graduates</b> between the regional levels of centrality and between single regions within equal centralities indicating a heterogeneous local structure of recruitment to studies and supply of <b>post-graduates</b> across regions even when controlling for the fields of education structure. The most central regions show, however, higher local supply of <b>post-graduates</b> than the local recruitment to studies suggest...|$|R

5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} <b>post-graduate</b> student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E

40|$|The first aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze if any {{correlation}} exists between the <b>post-graduate’s</b> and the tutor’s difficulty evaluation of the same tooth to be extracted. Secondly, the study aimed to verify whether, and possibly which, anatomical/topographic characteristics of the impacted lower third molar influence the <b>post-graduate’s</b> difficulty evaluation. Thirdly, patient’s age and gender were studied for any influence either on the <b>post-graduate’s</b> and tutor’s extraction difficulty evaluation or on surgical time. Lastly, the possible effect of the <b>post-graduate’s</b> difficulty evaluation on the incidence of surgical accidents was also studied. Eighty-four impacted mandibular third molars have been retrospectively reviewed. For each molar, pre- and operative information have been collected. The Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation, the general linear model with backward stepwise procedure, the variance analysis and the logistic regression were used for inferential statistics. Correlation between the <b>post-graduate’s</b> and tutor’s difficulty evaluation of each lower third molar to be extracted as well as between difficulty evaluation and operative time were statistically significant. Tooth position, impaction depth and relationship with the inferior alveolar nerve influenced operative times. Pre-surgical difficult degree had a positive significant effect on accident occurrence. The pre-operative post-graduates' difficulty evaluation did not differ from their post-operative evaluation although their judgement differed from that given by the tutor and did not correlate with the operative time. Lower third molar extraction difficulty seems to be influenced by some topographic factors such as tooth position, impaction depth and relationship between inferior alveolar nerve and impacted tooth...|$|R
