40|$|Within <b>power</b> <b>generation,</b> aging <b>assets</b> and an {{emphasis}} on more efficient operation of power systems and improved maintenance decision methods {{has led to a}} growing focus on asset prognostics. The main challenge facing the implementation of successful <b>asset</b> prognostics in <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> is the lack of available run-to-failure data. This paper proposes to overcome this issue by use of full-scope high-fidelity simulators to generate the run-to-failure data required. From this simulated failure data a similarity-based prognostic approach is developed for estimating the remaining useful life of a valve asset. Case study data is generated by initializing prebuilt industrial failure models within a 970 MW pressurized water reactor simulation. Such full-scope high-fidelity simulators are mainly operated for training purposes, allowing personnel to gain experience of standard operation as well as failures within a safe, simulated operating environment. This paper repurposes such a high-fidelity simulator to generate the type of data and affects that would be produced {{in the event of a}} fault. The fault scenario is then run multiple times to generate a library of failure events. This library of events was then split into training and test batches for building the prognostic model. Results are presented and conclusions drawn about the success of the technique and the use of high-fidelity simulators in this manner...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the field}} of <b>power</b> <b>generation,</b> aging <b>assets</b> and a desire for {{improved}} maintenance decision-making tools have led to growing interest in asset prognostics. Valve failures can account for 7 % or more of mechanical failures, and since a conventional power station will contain many hundreds of valves, this represents a significant asset base. This paper presents a prognostic approach for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of valves experiencing degradation, utilizing a similarity-based method. Case study data is generated through simulation of valves within a 400 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power station. High fidelity industrial simulators are often produced for operator training, to allow personnel to experience fault procedures and take corrective action in a safe, simulation environment, without endangering staff or equipment. This work repurposes such a high fidelity simulator to generate the type of condition monitoring data which would be produced {{in the presence of}} a fault. A first principles model of valve degradation was used to generate multiple run-to-failure events, at different degradation rates. The associated parameter data was collected to generate a library of failure cases. This set of cases was partitioned into training and test sets for prognostic modeling and the similarity based prognostic technique applied to calculate RUL. Results are presented of the technique’s accuracy, and conclusions are drawn about the applicability of the technique to this domain. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a techno-economic performance simulation and diagnostics computational {{system for the}} operations optimisation and risk management of a CCGT power station. The project objective {{was to provide a}} technological solution to a business problem originated at the Manx Electricity Authority (MEA). The CCGT performance simulation program was created from the integration of existing and new performance simulation codes of the main components of a CCGT power station using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Excel ®. The specifications of the real gas turbine (GT) engines at MEA demanded the modification of Turbomatch, a GT performance simulation code developed at Cranfield University. The new capabilities were successfully validated against previous work in the public domain. In the case of the steam cycle, the model for a double pressure once-through steam generator (OTSG) was produced. A novel approach using theoretical thermohydraulic models for heat exchangers and empiric correlations delivered positive results. Steamomatch, another code developed at the university, was used for the steam turbine performance simulation. An economic module based on the practitioners’ definition for spark spread was developed. The economic module makes use of the technical results, which are permanently accessible through the user interface of the system. The assessment of an existing gas turbine engine performance diagnostics system, Pythia, was made. The study tested the capabilities of the program under different ambient and operating conditions, signal noise levels and sensor faults. A set of guidelines aimed to increase the success rate of the diagnostic under the data and sensor restricted scenario presented by at MEA was generated. Once the development phase was concluded, technical and economic studies on the particular generation schedule for a cold day of winter 2007 were conducted. Variable ambient and operating conditions for each of the 48 time block forming the schedule were considered. The results showed error values below the 2 % band for key technical parameters such as fuel flow, thermal efficiency and power output. On the economic side, the study quantified the loss making operation strategy of the plant during the offpeak market period of the day. But it also demonstrated the profit made during the peak hours lead to an overall positive cash flow for the day. A number of optimisation strategies to increase the profitability of the plant were proposed highlighting the economic benefit of them. These scenarios were based on the technical performance simulation of the plant under these specific conditions, increasing the reliability of the study. Finally, a number of risk management strategies aimed to protect the operations of a power generator from the main technical and economic risk variables were outlined. It was concluded that the use of techno-economic advanced tools such as eCCGT and Pythia can positively affect the way an operator manages a <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>asset</b> through the implementation of virtually proven optimisation and risk management strategies.
