40|$|Axiom <b>pinpointing</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} in description logics (DLs) to help the used understand the reasons why consequences hold by computing minimal subsets {{of the knowledge base}} that have the con-sequence in consideration. Several <b>pinpointing</b> algorithms have been described as extensions of the standard tableau-based reasoning algo-rithms for deciding consequences from DL knowledge bases. Although these extensions are based on similar ideas, they are all introduced for a particular tableau-based algorithm for a particular DL, using spe-ci c traits of them. In the past, we have developed a general approach for extending tableau-based algorithms into <b>pinpointing</b> algorithms. In this paper we explore some issues of termination of general tableaux and their <b>pinpointing</b> extensions. We also dene a subclass of tableaux that allows the use of so-called blocking conditions, which stop the execution of the algorithm once a pattern is found, and adapt the <b>pinpointing</b> extensions accordingly, guaranteeing its correctness and termination. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Axiom <b>pinpointing</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} in description logics (DL) to help the user understand the reasons why consequences hold by computing minimal subsets {{of the knowledge base}} that have the conse-quence in question (MinA). Most of the <b>pinpointing</b> algorithms described in the DL literature are obtained as extensions of tableau-based reason-ing algorithms for computing consequences from DL knowledge bases. In this paper, we show that automata-based algorithms for reasoning in DLs can also be extended to <b>pinpointing</b> algorithms. The idea is that the tree automaton constructed by the automata-based approach can be trans-formed into a weighted tree automaton whose so-called behaviour yields a <b>pinpointing</b> formula, i. e., a monotone Boolean formula whose minimal valuations correspond to the MinAs. We also develop an approach for computing the behaviour of a given weighted tree automaton. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ontologies are the {{backbone}} of the Semantic Web as they allow one to share vocabulary in a semantically sound way. For ontologies, specified in OWL or a related web ontology language, Description Logic reasoner can often detect logical contradictions. Unfortunately, there are two drawbacks: they lack in support for debugging incoherence in ontologies, and they can only be applied to reasonably expressive ontologies (containing at least some sort of negation). In this paper, we attempt to close these gaps using a technique called <b>pinpointing.</b> In <b>pinpointing</b> we identify minimal sets of axioms which need to be removed or ignored to turn an ontology coherent. We then show how <b>pinpointing</b> can be used for debugging of web ontologies in two typical cases. More unusual is the application of <b>pinpointing</b> in the semantic clarification of underspecified web ontologies which we experimentally evaluate on a number of well-known web-ontologies. Our findings are encouraging: even though semantic ambiguity remains an issue, we show that <b>pinpointing</b> can be useful for debugging, and that it can significantly improve the quality of our semantic enrichment in a fully automatic way. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{enumeration}} of minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) finds {{a growing}} number of practical applications, that includes a wide range of diagnosis problems. As a concrete example, the problem of axiom <b>pinpointing</b> in the EL family of description logics (DLs) can be modeled as the enumeration of the group-MUSes of Horn formulae. In turn, axiom <b>pinpointing</b> for the EL family of DLs finds important applications, such as debugging medical ontologies, of which SNOMED CT is the best known example. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} develop an efficient group-MUS enumerator for Horn formulae, HGMUS, that finds immediate application in axiom <b>pinpointing</b> for the EL family of DLs. In the process of developing HGMUS, the paper also identifies performance bottlenecks of existing solutions. The new algorithm is shown to outperform all alternative approaches when the problem domain targeted by group-MUS enumeration of Horn formulae is axiom <b>pinpointing</b> for the EL family of DLs, with a representative suite of examples taken from different medical ontologies...|$|R
