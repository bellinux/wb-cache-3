Efficient gain was measured in 30 micron thick cells with two incident beams having the same intensity. We present a model of two-beam coupling gain based on the build-up and discharge of surface charge screening layers, spatially modulated due to the photoconductivity of doped PVK. The simulation of electric field distribution inside a liquid crystal cell for different two-beam coupling grating spacing showed different penetration of field into the liquid crystal bulk. The characteristics of dynamics, magnitude of two-beam coupling and the efficiency of diffraction were determined for different values of applied DC field, cell configuration and liquid crystals.

40|$|Nano-objects with {{well defined}} {{structures}} and original electronic properties are {{of great interest}} {{for the development of}} new generation circuits. Their intrinsic nanometer scale, potentially associated with novel functionalities, is particularly interesting to complement CMOS. However, it is very unlikely that conventional architectures developed so far for the CMOS technology will be ideally suited for these new objects. These architectures can barely cope with any significant variation in either electrical characteristics or placement of individual devices, which are an inherent particularity of most nano-devices. On the other side, adaptive circuits such as neural networks represent a challenging approach which intends {{to take advantage of the}} rich functionality of nano-size building blocks and at the same time to manage variability. In this context, functionalized carbon nanotube field effect transistors are of special relevance as they combine exceptional electrical performances with additional functionalities such as sensing and memory capabilities.

40|$|A novel ODEP (optical dielectrophoresis) chip using a polymer {{photoconductive}} {{material and}} fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive film is demonstrated to manipulate micron-sized polystyrene beads. Instead {{of using the}} traditional hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as photoconductive layers, a thin film of a mixture of poly (3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methylester (PCBM) <b>photoconductive</b> <b>polymer</b> is used in this novel ODEP chip. When the polymer layer is illuminated by a light beam, many electron-hole pairs are created, which increase the conductivity of the polymer. Consequently, localized non-uniform electric field can be generated when an AC bias is applied across the ODEP chip, and localized DEP forces are then generated. The distribution of electrical field induced by a ring-shaped optical electrode is simulated and the maximum trapping velocity is calculated according to Stokes&# 39; law for this ODEP chip. The effect of the polymer thickness to {{the magnitude of the}} generated DEP force has also been investigated. The maximum trapping velocity and the induced DEP force exerted on 20 μm polystyrene beads are estimated to be 77 μm/s and 15 pN, respectively. Finally, performance of the polymer-based ODEP chip is compared with an a-Si:H-based ODEP chip by trapping and sorting polystyrene beads with identical parameters. The experimental results indicate that the polymer photoconductive material used in our work is promising for rapid fabrication of ODEP chips for microparticles manipulation.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is derived from experimentation {{in the field of}} polymeric photorefractive materials. Low T(_g) polymeric composites were prepared, based on the well-known <b>photoconductive</b> <b>polymer</b> PVK (maximum 50 % w/w), sensitized with TNF (2 % w/w) and C(_ 60) (0. 2 % w/w), plasticized with ECZ (maximum 49. 3 % w/w) and doped with the nonlinear optical materials NPP (50 % w/w), DAN (20 % w/w), DED (5 % w/w), DCNQI (0. 5 % w/w), ULTRA-DEMI (5 % w/w) and DI-DEMI (2 % w/w), and their dielectric, linear and non linear optical properties were investigated. All the materials, except DCNQI, exhibited good solubility and sample processibility. The dielectric properties of the composites at 1 KHz and 1 MHz were determined using a parallel-plate capacitance bridge. The dielectric constant and loss at 10 GHz were measured using a novel adaptation of the resonant cavity technique, which was designed for measurements at ambient and elevated temperatures. The method was used to measure of the dielectric constant and loss of two novel, high T(_g), electro-optic polymers at temperatures up to 100 ºC. The dielectric properties measured were typical of polymeric materials. The absorption coefficient and the refractive index at different wavelengths were measured using a spectrophotometer. For the refractive index, an interference fringe analysis was used. The nonlinear measurements consisted of second harmonic generation, to prove the nonhnearity of the composites, two-beam coupling measurements, to prove their photorefractivity and degenerate four-wave mixing to measure their diffraction efficiency. The NPP, DAN, DED and ULTRA-DEMI doped investigated composites exhibited second order nonlinearity with highest the one of ULTRA-DEMI, at 292 pm/V for 19 kV of corona poling field. The photorefractivity of the NPP, DAN and DED doped composites was proven at 632. 8 nm, while ULTRA-DEMI doped composites photooxidized before any measurements were possible. The two-beam coupling coefficients measured were lower than 20 cm(^- 3), while net gain was observed only in the NPP doped composite. The diffraction efficiencies of the NPP, DAN and DED doped composites were measured at 632. 8 nm, and were found to be l 0 (^- 5) -l 0 (^- 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Quickly updatable {{hologram}} images using photorefractive (PR) polymer composite {{based on}} poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVCz) is presented. PVCz {{is one of}} the pioneer materials of <b>photoconductive</b> <b>polymers.</b> PR polymer composite consists of 44 wt % of PVCz, 35 wt % of 4 -azacycloheptylbenzylidene-malonitrile (7 -DCST) as a nonlinear optical dye, 20 wt % of carbazolylethylpropionate (CzEPA) as a photoconductive plasticizer and 1 wt % of 2, 4, 7 -trinitro- 9 -fluorenone (TNF) as a sensitizer. PR composite gives high diffraction efficiency of 68 % at E = 45 V μm− 1 . Response speed of optical diffraction is the key parameter for real-time 3 D holographic display. The key parameter for obtaining quickly updatable holographic images is to control the glass transition temperature lower enough to enhance chromophore orientation. Object image of the reflected coin surface recorded with reference beam at 532 nm (green beam) in the PR polymer composite is simultaneously reconstructed using a red probe beam at 642 nm. Instead of using a coin object, an object image produced by a computer was displayed on a spatial light modulator (SLM) and used for the hologram. The reflected object beam from an SLM was interfered with a reference beam on PR polymer composite to record a hologram and simultaneously reconstructed by a red probe beam...|$|R
40|$|<b>Photoconductive</b> <b>polymers</b> are doped into liquid {{crystals}} {{to create}} a new mechanism for space-charge field formation in photorefractive liquid crystal composites. The composites contain poly(2, 5 -bis(2 {prime}-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene) (BEH-PPV) and the electron acceptor N,N{prime}-dioctyl- 1, 4 : 5, 8 -naphthalenediimide, NI. Using asymmetric energy transfer (beam coupling) measurements that are diagnostic for the photorefractive effect, the direction of beam coupling as a function of grating fringe spacing inverts at a spacing of 5. 5 {micro}m. We show that the inversion is due to a change in the dominant mechanism for space-charge field formation. At small fringe spacings, the space-charge field is formed by ion diffusion in which the photogenerated anion is the more mobile species. At larger fringe spacings, the polarity of the space charge field inverts due to dominance of a charge transport mechanism in which photogenerated holes are the most mobile species due to hole migration along the BEH-PPV chains coupled with interchain hole hopping. Control experiments are presented, which use composites that can access only one of the two charge transport mechanisms. The results show that charge migration over long distances leading to enhanced photorefractive effects can be obtained using conjugated polymers dissolved in liquid crystals...|$|R
40|$|In {{liquid crystal}} cells with <b>photoconductive</b> poly(N-vinlyl carbazole) <b>polymer</b> layers, an {{external}} dc field can be completely screened by surface charge layers that develop at the liquid crystal–polymer interface. Under spatially modulated illumination, surface charge layers can be discharged in bright areas {{and lead to}} reorientation and spatially modulated Freedericksz transition. As a result, an asymmetric energy exchange in the photorefractive two-beam coupling process can take place. We propose a model to explain the origin of reorientation and phase shift in the two-beam coupling process, based on the profile and tilt of the refractive index grating. We also show that cells with just one photoconducting layer are more efficient than a typical design with two layers...|$|R
40|$|Scope. The {{body of work}} {{described}} in this thesis focuses on the synthesis of donor-acceptor architectures of the pseudorotaxane, rotaxane, and catenane genres. The binding constants of thiophene and phenylene-ethynylene based crown ethers are determined via fluorescence quenching titrations, {{in an attempt to}} correlate structure with binding affinities. The insight obtained from the binding constant determinations allows for the proper choice of crown ether for the formation of [2]-catenanes and [2]-rotaxanes. The electronic properties of these complexes are then probed by electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and conductivity measurements. The potential of a poly([2]-catenane) as a <b>photoconductive</b> <b>polymer</b> is also investigated. The obstacles encountered in synthesizing poly([2]-rotaxanes) is also discussed, with emphasis on end-group strategies that aid in thwarting electrochemically induced dethreading. Chapter 1. This chapter provides a broad overview of the physical methods utilized in this thesis. Electrochemical methods are covered, with particular emphasis on oxidative polymerization of heteroaromatic monomers. Correlation between electrode phenomena and cyclic voltammogram waveshapes is included, in order to reinforce an understanding of the various electrochemical processes. Electroactive catenane and rotaxane supramolecules feature prominent in the literature, and a brief overview of significant examples is given. Advanced electrochemical techniques regarding in-situ conductivity measurements and spectroelectrochemistry are discussed. The elucidation of binding affinities for hosts and guest via fluorescence spectroscopy, a major theme in Chapter 2, is presented with focus on interpreting Stern-Volmer plots. (cont.) A lengthy discussion of photovoltaic devices emphasizing I-V, C-V, and photoaction spectra interpretation is presented with relevant literature examples. Chapter 2. The synthesis of halo-functionalized crown ethers and efforts toward improving reaction yields for the macrocyclization are presented. Subsequent functionalization of the crown ethers with acetylide and thiophene groups via cross-coupling reactions, provides a wealth of receptors for the analyte paraquat. The affinities of the macrocycles for paraquat are determined through Stern-Volmer fluorescence quenching experiments. Correlations between structure and binding constants indicate that a-stacking interactions in two parallel planes, as seen for thiophene derivatized crown ether 33, affords the greatest complimentarity with paraquat, Ksv = 9665 +/- 179 M- 1. Acetylide functionalized crown ethers tend to have the weakest binding affinities, attributed to the poorer - extension. Increasing the electron-donating nature of the thiophene function as seen for 23 versus 15 leads to the doubling of the binding constant. Multiple crown ether receptor 29 does not display a non-linear Stern-Volmer plot, indicating that a single binding event occurs for this molecule. Relative to its monocrown analog 25, the binding constant for 29 is 1. 2 x larger, hinting at cooperativity between crown ether units. Chapter 3. Electrochemical studies on [2]-catenane 38, its non-catenated analog 23, and their respective polymers are undertaken in an effort to quantify the electronic disparity between the differing architectures [...] . by Davide Louis Simone.
