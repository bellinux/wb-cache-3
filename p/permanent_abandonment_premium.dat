This slide continued into the Great Depression as the line lay idle and more residents were forced to close their businesses and move elsewhere to find work. Despite road contact finally being made through Manchester in the late 1930s, little remained to induce people to linger and the few remaining residents began to die off or move away, with many relocating to nearby De Smet or Huron. Having lost many of its residents and its primary means of attracting more, Manchester's population steadily dwindled until a core population {{of no more than}} 100 residents remained, with most operating farms and ranches outside the town limits. The CNW railroad officially announced its <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the railroad line in 1986 and stopped maintaining the tracks.

30|$|With the {{widespread}} drilling of gas wells in Marcellus shale, there are high potentials for wellbore instability problems when wells {{are located in}} longwall mining areas, which in many areas such as southwest Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and eastern Ohio are being used for extraction of the coal seam overlaying the gas reserves. The ground deformation, caused by coal mining, could generate large horizontal displacement and complex stress change in subsurface rock. This in turn triggers ground movement which can cause casing failure, and thus interruption {{in the operation of}} the well that raises safety and environmental concerns. This could result in shutting down the well for repair, or <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment.</b> Thus, it is critical to characterize the parameters related to the longwall mining process and to propose a general casing design guideline in such areas. In this paper, numerical modeling was utilized to simulate the complex ground conditions and resulting stresses and strains in longwall mining areas. A casing design spreadsheet was then constructed for design of appropriate selection of casings, {{based on the results of}} the numerical modeling. Our results were validated with field practices of wellbore design in southwest Pennsylvania. This paper also provides a methodology for investigating potential ground deformations, resulting stress/strain changes, and wellbore stability issues for oil and gas wells drilled in longwall mining areas in Marcellus shale or similar formations worldwide with active coal mining activities.|$|R

The Roman influence was felt in many different fields, changing food, dress and trade habits and left deep marks in the interior of the settlements, such as in the typology of dwellings and urban modifications that were not always well achieved. With the advent of Romanization some villages were extinguished, but not all of them. “Cidade Velha” of Santa Luzia, Castelo de Neiva and St. Lawrence Castro are more than convincing examples.

40|$|An {{abandoned}} {{animal feeding}} facility {{is a significant}} threat to the environment. Procedures {{to minimize the risk}} are discussed. Feedlot abandonment occurs for various reasons, including economic and social changes, environmental concerns, consolidation for more cost effective management and operation, and modification of personal goals. Whether a feedlot is abandoned for a short time until some crisis passes, or permanently, steps are necessary to minimize the risk of environmental degradation. Under both scenarios, an abandoned feedlot poses an immediate threat to surface and groundwater quality. The unused facility is also a potential nuisance and source of health problems for humans and animals. The purpose of this NebGuide is to identify guidelines that will minimize environmental risk associated with feedlot abandonment. No matter how long the period of non-use is expected to be, manure should be removed to minimize transport of manure from the site via runoff and the risk of groundwater pollution. In all instances the risk of accidental entry into manure storages and holding ponds by animals and people must be minimized. Abandonment for periods exceeding one to two months during spring, summer or fall requires steps to control weeds and insects. Abandonment during any time of year dictates a need for rodent control in pens, feeding areas, and around feed storage facilities. With long-term or <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment,</b> the challenge is to return the lot area to productive crop growth in the shortest feasible time...|$|R
40|$|The {{useful life}} of an {{offshore}} well {{is determined by the}} reserves which it contacts, the pressure support within the reservoir and the continued integrity of the wellbore. When a well has reached the end of its lifetime, plugging operations have to be conducted before <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment.</b> Conventional Plug and Abandonment (P&A) operations will often require removing a section of the casing in order to create cross sectional barriers for well abandonment. Recently developed and field tested technology has the potential of efficiently setting cross sectional reservoir barriers without casing removal. Access to the annuli can be achieved through perforation and then the perforated interval can be washed prior to setting a P&A barrier. By deploying a wireline rig-up it can be possible to set a reservoir barrier prior to removal of the previously installed production or injection tubing. Wireline work can also provide information about the well integrity which can determine the potential for setting further reservoir barriers with minimum removal of tubulars. Further development of technology necessary to safely abandon wells with minimum removal of tubulars can provide cost efficient and robust plugging methods for abandoning offshore oil or gas fields without the need of deploying a drilling rig. This thesis will introduce methods of setting P&A barriers with minimal removal of tubulars as the main focus. Descriptions of various plugging operations will be given. Considerations regarding the critical factors encountered during plugging operations will be discussed, more specifically the current condition of wellbore integrity and the barrier envelope necessary to prevent uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons during or after plugging operations...|$|R
40|$|In {{rural areas}} of Central Africa, on an average infants are breast fed 13 times per day during first 12 months. This is {{considered}} to be due to the poor nutritional status of mothers, and lack of milk is compensate for by frequent breast-feeding. Postpartum amenorrhoea is exceptionally prolonged, up to two years after childbirth, and certain indications suggest that mother's poor nutritional state is in a large part responsible for this. There is an influence of nutritional state on reappearance of menstruation in the postpartum period and also on length of fertility. Infanticide and <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment</b> of infants was widespread in many levels of western society up to the beginning of 20 th century. Physicians reestablished the mother-child relationship and advocated breast-feeding as the best way to nourish a baby. Recently a trend towards promoting maternal breast-feeding has developed and it is likely to observe new changes in infants' diet in next 10 years. A study showed all mothers nursed their infants at birth but urban mothers produced more milk compared to mothers in rural areas, whereas the latter had shorter duration of post partum amenorrhoea. In the city, mothers who have to leave their children for some part of the day cannot breast-feed in optimal fashion; and the economic level does not allow for a sufficient diet for baby based on commercial baby food. Many of the babies who do not die are drawn into a vicious cycle of malnutrition and disease that will leave them physically and intellectually stunted for life. There are factors other than formula feeding which is responsible for a decrease in breast-feeding practice. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Classic period farmers {{living in}} the Tonto Basin, Arizona faced a diverse and rapidly {{fluctuating}} physical and social environment. The archaeological evidence is presented for changing adaptive strategies implemented by the inhabitants. The resulting account of variation in prehistoric agricultural practices depicts the range of options available to farmers in the Tonto Basin during the Classic period,to farmers in the Tonto Basin during the Classic period,explores the choices they made, and examines the results and consequences of those choices. The core of the research is the niacrobotanical analysis of 617 flotation samples from 54 archaeological sites. At least 62 different plant taxa were identified, including I I cultigens and 51 gathered wild plants. Three very different crop systems were identified, the warm-season annuals, cool-season grasses, and agave, a succulent rosette perennial. Each of these has a distinct, yet complementary growth history. Two fundamental adaptive strategies were identified, upland dry farming and irrigated alluvial terrace agriculture. Plant production dominated the subsistence economy throughout the Classic period. During the time span covered by the study, alternating droughts and heavy floods struck the basin around A.

40|$|Cybersecurity {{has become}} a key factor that determines {{the success or failure}} of {{companies}} that rely on information systems. Therefore, investment in cybersecurity is an important financial and operational decision. Typical information technology investments aim to create value, whereas cybersecurity investments aim to minimize loss incurred by cyber attacks. Admittedly, cybersecurity investment {{has become a}}n increasingly complex one since information systems are typically subject to frequent attacks, whose arrival and impact fluctuate stochastically. Further, cybersecurity measures and improvements, such as patches, become available at random points in time making investment decisions even more challenging. We propose and develop an analytical real options framework that incorporates major components relevant to cybersecurity practice, and analyze how optimal cybersecurity investment decisions perform for a private firm. The novelty of this paper is that it provides analytical solutions that lend themselves to intuitive interpretations regarding the effect of timing and cybersecurity risk on investment behavior using real options theory. Such aspects are frequently not implemented within economic models that support policy initiatives. However, if these are not properly understood, security controls will not be properly set resulting in a dynamic inefficiency reflected in cycles of over or under investment, and, in turn, increased cybersecurity risk following corrective policy actions. Results indicate that greater uncertainty over the cost of cybersecurity attacks raises the value of an embedded option to invest in cybersecurity. This increases the incentive to suspend operations temporarily in order to install a cybersecurity patch that will make the firm more resilient to cybersecurity breaches. Similarly, greater likelihood associated with the availability of a cybersecurity patch increases the value of the option to invest in cybersecurity. However, absence of an embedded investment option increases the incentive to delay the <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the company’s operation due to the irreversible nature of the decision...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{symbolic and}} political {{discourse in the}} works of three controversial intellectuals who participate in the contemporary debate on nationalisms in Spain. Basque poet and essayist Jon Juaristi (b. 1951), after brief involvement in ETA during the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, evolved into one of Spain 2 ̆ 7 s most outspoken critics of Basque nationalism, a position that led to death threats from ETA and eventually his <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the region. After founding his theater company Els Joglars in 1962, Catalan playwright Albert Boadella (b. 1943) used it as a vehicle to fight the Francoist dictatorship and promote a Catalan nationalist agenda. However, he eventually reversed his position on the issue of Catalan and Spanish nationalisms and became a political enemy to many in his home region. Finally, Basque filmmaker Julio Medem (b. 1958) caused outrage throughout much of Spain in 2003 with a documentary film exploring the clash between Spanish and Basque identities. In my examination of Boadella 2 ̆ 7 s and Juaristi 2 ̆ 7 s autobiographies and Medem 2 ̆ 7 s documentary I explore the ways each author portrays himself as subverting, transgressing, or transcending the sub-state nationalisms that are virtually hegemonic in their regions, and I reveal how each author 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of gender, especially his representations of masculinity, either undermines or substantiates the purportedly 2 ̆ 2 non-nationalist 2 ̆ 2 position he stakes. I argue that Juaristi 2 ̆ 7 s and Boadella 2 ̆ 7 s restrictive, traditionalist gender constructions reveal conservative Spanish nationalist discourses which prevent them from surpassing the rigid power structures that nourish the opposition between Spain 2 ̆ 7 s center and periphery, while Medem 2 ̆ 7 s cinematic work does present the possibility of breaking free from the boundaries of the conflict of national identities through the transcendence of patriarchal nationalist symbolism - both Basque and Spanish...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe main {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate challenges in satisfying rules and regulations set by regulatory bodies, constrains related to the well status {{as well as the}} limitation of technology available to perform plugging and abandonment activities. IOSS and NCA have joined resources in development of state of the art technology especially for full commercialization in P&A operations. It is required to provide suitable technical solutions to show to the authority that P&A for shut in well category 2 & 3 can normally be performed safely and successfully by fit for purpose intervention facilities as accomplished by drilling rigs. This will be a favorable solution for oil operating companies taking into consideration their determination toward IOR philosophy for subsea wells. Safety authorities require a good quality of P&A operation that provides an eternal sealing arrangement to isolate reservoir fluids migration up to the sea surface. Therefore primary strategy was to establish a clear understanding of the state of a shut in well to be abandoned and the means to establish barriers to control well pressure prior to commencement of the P&A campaign as required by the authorities. A thorough study of guidelines related to selection and location of WBE is dealt with, especially the technology available for deployment of tools downhole when setting plugs. This forms the design bases for top side equipment capability needed for handling heavy lifts of subsea WCP packages, SLIS or riser system and BHA while performing P&A activities. Based on evaluation {{of the state of the}} art of technology available today and exploration of the scope of work required to be accomplished on P&A operation for shut in well category 1 to 3, it is recommended that <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment</b> by use of small intervention facilities be done since is as well economically a viable solution. The major constrain in this work was the limitation in acquiring technical information for P&A operation since most of the information and experience available is not well shared in the industry and lack of supporting literature. It was necessary to gather technical information from experienced personnel who directly have been involved or performed P&A operations.

40|$|This {{overall goal}} of the thesis {{is to use the}} archaeological and {{historical}} records to investigate the lifestyle of 19 th century Métis winterers or hivernants in the Lower Saskatchewan region. Excavations occurred at the archaeological site of Petite Ville, which is located {{on the banks of the}} South Saskatchewan river, north of Saskatoon. Petite Ville was home to approximately 40 Métis wintering families between 1870 and 1874. It was originally planned to excavate several areas of the site, preferably resulting in the identification and exposure of several structures for intra-site comparison. However, the initial excavations concentrated on an area that contained a very large building. The research shifted to an examination and assessment of the architecture and internal organization of the dwelling. The limited historical descriptions of Métis dwellings are biased by the observers' European backgrounds and it was hoped that the archaeological data would add new information and a greater understanding of 19 th century hivernant Métis homes. The architectural remains and artifact assemblage was used to assess the spatial dimensions and organization of the structure and immediately surroundings. The structural remains represent the largest Métis hivernant structure excavated at present (20 m x 6. 5 m) which appears to have three rooms. Each room is hypothesized to house a Métis family and the structure may have housed more than 40 people. The artifact assemblage was also examined for clues about Métis consumption, trade and activities. The 14, 000 -piece assemblage is unique compared to other excavated hivernant sites because fine-screening was utilized for the entire excavation. This resulted in a collection of artifacts of which 80 % are less than 2 cm in size. The assemblage provided information on Métis society and activities, such as jewellery making and the use of fragile earthenware teacups. The assemblage also supports previous assertions that the Métis do not make stone tools and that lithics artifacts are primarily intrusive. Preliminary results of the faunal analysis were also included with thoughts on Métis diet and possible dietary stress caused by the decline of bison population. The results of the Petite Ville excavations were also compared to other archaeological hivernant sites (Buffalo Lake, Kajewski, Kis-sis-away Tanner's Camp and Four Mile Coulee). The inter-site comparison examined similarities and differences in Métis spatial organization and archaeological assemblages. The impact of seasonal and <b>permanent</b> <b>abandonment</b> on the archaeological record was also considered. It is hoped that the intra-and inter-site comparisons have added useful information for future archaeological and historical research into hivernant history and it is believed that the research goals of this study were accomplished...|$|R

The fifth chapter is focusing on the barriers, well barriers and well barrier acceptance criteria, and defines how the Norwegian management regulation section 5 is emphasizing that the barriers shall be established at all times. The sixth chapter of the thesis is highlighting the data selection process and present the scope of P&A activities by fields and major operating companies in NCS. The analysis part in chapter seven is focusing on the effects of the changes in regulation on issues related to; integrity, HSE, costs, effectiveness, resource utilisation and the need for the technology development in the field of P&A. The eighth chapter is the discussion part where I have interpreted and described the significance of the findings and the effects on the operations in the field of P&A: The chapter is explaining the developments in the regulation, challenges and main actors in the field. The primary source of data, information on wells and well status discussed with the currently available knowledge in the field. This thesis provides the overview of the changes in regulations, the need for more in-depth research in the field in the future. As it is presented in chapter nine for conclusions, the presenting findings are based on my experience with gathered data, communications with major oil and gas operating companies and with Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authorities. The finding from the thesis is clearly indicating the possibility for improvements in data quality, feedback from industry to students and researchers as well as evaluating the need for establishing a monitoring system for all permanently plugged wells...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} called Downhole Tubing Disposal {{developed}} by Oilfield Innovations for performing rigless <b>permanent</b> plug and <b>abandonment</b> is presented. Instead of pulling the production tubing, the tubing is weakened with longitudinal cuts which enables crushing of the tubing into the available liquid {{space of the}} constraining casing, effectively providing an unobstructed casing length where cement plugs can be set. By eliminating the requirement for a drilling rig, significant cost savings can be achieved. Evaluation of a full-scale experiment with a 2 3 / 8 ” tubing is given, and the plans for conducting a full-scale experiment with 4 ½” tubing is presented and discussed. Furthermore, a small-scale experiment was performed with the main objective being investigation {{of the influence of}} cutting pattern and radial clearance between compaction tube and constraint. The discussions from the three experiments are combined and further developed in terms of a real case of Downhole Tubing Disposal. No studies on chaotic crushing of constrained tubes have been found in the literature except for an experiment conducted by the inventors of Downhole Tubing Disposal. The data on the matter were therefore limited, which motivated the small-scale experiment. This experiment clearly shows that weakening a tube with longitudinal cuts reduces its axial compressive strength, and an increasing number of cuts further reduces this strength. Moreover, the compaction ratio increased significantly at moderate loads when more than two cuts were used. Calculations revealed that while a smaller constraining tube gave a reduced compaction ratio, the occupied cross-sectional area of the constraining tube increased at high loads. At moderate loads, the occupied cross-sectional area was identical for the different constraining tubes...|$|R
40|$|Historically {{and up to}} date, {{ordinary}} Portland cement (OPC) or {{a slight}} variation is {{the most widely used}} material for <b>permanent</b> Plug & <b>Abandonment</b> operation. However, there are several challenges related to cement usage. Apart from the placement of the product and the displacement of the fluid in place which will not be considered in this work, there is also the concern of long-term sealing capability. Also cement lack adequate mechanical properties such as compressive strength and has high shrinkage, to mention just a few. Therefore, the question has always been, does there exist or is it possible to develop an alternative material that can be placed easily and can develop very high compressive strength with eternity in view and that might possibly allow for a shorter plug length. The motivation behind this thesis experimental work is not just to develop a preferred alternative material to well plugging and abandonment, but to investigate how essential mechanical properties like compressive strength and tensile strength is developed and investigate how the mechanical integrity of aplite-based geopolymer material is impacted by compositional ratio of admixtures. Very few literature exist that discusses aplite-based geopolymer material. Therefore to extend the work done by previous researchers, we used a well-known retarder in oil well cement by applying it on the slurry design and see how it will delay the setting time. This thesis findings are of great practical importance to the drilling industry because the effect of adding additional micro silica was also investigated and reported. A scan electron microscopy (SEM) will further reveal the intermolecular counteraction of the geopolymer grain and how they contribute to strength of the material. After two months of laboratory experimental work and analysis of the results, it was discovered that sucrose addition to aplite-based geopolymer could retard the setting-time. Whereas addition of excess silica above a certain degree could prevent hardening of the geopolymer irrespective of the application of heat...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} it has been {{performed}} formation stress tests (FST) on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). These tests are performed for estimating the formation strength in wells. More strict regulations for well integrity on the NCS {{have led to a}} need for better and more precise treatment of the FST. Minimum formation stress is by NORSOK the preferred parameter as the well barrier (reg. fracturing) during drilling, production and <b>permanent</b> plugging and <b>abandonment.</b> To estimate this parameter extended leak off tests (XLOT) are the preferred method. Statoil ASA has performed several XLOT`s the last years (ca. 100). The information from these tests is gathered in a spreadsheet (StressAtlas) where some of the different parameters from each tests are structured together with general well information. One of the goals in this master thesis has been to structure these tests in a tool named Spotfire. This is a tool with capacity of handling large datasets. An additional usage is to analyze in great scale the different data and place them in their regional area with the help of coordinates. One of the challenges with this task is to gather all the needed information from each test. All data is not stored in StressAtlas, some of the information is stored in other databases. With Spotfire this problem can be solved by the use of SQL codes that connect the data from different databases. Another part of the task is to use the designed tool for interpretations and calculations. Regional differences of the minimum formation stress on the NCS have been analyzed and discussed. Overburden parameters as vertical stress and pore pressure influence on each of the regional zones have also been discussed by calculating the effective stress ratio for each of the tests. It has also been designed a universal equation for the NCS {{that can be used for}} estimating the minimum horizontal stress with depth and pore pressure as an input. Regional differences have been observed and it has been developed an equation for estimation of minimum horizontal stress on the Norwegian continental shelf that has a higher accuracy than previous equations. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway (PSA) has now {{acknowledged}} {{the use of}} shale as an annular barrier for <b>permanent</b> plug and <b>abandonment</b> (PP&A) operations in the oil industry. Shale can exhibit a natural self-sealing effect; a result from delayed deformation of the rock. It is believed that creep in combination with consolidation plays important roles in the process when shale closes in and forms a tight barrier around a well. For using shale as a permanent annular barrier {{it is important to}} comprehend how these time-dependent mechanisms are affected by externally induced parameters, like stress, temperature and chemical alterations of the pore fluid. The purpose of this master thesis is to investigate creep characteristics and consolidation effects in Pierre shale. Two literature studies have been completed and several laboratory experiments have been carried out on small size core plugs drilled normal to the bedding plane. Axial strain-time curves have been obtained by performing uniaxial compression tests with step loading at a temperature around 30 oC. The main objectives have been to identify how the creep and consolidation processes are affected by different stress levels and variations in the pore fluid pH. Eventually, the laboratory work resulted in four successful creep experiments. The obtained data showed that Pierre shale exhibits considerable time-dependent deformation in response to applied stress. Changing the stress conditions affected the amount of deformation in periods with constant stress and it appeared like the shale demonstrated different creep behavior before and after a certain test dependent stress level. It was also seen that the temperature variation increased with extended test time for the conducted experiments and the experimental results implied that p-wave velocities are related to strain as well as stress. In addition, the creep tests indicated a correlation between p-wave velocities and temperature. Finally, {{it was found that the}} pH value of the pore fluid had an impact on consolidation and creep properties. A lower pH value reduced the overall stiffness and strength of the samples, resulting in more consolidation. More creep deformation and increased creep rates were seen compared to a near-neutral pH environment...|$|R
