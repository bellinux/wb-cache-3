25|$|Conventional PCI, often {{shortened}} to PCI, is a {{local computer}} bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer. PCI is the initialism for <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> and {{is part of the}} PCI Local Bus standard. The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.|$|E
25|$|A kernel must {{maintain}} {{a list of}} available devices. This list may be known in advance (e.g. on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally called plug and play). In a plug and play system, a device manager first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Interconnect</b> (PCI) or Universal Serial Bus (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers.|$|E

40|$|A {{limited number}} of studies have shown that adults and {{adolescents}} with psychopathic traits suffer from emotional memory impairment. The present study examined whether this finding could be replicated in a sample of children between 8 and 12 ?years of age with callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Children with high CU traits (n?=? 24) were compared with children with low CU traits (n?=? 18) with regard to performance on a peripheral memory recognition test that examined memory for central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>components</b> of neutral and negative pictures. Results showed that overall recognition rates did not differ between the high- and low-CU groups. For negative pictures, both groups demonstrated better recognition of the central component {{at the expense of the}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>component,</b> while for neutral pictures, the <b>peripheral</b> <b>component</b> was better recognized than the central component. This study is the first to demonstrate that children with high CU traits do not suffer from an impaired emotional memory. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{experimentally}} observed {{phenomenon of}} non-equimolarity for enzyme components, assembled into multienzyme complexes of the 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenases family, is structurally interpreted {{to predict the}} only possible stable symmetrical distribution of <b>peripheral</b> <b>components</b> on the complex core. To obey the equivalent neighboring, that is necessary for unique self-assembled structures, we should deduce discrete conformational states for core subunits, those with different affinity for <b>peripheral</b> <b>components.</b> Two kinetically different types of substrate-intermediate pathways through the lipoyl network of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex follow from this structural theory.

40|$|International audienceSurrounding {{autonomous}} {{embedded devices}} {{are in a}} constant expansion. The advent {{and the rise of}} Internet of Things (IoT) enable these objects to take a giant step forward, especially regarding their large scale deployment in real-world applications of the everyday life. A significant part of these objects are battery-powered and energy-dependent. Thus, energy is a critical resource which greatly complicates the development of the embedded software. By decomposing the energy consumption of a battery-powered IoT device, we can see that <b>peripheral</b> <b>components</b> are the major contributors among the overall consumption. Indeed, these components are exploited and repeatedly used by the object to interact and communicate with its surrounding environment during all the application lifetime. Acquire the expertise to handle accurately, during the development stage, the behaviour of every on-board <b>peripheral</b> <b>component</b> is a big challenge to improve the development of IoT embedded applications. To guide the developer in this task, we propose an automated inference procedure of energy models for <b>peripheral</b> <b>components.</b> An accurate automata-based model of the energy consumption can be generated, with only little efforts from the developer, based on real runtime measurements, providing precise energy figures. The proposed process is focused on a lightweight code generation step and simple analyses of the energy output traces, allowing a quick regeneration of the models {{in the case of a}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>component</b> modification. We show the potentials of the proposed procedure by real experiments on real peripherals. The obtained results are satisfactory, and we believe that our proposition is able to enhance the embedded development in an energy-constrained environment...|$|R
