Thousands of <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reinforce these as the floodwaters continued to rise. Manpower was also used to gather ripened crops before the storm destroyed them.

500|$|Further {{allegations}} of homophobic content arose when a easter egg {{was discovered in}} the game's opening tutorial level. If the player remains idle {{for a brief period}} of time, they are able to hear one soldier ask another soldier about his sexuality, and then remark [...] "don't ask, don't tell". This easter egg references the United States policy [...] "Don't ask, don't tell", which prevented openly gay people from serving in the United States Armed Forces. Unlike the [...] "Fight Against Grenade Spam" [...] video, few journalists commented on the easter egg. Jim Sterling of Destructoid felt that the easter egg was [...] "too silly/stupid" [...] for him to be angry at, while James Sherwood of The Register commented that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> generate controversy over unimportant dialogue. Lyle Masaki of Logo TV's NewNowNext.com deemed the easter egg to be homophobic, but not representative of the game as a whole.|$|E

500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue.

500|$|The {{first game}} {{was to begin}} at 6pm CDT, with the second game to follow. Lorelei, a model who did public {{appearances}} for WLUP and who was very popular in Chicago that summer for her sexually provocative poses in the station's advertisements, threw out the first pitch. As the first game began, Mike Veeck got word that thousands of <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get into the park without tickets. [...] He sent his security personnel to the stadium gates to keep the would-be gate crashers at bay. This left the field unattended, and fans began throwing the uncollected disco LPs and singles from the stands. [...] Tigers designated hitter Rusty Staub remembered that the records would slice through the air, and land {{sticking out of the}} ground. [...] He urged teammates to wear batting helmets when playing their positions, [...] "It wasn't just one, it was many. [...] Oh, God almighty, I've never seen anything so dangerous in my life." [...] Attendees also threw firecrackers, empty liquor bottles, and lighters onto the field. The game was stopped several times because of the rain of foreign objects.|$|E
500|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was written}} by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and {{produced}} by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into {{the line of fire}} with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone". She further said that she [...] "loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that".|$|E

On Dyer's orders, his troops fired on the crowd for ten minutes, {{directing}} their bullets largely towards the few open gates through which <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> flee. The British government released figures stating 379 dead and 1,200 wounded. Other sources place the number of dead at well over 1,000. This [...] "brutality stunned the entire nation", resulting in a [...] "wrenching loss of faith" [...] {{of the general public}} in the intentions of the UK. The ineffective inquiry and the initial accolades for Dyer by the House of Lords fuelled widespread anger, leading to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920–22.|$|E
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a wonderfully}} {{cooperative}} young lady that needed direction. Had no technique and no real acting experience. She {{was engaged to}} marry Dick Zanuck. So in Planet of the Apes they put her in with Frank Schaffner, then in mine, they underwrote her. They had nothing {{for her to do}} in this one, except just be part of the sequel. In other words, she was so badly conceived in the writing that I had to conceive actions for her to make her belong to the piece. And the big action which I gave her – and I think she came off beautifully with it – was to try to understand what these <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> communicate to her. And struggling to understand and feeling sympathetic vibrations coming from these people. So I gave her something which was not in the script to play and she played that, I think, very simpatico, very beautifully." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tutchin was convinced, {{throughout}} his life, that corruption was rampant and that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> defraud {{the government or}} serve an anti-English master, and in 1699 he was rewarded with £12 for his officious [...] "saving {{so much of the}} bloody pickle which drained from the casks and binns which hold the flesh at the Victualling Office." [...] This was indicative, in a sense, of Tutchin's terrier-like concern. [...] At the same time, he grew disaffected by William's Dutch courtiers and wrote, in 1700 The Foreigners. [...] It was a very poor poem filled with xenophobia that outlined a Lockean position on the social contract and suggested that William was not a valid sovereign. [...] Tutchin was arrested, but, because he had slightly disguised the proper names of the figures he lampooned, the poem could be pronounced a [...] "seditious libel," [...] but Tutchin could not be tried for sedition. [...] Daniel Defoe answered Tutchin with The True-Born Englishman.|$|E

60|$|He {{reached the}} {{platform}} {{a few minutes}} after the train had arrived. That entire incapability of devising administrative measures for the management of large crowds, {{which is one of the}} characteristics of Englishmen in authority, is nowhere more strikingly exemplified than at York. Three different lines of railway assemble three passenger mobs, from morning to night, under one roof; and leave them to raise a traveler's riot, with all the assistance which the bewildered servants of the company can render to increase the confusion. The customary disturbance was rising to its climax as Captain Wragge approached the platform. Dozens of different <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> attain dozens of different objects, in dozens of different directions, all starting from the same common point and all equally deprived of the means of information. A sudden parting of the crowd, near the second-class carriages, attracted the captain's curiosity. He pushed his way in; and found a decently-dressed man--assisted by a porter and a policeman--attempting to pick up some printed bills scattered from a paper parcel, which his frenzied fellow-passengers had knocked out of his hand.|$|E
6000|$|In Boston and Cambridge Henry James {{at length}} touched a purely {{literary}} circle. The beginning of such fruitful friendships {{as those with}} Professor C. E. Norton and Mr. W. D. Howells meant his open and professed dedication to literature. The Harvard Law School left as little direct impression on him as any of his other exposures to ordinary teaching, but at last he had finished with these makeshifts. His new friends helped him into his proper channel. Under their auspices {{he made his way}} into publication and became a regular contributor of criticism and fiction to several journals and reviews. There followed some very uneventful and industrious years, disturbed to some extent by ill-health but broken by no long absences from Cambridge. His constant companion and literary confidant was Mr. Howells, who writes to me that 'people were very much struck with his work in the magazine'--the Atlantic Monthly, of which this friend was at that time assistant editor--'but mostly not pleased with it. It was a common thing to hear them say, [...] "Oh, yes, we like Mr. James very much, but we cannot bear his stories".' Mr. Howells adds: 'I could scarcely exaggerate the intensity of our literary association. It included not only what he was doing and thinking himself in fiction, and criticism of whatever he was reading, but what other <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do in our American magazines.' Beneath these activities we are to imagine the deep pre-occupation, growing and growing, of the idea of a possible return to Europe. It is not very clear why the satisfaction of his wish was delayed {{for as long as it}} was. His doubtful health can hardly have amounted to a hindrance, and the authority of his parents was far too light and sympathetic to stand in his way. Yet it is only by the end of 1868, as I find from a letter of that time, that a journey to Europe has 'ceased to look positively and aggressively impossible.' Thereafter things move more quickly, and three months later he arrives at the great moment, memorable ever afterwards, of his landing at Liverpool.|$|E
