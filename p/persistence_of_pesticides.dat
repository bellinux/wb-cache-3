A High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with an UV detector and an on-line radio-chemical detector, plus a Supelco Discovery column (250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 μm), and PRP- 1 column (305 x 7. 0 mm, 10 μm) was used for the HPLC analysis. The radioactivity was determined by a Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) in scintillation fluid. The soil used was both sterilized and non-sterilized in order to observe the involvement of soil microbes. The estimated DT 50 and DT 90 values of metsulfuron-methyl in a non-sterile system were observed to be 13 and 44 days, whereas in sterilized soil, the DT 50 and DT 90 were 31 and 70 days, respectively. The principal degradation product after 60 days was CO 2. The higher cumulative amount of (14) CO 2 in (14) C-triazine in the non-sterilized soil compared to that in the sterile system suggests that biological degradation by soil micro-organisms significantly contributes to the dissipation of the compound.

In this study the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) evolution has been studied in a factorial lab experiment combining five substrates (a soil, two aged composts and their mixtures) treated with a co-application of three pesticides (azoxystrobin, chlorotoluron and epoxiconazole), with two extraction methods, and two incubation times (0 and 58 days). FAMEs extraction followed the microbial identification system (MIDI) and ester-linked method (EL). The pesticides showed high persistence, as revealed by half-life (t 1 / 2) values ranging from 168 to 298 days, which confirms their recalcitrance to degradation. However, t 1 / 2 values were affected by substrate and compost age down to 8 days for chlorotoluron in S and up to 453 days for epoxiconazole in 12 M. Fifty-six FAMEs were detected. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the EL method detected a higher number of FAMEs and unique FAMEs than the MIDI one, whereas principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted that the monosaturated 18 : 1 ω 9 c and cyclopropane 19 : 0 ω 10 c/ 19 ω 6 were the most significant FAMEs grouping by extraction method.

The prairie pothole region (PPR) {{is among the}} most extensively altered ecosystems on Earth. This region covers approximately 780, 000 km 2 of central North America, and contains numerous glacially formed wetlands embedded in an agricultural landscape. These wetlands, commonly known as prairie pothole lakes (PPLs), provide essential ecosystem services. Over the last 150 years, agricultural drainage has resulted in severe loss of native prairie wetlands. The remaining PPLs continue to be threatened by nonpoint source pesticide pollution from agriculture. Currently, {{little is known about the}} fate and <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in PPLs. In this work, the abiotic transformations of commonly used pesticides in PPL sediment porewaters and surface water were explored. Chloroacetanilide and dinitroaniline pesticides were found to react rapidly with naturally abundant reduced sulfur species (i. e., hydrogen sulfide and polysulfides) in sediment porewaters via nucleophilic substitution and reduction reactions, respectively. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was also found to play a vital role in the reductive transformation. Next, the photodegradation of a suite of pesticides was investigated in PPL surface water under both simulated and natural sunlight. Enhanced pesticide removal rates pointed to the importance of indirect photolysis pathways involving photochemically produced reactive intermediates such as singlet oxygen and triplet excited-state DOM. Finally, the sedimentary sulfur speciation was examined by sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Sulfur species in PPL sediments were found to consist of organic (di) sulfides, sulfonate, sulfate, and the mineral pyrite.

However, {{the implications of}} adding BC to agricultural soil for the environmental fate of pesticides remain unclear. In particular, the effect of biochars on desorption behavior of compounds is poorly understood. This study examined the influence of BC on pesticide chemical and biological accessibility using the herbicide isoproturon (IPU). Soils amended with 1 % and 2 % BC showed enhanced sorption, slower desorption, and reduced biodegradation of IPU. Addition of 0. 1 % BC {{had no effect on}} sorption, desorption or biodegradation of IPU. However, the mineralization of 14 C-IPU was reduced by all BC concentrations, reducing by 13. 6 %, 40. 1 % and 49. 8 % at BC concentrations of 0. 1 %, 1 % and 2 % respectively. Further, the ratio of the toxic metabolite 4 -isopropyl-aniline to intact IPU was substantially reduced by higher BC concentrations. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) extractions were used to estimate the IPU bioaccessibility in the BC-amended soil. Significant correlations were found between HPCD-extracted 14 C-IPU and the IPU desorbed (%) (r 2 = 0. 8518, p< 0. 01), and also the 14 C-IPU mineralized (%) (r 2 = 0. 733; p< 0. 01) for all BC-amended soils.

Degradation studies were carried out during 120 days under laboratory conditions. Mobility experiments showed that pesticides can be grouped according to their potential leaching. Thus, pesticides showing medium leachability were included in group 1 (referred as G 1) while those with high leachability were termed as G 2. The differences observed in the leachability can be attributed to the different organic carbon (OC) content in the soils (0. 7 - 1. 8 %). Values of log K OC were higher in the order: soil C > soil B > soil A, which agrees with the OC content in each soil.

40|$|A recent {{concern in}} the {{widespread}} use of soil-applied pesticides is the phenomenon of enhanced degradation by soil microorganisms. This study investigated selected factors influencing the enhanced microbial degradation of pesticides. Because hydrolysis is a significant initial step in the degradation of pesticides, the role of hydrolysis metabolites in the induction of enhanced degradation was studied. Salicylic acid, p-nitrophenol, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol conditioned the soil for enhanced degradation of their parent compounds, isofenphos, parathion, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, respectively. Repeated applications of 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol resulted in increased persistence of its parent compound, chlorpyrifos. Pretreatment of soil with hydrolysis metabolites of carbofuran, diazinon, fonofos, and 2, 4, 5 -T did not have any effect on the degradation of their respective parent compounds;The properties of pesticide metabolites such as toxicity and availability to microorganisms may influence their potential to condition soils for the enhanced degradation of their parent pesticides. Mobility studies using a soil thin-layer chromatography technique indicated that for a pesticide to be susceptible to enhanced degradation, it need not necessarily be very mobile. Because some metabolites are capable of inducing or inhibiting the enhanced degradation process the mobility/availability of hydrolysis metabolites is of practical significance. Soil pH significantly affected mobility of most of the chemicals studied, with increased mobility in soils with higher pH 2 ̆ 7 s.

The amendment of soil with compost may significantly influence the mobility and <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and thus affect their environmental fate. Factors like adsorption, kinetics, and rate of degradation of pesticides could be altered in amended soils. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of the addition of compost made from source-separated municipal waste and green waste, on the fate of triasulfuron [(2 -(2 -chloroethoxy) -N-[[4 -methoxy- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl) amino] carbonyl]benzenesulfonamide], a sulfonylurea herbicide used in postemergence treatment of cereals. Two native soils with low organic matter content were used. A series of analyses was performed to evaluate the adsorption and degradation of the herbicide in soil and in solution after the addition of compost and compost-extracted organic fractions, namely humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (HoDOM). Results have shown that the adsorption of triasulfuron to soil increases in the presence of compost, and that the HA and HoDOM fractions are mainly responsible for this increase. Hydrophobic dissolved organic matter applied to the soils underwent sorption reactions with the soils, and in the sorbed state, served to increase the adsorption capacity of the soil for triasulfuron. The rate of hydrolysis of triasulfuron in solution was significantly higher at acidic pH and the presence of organic matter fractions extracted from compost also slightly increased the rate of hydrolysis. The rate of degradation in amended and nonamended soils is explained by a two-stage degradation kinetics. During the initial phase, although triasulfuron degradation was rapid with a half-life of approximately 30 d, the presence of compost and HoDOM was found to slightly reduce the rate of degradation with respect to that in nonamended soil. peer-reviewe...|$|E

Radioactive tracer techniques were utilized to follow the adsorption and degradation of the two pesticides. Additional information about the disappearance of the phenyl carbon atoms from CIPC adaptation cultures was obtained from ultraviolet spectra. 2, 4 -D was found strongly resistant to microbial degradation in a liquid medium of mineral salts. Less than 40 percent of the acetic acid portion of the molecule disappeared from solution in six months, even in the presence of additional sources of organic carbon. CIPC was degraded much more rapidly than 2, 4 -D. The isopropyl segment of the CIPC molecule was completely metabolized. Metabolism of the carbon atoms in the ring structure ceased after 40 to 60 percent of the atoms had disappeared from solution. A partial metabolic pathway for the degradation of CIPC is proposed. The clay minerals, illite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite, suspended in dilute pesticide solutions adsorbed very little 2, 4 -D or CIPC. CIPC was adsorbed extensively from water solutions with powdered activated carbon. The equilibrium for the adsorption of CIPC on activated carbon was represented closely by a Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption appeared to involve physical or weak chemical bonding. There was some indication that the adsorption of CIPC on activated carbon in a well-stirred system was diffusion controlled. The addition of activated carbon decreased the overall rate of degradation of CIPC. It is proposed that the decomposition of CIPC in the presence of powdered activated carbon occurs principally in the aqueous phase or at the interface between the liquid and the exterior surface of the activated carbon. As CIPC is degraded in solution, additional quantities desorb. The adsorption equilibrium of the activated carbon-CIPC system is influenced by the presence of bacterial cells and metabolic intermediates. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceReducing tillage {{intensity}} {{through the}} implementation of conservation practices {{is a way to}} reach a more sustainable agriculture. Reducing tillage is indeed an efficient way to control soil erosion and to decrease production costs. Nonetheless, the environmental impact of reduced tillage is not well known because conservation techniques may induce strong changes in soil physicochemical properties and biological activity. Knowledge on the fate of applied pesticides under conservation practices is particularly important from this point of view. We review here the advances in the understanding, quantification and prediction of the effects of tillage on pesticide fate in soils. We found the following major points: (1) for most dissipation processes such as retention, degradation and transfer, results of pesticide behaviour studies in soils are highly variable and sometimes contradictory. This variability is partially explained by the multiplicity of processes and contributive factors, by the variety of their interactions, and by their complex temporal and spatial dynamics. In addition, the lack of a thorough description of tillage systems and sampling strategy in most reports hampers any comprehensive interpretation of this variability. (2) Implementation of conservation tillage induces an increase in organic matter content at the soil surface and its gradual decrease with depth. This, in turn, leads to an increase in pesticide retention in the topsoil layer. (3) Increasing retention of pesticides in the topsoil layer under conservation tillage decreases the availability of the pesticides for biological degradation. This competition between retention and degradation leads to a higher <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in soils, though this persistence can be partially compensated for by a more intensive microbial activity under conservation tillage. (4) Despite strong changes in soil physical properties under conservation tillage, pesticide transfer is more influenced by initial soil conditions and climatic conditions than by tillage. Conservation tillage systems such as no-tillage improve macropore connectivity, which in turn increases pesticide leaching. We conclude that more knowledge is needed to fully understand the temporal and spatial dynamics of pesticide in soil, especially preferential flows, in order to improve the assessment of pesticide risks, and their relation to tillage management...|$|E
40|$|Pesticides {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of modern intensive agriculture and are applied extensively on a wide range of crops. Viticulture is one of the most pesticide intensive forms of agriculture due to the vines susceptibility for fungal diseases like powdery mildew. Although the use of pesticides has apparent benefits, it poses a risk for human health and non-target species in surrounding ecosystems. Since the introduction a lot of improvements have been made on the toxicity and environmental <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> but there is still a lot unknown about the environmental fate and community level effects of different compounds. The behavior of pesticides in soils is often poorly understood because laboratory results don’t translate to field conditions. Pesticides are believed to be immobile once they are sorbed to soil particles, but can be transported with particulate matter following erosion processes. This study aims to determine the levels of pesticide residues present in vineyard soils after years of pesticide application and to quantify the particle- facilitated transport of pesticide residues driven by soil erosion caused by runoff events. Three study sites with different soil types were selected in the Sao Lourenço sub-basin in Portugal. Plots were installed and soil and sediment samples were collected following runoff events. Collected samples were analyzed for pesticide residues using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS). Residues of six commonly applied fungicides (dimethomorph, pyrimethanil, pyraclostrobin, metalaxyl, penconazole and tebuconazole), one herbicide (glyphosate) and one metabolite (AMPA) were detected in the collected samples. Except for 4 samples of 1 site, all samples contained quantifiable levels of at least 1 compound. Except for dimethomorph at humic cambisol, no patterns of degradation were detected during the study period. Concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA were the highest of the detected compounds and were at least one order of magnitude higher than for the other compounds. Residue concentrations for glyphosate and AMPA were significantly higher in sediment than in soil and were related to particle size and organic matter content. Transport of particle-bound pesticide residues was highest at the site with the highest sediment export. The results of this study indicate that especially for glyphosate and AMPA, particle facilitated transport is a serious concern in areas with high erosion rates...|$|E
40|$|Reducing tillage {{intensity}} {{through the}} implementation of conservation practices {{is a way to}} reach a more sustainable agriculture. Reducing tillage is indeed an efficient way to control soil erosion and to decrease production costs. Nonetheless, the environmental impact of reduced tillage is not well known because conservation techniques may induce strong changes in soil physicochemical properties and biological activity. Knowledge on the fate of applied pesticides under conservation practices is particularly important from this point of view. We review here the advances in the understanding, quantification and prediction of the effects of tillage on pesticide fate in soils. We found the following major points: (1) for most dissipation processes such as retention, degradation and transfer, results of pesticide behaviour studies in soils are highly variable and sometimes contradictory. This variability is partially explained by the multiplicity of processes and contributive factors, by the variety of their interactions, and by their complex temporal and spatial dynamics. In addition, the lack of a thorough description of tillage systems and sampling strategy in most reports hampers any comprehensive interpretation of this variability. (2) Implementation of conservation tillage induces an in crease in organic matter content at the soil surface and its gradual decrease with depth. This, in turn, leads to an increase in pesticide retention in the topsoil layer. (3) Increasing retention of pesticides in the topsoil layer under conservation tillage decreases the availability of the pesticides for biological degradation. This competition between retention and degradation leads to a higher <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in soils, though this persistence can be partially compensated for by a more intensive microbial activity under conservation tillage. (4) Despite strong changes in soil physical properties under conservation tillage, pesticide transfer is more influenced by initial soil conditions and climatic conditions than by tillage. Conservation tillage systems such as no-tillage improve macropore connectivity, which in turn increases pesticide leaching. We conclude that more knowledge is needed to fully understand the temporal and spatial dynamics of pesticide in soil, especially preferential flows, in order to improve the assessment of pesticide risks, and their relation to tillage management...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{fate of the}} 14 C-labeled {{herbicides}} ethidimuron (ETD), methabenzthiazuron (MBT), and the fungicide anilazine (ANI) in soils {{was evaluated}} after long-term aging (9 – 17 years) in field based lysimeters subject to crop rotation. Analysis of residual 14 C activity in the soils revealed 19 % (ETD soil; 0 – 10  cm depth), 35 % (MBT soil; 0 – 30), and 43 % (ANI soil; 0 – 30) of the total initially applied. Accelerated solvent extraction yielded 90 % (ETD soil), 26 % (MBT soil), and 41 % (ANI soil) <b>of</b> residual <b>pesticide</b> 14 C activity in the samples. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the parent compounds ETD and MBT, accounting for 3 % and 2 % of applied active ingredient in the soil layer, as well as dihydroxy-anilazine as the primary ANI metabolite. The results for ETD and MBT were matching with values obtained from samples of a 12 year old field plot experiment.

Under natural sunlight (800 w m- 2) and Vita Lite R high intensity fluorescent lamps (Dura Test, 50 w m- 2, 290 - 700 nm), there was 10 to 20 times the uptake of C ring-labelled fenitrothion into live and freeze-killed algae as compared to dark conditions. The accumulated label in both the live and freeze-killed algae (with nonfunctioning electron transport systems) was identified as polar metabolites of fenitrothion, their identical percentages suggesting photophysical reactions. As a consequence of increased uptake and degradation of fenitrothion by live algae, the fenitrothion half-life in the media decreased by approximately one half {{in the presence of}} algae and light, as compared to lighted media controls. When accumulation experiments were repeated under anaerobic conditions, polar metabolites were reduced by 50...|$|R
40|$|Six million {{children}} live in poverty in America's inner cities. These children {{are at high risk}} <b>of</b> exposure to <b>pesticides</b> that are used extensively in urban schools, homes, and day-care centers for control of roaches, rats, and other vermin. The organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos and certain pyrethroids are the registered pesticides most heavily applied in cities. Illegal street pesticides are also in use, including tres pasitos (a carbamate), tiza china, and methyl parathion. In New York State in 1997, the heaviest use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in all counties statewide was in the urban boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Children are highly vulnerable to <b>pesticides.</b> Because <b>of</b> their play close to the ground, their hand-to-mouth behavior, and their unique dietary patterns, children absorb more pesticides from their environment than adults. The long <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> semivolatile <b>pesticides</b> such as chlorpyrifos on rugs, furniture, stuffed toys, and other absorbent surfaces within closed apartments further enhances urban children's exposures. Compounding these risks of heavy exposures are children's decreased ability to detoxify and excrete pesticides and the rapid growth, development, and differentiation of their vital organ systems. These developmental immaturities create early windows of great vulnerability. Recent experimental data suggest, for example, that chlorpyrifos may be a developmental neurotoxicant and that exposur...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{consumers}} {{influence in}} the manufacture and retailing of food and drinks products has been increasing. Expecting safe foods, nutrition, quality and value for money in the products they eat and drink, consumers {{want to know the}} origin of what they choose. In addition, environmental issues including pollution, packaging, waste and pesticide residues (one of the critical areas related to food safety is the over-use of agrochemicals) are all areas of concern, and required new approaches for their management. Food production is a complex structure and, therefore, a systematic approach is needed to identify potential hazards at each point in the food chain, to avoid outbreaks of food-borne illness and contamination of foodstuffs. Food-borne exposure to agricultural and environmental chemicals is of great public concern and, owing to the development of sensitive methods of detection, trace amounts of potentially harmful chemicals can be detected in many foods. Fortunately, the levels of human exposure to these chemicals are generally well below the tolerable daily intakes and the regulatory limits set by international committees. Constant surveillance and monitoring in the use of pesticides is therefore very important. At the EU level, intensive action has been taken to rebuild confidence in the European food supply chain by means the publication of a White Paper on Food Safety {{and the development of a}} legislation establishing “from farm to table” criteria. If the widespread use of pesticides in agriculture led to increased world food production, residues of these chemicals and their metabolites have resulted in food commodities, water and soil. The <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the environment is not well understood, yet, while their acute toxicity has been proven in many cases. The way in which governments regulate food safety and environmental protection, including pesticide residue levels, has important implications for international trade. In particular, EU and Italian legislation imposed stringent residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs to guarantee consumer’s health. Consequently, there is a growing interest from governmental agencies and private laboratories to improve the performances of analytical methods for pesticide residue determination, increasing their efficiency and lowering cost and time of analysis. Sensitive multiresidue methods - enabling the determination of as many pesticides as possible, with the least analytical steps - need therefore to be developed. The aim of this study was to determinate 27 organophosphorus pesticide (OP) residues (at ppb level) in commercial cereals and other products of their grinding. The method foresees a preliminary liquid-liquid extraction followed by a clean-up step using alumina as adsorbent. The determination of OP residues was performed by GC-NPD, while positive samples were confirmed by GC-MS. Due to the complexity of the studied matrices, the cleaning-up step was crucial; in fact this step was necessary to reduce matrix interferences on the chromatographic separation. To remove interfering high molecular weight components (e. g. proteins, lipids, cellulose) from different food samples prior to a chromatographic separation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is frequently used. In our study a different approach was followed purifying organic extracts on alumina columns. The method was successfully applied to the determination of OP pesticides in 134 cereal samples (wheat, bran, fine bran, maize, flour) collected in different Italian regions. No significant traces of the analyzed pesticides were found in the majority of the samples. In five samples on 134 the presence of pyrimifos methyl and chlorpyrifos at very low level was ascertained...|$|E
40|$|Transformation {{rates of}} four widely used {{pesticides}} were determined in surface waters that were characterised {{on the basis}} of hydrological status and physico-chemical, biochemical and chemical composition. Large variations in transformation rates were observed, ranging from 0. 004 to 0. 01 day- 1 (half-life = 70 - 173 days) for aldicarb, 0. 005 to 0. 57 day- 1 (half-life = 1 - 139 days) for simazine, 0. 002 to 0. 43 day- 1 for MCPA (half-life= 2 - 347 days) and 0. 0005 to 0. 24 day- 1 (half-life = 3 - 1400 days) for mecoprop. Principal component analyses and step-wise multiple regression analyses were carried out, combining field data and laboratory observations, to reveal the discriminating environmental variables that determine the transformation rates of aldicarb, simazine, MCPA and mecoprop in various aqueous systems. A large set of environmental variables (286 observations) was reduced to three underlying components, explaining 84 % of the total variance in the data set. The first component contains variables that promote biorespiratory processes, in which a relationship appears between sorption potential, N sources and microbial activity. The second component is the macro/micronutrient group. The third component is the phosphorus group. Rapid transformation <b>of</b> these <b>pesticides</b> generally occurs in small hydrological systems such as field ditches and channels. Large water bodies such as main discharge channels or lakes seem to enhance the <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> all four <b>pesticides.</b> Besides the hydrological status of the water course, historical application <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> and subsequent adaptation of biorespiratory processes appear to be the most discriminating environmental factors that determine transformation rates <b>of</b> the <b>pesticides</b> studied.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and potential}} effects <b>of</b> current-use <b>pesticides</b> are <b>of</b> {{concern in the}} San Francisco Estuary watershed but {{our understanding of the}} spatial and temporal distribution of contamination is limited. This paper summarizes almost two decades of historical data and uses it to describe our current knowledge of the processes controlling the occurrence <b>of</b> current-use <b>pesticides</b> in the watershed. Monitoring studies analyze fewer than half <b>of</b> the <b>pesticides</b> applied in the watershed and most of our knowledge is about inputs <b>of</b> dissolved <b>pesticides</b> in the upper watershed. The four major seasonal patterns of riverine inputs <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> to the estuary can be identified by usage and transport mechanism. Dormant spray insecticides applied to orchards and herbicides applied to a variety of crops are transported by rainfall during the winter. Alfalfa pesticides are detected following rainfall and irrigation return flow in the spring, and rice pesticides are detected following release of rice field water in the summer. Irrigation return flows transport a variety of herbicides during the summer. In addition, pesticides applied on Delta islands can cause elevated pesticide concentrations in localized areas. Although not as well characterized, urban creeks appear to have their own patterns of insecticide concentrations causing toxicity throughout most of the year. Current-use pesticides have also been detected on suspended and bed sediments throughout the watershed but limited data make it difficult to determine occurrence patterns. Data gaps include the lack of analysis <b>of</b> many <b>pesticides</b> (or degradates), changing pesticide use, limited information on pesticide transport within the Delta, and an incomplete understanding of the transport and <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> sediment-associated <b>pesticides.</b> Future monitoring programs should be designed to address these data gaps...|$|R

The yearly based experimental scheme of exposure consisted of two oral administration periods, lasting 3 months and I month each, interrupted by an 8 -month washout period (total duration 12 months). At the end of the experimental scheme, the rabbits underwent an echocardiographic evaluation under sedation, after which they were killed and the tissue and serum samples were collected. A mild localized cardiotoxic effect was established by echocardiography for the three pesticides tested. Severe histological alterations were identified, especially in the diazinon-treated animals in agreement with increased <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> this <b>pesticide</b> established in the cardiac tissue.

Methods A knowledge–attitude–practice study, using questionnaires, was undertaken with 102 rice farmers in Tiassalé and 106 vegetable farmers in Dabou (South Côte d’Ivoire) in order to generate information on pesticide usage.

The impact of other key parameters including pesticide dose, temperature and repeated applications on the degradation <b>of</b> eight <b>pesticides,</b> applied as a mixture, in a BX and a peat-based biomixture (OBX) was compared and contrasted to their degradation in soil. Incubation studies showed that straw was essential in maintaining a high <b>pesticide</b> degradation capacity <b>of</b> the biomixture, whereas compost, when mixed with soil, retarded pesticide degradation. The highest rates of degradation were shown in the biomixture composed of soil/compost/straw suggesting that all three components are essential for maximum biobed performance.
