500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

The birds' wings at rest extend just slightly beyond the tail.|$|R
50|$|Juvenile Cox's {{sandpipers}} {{are known}} from only two individuals, one from Massachusetts {{and one from}} Japan, both believed to be Cox's sandpiper based on their morphology, but not identified with certainty. These birds closely resembled juvenile <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> but without a well-demarcated breast-band (although the Japanese bird showed strong streaking on the breast-sides). In this plumage, the birds also showed large amounts of white on the uppertail-coverts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Calidris melanotos) is a small, migratory wader that breeds in North America and Asia, {{wintering}} in South America and Oceania. It eats small invertebrates. Its nest, a hole scraped in {{the ground}} and with a thick lining, is deep enough to protect its four eggs from the cool breezes of its breeding grounds. The <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpiper</b> is 21 cm long, with a wingspan of 46 cm.|$|E
50|$|These birds forage on grasslands and mudflats, {{like the}} <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> picking up food by sight, {{sometimes}} by probing. They mainly eat insects and other invertebrates.|$|E

The <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpiper</b> is a largish calidrid (21 cm in length, with a wingspan of 46 cm) with a grey-brown back, brownest in the summer male, and greyest in winter. The <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpiper</b> has a grey breast, sharply demarcated at its lower edge, which gives this species its English name; this clear dividing line is particularly conspicuous if the birds are turned towards the observer. The legs are yellowish, and the bill is olive with a darker tip.|$|E
50|$|The {{birds were}} {{conclusively}} {{shown to be}} hybrids by Christidis et al. (1996).

Since mtDNA is inherited only from the mother, they concluded that the parentage of Cox's sandpipers was a male pectoral and a female curlew sandpiper.|$|R
40|$|The {{functions}} of sleep remain elusive. Extensive {{evidence suggests that}} sleep performs restorative processes that sustain waking brain performance. An alternative view proposes that sleep simply enforces adaptive inactivity to conserve energy when activity is unproductive. Under this hypothesis, animals may evolve the ability to dispense with sleep when ecological demands favor wakefulness. Here, we show that male <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris melanotos), a polygynous Arctic breeding shorebird, are able to maintain high neurobehavioral performance despite greatly reducing their time spent sleeping during a 3 -week period of intense male-male competition for access to fertile females. Males that slept the least sired the most offspring. Our results challenge the view that decreased performance is an inescapable outcome of sleep loss...|$|R
50|$|The refuge was {{established}} in 1975 and provides important stop-over and nesting habitat for over 200 species of neotropical migratory birds. The refuge is also known for large numbers of wintering waterfowl, at times exceeding 125,000 birds. Mallards, American wigeon, gadwall, northern shoveler, teal, scaup, and ring-necked ducks traveling through the Mississippi Flyway stop by Hillside National Wildlife Refuge each winter. Breeding populations of wood ducks and hooded mergansers can be found throughout the refuge. Common shorebirds include killdeer, snipe, least and <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> and greater and lesser yellowlegs.

40|$|To {{examine how}} habitat use by {{sandpipers}} (Calidris spp.; Baird’s sandpipers, dunlin, least <b>sandpipers,</b> <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> semipalmated sandpipers, stilt sandpipers, and white-rumped sandpipers) varies {{across a broad}} suite of environmental conditions, we conducted surveys at wetlands throughout the spring migratory period in 2013 and 2014 in 2 important stopover regions: the Rainwater Basin (RWB) in Nebraska, USA, and the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) in South Dakota, USA. Because providing adequate energetic resources for migratory birds is {{a high priority for}} wetland management, we also measured invertebrate abundance at managed wetlands in the RWB to determine how food abundance influences the occupancy and abundance of sandpipers on wetlands throughout the migratory period. To quantify habitat use, we surveyed wetlands every 7 – 10 days in both regions and visually estimated wetland attributes. Our results indicate that invertebrate abundance predicted occupancy, but not abundance, of sandpipers at wetlands in the RWB. The wetland vegetation characteristics that predict sandpiper occupancy are similar in both regions, but wetlands in the PPR support a higher abundance of sandpipers than wetlands in the RWB. Our results suggest that sandpipers make stopover decisions that balance local and regional wetland conditions. Managers should maintain the cues (i. e., mudflat) and ecological conditions beyond invertebrate abundance that predict sandpiper habitat use to successfully provide resources for sandpipers during migratory stopover if that is a goal of wetland management...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{fluctuations}} in the availability of critical stopover sites coupled with anthropogenic destruction of wetlands, land-use change, and anticipated losses due to climate change present migratory birds with a formidable challenge.

At the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, we are creating ecological forecasting tools for science and application users to address the consequences of loss of wetlands, flooding, drought or other natural disasters such as hurricanes on avian biodiversity and bird migration. We use an individual-based bird biophysical migration model, driven by remotely sensed land surface data, climate and hydrologic data, and biological field observations to study migratory bird responses to environmental change in North America. Simulation allows us to study bird migration across multiple scales and can be linked to mechanistic processes describing the time and energy budget states of migrating birds.

Mean stop-over durations and stop-over frequency with latitude predicted from our model for nominal cases were consistent with results reported in the literature and available field data. In this study, we take advantage of new computing capabilities enabled by recent GP-GPU computing paradigms and commodity hardware (general purchase computing on graphics processing units). Several aspects of our individual based (agent modeling) approach lend themselves well to GP-GPU computing. We have been able to allocate compute-intensive tasks to the graphics processing units, and now simulate ensembles of 400, 000 birds at varying spatial resolutions along the central North American flyway.

40|$|Understanding bird {{migration}} and avian biodiversity {{is one of}} the most compelling and challenging problems of modern biology with major implications for human health and conservation biology. Migration and conservation efforts cross national boundaries and are subject to numerous international agreements and treaties presenting challenges in both geographic space and time.

At NASA, we are creating ecological forecasting tools for science and application users to address the consequences of loss of wetlands, flooding, drought or other natural disasters such as hurricanes on avian biodiversity and {{bird migration}}. In our work, we use individual organism biophysical models and drive these models with satellite observations and numerical weather predictions of the spatio-temporal gradients in climate and habitat. Geographic information system technology comprises one component of our overall simulation framework, especially for characterizing the changing habitats and conditions encountered by en-route migratory birds. Simulation provides a tool for studying bird migration across multiple scales and can be linked to mechanistic processes describing the time and energy budget states of migrating birds. Such models yield an understanding of how a migratory flyway and its component habitats function as a whole and link stop-over ecology with biological conservation and management.

40|$|YELLOW RAILS. On 21 September 1986, while {{conducting}} a waterfowl survey on the Jack Senn WMA, near Ceresco, Lancaster Co., I flushed a small rail-like bird, which flew {{a short distance}} before landing in heavy grass. Although its flight was {{very similar to the}} Virginia Rail and the Sora, which I was accustomed to seeing, the light color and white wing patches were very distinctive. Later I checked a field guide and found that the description most closely matching this bird was that of the very secretive Yellow Rail. I had planned to do some rail and snipe hunting the next day, so the following morning I returned to the area with my brother and my springer spaniel. Within four hours we flushed approximately 12 rail and collected 5, 3 of these were Yellow Rails. What I have found in subsequent outings in the marsh is that the Yellow Rails tend to be even more difficult to flush than the Virginia and Sora rails. Their flight distance is generally much shorter (10 to 15 yards) and in several instances when I observed them landing they immediately dove under the vegetation and began running. On several occasions when I saw the exact spot a bird landed I was unable to reflush it, even with the help of my dog. During summer nest drag surveying of the area Sora and Virginia Rail were flushed on a regular basis, but it was only during a 2 to 3 week period in late summer that I saw Yellow Rails. I am assuming these were all migrating birds, and none nest in the area. -Charles Lesick PECTORAL SANDPIPERS.

40|$|Overall, {{this fall}} {{migration}} was routine (waterfowl, warblers, sparrows), {{but there were}} a few unexpected highlights. The flooded Missouri River Valley provided habitat that led to some amazing fall counts: 3000 pelicans, 5700 coots, 338 American Golden-Plovers, and 1200 <b>Pectoral</b> <b>Sandpipers.</b> The 10, 000 cormorants at Harlan County Reservoir may not have been affected by the Missouri River flooding, and were a record count also. While we 2 ̆ 7 re talking numbers, the martin roost in Omaha topped out at 50, 000 – 55, 000, and seasonal totals of 4 Red-necked Grebes and 15 Philadelphia Vireos for the state, 34 Mississippi Kites over Ogallala (it 2 ̆ 7 s often hard to find one), and 45 Lesser Goldfinches banded at Wildcat Hills Nature Center were interesting tallies. Surprising many was the rare occurrence of 4000 – 5000 Sandhill Cranes lingering late into fall; the reports of 5 Snowy Owls {{before the end of the}} period also was a hint of what might follow. Also surprising was the low number of Black-capped Chickadees reported in south-central Nebraska; the NOU meeting held at Audubon Rowe Sanctuary reported chickadees in only one of the 12 counties covered by participants. And, of course, there is always the weird. Two species of vagrant psittacids were reported, neither a threat to our native birds: a Rosy-faced Lovebird and a Budgerigar.

40|$|Recent {{increases}} in lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) abundance {{have raised the}} question of how populations of other tundra-nesting birds are impacted by increased goose herbivory and habitat degradation. Line transect surveys were conducted on 30 transects at the Nestor 1 study site outside of Churchill, Manitoba in June 1984, 1999, and 2000 to obtain estimates of population densities of tundranesting birds and determine if density changes have occurred in relation to increased goose habitat damage. We also compared bird abundance at a smaller scale between degraded and non-degraded freshwater sedge meadows. Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) exhibited significant (P < 0. 05) {{increases in}} population densities from 1984 to 1999 and 2000. Dunlins (Calidris alpina) had significantly lower densities from 1984 to 1999 (P < 0. 10) and nonsignificant declines from 1984 to 2000. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus), savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), and the sedge meadow shorebird guild exhibited nonsignificant increases in density. The tundra-nesting passerine guild exhibited a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in density from 1984 to 1999. Arctic terns (Sterna paradiseaea), <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris melantos), and willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) indicated significant (P < 0. 05) declines in densities of birds seen on transects and in the numbers of transects birds were detected on. Significantly lower abundances of passerines and shorebird guild birds were detected in degraded freshwater sedge meadows versus non-degraded meadows. Results indicate that most species did not exhibit population density declines over time on the study area, despite increased snow goose damage and density. However, at the scale of the habitat patch, the same groups of species had lower abundances in degraded habitats versus non-degraded habitats. Results suggest that habitat degradation led to lower bird abundance, however habitat damage may have to be widespread and severe to elicit population density declines over a large area, like Nestor 1.

40|$|Significant {{landscape}} alteration has occurred from the westward expansion of European settlement {{starting in the}} 18 th Century {{in the form of}} conversion of large expanses of land to agricultural production. This agricultural expansion was facilitated by the development and installation of artificial subsurface drainage to convert previously saturated and unproductive soil in topographic depressions, also known as prairie potholes, into highly productive tillable areas. Although most are currently drained they still exist in some form and are often observed as sheetwater wetlands in agricultural fields. Sheetwater wetlands have potential value to migratory waterbirds but this value has only been examined in limited spatial and temporal contexts. Many species of shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) undergo bi-annual long distance migrations between temperate and tropical wintering areas to extreme northern latitudes for breeding purposes. During these journeys individuals rely on migratory stopover sites with sufficient resources to refuel energetically and accumulate energy stores in preparation for subsequent migratory bouts. Most previous studies on migratory stopover in shorebirds have been focused on coastal areas or ecosystems; however, many shorebird species migrate through mid-continental areas of North America and rely on network of ephemeral and unpredictable stopover sites in this region. The objective {{of this study was to}} document and assess the dynamics and value of agricultural sheetwater wetlands (farmed wetlands) to migratory waterbirds throughout the Prairie Pothole Region in Iowa as well as examine stopover dynamics of <b>Pectoral</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris melanotos) at a stopover site in Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s Prairie Pothole Region.

40|$|The broad-scale {{reductions}} and shifts {{that may be}} expected under climate change in the availability and quality of stopover habitat for long-distance migrants {{is an area of}} increasing concern for conservation biologists. Researchers generally have taken two broad approaches to the modeling of migration behaviour to understand the impact of these changes on migratory bird populations. These include models based on causal processes and their response to environmental stimulation, "mechanistic models", or models that primarily are based on observed animal distribution patterns and the correlation of these patterns with environmental variables, i. e. "data driven" models. Investigators have applied the latter technique to forecast changes in migration patterns with changes in the environment, for example, as might be expected under climate change, by forecasting how the underlying environmental data layers upon which the relationships are built will change over time. The learned geostatstical correlations are then applied to the modified data layers [...] However, this is problematic. Even if the projections of how the underlying data layers will change are correct, it is not evident that the statistical relationships will remain the same, i. e. that the animal organism may not adapt its' behaviour to the changing conditions. Mechanistic models that explicitly take into account the physical, biological, and behaviour responses of an organism as well as the underlying changes in the landscape offer an alternative to address these shortcomings. The availability of satellite remote sensing observations at multiple spatial and temporal scales, coupled with advances in climate modeling and information technologies enable the application of the mechanistic models to predict how continental bird migration patterns may change in response to environmental change. In earlier work, we simulated the impact of effects of wetland loss and inter-annual variability on the fitness of migratory shorebirds in the central fly ways of North America. We demonstrated the phenotypic plasticity of a migratory population of <b>Pectoral</b> <b>sandpipers</b> consisting of an ensemble of 10, 000 individual birds in response to changes in stopover locations using an individual based migration model driven by remotely sensed land surface data, climate data and biological field data. With the advent of new computing capabilities enabled hy recent GPU-GP computing paradigms and commodity hardware, it now is possible to simulate both larger ensemble populations and to incorporate more realistic mechanistic factors into migration models. Here, we take our first steps use these tools to study the impact of long-term drought variability on shorebird survival...|$|R
40|$|Williams, Christopher K. I {{conducted}} {{my research}} on Chickaloon Flats, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, {{which is a}} tidal mudflats located along {{the northern part of}} the Kenai Peninsula in upper Cook Inlet, Alaska, 2009 ??? 2010. It is a protected coastal estuary stopover area along the Pacific Flyway, covering 7 % of the total estuarine intertidal area of Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Almost one-third (23 of 73) of shorebird species recorded in Alaska use this stopover during spring and/or fall migrations. My objectives included 1) creating a current vegetation classification map and quantify vegetation changes from 1975 to 2005, 2) identify the driving factors of ephemeral pool presence, 3) document avian use of Chickaloon Flats during migration periods, and 4) conduct a multi-isotopic approach to estimate probable breeding and/or wintering origins of six species of shorebirds using Chickaloon during spring and fall migration of 2009 and 2010. I analyzed Hydrogen (dD), Carbon (d 13 C), and Nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopes from feathers and performed a likelihood-based assignment to inform North American (NA) and South American (SA) origins of six shorebird species. Only lesser yellowlegs feathers (Tringa flavipes) indicated wintering (n= 4, coastal SA) and breeding (n= 26, central Alaska) ranges. Estimated wintering ranges for least sandpipers (Calidris minutilla, n= 13) occurred in southern NA to northern SA, long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus, n= 8) occurred in Mexico, and <b>pectoral</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris melanotos, n= 11) occurred in northeastern SA. Estimated breeding ranges for greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca, n= 67) occurred in southwest Alaska, and short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus caurinus, n= 26) occurred in south-central Alaska. The analysis of stable isotopes to infer molt origins of birds is a useful and important tool in migration and conservation studies. I determined probable origins of long-distance shorebird migrants, some of high conservation concern, using an Alaskan stopover site, which identified habitats and previously unknown areas used by Alaskan breeding shorebirds. I observed 95 bird species throughout the spring and fall of 2009 and 2010, with 26 of those species breeding on Chickaloon. I observed several pulses of total birds during spring migration, and a more protracted fall migration with variable smaller pulses of birds. Estimated maximum daily shorebird numbers are 5, 638 during spring migration, and 20, 297 during fall migration. I created a recent vegetation classification of 7 vegetation types on Chickaloon Flats using 2005 Landsat TM imagery. I also quantified change of 3 mud/vegetation cover types from 1975 ??? 2005. The vegetated community type remained relatively stable over the 30 -year period, while the mud and mixed mud/vegetation cover types closest to Cook Inlet showed a relatively-small amount of change over time. The greatest change was an increase in mud area, indicating that the vegetated areas of Chickaloon may be slowly converting to a less productive mud community type. My research highlights the overall importance and value of Chickaloon Flats as a stopover and breeding grounds for a diversity of avian species, and long-distance migrant shorebirds in particular.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} condition (fat {{and protein}} reserves) of shorebirds was studied, mainly at Teesmouth and Lindisfarne, north-east England, during the non-breeding season. Normal patterns {{of fat and}} protein storage are similar in most coastal shorebird species. Fat reserves rise to a peak in midwinter. Fat is stored rapidly before both spring and autumn migrations. Protein reserves (measured as pectoral muscle size) remain steady during winter. Protein reserves increase before spring migration, but not before autumn migration. Most shorebirds regulate both fat and protein reserves during winter. Plovers (Charadriidae) have larger fat and protein reserves than Sandpipers (Scolopacidae). However rocky-shore species carry smaller reserves than species feeding on soft sediments. Interspecific differences are related to morphology, foraging behaviour, habitat use and winter movements. First-year shorebirds carry similar sized or larger reserves than adult conspecifics. Catabolism of nutritional reserves was studied during two periods of severe winter weather in north-east England. Reserves were catabolised faster by species that normally carried the largest regulated reserves. In eastern Britain some Redshanks cannot regulate their fat and protein reserves even during mild winters. Possible reasons are discussed. The condition of shorebirds that had starved to death during severe weather is examined. Redshanks, first-year Oystercatchers, inland species) and shorebirds that return early to breeding grounds are most at risk. Recovery of nutritional condition after starvation is examined. In addition to seasonal variation, differences {{in the size of}} regulated fat reserves occur in different wintering grounds. Total lean weights in relation to wing-length as a measure of body size are used to examine whether similar seasonal and latitudinal differences in protein reserves of shorebirds exist. Plovers have larger <b>pectoral</b> muscles than <b>Sandpipers</b> but similar total lean weight (measured in relation to body size). During winter, lean weights are lower in several equatorial and southern hemisphere areas than in northern temperate regions. Seasonal and latitutinal changes in lean weight are discussed in relation to periods of environmental stress...|$|R
