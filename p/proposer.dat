At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the <b>proposer</b> or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experiment}} on two treatments of an ultimatum minigame. In one treatment, responders' reactions are hidden to <b>proposers.</b> We observe high rejection rates reflecting responders' intrinsic resistance to unfairness. In the second treatment, <b>proposers</b> are informed, allowing for dynamic effects over eight rounds of play. The higher rejection rates {{can be attributed}} to responders' provision of a public good: Punishment creates a group reputation for being "tough" and effectively "educate" <b>proposers.</b> Since rejection rates with informed <b>proposers</b> drop {{to the level of the}} treatment with non-informed <b>proposers,</b> the hypothesis of responders' enjoyment of overt punishment is not supported. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{experimental}} study investigates how behavior changes after receiving punishment. The {{focus is on}} how <b>proposers</b> in a power-to-take game adjust their behavior depending on their fairness perceptions, their experienced emotions, and their interaction with responders. We find that fairness plays an important role: <b>proposers</b> who take what {{they consider to be}} an unfair amount experience higher intensities of prosocial emotions (shame and guilt), particularly if they are punished. This emotional experience induces <b>proposers</b> to lower their claims. We also find that fairness perceptions vary considerably between individuals. Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that <b>proposers</b> who considered themselves fair are taking less from responders than other <b>proposers.</b> Lastly, we provide evidence that suggests that eliciting emotions through self-reports does not affect subsequent behavior.

25|$|The {{ultimatum}} {{game is a}} game {{in economic}} experiments. The first player (the <b>proposer)</b> conditionally receives a sum of money and proposes how to divide the sum between the <b>proposer</b> and the other player. The second player (the responder) chooses to either accept or reject this proposal. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If the second player rejects, neither player receives any money. The game is typically played only once so that reciprocation is not an issue.|$|E

40|$|Agreements and {{commitments}} {{have provided a}} novel mechanism to promote cooperation in social dilemmas in both one-shot and repeated games. Individuals requesting others to commit to cooperate (<b>proposers)</b> incur a cost, while their co-players are not necessarily required to pay any, allowing them to free-ride on the proposal investment cost (acceptors). Although {{there is a clear}} complementarity in these behaviours, no dynamic evidence is currently available that proves that they coexist in different forms of commitment creation. Using a stochastic evolutionary model allowing for mixed population states, we identify non-trivial roles of acceptors as well as the importance of intention recognition in commitments. In the one-shot prisoner’s dilemma, alliances between <b>proposers</b> and acceptors are necessary to isolate defectors when <b>proposers</b> do not know the acceptance intentions of the others. However, when the intentions are clear beforehand, the <b>proposers</b> can emerge by themselves. In repeated games with noise, the incapacity of <b>proposers</b> and acceptors to set up alliances makes the emergence of the first harder whenever the latter are present. As a result, acceptors will exploit <b>proposers</b> and take over the population when an apology-forgiveness mechanism with too low apology cost is introduced, and hence reduce the overall cooperation level...|$|R

40|$|Humans often lie strategically. We {{study this}} problem in an {{ultimatum}} game involving informed <b>proposers</b> and uninformed responders, where the former can send an unverifiable statement about their endowment. If there are some intrinsically honest <b>proposers,</b> a simple message game shows {{that the rest of}} them are likely to declare a lower-than-actual endowment to the responders. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we report on an experiment testing this game. On average, 88. 5 % of the <b>proposers</b> understate the actual endowment by 20. 5 %. Regression analysis shows that a one-dollar gap between the actual and declared amounts prompts <b>proposers</b> to reduce their offer by 19 cents. However, responders appear not to take such claims seriously, and thus the frequency of rejections should increase. The consequence is a net welfare loss, that is specific to such a "free-to-lie" environment...|$|R
25|$|The most {{controversial}} measure Caesar introduced was an agrarian bill to allot plots {{of land to}} the landless poor to farm. Conservative aristocrats had a tradition of vehemently opposing land redistribution and most such bills were not passed. In Cassius Dio’s opinion, Caesar tried to appear to promote {{the interests of the}} optimates {{as well as those of}} the people, and said that he would not introduce his land reform if they did not agree with it. He read the draft of the bill to the senate, asked for the option of each senator and promised to amend or scrap any clause that had raised objections. The optimates were annoyed because the bill, to their embarrassment, could not be criticised. Moreover, it would give Caesar popularity and power. Even though no optimate spoke against it, no one expressed approval. The law would distribute public and private land to all citizens instead of just Pompey’s veterans and would do so without any expense for the city or any loss for the optimates. It would be financed with the proceeds from Pompey’s war booty and the new tributes and taxes in the east Pompey established with his victories in the Third Mithridatic War. Private land was to be bought at the price assessed in the tax-lists to ensure fairness. The land commission in charge of the allocations would be large and have twenty members so that it would not be small commission run by a clique and many men would share the honour. Caesar added that it would be run by the most suitable men. This was an invitation to the optimates to apply for these posts. He ruled himself out of the commission to avoid suggestions that he proposed the measure out of self-interest and said that he was happy with being just the <b>proposer</b> of the law. The senators kept delaying the vote. Cato advocated the status quo. Caesar came to the point of having him dragged out of the senate house and arrested. Cato said that he was up for this and many senators followed suit and left. Caesar adjourned the session of the senate and decided that since the senate was not willing to pass a preliminary decree he would get the plebeian council to vote. He did not convene the senate for the rest of his consulship and proposed motions directly to the plebeian council. Cassius Dio thought Caesar proposed the bill as a favour to Pompey and Crassus.|$|E

40|$|In the ultimatum-game, {{as in many}} real-life social {{exchange}} situations, the selfish {{motive to}} maximize own gains conflicts with fairness preferences. In the present study we manipulated the availability of cognitive-control resources for ultimatum-game <b>proposers</b> to test whether preference for fairness is a deliberative cognitive-controlled act or an automatic act. In two experiments we found that a shortage in cognitive control (ego depletion) led <b>proposers</b> in the ultimatum game to propose significantly more equal split offers than non-depleted <b>proposers.</b> These results {{can be interpreted as}} resulting from an automatic concern for fairness, or from a greater fear of rejection, which would be in line with a purely self-interested response. To separate these competing explanations, in Experiment 2 we conducted a dictator-game in which the responder cannot reject the offer. In contrast to the increased fairness behavior demonstrated by depleted ultimatum-game <b>proposers,</b> we found that depleted dictator-game allocators chose the equal split significantly less often than non-depleted allocators. These results indicate that fairness preferences are automatically driven among ultimatum game <b>proposers.</b> The automatic fair behavior, however, at least partially reflects concern about self-interest gain.
