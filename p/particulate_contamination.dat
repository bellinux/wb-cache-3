40|$|We {{study the}} failure {{mechanisms}} of a microresonator. A MEMs process simulation tool {{is used to}} discover {{the full spectrum of}} defective structures caused by <b>particulate</b> <b>contaminations</b> introduced during manufacturing. Based on process simulation results, defect categorization is performed. Mechanical and electrical simulation are then used to quantify the misbehaviors associated with the categories of defective structures. The analysis reveals that particulates can cause both parametric and catastrophic changes in behavior. Also, we found types of defects that do not affect mechanical behavior but {{have a significant impact on}} electrical behavior...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Clinicians {{have had}} {{concerns}} about <b>particulate</b> matter <b>contamination</b> of injectable drug products since {{the development of}} the earliest intravenous therapeutics. All parenteral products contain particulate matter, and <b>particulate</b> matter <b>contamination</b> still has the potential to cause harm to patients. With tens of millions of doses of injectable drug products administered in the United States each year, it is critical to understand the types and sources of particulate matter that contaminate injectable drug products, the possible effects of injected particulate matter on patients, and the current state of regulations and standards related to particulate matter in injectable drug products. Today, the goal of manufacturers, regulators, and standards-setting organizations should be to continue to minimize the risk of particle-induced sequelae, especially in high-risk patients, without trading unnecessary manufacturing burden for minimal safety gains...|$|R

50|$|On August 25, 1992, <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> {{was found}} within the spacecraft. After a full inspection, a {{cleaning}} was determined necessary and was performed on August 29.

This repair only works when the {{sodium silicate}} reaches its [...] "conversion" [...] temperature at 100-105°C. Contamination of engine oil is a serious possibility in situations in which a coolant-to-oil leak is present. Sodium silicate (glass <b>particulate)</b> <b>contamination</b> of lubricants is detrimental to their function.|$|E

40|$|By {{the end of}} this decade, the two {{missions}} {{comprising the}} Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) will become the X-ray component of NASA's Great Observatories. In order to meet some of the ambitious scientific objectives, the AXAF team plans to calibrate the telescopes and instruments to an accuracy of a few percent. <b>Particulate</b> and molecular <b>contamination</b> potentially limit this precision, because they would likely change between ground calibration and orbital operation. To avoid this requires careful control over procedures affecting the coated optical surfaces, to ensure that neither <b>particulate</b> nor molecular <b>contamination</b> compromise the calibration. In particular, the fractional areal coverage by particulates or condensed droplets must be less than 0. 005 projected onto the aperture plane; the thickness of any molecular film must be less than a few tens of angstrom...|$|R
40|$|In {{all places}} where {{engineered}} Nanoparticles (ENPs) are produced, used or handled, adequate workplace safety precautions should be implemented {{due to the}} protection of workers and the surrounding environment. Any possible accidental release of ENPs should be evaluated. Thereby detected potential risks have to be eliminated as far as possible. An implemented reasonable safety culture in each ENP-related company will help to meet this challenge. Different infrastructures and workplace design can help {{to reduce the risk of}} an accidentally contact of the workers with ENPs: Transferable examples will be shown from the semiconductor and life-science Industry. These systems like clean rooms, glove boxes, fume cupboards, filter and suction systems and other restricted area barrier access systems (RABS) are mainly being developed to protect sensitive products, but they can also be used to protect working personnel. Clean environments regarding airborne <b>particulate</b> <b>contaminations</b> can be classified according to ISO 14644 - 1. A short insight into this ISO-classification will be given. But overall, a simple and reasonable workplace and workflow organization will reduce the risk of an accidental release of ENPs largely. This may lead to a therefore necessary adaption of existing workflow patterns. The workers have to get aware about the potential risks! This can be done with appropriate education materials, leaflets, posters and brochures. These are some of the later outcomes from the NanoDevice dissemination and handbook work package...|$|R
50|$|High oil {{compressed}} air coalescing filters remove water and oil aerosols by coalescing the aerosols into droplets. This happens partially because of tortuous path and pressure drop. Coalescers remove both water and oil aerosols {{from the air}} stream, and are rated at <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> through direct interception. Filtration of oil, water aerosols, dust and dirt particles to 0.01 µm the best achievable in industry.|$|E
5000|$|Particle {{counters}} are utilized as {{measurement devices}} {{in order to}} determine <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> with regard to geometrical size, quantity, distribution, chronological progression and location. [...] The cleanroom suitability of a material describes its particle emission behavior. However, as particle emission from materials can only be assessed under stress conditions, model tests on material pairings have proved to be valuable in order to obtain reproducible, comparable results. Particle emission behavior tests have to be carried out under the same conditions as for machines and operating utilities, and optical particle counters are also implemented.|$|E
5000|$|The UK {{national}} building specifications, British Standard 5295:1989, specifically addresses [...] "clean room" [...] environments serving electronics manufacturers, {{as well as}} {{the pharmaceutical}} industry (the Pharmaceutical Industry has, for some time, worked to the ISO standard 14644 which is subtly different). Standard 5295:1989 specifically pertains to constructed interior spaces where higher than normal environmental standards must be maintained, in order to control <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination,</b> temperature and humidity. It is only at the third fix stage, when building site conditions are rendered virtually dust free, so as to minimize the introduction, generation and retention of particles which may contaminate equipment serving the electronics and pharmaceuticals manufacturing process, that the build-out of [...] "clean room" [...] spaces can commence.|$|E

50|$|Both sterile and {{non-sterile}} compounding {{are legal}} provided the medicines are provided {{for a particular}} patient for therapeutic application to that patient, and the compounded product is supplied on or from the compounding pharmacy premises. There are additional requirements for sterile compounding. Not only must a laminar flow cabinet flow hood be used, but {{the environment in which}} the hood is located must be strictly controlled for microbial and <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> and all procedures, equipment and personnel must be validated to ensure the safe preparation of sterile products. In non-sterile compounding, a powder containment hood is required when any hazardous material (e.g. hormones) are prepared or when there is a risk of cross-contamination of the compounded product. Pharmacists preparing compounded products must comply with these requirements and others published in the Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary & Handbook.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{phenomenon}} of <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> of heated wafers contained in a closed environment like the front opening unified pod (FOUP), which is a fundamental component of minienvironment system in semiconductor manufacturing, was elucidated both experimentally and numerically. The degree of <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> of heated wafers was examined according {{to the position of}} the wafers in the closed environment. The results showed that particles, if any, generated inside the closed environment such as the FOUP could be carried by natural convection flow and deposit on the heated wafer placed at the upper position in the closed environment. As a result, the topmost wafer was the most vulnerable to <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination.</b> The effect of the wafer temperature on the degree of <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> of the topmost wafer was investigated, and a narrower contaminated area appeared at a higher wafer temperature condition.

40|$|Spacecraft may {{actively}} {{modify their}} environment by {{the release of}} <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination.</b> Particles may also enter the near-spacecraft environment when spacecraft enter clouds of dust or debris in space. This contamination may seriously hamper the function of systems on board the craft. Two regimes of <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> will be examined. The first is that of <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> {{in the vicinity of}} a spacecraft. This may interfere substantially with functions such as electromagnetic observations in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. Second is the tendency of some particles to accumulate on surfaces, such as radiators or solar arrays, and degrade their performance. The background and the problem statement will be discussed in the first chapter. A computational model is developed to observe the behavior of <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> in the spacecraft environment. This model self-consistently monitors the forces and charge on the particle. Three methods of actively controlling the particles are introduced to the simulation.

40|$|<b>Particulate</b> surface <b>contamination</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of low yields in the {{semiconductor}} and other affected industries. The theory of low frequency (ultrasonic) and high frequency (megasonic) cleaning will be presented. Ultrasonic cleaning (less than 100 kHz) is relevant to cleaning of optics and precision parts. Megasonic cleaning (0. 8 to 1. 2 MHz) is used in semiconductor manufacturing. Experimental results for both types of cleaning, using semiconductor wafers, will be presented. Effects of varying operational parameters such as sonication time, and solution chemistry are shown. Effects of different particle composition and size challenges upon removal efficiency are also shown and discussed in terms of theory. Results indicate a strong dependence upon particle size and composition. Removal is also shown to be higher in SC 1 than in water. Emphasis will be placed upon cleaning of semiconductor (Si) wafers, but concepts can be applied to cleaning of other parts as well. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Particulate Optical Test was {{designed}} to record and measure particulate contaminants on the Hubble Space Telescope primary mirror. The objective of the test was to quantify the primary mirror <b>particulate</b> <b>contamination</b> prior to launch. The test consists of taking dark-field photographs of the primary mirror from {{in front of the}} telescope's aperture door. These photographs are subsequently digitized and analyzed to produce the areal coverage estimates. The estimated particulate areal obscuration is approximately 1. 0 percent of the primary mirror surface in the usable region.
