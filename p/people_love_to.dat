According to Thornton, [...] "I'm one of those artists that people take my music without my consent. <b>People</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> snatch my music and do things on their own. You got people that put me on beats I never rapped on. I just feel that it's a bad thing." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Steven Koch of the Halprin Landscapes Conservancy, {{the parks}} in Lawrence's Portland Open Space Sequence {{represent}} local geography: Source Fountain {{is above the}} timberline, Lovejoy Fountain and Pettygrove Park are in the middle, and Keller Fountain represents [...] "the foothills with the roaring falls". A writer in the Oregonian said the fountain [...] "is an abstraction of a mountain waterfall". Local architect Marcy McInelly said [...] "they were the first full realization of a theory about reflecting forces of nature but not mimicking natural forms. People came {{from all over the}} world to see them". Bob Gerding, who turned the First Regiment Armory Annex into the LEED Platinum-rated performing arts center, said that in 25 years, [...] "I hope [...] loved by the city. I hope <b>people</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> see plays there or have a meeting there or whatever, that it becomes just a cool thing in the city, like the Keller Fountain".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} use of Auto-Tune in Spears' voice. Ewing said that Blackout serves as a {{reminder}} of how instantly recognizable Spears' vocals are, saying that [...] "treated or untreated: her thin Southern huskiness is one of the defining sounds of 00s pop." [...] He noted that the album [...] "is a masterclass in autotune and vocal treatment as a studio instrument, disrupting and jamming the songs as much as it helps them." [...] While reviewing Spears' demo of [...] "Telephone", Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone compared it to [...] "Piece of Me", [...] "proving yet again how much impact Britney has had on the sonics of current pop. <b>People</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> make fun of Britney, and why not, but if 'Telephone' proves anything, it's that Blackout may be the most influential pop album of the past five years." [...] In June 2012, [...] "Blackout" [...] was added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's musical library and archive.|$|E

500|$|Inside Soap editor, Steven Murphy, {{said that}} the fact Pauline has been such an [...] "enduring staple" [...] will {{make it hard for}} fans to cope with her departure. [...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} <b>people</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> hate—you just assumed she would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years." [...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E
2500|$|Another writer {{recalled}} {{the area around}} the Dunbar as [...] "a place where <b>people</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> congregate and have a good time, check out the new models and pick up on the latest lingo." [...] The Dunbar built a reputation in the 1930s as [...] "the symbol of L.A.'s black nightlife," [...] as [...] "regular jamming sessions and meetings in the hotel lobby elevated the structure to a practically mythical status." [...] Lionel Hampton had fond memories of jam sessions and practices on the Dunbar's mezzanine. Hampton recalled, [...] "Everybody that was anybody showed up at the Dunbar. [...] I remember a chauffeur would drive Stepin Fetchit, the movie star, up to the curb in a big Packard, and he'd look out the window at all the folks." ...|$|E

6000|$|Yes. There is {{an eternal}} law of God, {{which people are}} forgetting, I often fear, more and more, in England just now.

60|$|Bertram {{kept his}} word, {{and told his}} lady-love all {{particulars}} as to the game he killed; some particulars also he gave her as to scenery, as to his friends, and as to Scotch people. He wrote nice, chatty, amusing letters, such as most <b>people</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> get from their friends; but he said little or nothing about love. Once or twice he ventured to tell her of some pretty girl that he met, of some adventure with a laird's daughter; nay, insinuated laughingly {{that he had not}} escaped from it quite heart-whole. Caroline answered his letter in the same tone; told him, with excellent comedy, of the leading facts of life in Littlebath; recommended him by all means to go back after the laird's daughter; described the joy of her heart at unexpectedly meeting Mr. M'Gabbery in the pump-room, and her subsequent disappointment at hearing that there was now a Mrs. M'Gabbery. He had married that Miss Jones, of whom the parental Potts had so strongly disapproved. All this was very nice, very amusing, and very friendly. But Bertram, as a lover, knew that he was not satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|Each {{political}} party accuses the [...] "opposing candidate" [...] of refusing to answer certain questions which somebody {{has chosen to}} ask him. I think myself it is discreditable for a candidate {{to answer any questions}} at all, to make speeches, declare his policy, or to do anything whatever to get himself elected. If a {{political party}} choose to nominate a man so obscure that his character and his views on all public questions are not known or inferable he ought to have the dignity to refuse to expound them. As to the strife for office being a pursuit worthy of a noble ambition, I do not think so; nor shall I believe that many do think so until the term [...] "office seeker" [...] carries a less opprobrious meaning and the dictum that [...] "the office should seek the man, not the man the office," [...] has a narrower currency among all manner of persons. That by acts and words generally felt to be discreditable a man may evoke great popular enthusiasm is not at all surprising. The late Mr. Barnum was not the first nor the last to observe that the <b>people</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> be humbugged. They love an impostor and a scamp, and the best service that you can do for a candidate for high political preferment is to prove him a little better than a thief, but not quite so good as a thug.|$|E

60|$|We pride {{ourselves}} on our superior light, and our improved civilisation, {{and look down}} on the old Roman Catholic missionaries, who converted our forefathers from heathendom in the Middle Ages. Now, I am a Protestant, if ever there was one, and I know well that these men had their superstitions and false doctrines. They made mistakes, and often worse than mistakes, for they were but men. But this I tell you, that if they had not had a deep and sound belief that they were in the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven; and that they and all men must obey the laws of the kingdom of heaven; and that the first law of it was, that wrongdoing would be punished, and rightdoing rewarded, in this life, every day, and all day long, as sure as Christ the living Lord reigned in righteousness over all the earth; if they had not believed that, I say, and acted on it, we should probably have been heathen at this day. As it is, unless we Protestants get back the old belief, that God is a living God, and that His judgments are abroad in the earth, and that only in keeping His commandments can we get life, and not perish, we shall be seriously in danger of sinking at last into that hopeless state of popular feeling, into which more than one nation in our own time has fallen,--that, as the prophet of old says, a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets--that is, the preachers and teachers--prophesy falsely; and the priests--the ministers of religion--bear rule by their means; and my <b>people</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> have it so--love to have their consciences drugged by the news that they may live bad lives, and yet die good deaths.|$|E
