The team played their home games at the Teaneck Armory for that one season, and was {{scheduled}} to play a one-game playoff at the armory.

500|$|In 1973, the San Diego Conquistadors of the NBA rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $600,000 salary. However, the Lakers sued {{their former}} star and {{successfully}} {{prevented him from}} actually playing, because he still owed them the option year of his contract. Barred from playing, Chamberlain mostly left the coaching duties to his assistant Stan Albeck, who recalled: [...] "Chamberlain... has a great feel for <b>pro</b> <b>basketball...</b> the day-to-day things that {{are an important part}} of basketball... just bored him. He did not have the patience." [...] The players were split on Chamberlain, who was seen as competent, but often indifferent and more occupied with promotion of his autobiography Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door than with coaching. [...] He once skipped a game to sign autographs for the book. In his single season as a coach, the Conquistadors went a mediocre 37–47 in the regular season and lost against the Utah Stars in the Division Semifinals. However, Chamberlain was not pleased by the Qs' meager attendance: crowds averaged 1,843, just over half of the Qs' small San Diego 3,200-seat sports arena. After the season, Chamberlain retired from professional basketball.|$|E
