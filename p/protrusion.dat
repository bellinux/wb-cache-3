5|$|Shortly after Jordan's {{description}} was published, several scientists {{noted the}} similarity between Mitsukurina and the extinct Mesozoic shark Scapanorhynchus. For a time, the prevailing view was to treat Mitsukurina as a junior synonym of Scapanorhynchus. Eventually, more complete fossils revealed many anatomical differences between Scapanorhynchus and Mitsukurina, leading modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera. Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This taxonomic confusion arose because the specimens' jaws were fixed at varying degrees of <b>protrusion</b> during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences in the head.|$|E

40|$|Short Abstract — Cells {{produce a}} variety of <b>protrusions</b> through {{polymerization}} of actin filaments near the membrane. Many of these <b>protrusions</b> also contain adhesive proteins that together with the actin filaments organize in a fairly similar way in most adhesive <b>protrusions.</b> I will present a simplified physical model that attempts to explain the structure and behavior of such <b>protrusions</b> (specifically podosomes). In this model, actin activity level depends on membrane curvature as indicated by recent experimental evidence. This dependence can account for some special features observed in these systems...|$|R

40|$|We {{carry out}} phase field {{simulations}} to study {{properties of the}} comblike step patterns induced by an adatom source. When an adatom source advances {{right in front of}} a step, stepwandering is caused by the asymmetry of the surface diffusion field and small <b>protrusions</b> are formed. If the velocity of the source Vp is smaller than a critical value V c p, the <b>protrusions</b> follow the adatom source with coarsening of the step pattern, and a regular comblike pattern with finger-like <b>protrusions</b> is formed. With a sufficiently small Vp, the gap of the supersaturation is large at the adatom source. Since the period of <b>protrusions,,</b> decreases with increasing Vp, the coarsening of step pattern is irrelevant for the <b>protrusions</b> {{to catch up with the}} adatom source. Near V c p, the gap of the supersaturation at the adatom source is small.

5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a <b>protrusion</b> that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.|$|E
5|$|A bowl {{of living}} larvae is {{served at the}} meal, to Picard's disgust. He {{attempts}} to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears {{to be controlled by}} the parasite Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic <b>protrusion</b> on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Cell-to-cell spread is a {{fundamental}} step in the infection cycle of Listeria monocytogenes that strictly depends on the formation of bacteria-induced <b>protrusions.</b> Since Listeria actin tails in the <b>protrusions</b> are tightly associated with the plasma membrane, we hypothesised that membrane–cytoskeleton linkers would be required for initiating and sustaining their formation and the subsequent cell-to-cell spread. We have found that ezrin, {{a member of the}} ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) family that functions as a key membrane–cytoskeleton linker, accumulates at Listeria <b>protrusions.</b> The ability of Listeria to induce <b>protrusions</b> and effectively spread between adjacent cells depends on the interaction of ERM proteins with both a membrane component such as CD 44 and actin filaments. Interfering with either of these interactions or with ERM proteins phosphorylation not only reduces the number of <b>protrusions</b> but also alters their morphology, resulting in the formation of short and collapsed <b>protrusions.</b> As a consequence, Listeria cell-to-cell spread is severely impaired. Thus, ERM proteins are exploited by Listeria to escape the host immune response and to succeed {{in the development of the}} infection...|$|R
40|$|A hybrid {{technique}} {{combining the}} shooting-andbouncing-ray (SBR) method and the method-of-moments (MoM) is presented for analyzing scattering by large conducting bodies having small <b>protrusions.</b> In this technique, the MoM with an approximate Green's function {{is used to}} characterize the small <b>protrusions,</b> yielding an admittance matrix, which, when multiplied with the incident field on the <b>protrusions,</b> yields the currents induced on the <b>protrusions.</b> The incident field {{in the presence of}} the large bodies is calculated using the SBR method. The field radiated by the currents on the <b>protrusions</b> is also calculated using the SBR method with the aid of reciprocity.

5|$|At {{the back}} of the skull there is a <b>protrusion,</b> called the nuchal crest, arising from the fused parietal bones, a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids. In Alioramus, the nuchal crest is greatly thickened, {{similarly}} to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Like the rest of the skull, the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender, another possible juvenile characteristic. As in Tarbosaurus, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, locking the two bones together and removing much of the flexibility seen in other tyrannosaurids. Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth, D-shaped in cross section, on each side. Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla, and 18 in each dentary, Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth, more than any other tyrannosaurid. The braincase of A. altai was intermediate between the basal theropod and avialan conditions.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual <b>protrusion</b> of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E

He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A <b>protrusion</b> then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} Comeld hybrid {{joining technology}} for joining Ti 6 Al 4 V and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) is presented. The Comeld joining method utilises <b>protrusions</b> formed {{on the surface}} of the metal by electron beam surface treatment which are then embedded into composite layers to form an integrated joint by co-curing. In this paper, joints were formed with wedge profiled <b>protrusions</b> on the metal surface and during tensile testing the <b>protrusions</b> resisted fracture in all tests, leading to failure in the composite part. A digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to monitor full field, in-plane strain during the tests and to also identify the development of failure modes. The results from specimens with <b>protrusions</b> exposed on the side surface by grinding showed that the embedded <b>protrusions</b> are effective in reducing stress concentration near the metal composite interface and therefore contributed to improved mechanical properties of the hybrid joints...|$|R
40|$|Fine {{structure}} of the ascidian tunic cuticle was studied by transmission and scanning electron microscopy in 26 species belonging to 10 families.

5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw <b>protrusion</b> is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner.

Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck.
