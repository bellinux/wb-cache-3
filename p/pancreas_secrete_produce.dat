50|$|A {{monogastric}} {{digestive system}} works {{as soon as}} the food enters the mouth. Saliva moistens the food and begins the digestive process. After being swallowed, the food passes from the esophagus into the stomach, where stomach acid and enzymes help to break down the food. Bile salts stored in the gall bladder empty the contents of the stomach into the small intestines where most fats are broken down. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> enzymes and alkali to neutralize the stomach acid.|$|R
2500|$|As a meal {{containing}} carbohydrates or {{protein is}} eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes {{to stimulate the}} action of several enzymes, including glycogen synthase. Glucose molecules {{are added to the}} chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or [...] "fed" [...] state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> zymogens {{partly to}} prevent the enzymes from digesting {{proteins}} in the cells {{in which they are}} synthesised. Enzymes like pepsin are created in the form of pepsinogen, an inactive zymogen. Pepsinogen is activated when chief cells release it into the gastric acid, whose hydrochloric acid partially activates it. Another partially activated pepsinogen completes the activation by removing the peptide, turning the pepsinogen into pepsin. Accidental activation of zymogens can happen when the secretion duct in the pancreas is blocked by a gallstone resulting in acute pancreatitis.|$|R
40|$|On a {{clinical}} basis, severe insulin re-sistance {{is defined as}} a situation inwhich a patient requires 200 units of insulin daily for 2 days (1). This definitionwas determined 50 years ago, when it was erroneously believed that the human <b>pancreas</b> <b>secreted</b> 200 units of insulin a day. Although it is now known that the normal <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> only 20 – 40 units of insulin a day, this clinical definition is helpful because it delin-eates a very small group of patients, many with a number of unusual under-lying problems. In adults, the conditions associated with clinical insulin resistance are gross obesity, severe infection, Cushing’s syn-drome, acromegaly, hemochromatosis, li-podystrophic diabetes, genetic insulin receptor abnormalities, insulin receptor antibodies, Werner’s syndrome (adult form of progeria), insulin degradation at the injection site, and high titers of IgG insulin binding antibodies (immune me-diated). Gross obesity {{is by far the most}} common condition. Although a recent re-view (2) discussed the use of U- 500 reg-ular insulin in states of severe insulin resistance, no detailed description of how to start and adjust doses of this concen-trated form of insulin was given. This ar-ticle provides a treatment algorithm for the use of U- 500 regular insulin and sum-marizes our experience with obese, mark-edly insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic patients.

50|$|In type 2 diabetes, {{the cells}} of the body become {{resistant}} to the effects of insulin as the receptors which bind to the hormone become less sensitive to insulin concentrations resulting in hyperinsulinemia and disturbances in insulin release. With a reduced response to insulin, the beta cells of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secrete</b> increasing amounts of insulin in response to the continued high blood glucose levels resulting in hyperinsulinemia. In insulin resistant tissues, a threshold concentration of insulin is reached causing the cells to uptake glucose and therefore decreases blood glucose levels. Studies have shown that the high levels of insulin resulting from insulin resistance might enhance insulin resistance.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{inappropriate}} or premature activation of the digestive enzymes (they may, for example, trigger pancreatic self-digestion causing pancreatitis), these enzymes are secreted as inactive zymogen. The precursor of pepsin, pepsinogen, is secreted by the stomach, and is activated only in the acidic environment found in stomach. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> the precursors {{of a number of}} proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. The zymogen of trypsin is trypsinogen, which is activated by a very specific protease, enterokinase, secreted by the mucosa of the duodenum.

40|$|Gastrinomas are neuroendocrine neoplasms, usually {{located in}} the {{duodenum}} or <b>pancreas,</b> that <b>secrete</b> gastrin and cause a clinical syndrome known as Zollinger-Elli-son syndrome (ZES). ZES is characterized by gastric acid hypersecretion resulting in severe peptic disease (peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) [8 – 10]. In this section, ZES due to both duode-nal and pancreatic gastrinomas will be covered together because clinically they are similar [8, 10]. Specific points related to gastrinomas associated with the genetic syn-drome of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) (25 % of cases) will also be mentioned [11, 12].

5000|$|Secretin was {{the first}} hormone to be identified. In 1902, William Bayliss and Ernest Starling were {{studying}} how the nervous system controls the process of digestion. It was known that the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secreted</b> digestive juices {{in response to the}} passage of food (chyme) through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum. They discovered (by cutting all the nerves to the pancreas in their experimental animals) that this process was not, in fact, governed by the nervous system. They determined that a substance secreted by the intestinal lining stimulates the pancreas after being transported via the bloodstream. They named this intestinal secretion secretin. Secretin {{was the first}} such [...] "chemical messenger" [...] identified. This type of substance is now called a hormone, a term coined by Bayliss in 1905.|$|R
5000|$|While insulin is <b>secreted</b> by the <b>pancreas</b> {{to lower}} blood glucose levels, {{glucagon}} is secreted to raise blood glucose levels. This is why glucagon {{has been known}} for decades as a counter-regulatory hormone. [...] When blood glucose levels are low, the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> glucagon, which in turn causes the liver to convert stored glycogen polymers into glucose monomers, which is then released into the blood. This process is called glycogenolysis. Liver cells, or hepatocytes, have glucagon receptors which allow for glucagon to attach to them and thus stimulate glycogenolysis. [...] Contrary to insulin, which is produced by pancreatic β-cells, glucagon is produced by pancreatic α-cells. It is also known that an increase in insulin suppresses glucagon secretion, and a decrease in insulin, along with low glucose levels, stimulates the secretion of glucagon.|$|R
50|$|A working <b>pancreas</b> {{continually}} <b>secretes</b> {{small amounts}} of insulin into the blood to maintain normal glucose levels, which would otherwise rise from glucose release by the liver, especially during the early morning dawn phenomenon. This insulin {{is referred to as}} basal insulin secretion, and constitutes almost half the insulin produced by the normal pancreas.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> high HCO 3 - has not been fully resolved. This alkaline secretion, formed in pancreatic ducts, {{can be achieved by}} transporting HCO 3 - from serosa to mucosa or by moving H+ in the opposite direction. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether H+/K+-ATPases are expressed and functional in human pancreatic ducts and whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have effect on those. Here we show that the gastric HKα 1 and HKβ subunits (ATP 4 A; ATP 4 B) and non-gastric HKα 2 subunits (ATP 12 A) of H+/K+-ATPases are expressed in human pancreatic cells. Pumps have similar localizations in duct cell monolayers (Capan- 1) and human pancreas, and notably the gastric pumps are localized on the luminal membranes. In Capan- 1 cells, PPIs inhibited recovery of intracellular pH from acidosis. Furthermore, in rats treated with PPIs, pancreatic secretion was inhibited but concentrations of major ions in secretion follow similar excretory curves in control and PPI treated animals. In addition to HCO 3 -, <b>pancreas</b> also <b>secretes</b> K+. In conclusion, this study calls for a revision of the basic model for HCO 3 - secretion. We propose that proton transport is driving secretion, and that in addition it may provide a protective pH buffer zone and K+ recirculation. Furthermore, it seems relevant to re-evaluate whether PPIs should be used in treatment therapies where pancreatic functions are already compromised...|$|R

50|$|The Hay System {{promoted}} eating {{three meals}} per day with meal one being what the diet {{considers to be}} alkaline foods only, meal two composed of what the diet considers to be protein foods with salads, vegetables and fruit, and meal three composed of what the diet considers to be starchy foods with salads, vegetables and sweet fruit; with an interval of 4.0 to 4.5 hours between each meal. The Hay diet was popular in the 1930s and many restaurants offered 'Hay-friendly' menus; followers of his dietary advice, included Henry Ford and Man Ray. In this period Hay was criticized in the Journal of the American Medical Society (JAMA) as a food-faddist and separately for advocating that a patient with type 1 diabetes on the Hay diet should stop taking insulin. In 1935, Stewart Baxter showed that the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> digestion enzymes simultaneously {{regardless of whether the}} food eaten is carbohydrates or protein, contrary to one of the central propositions of the diet.|$|R

50|$|Pulsatile {{intravenous}} insulin therapy, {{sometimes called}} metabolic activation therapy, or cellular activation therapy describes in a literal sense the intravenous injection of insulin in pulses versus continuous infusions. Injection of insulin in pulses mimics the physiological secretions of insulin by the pancreas into the portal vein which then drains into the liver. In healthy, non-diabetic individuals, pancreatic secretions of insulin {{correspond to the}} intake of food. The <b>pancreas</b> will <b>secrete</b> variable amounts of insulin based upon {{the amount of food}} consumed (basically speaking, the more food that is consumed, the more insulin the <b>pancreas</b> will <b>secrete)</b> among other factors. Continuous exposure to insulin and glucagon is known to decrease the hormones’ metabolic effectiveness on glucose production in humans due to the body developing an increased tolerance to the hormones. Down-regulation at the cellular level may partially explain the decreased action of steady-state levels of insulin, while pulsatile hormone secretion may allow recovery of receptor affinity and numbers for insulin. Intermittent intravenous insulin administration with peaks of insulin concentrations may enhance suppression of gluconeogenesis and reduce hepatic glucose production.|$|R

50|$|Bayliss and Starling {{investigated}} pancreatic secretion, {{which at}} that time was believed to be entirely under nervous control.

40|$|<b>Pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> fluid rich in {{digestive}} enzymes and bicarbonate. The alkaline secretion {{is important in}} buffering of acid chyme entering duodenum and for activation of enzymes. This secretion is formed in pancreatic ducts, and studies to date show that plasma membranes of duct epithelium express H+/HCO 3 − transporters, which depend on gradients created by the Na+/K+-ATPase. However, the model cannot fully account for high-bicarbonate concentrations, and other active transporters, i. e. pumps, have not been explored. Here we show that pancreatic ducts express functional gastric and non-gastric H+-K+-ATPases. We measured intracellular pH and secretion in small ducts isolated from rat pancreas and showed their sensitivity to H+-K+ pump inhibitors and ion substitutions. Gastric and non-gastric H+-K+ pumps were demonstrated on RNA and protein levels, and pumps were localized to the plasma membranes of pancreatic ducts. Quantitative analysis of H+/HCO 3 − and fluid transport shows that the H+-K+ pumps can contribute to pancreatic secretion in several species. Our results call for revision of the bicarbonate transport physiology in pancreas, and most likely other epithelia. Furthermore, because pancreatic ducts {{play a central role}} in several pancreatic diseases, it is of high relevance to understand the role of H+-K+ pumps in pathophysiology...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic tumours are scirrhous, {{avascular}} tumours, {{suggesting that}} they may produce angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress {{the growth of the}} vasculature to the tumour and metastases. We have sought evidence for the angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin, in normal and cancerous pancreatic tissue. Using Western blotting, we found mature 20 [*]kDa endostatin in cancer tissue but not in normal tissue. Several endostatin-related peptides of higher mol wt were present in both tissues. Extracts from normal tissue were able to degrade exogenous endostatin, whereas extracts from cancer were without effect. Although the exocrine <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> inactive proenzymes of trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, their possible role in this degradation was examined. The trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor, Glycine max, did not prevent the degradation of endostatin by normal pancreatic extracts but elastatinal, a specific inhibitor of elastase, reduced the rate of degradation. Extracts of pancreatic tumours did not express any detectable elastase activity, but an elastase (Km 1. 1 [*]mM) was expressed by extracts of normal pancreas. We conclude that endostatin is present and stable in pancreatic cancer tissues, which may explain their avascular nature, but that normal pancreatic tissue expresses enzymes, including elastase, which rapidly degrade endostatin. The stability of endostatin may have implications for its therapeutic use...|$|R

Via ultrasound guidance we applied steroids directly to ovine fetuses at d 62 and d 82 of gestation, and examined fetal (day 90 gestation) and postnatal (11 months old) pancreatic structure and function. Of three classes of steroid agonists applied (androgen - Testosterone propionate (TP), estrogen - Diethystilbesterol (DES) and glucocorticoid - Dexamethasone (DEX)), only androgens (TP) caused altered pancreatic development. Beta cell numbers were significantly elevated in prenatally androgenised female fetuses (P= 0. 03) (to approximately the higher numbers found in male fetuses), whereas alpha cell counts were unaffected, precipitating decreased alpha:beta cell ratios {{in the developing}} fetal pancreas (P= 0. 001), sustained into adolescence (P= 0. 0004). In adolescence basal insulin secretion was significantly higher in female offspring from androgen-excess pregnancies (P= 0. 045), and an exaggerated, hyperinsulinaemic response to glucose challenge (P= 0. 0007) observed, whereas prenatal DES or DEX treatment had no effects upon insulin secretion. Postnatal insulin secretion correlated with beta cell numbers (P= 0. 03). We conclude that the pancreas is a primary locus of androgenic stimulation during development, giving rise to postnatal offspring whose <b>pancreas</b> <b>secreted</b> excess insulin due to excess beta cells {{in the presence of}} a normal number of alpha cells...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Micropuncture {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to examine electrolyte secretion by the in vitro rabbit pancreas. The concentration profiles of the major secreted ions and digestive protein and the electrical potential profile within the pancreatic ductal system have been determined during spontaneous and secretin-stimulated secretion. The active transport of both Na and HCO 3 are the rate-controlling steps in primary secretion. Spontaneous secretion is produced primarily within the intralobular ducts. The anion composition of this primary secretion depends on the secretion rate with HCO 3 ranging from about 70 meq/liter at low rates to about 110 meq/liter at high rates. With secretin stimulation the smaller extralobular ducts also secrete and this extralobular secretion has a higher HCO? content than that of the intralobular secretion. In the main collecting duct the anion composition of the juice is modified further by Cl-HC 03 exchange which appears to be a passive process depending on the average residence time of the juice in the main duct. Little is known definitively about the mechanisms responsible for pancreatic electrolyte secretion either at the whole tissue or the cellular level. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> a fluid rich in HCO 3 into a highly branched ductal system through which it is transported to the duodenum to aid in the neutralization of gastric secretion. Due to the complex geometry of the ductal system, electrolyte secretion has been studied primarily by collecting and analyzing the juice leaving the gland. The characteristic feature of the externally collected juice is a hyperbolic dependence of the juice HCO 3 concentration on the secretion rate (1). Over the years three major whole tissue mechanisms, admixture (2, 3), Cl-HCO 3 exchange (4), and unicellular (5 - 7) have been proposed to explain this dependency. These mechanisms differ only i...|$|R
