Plutonium dioxide is mainly produced by calcination of plutonium(IV) oxalate, Pu(C2O4)2·6H2O, at 300 °C. <b>Plutonium</b> <b>oxalate</b> is obtained during the reprocessing of nuclear fuel as plutonium is dissolved in HNO3/HF. Plutonium dioxide can also be recovered from molten-salt breeder reactors by adding sodium carbonate to the fuel salt after any remaining uranium is removed from the salt as its hexafluoride.|$|E

The basic Task II process {{consists of}} calcining the <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxalate</b> cake to form plutonium dioxide. The plutonium dioxide is then fluorinated to form plutonium tetrafluoride which is transferred to Task III for further processing.

40|$|All of the 231 Building {{final product}} was {{prepared}} for off-site shipment prior to the startup of the 234 - 5 Building. The evaporator (S- 1) effluent, a solution approximately 10 molar in nitric acid with plutonium concentration of 275 grams/liter, was dried within the shipping container (sample can) to a solid cake. The purpose of this drying operation was to minimize personnel contamination and/or loss of product during shipment. The dried cake was redissolved in water before further purification steps could be performed. The procedures for testing the purification of AT solution as recommended by the development group (6) were presented in Production Test 231 - 10 Supplement B.

40|$|Oxalate {{precipitation}} {{followed by}} filtration {{is used to}} prepare <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxalate.</b> Historically, <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxalate</b> has tended to accumulate in the precipitation tanks. These solids are periodically removed by flushing with concentrated (64 percent) nitric acid. The same precipitation tanks will now {{be used in the}} processing of neptunium. Literature values indicate that neptunium oxalate may not be as soluble as <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxalate</b> in nitric acid. Although a wide variety of options is available to improve neptunium oxalate solubility for precipitator flushing, most of these options are not practical for use. Many of these options require the use of incompatible or difficult to handle chemicals. Other options would require expensive equipment modifications or are likely to lead to product contamination. Based on review of literature and experimental results, the two best options for flushing the precipitator are (1) 64 percent nitric acid and (2) addition of sodium permanganate follow ed by sodium nitrite. Nitric acid is the easiest option to implement. It is already used in the facility and will not lead to product contamination. Experimental results indicate that neptunium oxalate can be dissolved in concentrated nitric acid (64 percent) at 60 degree C to a concentration of 2. 6 to 5. 6 grams of Np/liter after at least three hours of heating. A lower concentration (1. 1 grams of Np/liter) was measured at 60 degree C after less than two hours of heating. These concentrations are acceptable for flushing if precipitator holdup is low (approximately 100 - 250 grams), but a second method is required for effective flushing if precipitator holdup is high (approximately 2 kilograms). The most effective method for obtaining higher neptunium concentrations is the use of sodium permanganate followed by the addition of sodium nitrite. There is concern that residual manganese from these flushes could impact product purity. Gas generation during permanganate addition is also a concern. Experimental results indicate that a solubility of at least 40 grams of Np/liter can be obtained using permanganate at ambient temperature, although it is expected that even higher neptunium concentrations can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} has been reviewed in December 2011 for calcination data of plutonium oxide (PuO{sub 2 }) from <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxalate</b> Pu(C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }) {sub 2 } precipitation {{with respect to}} the PuO{sub 2 } specific surface area (SSA). A summary of the literature is presented for what are believed to be the dominant factors influencing SSA, the calcination temperature and time. The PuO{sub 2 } from Pu(C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }) {sub 2 } calcination data from this review has been regressed to better understand the influence of calcination temperature and time on SSA. Based on this literature review data set, calcination temperature has a bigger impact on SSA versus time. However, there is still some variance in this data set that may be reflecting differences in the <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxalate</b> preparation or different calcination techniques. It is evident from this review that additional calcination temperature and time data for PuO{sub 2 } from Pu(C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }) {sub 2 } needs to be collected and evaluated to better define the relationship. The existing data set has a lot of calcination times that are about 2 hours and therefore may be underestimating the impact of heating time on SSA. SRNL recommends that more calcination temperature and time data for PuO{sub 2 } from Pu(C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }) {sub 2 } be collected and this literature review data set be augmented to better refine the relationship between PuO{sub 2 } SSA and its calcination parameters...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{dissolution}} of plutonium dioxide {{has traditionally been}} accomplished by contact with strong nitric acid containing {{a small amount of}} fluoride at temperatures of {approximately} 100 C. In spite of these aggressive conditions, PuO{sub 2 } dissolution is sometimes incomplete requiring additional contact with the solvent. This work focused on an alternative to conventional dissolution in nitric acid where an electron transfer catalyst, Fe(II), was used in hydrochloric acid. Cyclic voltammetry was employed as an in-situ analytical technique for monitoring the dissolution reaction rate.

Attempts to dry sieve the oxide into narrow size fractions prior to dissolution in the HCl-Fe(II) solvent system failed, apparently due to significant interparticle attractive forces. Although sieve splits were obtained, subsequent scanning laser microscopy analysis of the sieve fractions indicated that particle segregation was not accomplished and the individual sieve fractions retained a particle size distribution very similar to the original powder assemblage. This phenomena was confirmed through subsequent dissolution experiments on the various screen fractions which illustrated no difference in kinetic behavior between the original oxide assemblage and the sieve fractions...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} review of oxalate oxidation processes finds that manganese(II) -catalyzed nitric acid oxidation of oxalate in precipitate filtrate {{is a viable}} and well-documented process. The process has been operated on the large scale at Savannah River in the past, including oxidation of 20 tons of oxalic acid in F-Canyon. Research data {{under a variety of}} conditions show the process to be robust. This process is recommended for oxalate destruction in H-Canyon in the upcoming program to produce feed for the MOX facility. Prevention of <b>plutonium</b> <b>oxalate</b> precipitation in filtrate can be achieved by concentrated nitric acid/ferric nitrate sequestration of oxalate. Organic complexants do not appear practical to sequester plutonium. Testing is proposed to confirm the literature and calculation findings of this review at projected operating conditions for the upcoming campaign. H Canyon plans to commence conversion of plutonium metal to low-fired plutonium oxide in 2012 for eventual use in the Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX) Facility. The flowsheet includes sequential operations of metal dissolution, ion exchange, elution, oxalate precipitation, filtration, and calcination. All processes beyond dissolution will occur in HB-Line. The filtration step produces an aqueous filtrate that may have as much as 4 M nitric acid and 0. 15 M oxalate. The oxalate needs to be removed from the stream to prevent possible downstream precipitation of residual plutonium when the solution is processed in H Canyon. In addition, sending the oxalate to the waste tank farm is undesirable. This report addresses the processing options for destroying the oxalate in existing H Canyon equipment...|$|E

No major problems were noted during {{the operation of the}} mixer-settlers, and low uranium and plutonium losses (< 0. 02 %) were achieved. Zirconium and ruthenium decontamination factors (DFs) were improved by increasing the number of scrub stages and increasing the peak solvent loading in the coextraction-coscrub bank. The use of an in-line photometer to measure the uranium and plutonium concentrations in a process stream permitted high solvent loadings of heavy metals to be achieved in the extraction bank while maintaining low losses to the aqueous raffinate.
