For example, in Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation 1955 2 QB 327, the Court held that the <b>posting</b> <b>rule</b> did not apply to an acceptance by telex as the Court regarded it as an instantaneous form of communication. The general principle that acceptance takes place when communicated applies to instantaneous forms of communication. Courts have similarly held that the <b>posting</b> <b>rule</b> {{does not apply}} to acceptances by telephone or fax.|$|E
50|$|The <b>posting</b> <b>rule</b> {{does not}} apply to option {{contracts}} or irrevocable offers where acceptance is still effective only upon receipt. This is because the offeree no longer needs protection against subsequently mailed revocations of the offer.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>posting</b> <b>rule</b> (or mailbox {{rule in the}} United States, {{also known}} as the [...] "postal rule" [...] or [...] "deposited {{acceptance}} rule") is an exception to the general rule of contract law in common law countries that acceptance of an offer takes place when communicated. Under the <b>posting</b> <b>rule,</b> that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted (that is, dropped in a post box or handed to a postal worker). [...] In plain English, the [...] "meeting of the minds" [...] necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is sent via post by the person accepting it, rather than when that acceptance is received by the person who offered the contract.|$|E

50|$|One {{rationale}} {{given for}} the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror. The main effect of the <b>posting</b> <b>rule</b> is {{that the risk of}} acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror. If the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>posting</b> <b>rule</b> {{applies only}} to acceptance. Other {{contractual}} letters (such as one revoking the offer) do not take effect until the letter is delivered, as in Stevenson, Jacques & Co v McLean (1880) 5 QBD 346. The implication {{of this is that}} it is possible for a letter of acceptance to be posted after a letter of revocation of the offer has been posted but before it is delivered, and acceptance will be complete {{at the time that the}} letter of acceptance was posted—the offeror's revocation would be inoperative.|$|E
50|$|Under the <b>posting</b> <b>rule,</b> {{performance}} {{is a means}} of acceptance. If A orders 1000 blue coathangers and B ships them out, that shipment {{is considered to be a}} conveyance of acceptance of A's offer to buy the coathangers. Defective {{performance is}} also an acceptance, unless accompanied by an explanation. For example, if A orders 1000 blue coathangers, and B mistakenly ships 1000 red coathangers, this is still an acceptance of the contract. However, if B ships the red coathangers with a note that they sent these because they had run out of blue coathangers, this is not an acceptance, but rather an accommodation, which is a form of counter-offer.|$|E

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{implication of}} {{the operation of the}} <b>posting</b> <b>rule</b> is that an acceptance is complete once the letter of acceptance is posted; it makes no difference whether the offeror actually receives the letter. This was demonstrated in Byrne v Van Tienhoven (1880) 5 CPD 344. If a letter of acceptance were to be lost, acceptance has still taken place. An exception to this would be if the offeree knows or has reason to know that the letter of acceptance never reached the offeror. For example, if A brings a letter of acceptance to the local post office and A sees the post office burn down a moment later, there is no acceptance.|$|E

40|$|This article {{identifies}} how {{the use of}} the European Union (EU) mobility rules, as {{formulated by}} the EU's Posting Directive, has been linked to the temporary provision of services in practice. It demonstrates how this linkage, legitimised by European Court rulings, undermines the Directive's original intent to provide rights-based regulation of labour mobility in the Union. In the assessment of posting practices, striking findings of two studies co-conducted by the author in 2003 and 2010 are discussed. In the first section, the origins of the Directive are described, followed by sections that contextualise the <b>posting</b> <b>rules</b> in the framework of the fundamental economic freedoms of EU Treaties, and discuss the problems related to implementation and enforcement. Based on the Directive's definition of posting, three issues of governance and practice are raised: (a) regulation of the employment relationship, (b) application of labour conditions and (c) respect for collective agreements. A final section offers policy recommendations {{in order to deal with}} the ways in which posting governance and practices currently impede any vision of rights-based mobility in the EU. It is argued that current minimalist interpretation of the <b>posting</b> <b>rules</b> can neither guarantee equal treatment nor protect the rights of temporary migrant workers...|$|R
40|$|The cross border {{provision}} of services with posted workers {{is an integral part}} of the economic freedoms in the EU internal market. In the best case this provision is a logical part of a genuine division of labour at European scale between contractors and specialised subcontractors. In the worst case the cross border {{provision of}} services falsely can be used as a method to recruit cheap temporary labour. The EU Posting Directive, established in the mid 1990 s, tried to settle <b>posting</b> <b>rules</b> that could guarantee the rights of posted workers within the territory where the work was pursued. Starting point was that a foreign employer, who temporarily delivers services, with workers posted, had to respect a large part of the applicable labour standards in the host country. CLR Studies 6 is dedicated to an analysis of the theory and practice of the functioning of the <b>posting</b> <b>rules</b> in 12 European countries. The experts’ focus was on the practical experiences of compliance authorities, labour inspectors and other controlling bodies. One of the main conclusions of this practical evaluation is that the use of the posting mechanism ranges from normal and decent long-established partnership between contracting partners to completely fake letter box practices of labour-only recruitment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{addition}} to penalties imposed for breaches of statutory duties {{in the event}} of workplace accidents involving physical harms, New Zealand’s Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 also provides for penalties where accidents have not occurred. Ordinary negligence <b>rules</b> are ex <b>post</b> in that both an accident and harm must occur before liability accrues, whereas ex ante liability rules create liability for deficient care per se. This paper examines whether liability for breaches of duty that do not give rise to accidents have a useful incentive-enhancing role for health and safety decisions by employers in the New Zealand context when used in conjunction with ex <b>post</b> liability <b>rules.</b> We argue that ex <b>post</b> <b>rules</b> by themselves are insufficient to induce appropriate levels of precaution due to the combined presence of weak penalties and considerable uncertainty surrounding the Courts’ required standard of care. Merely augmenting ex post liability with ex ante liability, however, is unlikely to induce desirable levels of employer precautions. Further, more strict ex ante standards than socially optimal precaution levels may be desirable since inspection probabilities, prosecution rates, and penalties for breaches of ex ante standards are relatively low, providing some justification for the relatively stringent safety regulations and required standard of care observed in New Zealand. Nevetheless, a weaker but less uncertain standard may instead induce a small degree of overprecaution, removing the need for ex ante regulations from this particular perspective...|$|R
