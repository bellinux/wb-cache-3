500|$|By the mid-2000s, whale tails became {{common to}} celebrities, {{providing}} opportunities to the paparazzi. Whale tail display spawned a new accessory [...] clip-on jewelry for the visible straps. Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian claimed that following pop {{stars in the}} hipster trousers {{gave rise to the}} [...] "low-slung jeans, whale-tail G-string era". On 17 September 2004, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera regularly were photographed with thong straps riding high above their low-rise jeans. And even usually tasteful Halle Berry succumbed to the thong craze by attending an awards show with bejeweled thong straps <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> above her miniskirt." [...] Actresses Gillian Anderson, Natalie Portman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall and Tara Reid, MTV's Molly Sims, model Kate Moss, singers Beyoncé Knowles, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, LeAnn Rimes and Britney Spears have been associated as propagators of the trend by ABC.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a production management company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd, giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E

2500|$|The figure stands {{outdoors}} at {{the base}} of a set of stone steps with no visible detail aside from some undergrowth and rocks. He looks off to his right, which is to say away from the other two characters in the triptych. His face has a serious expression, and he holds a long unsheathed sword in front of him with both hands. The empty black [...] sheath is tucked into his blue patterned obi sash, and <b>peeks</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> behind his back along with a second matching sheathed sword. Both tsuka sword handles would <b>peek</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> his left side, the standard position for samurai as it made them more accessible for the right-handed.|$|R
2500|$|An {{ability to}} pick out subliminally {{depicted}} labia from advertisements and elsewhere, whether actual or imagined, was exploited in a recurring magazine article in which René, dubbing himself [...] "Nature's Ambassador", would point out occurrences of [...] "the sacred image" [...] <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from,</b> as per one entry, sculptural elements found decorating New York's Central Park.|$|E
2500|$|The scene {{opens in}} Venice with 24 farm girls declaring their passionate {{love for a}} pair of gondoliers, Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri. [...] These two gondoliers are so gallant and {{peerless}} in their manly beauty that the maidens are waiting for them to select brides before they can consider other suitors. [...] A large group of merry gondoliers enter, saying that they adore the girls, but the ladies explain that the two brothers must choose first. [...] When the Palmieri brothers enter, the ladies present them with flowers. [...] The two gondoliers amiably offer to pick their brides in a game of blind man's buff. [...] They appear to be cheating by <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under their blindfolds, however. [...] Eventually, from the crowd of maidens, Giuseppe picks Tessa, and Marco picks Gianetta [...] "Just the very girl I wanted!" [...] (although the two then politely offer to switch girls). [...] All leave to go to church for the double wedding.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creature}} {{inside the}} mechanical casing {{is soft and}} repulsive in appearance and vicious in temperament. The first-ever glimpse of a Dalek mutant, in The Daleks, was a claw <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under a Thal cloak after it {{had been removed from}} its casing. The mutants' actual appearance has varied, but often adheres to the Doctor's description of the species in Remembrance of the Daleks as [...] "little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour". In Resurrection of the Daleks a Dalek creature, separated from its casing, attacks and severely injures a human soldier; in Remembrance of the Daleks, there are two Dalek factions (Imperial and Renegade) and the creatures inside have a different appearance in each case, one resembling the amorphous creature from Resurrection, the other the crab-like creature from the original Dalek serial. As the creature inside is rarely seen on screen, a common misconception exists that Daleks are wholly mechanical robots. In the new series Daleks are retconned to be mollusc-like in appearance, with small tentacles, one or two eyes, and an exposed brain.|$|E

A tranquil atmosphere permeates the garden, {{and there are a number}} of amusing stone statues that <b>peek</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the moss. Along with the rest of the temple, the garden is particularly impressive during the autumn colors, which usually take place in mid November, about a week earlier than in central Kyoto.|$|R
2500|$|Many of Winnicott's {{writings}} {{show his}} efforts to understand what helps {{people to be able}} to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully <b>peeking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E

5000|$|St Catherine {{was highly}} venerated in the Middle Ages, second only in {{popularity}} to the Magdelen.

More than one million Iranians (mostly women) were arrested in a 12-month period (May 2007 May 2008) for violating the state dress code, according to a May 2008 NBC Today Show report by Matt Lauer.|$|R

From “Ophelia”’s awkward keyboard switches to the expansive, syncopated refrain of “Little Ghost”, this section of the disc feels like a nostalgic, triumphant encore. It’s not the last one this band will have demanded of them." ...|$|R
