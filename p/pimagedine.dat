5000|$|In November 1998, Alteon {{announced}} that its Phase III trial for <b>pimagedine</b> {{as a treatment}} for end stage renal disease had failed to prove efficacy, which led Carl Gordon, a leading biotech analyst, to say: [...] "It looks like <b>pimagedine</b> is probably finished." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Pimagedine,</b> {{also known}} as aminoguanidine, is an investigational drug for the {{treatment}} of diabetic nephropathy that is no longer under development as a drug. <b>Pimagedine</b> is a diamine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. It acts to reduce levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) through interacting with 3-deoxyglucosone.|$|E
50|$|In February, 1999, Genentech {{ended its}} {{collaboration}} with Alteon to develop <b>pimagedine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alteon's 2000, 2001, 2002 {{annual reports}} {{indicated}} {{that it was not}} running any clinical trials on <b>pimagedine</b> but was seeking co-development partners. Alteon's 2003 and subsequent annual reports did not mention that Alteon was seeking partners for pimagenine, which indicated that efforts to interest other companies and investors had failed and which signaled that commercial efforts to develop <b>pimagedine</b> as a drug were indeed finished.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Alteon and Marion Merrell Dow Inc (MMD) {{entered into}} a joint {{development}} program for <b>pimagedine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Alteon {{licensed}} {{a patent}} from Rockefeller University {{relating to the}} use of <b>pimagedine</b> to inhibit AGE formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pimagedine</b> {{was under}} {{development}} as a drug for kidney diseases by the pharmaceutical company Alteon (now known Synvista Therapeutics Inc.) that was founded in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|Compounds {{that have}} been found to inhibit AGE {{formation}} in the laboratory include Vitamin C, benfotiamine, pyridoxamine, alpha-lipoic acid, [...] taurine, <b>pimagedine,</b> aspirin, carnosine, metformin, pioglitazone, and pentoxifylline.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, Alteon and Genentech {{announced}} a collaboration agreement under which Genentech would fund development of <b>pimagedine</b> {{and would have}} the rights to sell the drug {{if it would be}} approved.|$|E
50|$|In April 1999 Alteon {{announced}} that it would cease development of <b>pimagedine</b> as a treatment for end stage renal disease but might consider continuing development in type 1 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy or progressive kidney disease.|$|E
50|$|In March 1998, Alteon {{announced}} {{that it had been}} advised that it should discontinue its Phase III trial of <b>pimagedine</b> in non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes patients with overt nephropathy, after the trial's external safety monitoring committee found an increased risk of side effects in the treatment group.|$|E
5000|$|Work {{that he did}} {{while he}} was at Rockefeller on {{advanced}} glycation end-products (AGEs) and protein cross-linking and their roles in metabolic diseases and aging was patented by Rockfeller and licensed to Alteon Inc. in 1987 and in 1992 the company licensed further work that Cerami did on the use of <b>pimagedine</b> to reduce AGEs.|$|E
