5|$|By 1908, <b>Piemonte</b> {{had been}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, <b>Piemonte</b> participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, {{and the fact that}} the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna. The Maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. <b>Piemonte</b> then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.|$|E
5|$|<b>Piemonte</b> was {{a unique}} {{protected}} cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1880s by the British shipyard Armstrong Whitworth. She {{was the first major}} warship armed entirely with quick-firing (QF) guns and she was also the fastest cruiser in the world upon her completion in 1889. <b>Piemonte</b> was frequently deployed overseas, including a lengthy tour in East Asian waters from 1901 to 1904. She saw significant action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112 in the Red Sea, where she frequently bombarded Ottoman ports. During the Battle of Kunfuda Bay in January 1912, she and two destroyers sank four Ottoman gunboats and forced ashore three more. <b>Piemonte</b> participated in World War I but she saw little action during the conflict. She remained in service until 1920, when she was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} an eventful career. She was briefly {{assigned}} to the main fleet, but by the early 1890s, she was serving abroad in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. In 1896 she was sent to Brazil to protect Italian nationals in the country after unrest in the country targeted Europeans. By 1901, <b>Piemonte</b> was {{assigned to the}} East Asia Station. By the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, the ship was again stationed in the Red Sea. She led a pair of destroyers in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay, where she sank or destroyed seven Ottoman gunboats, destroying Ottoman naval strength in the area. For the rest of the war, she blockaded and bombarded Ottoman ports. During World War I, she {{was assigned to the}} Second Fleet, based in Brindisi, but she did not see action. <b>Piemonte</b> was sold for scrap in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Circuito de Getxo, the Châteauroux Classic, Vattenfall Cyclassics, the GP Ouest-France, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, Paris–Tours, the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> and the Giro di Lombardia, but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 15th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|Astana raced a light {{schedule}} in the fall, with {{the pinnacle of}} their season having come at the Tour de France. The team sent squads to the Clásica de San Sebastián, Vattenfall Cyclassics, the GP Ouest-France, the Giro dell'Emilia, the GP Beghelli, the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> and the Giro di Lombardia. Their best results from this crop of races came from Alexander Vinokourov, who finished seventh in Lombardy and fifth in the Giro dell'Emilia.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Tour du Doubs, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, Paris–Brussels, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, the Grand Prix de Wallonie, the Grand Prix d'Isbergues, Binche–Tournai–Binche, Paris–Bourges, Paris–Tours, the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> the Giro di Lombardia, and the Japan Cup, but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 11th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Italo-Turkish War in September 1911, <b>Piemonte</b> was stationed in the Red Sea with four other cruisers. In December, she and the other cruisers patrolled the Ottoman ports in the Red Sea for ships that might be preparing to carry a rumored invasion force across the narrow sea to Italian Eritrea. Hostilities were temporarily ceased while the British King George V passed through the Red Sea following his coronation ceremony in Indiathe ceasefire lasted until 26 November.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} had good showings from Nocentini at the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal (ninth place), Mondory at the Grand Prix de la Somme (second place), Montaguti at the Gran Premio Industria e Commercio di Prato (third place), Bouet at the Tour de Vendée (third place), and Roche at the Giro del <b>Piemonte</b> (fifth place). Roche also took the team's best placing at the fall monument, the Giro di Lombardia, {{but was a}} {{relatively}} distant 16th on the day.|$|E
5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert <b>Piemonte</b> into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, tall enough to clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina {{were not interested in}} operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt to lighten the ship.|$|E
5|$|In September 1794 the Sardinians and Austrians {{advanced}} to Carcare, {{threatening to cut}} the French link to Genoa, where supplies were obtained. Advised by his artillery chief Napoleon Bonaparte, Dumerbion struck back on 15 September. While Sérurier feinted at Vinadio {{on the left and}} Macquard feinted at Limone <b>Piemonte</b> in the center, Masséna mounted the main thrust on the right. In the First Battle of Dego on 21 September, 18,000 French troops beat Olivier, Count of Wallis and 8,000 Austro-Sardinians. Though the allies escaped encirclement, the French later seized the port of Vado Ligure. Dumerbion and Garnier both recommended Sérurier's promotion and he was nominated general of division on 22 December 1794. Given command of the right flank division in place of Masséna who was sick, his brigadiers were Barthélemy Catherine Joubert and Sextius Alexandre François de Miollis.|$|E
5|$|The team {{entered the}} Clásica de San Sebastián in August, with Contador in 26th their highest-placed finisher. Contador, like many riders in the event, rode it as {{preparation}} for the road cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games. Astana also took part in Vattenfall Cyclassics, the Coppa Sabatini, Paris–Bourges, the Giro dell'Emilia, the Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli, Milano–Torino, and the Giro del <b>Piemonte</b> in September and October, but did not obtain a place higher than 11th (by Janez Brajkovič in the Giro dell'Emilia). In August, Leipheimer and Contador took the top two spots in the Clásica a los Puertos de Guadarrama, a race they rode as {{preparation for the}} Vuelta a España.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{neutralization}} of Ottoman {{naval forces}} in the region, Aretusa {{and the rest of}} the Italian ships then commenced a bombardment campaign against the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a blockade of the city of Al Hudaydah on 26 January. On 27 July and 12 August, Aretusa, her sister ship Caprera, and <b>Piemonte</b> conducted two bombardments of Al Hudaydah. During the second attack, they destroyed an Ottoman ammunition dump. With the threat of an Ottoman attack greatly reduced, the High Command thereafter began to withdraw forces from the Red Sea Squadron. By the end of August, the unit was reduced to three protected cruisers, Aretusa, Caprera and two auxiliaries. On 14 October, the Ottoman government agreed to sign a peace treaty, ending the war. Aretusas career ended shortly thereafter; the Regia Marina discarded the ship in December and she was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Piemonte</b> wine {{region is}} divided into five broad zones.|$|E
25|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Clásica de San Sebastián, Tre Valli Varesine, Druivenkoers Overijse, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, the Giro dell'Emilia, the GP Bruno Beghelli, Paris–Tours, and the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 11th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
25|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia, the Clásica de San Sebastián, Circuito de Getxo, Trofeo Matteotti, Tre Valli Varesine, the Coppa Bernocchi, the Grand Prix de Fourmies, the Giro dell'Emilia, the Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli, the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> the Giro di Lombardia and the Chrono des Nations, but placed {{no higher than}} 11th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
25|$|Giulia Marletta was a {{promoter}} {{and board}} member of Film Investimenti <b>Piemonte</b> S.r.l. (FIP), a multinational mixed capital investment company established in Turin, Italy for the financing and production of international films. US-based funding for the company was provided through Endgame Entertainment. Giulia Marletta’s company Marletta Films, based in Los Angeles, currently develops, produces and funds international projects for film and television.|$|E
25|$|In January 1912, the Italian cruiser <b>Piemonte,</b> {{with the}} Soldato class destroyers Artigliere and Garibaldino, sank seven Turkish gunboats (Ayintab, Bafra, Gökcedag, Kastamonu, Muha, Ordu and Refahiye) and a yacht (Sipka) in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay. Successively the Italians {{blockaded}} the Red Sea ports of the Ottomans, while actively supplying {{and supporting the}} Emirate of Asir which was also concurrently {{at war with the}} Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2007, Marletta {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} creating the first mixed capital fund in Italy for the financing and production of international films. Endgame Entertainment provided US based funding for the project that {{was established in the}} Piedmont region of Italy. In 2008, the project took form as Film Investimenti <b>Piemonte</b> S.r.l. (FIP), with Marletta having served as an Executive Board Member until January, 2010.|$|E
25|$|The French seized Saorgio on 28 April after Colli withdrew. He {{abandoned}} the Col de Tende and retreated to Limone <b>Piemonte,</b> {{just north of}} the pass. In early May, Colli fell back to Borgo San Dalmazzo near the fortress of Cuneo. On the coast, the French advanced to seize Albenga and Loano. General of Division François Macquard occupied the Col de Tende, while farther east Masséna deployed his troops to hold the ridges between Ormea and Loano. In the fighting near Saorge, historian Digby Smith stated French losses as 1,500 killed and wounded, while the allied casualties numbered 2,800. Losses for the other battles are not given.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 1944 the 3rd Alpini Regiment was recreated in Southern Italy {{with the}} battalions <b>Piemonte</b> and Monte Granero. Along with the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment it formed the 1st Italian Brigade of the Italian Liberation Corps, which {{fought in the}} war on the Allied side. After the Bersaglieri {{regiment}} had suffered heavy casualties the two regiments were merged on 30 September 1944 to form the Special Infantry Regiment, which entered the Legnano Combat Group. The Combat Group was equipped with British weapons and materiel and fought as part of the Polish II Corps on the extreme left of the British 8th Army near the river Idice.|$|E
25|$|The team {{then decided}} against sending Cavendish {{to the fall}} monument, the Giro di Lombardia. Its profile, even hillier than the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> meant it was {{unlikely}} that Cavendish would finish that race either. Sporting director Valerio Piva explained that having Cavendish start that race only to pull out after riding for an hour would be disrespectful to Cavendish, the rainbow jersey, and the race itself. The squad therefore sent only six riders to the race instead of the customary nine, and Sivtsov in 43rd place was the only classified finisher. The next day, Martin took the team's final victory in their history at the Chrono des Nations single-day time trial. It was perhaps the most dominant victory of Martin's career, with no rider coming inside two minutes of his winning time. Coincidentally, Amber Neben of the women's HTC-Highroad team also took victory at this event, closing the team's history with double success.|$|E
25|$|The team's fall {{performances}} were perhaps subdued {{by the news}} of their impending collapse being confirmed in early August. It was not until October, at Paris–Bourges that the team came relatively close to another victory. Degenkolb took fourth place in a hectic {{that resulted in the}} peloton being split into several groups. The team had a bittersweet joy later that same week at Paris–Tours, as it was there that Cavendish debuted his newly won world championship rainbow jersey, {{in one of the few}} occasions he would wear it as a member of this team. With a late attack by 's Greg Van Avermaet keeping the expected bunch finish from happening, the team's best-placed man on the day was Degenkolb in 11th; Cavendish was 42nd, coming in towards the back of the first large group on the road. Cavendish also rode in the rainbow jersey at the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> but did not complete the race. The team's best-placed rider that day was trainee rider Zakkari Dempster, well down in 65th position.|$|E
25|$|The French lost 3,400 {{killed and}} wounded plus 4,200 men and five guns captured. The Austrians {{sustained}} losses of 2,150 killed and wounded and 250 captured. Wishing to besiege Cuneo, Melas moved against the nearby French forces. On 10 November Ott drove Richepanse from Borgo San Dalmazzo back to Limone <b>Piemonte.</b> Melas ordered Liechtenstein and Mittrowski to attack Mondovì. On 13 November 1799, 14,000 Austrians attacked Championnet's 9,000 at Mondovì. Casualties were about even at about 500 on each side. Championnet pulled his troops back to Ormea and Garessio {{and set up}} his headquarters at Finale Ligure on the coast. On 15 November, the Austrians drove the French from Limone and over the Col de Tende. Having cleared the French from Piedmont, Melas directed Liechtenstein to lay siege to Cuneo on the 18th. The city was {{cut off from the}} waters of the Stura on 21 November and trenches were begun {{on the night of the}} 26th. On 2 December, the Austrian guns opened their bombardment, breaching the defenses and burning down many houses. On 3 December the garrison commander Clément surrendered the surviving 3,000 troops, 187 cannons and 14,000 cwt of gunpowder.|$|E
500|$|In late 1901, <b>Piemonte</b> was {{assigned}} to the East Asian station after a year-long modernization. She passed through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea and stopped to coal in British Aden while en route to Asian waters. In September 1902 she was in Nagasaki, Japan, with the Italian cruiser [...] <b>Piemonte</b> met the British cruiser [...] in the British colony at Weihaiwei. A party of officers and men from <b>Piemonte</b> visited the British ship on 28 July. That year, she was joined by the armored cruiser [...] and the protected cruiser [...] The following year, the armored cruiser [...] and the protected cruiser [...] were scheduled to replace Vettor Pisani and <b>Piemonte,</b> respectively, but due to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War on 8 February 1904, <b>Piemonte</b> remained in the region. On 24 February, <b>Piemonte</b> arrived in Seoul and landed a contingent of infantry to augment the guards at the Italian embassy. <b>Piemonte</b> was finally recalled to Italy in April; she stopped in Singapore on 22 April to coal, departing two days later for home.|$|E
500|$|<b>Piemonte</b> and {{the rest}} of the Italian ships {{returned}} to bombarding the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a blockade of the city of Al Hudaydah on 26 January. <b>Piemonte</b> accidentally damaged the railroad that was being built by a French company when she bombarded the port of Djebana. As a result, the French firm sued the Italian government for the sum of 200,000lire. By April, <b>Piemonte</b> was serving as the flagship of the Italian squadron in the Red Sea. On 27 July and 12 August, <b>Piemonte,</b> the torpedo cruisers [...] and [...] conducted two bombardments of Al Hudaydah. During the 12 August attack, they destroyed an Ottoman ammunition dump. <b>Piemonte</b> thereafter left the Red Sea with four destroyers. The Ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in October, ending the war.|$|E
500|$|With the team's {{merger with}} Team RadioShack already announced, the {{traditional}} season-closing weekend in Italy at the Giro del <b>Piemonte</b> and the Giro di Lombardia effectively figured to comprise the team's final races under this guise. At the Giro del <b>Piemonte,</b> Bennati made {{each of the}} day's selections, first a 31-rider group that formed at the [...] to go mark and then a 14-rider break in the race's final kilometer. He could manage only seventh in the uphill final sprint, however.|$|E
500|$|<b>Piemonte</b> was [...] between perpendiculars, with {{a beam of}} [...] She had a mean {{draft of}} [...] and {{displaced}} [...] The ship had a crew of 12 officers and 245 enlisted crew. <b>Piemonte</b> was fitted with two heavy military masts and had a partial double bottom.

Her intended armament consisted of two [...] and four [...] guns, all breech-loading weapons, but the Italians insisted that she be equipped with six 6-inch QF guns. The changes to the magazines {{and the addition of}} large sponsons to accommodate the QF guns significantly delayed her completion. <b>Piemonte</b> was the first major warship to be armed with medium-caliber, quick-firing guns; these weapons would become the standard armament for cruisers in the 1890s.|$|E
500|$|<b>Piemonte</b> {{was built}} by the British {{shipyard}} Armstrong Whitworth in Elswick. Her keel was laid down in 1887 and she was launched on 23 August 1888. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was completed on 8 September 1889 and delivered to the Regia Marina. In 1890, <b>Piemonte</b> participated in the annual fleet maneuvers in the First Squadron, along with the ironclad , Dogali, and several torpedo boats. The exercises were conducted in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where the First Squadron was tasked with defending against an attacking [...] "hostile" [...] squadron. By 1891, the Italian Navy had determined that Piemontes armament was too heavy, and so the four broadside 6-inch guns were replaced with lighter 4.7-inch guns and their sponsons removed. In addition, the heavy military masts were replaced by light pole masts. In the following years, the ship served in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean {{in addition to the}} Mediterranean. In mid-1896, violence against Italians in Brazil prompted the Italian government to dispatch <b>Piemonte</b> on a mission to secure the interests of Italian nationals in the country. The attempt at gunboat diplomacy secured an official apology from the Brazilian government, as well as an arrangement to adjudicate Italian claims of damages by the United States' and German ambassadors.|$|E
500|$|When Italy entered World War I on 23 May 1915, <b>Piemonte</b> {{was based}} in Brindisi and was {{assigned}} to the Second Fleet, which included the [...] and [...] pre-dreadnought battleships and the [...] and [...] armored cruisers. The primary naval opponent {{for the duration of the}} war was the Austro-Hungarian Navy; the Naval Chief of Staff, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, planned a distant blockade with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats conducted raids. The heavy ships of the Italian fleet would be preserved for a potential major battle in the Austro-Hungarian fleet should emerge from its bases. As a result, the ship's activities during the war was limited and she spent much of it based at Salonica, Greece as part of the Anglo-French Levant Squadron. Plans to use her for torpedo trials after the war came to nothing and <b>Piemonte</b> was stricken from the Navy List on 15 May 1920 and broken up shortly afterwards.|$|E

500|$|<b>Piemonte,</b> {{designed}} by Philip Watts at Armstrong Whitworth, {{was based on}} the preceding Dogali. Originally intended to carry a pair of [...] guns and four [...] guns, the Italian Navy instead requested a uniform battery of six 6-inch guns. She proved to be a revolutionary vessel, as she was the first major warship to be armed entirely with quick-firing, medium-caliber guns; these became the standard for all cruisers from the 1890s onward.|$|E
500|$|Il Lombardia {{was also}} {{the last of a}} series of Italian classics. The most {{important}} of these came in two groups of three. The first three races formed the Trittico Lombardo: these were the Coppa Ugo Agostoni, the Coppa Bernocchi and the Tre Valli Varesine. Vincenzo Nibali (...) came second to Davide Rebellin (...) in the Coppa Ugo Agostoni, then won the remaining two races. The second group was the Trittico di Autunno: these were the Milano–Torino, the Gran <b>Piemonte</b> and Il Lombardia itself, which {{was the only one of}} the races to be part of the World Tour. Diego Rosa, Nibali's teammate, won the Milano–Torino.|$|E
500|$|In early 1912, the Italian Red Sea Fleet {{searched for}} a group of seven Ottoman gunboats thought to be {{planning}} an attack on Eritrea, though they were in fact immobilized {{due to a lack of}} coal. <b>Piemonte</b> and the destroyers [...] and [...] searched for the gunboats while the cruisers [...] and Puglia carried out diversionary bombardments against Jebl Tahr, and Al Luḩayyah. On 7 January, they found the gunboats and quickly sank four in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay; the other three were forced to beach to avoid sinking as well. The next day, the Italian warships sent a shore party to destroy the grounded gunboats.|$|E
500|$|<b>Piemonte</b> {{was armed}} with a main battery of six 6-inch L/40 guns in single mounts. One gun was placed forward and one aft, with two on each {{broadside}} abreast of the masts.
