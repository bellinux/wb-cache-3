50|$|If the {{metabolism}} of <b>proxicromil</b> in a rat is inhibited with SKF-525A, {{the plasma}} clearance of <b>proxicromil</b> is lowered (0.6 ml min-1 kg-1) , {{which increases the}} amount of unchanged drug cleared by biliary excretion.|$|E
50|$|After giving nursing rat mothers <b>proxicromil,</b> {{the drug}} and its {{metabolites}} gets also excrete in the milk of these rats. At a maternal dose level of 20 mg/kg, an amount 1-2% was present in the milk. From which 63% was <b>proxicromil</b> and 37% the hydroxylated metabolites.|$|E
50|$|Treatment with <b>Proxicromil</b> {{reverses the}} tumor {{enhancement}} in immunosuppressed animals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proxicromil</b> {{is found}} to be hepatotoxic in dogs but not in rats, which is a result from the {{different}} metabolisms. This comes through the route of excretion which <b>Proxicromil</b> undergoes and which leads to a high concentrations at the biliary canaliculus and thus its accumulation and a consequent increase in hepatic exposure.|$|E
50|$|For {{asthma and}} exercise-induced bronchospasm, <b>Proxicromil</b> {{was found to}} be mildly effective. But the {{investigation}} was discontinued when malignancies occurred in long-term animal studies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proxicromil</b> has a {{strongly}} acidic chromone skeleton. The 5-hydroxy group increases the activity and, {{along with the}} 10-alkyl group, causes an increase in lipophilicity of the compound. The relatively high lipophilicity of the molecule allows it to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is postulated that the absorption may take place via ion-pair formation. Due to these properties <b>proxicromil</b> operates efficiently as a mast cell stabilizer, preventing the release of histamine. This causes the compound to have anti-allergic properties.|$|E

50|$|<b>Proxicromil</b> is a mast-cell {{stabilizer}} {{that prevents}} degranulation and release of {{mediators such as}} histamine from mast cells. In normal animals, the drug has no effect.|$|E
50|$|In {{preventing}} {{in vitro}} antigen-induced pulmonary anaphylaxis, <b>Proxicromil</b> {{was found to}} be twenty times less potent than Cl-922, another anti-allergy compound. The same result were found in an animal model with rats.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{inhibiting}} {{effect of}} <b>Proxicromil</b> on the high-affinity FcεRI disables bonding to the IgE antigen {{and that way}} blocks the release of mediators such as histamine that would normally give an allergic response.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proxicromil</b> {{acts as an}} {{inhibitor}} of this process, {{competing with}} IgE antibodies for binding with the FcεRI receptors, thereby reducing the irritation caused by histamines. The substance was found to reduce allergic reactions and the severity of clinical diseases when administered just before the onset.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proxicromil</b> {{is tested}} {{through a variety}} of {{independent}} studies for its beneficial effect as an anti-allergen, its efficacy against migraine, asthma and tumor enhancement. It shows no effect as a prophylactic against migraine. The reported side effects during this study related mainly to transient gastrointestinal troubles and were generally of a mild nature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proxicromil</b> is a detergent-like, {{lipophilic}} oral medication {{developed in}} late 1970s {{that was not}} admitted on the market because of its possible carcinogenic effects. It supresses allergic reactions by binding to FcεRI receptor in mast cells, thereby inhibiting production of histamines. It is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and is proven hepatotoxic for dogs {{as a result of}} its accumulation in the biliary canaliculus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proxicromil</b> was {{developed}} in the late 1970s as an oral analogue and a successor of anti-allergy drug Intal, whose patent protection period was to expire in 1982. Disodium cromoglycate {{in the form of an}} inhaler licensed as Intal (derived from ‘interfere with allergy’) had become the Fisons company's leading product, generating immense income and stimulating further research; thus several attempts at developing a congener were undertaken. Nevertheless, because of its possible carcinogenic properties, Fisons decided to withdraw the drug in 1981, just before it was to be marketed.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth rate}} of Cloudman S 91 {{melanoma}} cells was compared in groups of normal and immunologically compromised DBA/ 2 mice that had undergone thymectomy and treatment with antilymphocyte serum. Tumor growth was markedly accelerated in the immunosuppressed animals. Other groups of normal and immunosuppressed animals were treated with daily injections of either histamine, the H- 2 antihistamine cimetidine, the H 1 antihistamine pyrilamine; or the mast cell stabilizer <b>proxicromil.</b> Histamine treatment accelerated tumor growth, but only in normal animals and {{had little effect on}} tumor growth in immunocompromised hosts. Cimetidine treatment tended to increase tumor growth in normal hosts but this was statistically significant in only 1 of 3 experiments. In contrast, treatment with cimetidine, pyrilamine, or <b>proxicromil</b> always resulted in significant retardation of tumor growth in immunosuppressed animals. These data are consistent with the notion that thymectomy and treatment with antilymphocyte serum results in enhanced tumor growth that is in part due to activation of histamine-dependent suppressor cells. In this system, histamine activation of suppressor cells may be reversed by treatment with either antihistamines or <b>proxicromil,</b> a drug that prevents mast cell release of histamine. However, since the effects of these drugs seem to depend on the immune status of the host, thorough evaluation of immunoregulatory function and careful testing to determine whether histamine blockers reduce or promote tumor growth would seem indicated when immunomodulatory treatment with these drugs is contemplated...|$|E
40|$|Murine delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} (DTH) {{reactions and}} the localization of 51 chromium-labelled leucocytes into DTH sites, {{as well as}} into lymph nodes, can be markedly inhibited by drugs that deplete vasoactive amines (VAA; reserpine); antagonize VAA action (methysergide, cyproheptadine), or block the release of VAA from mast cells (<b>Proxicromil).</b> These drug treatments have much less of {{an effect on the}} cells that localize in tissues that are not separated from the blood by venule endothelium such as spleen, liver and the bone marrow. These results suggest that localization of many blood borne leucocytes in tissues that are separated from the blood by venule endothelium requires VAA to induce the formation of 'gaps' between the endothelial cells in order for the leucocytes to make an exit from the blood. Thus DTH may be considered, at least in part, as a tissue equivalent of a lymph node 'trap', with the difference being the type of recruited or 'trapped' cell type; inflammatory leucocytes in DTH responses and lymphocytes in lymph nodes...|$|E
