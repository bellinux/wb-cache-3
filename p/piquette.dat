25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{entrepreneurs}} in the Detroit area—notably Henry Ford—forged into production of the automobile, capitalizing on the already-existing machine tool and coach-building industry in the city. Early automotive production is recognizable by structures such as the Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant (1904) (a National Historic Landmark), and multiple structures in the surrounding <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Industrial Historic District (including the now-destroyed E-M-F/Studebaker Plant, 1906) and the New Amsterdam Historic District (including the original Cadillac factory, 1905) and small factories such as the Crescent Brass and Pin Company Building (1905).|$|E
25|$|The primary {{location}} of commercial buildings is along the Woodward and Cass corridors. Although the commercial activity is reduced {{from what it}} was in the heyday of the area, it still continues, particularly in service of students at Wayne State. Farther north in the area are sites which were originally primarily industrial, now grouped in the New Amsterdam Historic District and the <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Industrial Historic District.|$|E
50|$|A common way {{to produce}} such <b>piquettes</b> was to mix raisins with water. The raisins used were {{imported}} to France from Mediterranean countries, and were produced from grape varieties not directly suitable for wine production.|$|R
25|$|The Detroit Automobile Company was reorganized {{into the}} Henry Ford Company on November 20, 1901, after Ford gained further backing from investors {{because of his}} racing success. It later became the Cadillac Company under the {{ownership}} of Henry Leland, who came in subsequently after Ford had left. The factory location for the Detroit Automobile Company {{is less than a}} mile away southeast from Mr. Ford's <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant, which opened four years later.|$|E
25|$|Major {{railroad}} infrastructure, {{known as}} the Milwaukee Junction, {{was built in the}} 1890s to facilitate industrial expansion in the city of Detroit. To take advantage of the rail line, industrial plants were built in this area on both sides of Woodward Avenue, with the automotive industry prominently involved. Part of this area east of Woodward is now the <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Industrial Historic District, while the area west of Woodward and south of the railroad tracks is the New Amsterdam Historic District. Some commercial buildings were also built in this area, particularly along Cass.|$|E
25|$|The {{knowledge}} and skills needed by a factory worker were reduced to 84 areas. When introduced, the T used the building methods typical at the time, assembly by hand, and production was small. The Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant could {{not keep up with}} demand for the Model T, and only 11 cars were built there during the first full month of production. More and more machines were used to reduce the complexity within the 84 defined areas. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new Highland Park complex.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, major {{railroad}} infrastructure {{known as}} the Milwaukee Junction was built just south of Grand Boulevard to facilitate industrial expansion {{in the city of}} Detroit. To take advantage of the rail line, industrial plants were built in this area on both sides of Woodward Avenue, with the automotive industry prominently involved. Part of this area east of Woodward is now the <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Industrial Historic District, while the area west of Woodward and south of the railroad tracks is the New Amsterdam Historic District. Most notably, in 1904, Burroughs Adding Machine Company built a large factory on Third, and the following year Cadillac built an assembly plant just to the east of Burroughs.|$|E
25|$|Many of the area's {{prominent}} {{museums are}} located in the historic cultural center neighborhood around Wayne State University and the College for Creative Studies. These museums include the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Historical Museum, Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the Detroit Science Center, as well as the main branch of the Detroit Public Library. Other cultural highlights include Motown Historical Museum, the Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant museum (birthplace of the Ford Model T and the world's oldest car factory building open to the public), the Pewabic Pottery studio and school, the Tuskegee Airmen Museum, Fort Wayne, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD), the Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit (CAID), and the Belle Isle Conservatory.|$|E
25|$|Henry Ford's {{first attempt}} at a car company under his own name was the Henry Ford Company on November 3, 1901, which became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name. The Ford Motor Company was {{launched}} in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later its factory on <b>Piquette</b> Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups {{of two or three}} men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade, the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era.|$|E
2500|$|The Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant {{is located}} at 461 <b>Piquette,</b> on the {{northwest}} corner of <b>Piquette</b> and Beaubien. It is a three-story mill-style building designed by Field, Hinchman, and Smith for Ford in 1904. [...] The first Model Ts were built in this building. [...] The building was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 17, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Industrial Historic District is a {{historic}} district located along <b>Piquette</b> Street in Detroit, Michigan, from Woodward Avenue on the west to Hastings Street on the east. [...] The district extends approximately one block south of <b>Piquette</b> to Harper, and one block north to the Grand Trunk Western Railroad Line. [...] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|When Studebaker began {{production}} of the two models of the Rockne, the larger [...] "75" [...] was produced in South Bend, beginning December 15, 1931; and the smaller [...] "65" [...] went into production at the old E-M-F plant on <b>Piquette</b> Avenue in Detroit, February 22, 1932. This <b>Piquette</b> Avenue plant was the same plant at which the 1927 and 1928 Erskine models had been built. Rockne's were also produced at Studebaker's Walkerville, Ontario plant.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{railroad}} infrastructure, {{known as}} the Milwaukee Junction, {{was built in the}} 1890s to facilitate industrial expansion in the city of Detroit.

The area west of Woodward and south of the railroad tracks is the New Amsterdam Historic District, while a portion of the area east of Woodward is now the <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Industrial Historic District.|$|E
2500|$|The Autocar Service Building {{is located}} on the {{southwest}} corner of <b>Piquette</b> and Brush. [...] It is currently owned by the City of Detroit Parks and Recreation Department.|$|E
2500|$|The area along <b>Piquette</b> was an {{important}} center for automobile production in the early 20th century. [...] Ford Motor Company, Studebaker, Cadillac, Dodge, and Regal Motor Car had plants in the area, as well as suppliers such as Fisher Body. [...] In 1910, the two largest automobile producers in the world, Studebaker and Ford, were located next door {{to each other on}} <b>Piquette.</b> [...] Although the area is largely empty and derelict now, as recently as the 1950s there were 50,000 workers employed in plants in the district.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{was used in}} part for warehousing after that, as well as home the <b>Piquette</b> Market, a meat wholesaler. [...] In June 2005, the plant was completely destroyed in a fire. [...] As of 2008, a shelter for homeless veterans was planned for the site.|$|E
2500|$|Plant 3 at Detroit made {{complete}} chassis for Special and Big Six models in over [...] of floor space. Plant 5 was the service parts store and shipping facility, plus the executive offices of various technical departments. The Detroit facilities {{were moved to}} South Bend in 1926, except that the <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant (Plant 10) was retained for assembly of the Erskine between 1927 and 1929 and the Rockne (1931-1933).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the day's hearing, Judge Richardson fined Moore $100 {{and court}} costs. [...] Moore said he would appeal the ruling and told his disciples at the Chicago Avenue police station that he would hold {{services}} as usual that evening. [...] City Attorney, Louis P. <b>Piquette,</b> threatened to close all meetings at Moore's temple. [...] That evening, 50 of Moore's followers gathered at his temple, where they conducted ceremonies [...] "as usual, without molestation" [...] from the police or City Attorney.|$|E
2500|$|Studebaker's president, Fred Fish, had {{purchased}} {{one-third of the}} E-M-F stock in 1908 and followed up by acquiring all the remainder from J. P. Morgan in 1910 and buying E-M-F's manufacturing plants at Walkerville, Ontario, Canada, and across the river in Detroit. [...] The former Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant, located across Brush Street from the old E-M-F plant in the Milwaukee Junction area of Detroit, was purchased from Ford in January 1911 to become Studebaker Plant 10, used for assembly work until 1933.|$|E
2500|$|The Studebaker Plant {{was located}} {{on the north side}} of <b>Piquette,</b> between Brush and John R. [...] The {{building}} first housed Wayne Automotive in 1906. [...] In 1908, Wayne merged with Northern Motor Car to form the [...] E-M-F Company. [...] The owners of E-M-F formed a manufacturing and distribution partnership with Studebaker, and eventually Studebaker took control of E-M-F (and the plant) in 1910. [...] Studebaker continued to manufacture automobiles in the plant until 1925. [...] After Studebaker left the plant, Chrysler used it until the mid-1960s as a parts facility.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{automobiles}} {{had already}} existed for decades, {{they were still}} mostly scarce and expensive at the Model T's introduction in 1908. Positioned as reliable, easily maintained, mass-market transportation, it was a runaway success. [...] In {{a matter of days}} after the release, 15,000 orders were placed. The first production Model T was produced on August 12, 1908 and left the factory on September27, 1908, at the Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant in Detroit, Michigan. On May26, 1927, Henry Ford watched the 15millionth Model T Ford roll off the assembly line at his factory in Highland Park, Michigan.|$|E
2500|$|The University-Cultural Center is {{a section}} of Detroit bounded by the Chrysler Freeway (I-75) on the east, the Lodge Freeway (M-10) on the west, the Grand Trunk Railroad tracks on the north, and Selden Street, Parsons Street, East Willis Street, and East Warren Avenue on the south. This {{particular}} appellation has fallen out of use, replaced by [...] "Midtown", which extends the southern University-Cultural Center noundary to the Fisher Freeway (I-75), and contracts the northern boundary to the Edsel Ford Freeway (I-94). All the structures in this MRA are located within Midtown. The section of the University-Cultural Center not included in Midtown is primarily industrial in nature (unlike the residential and commercial buildings in this MRA), and contains the New Amsterdam Historic District and the <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Industrial Historic District.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the use of}} {{the basket}} press became more popular, wineries and wine writers started to make a {{distinction}} between the quality of wine that came from different levels of pressing. The highest quality was the vin de goutte or the [...] "free run" [...] juice that was released by the mere weight of the grapes squeezing each other as they were loaded into the press. This was usually the lightest in colour and body and was often kept separate from the vin de presse that came from pressing which was darker and had more tannins. In 1600, French wine writer Olivier de Serres noted in his work Théâtre d'Agriculture that it was a tradition associated only with the wines of Anjou in the Loire Valley to blend in the vin de goutte with the vin de presse. Much like the ancient Roman pressed wine lorca, Middle Age peasants often drank <b>piquette</b> from the left over grape skins after pressing.|$|E
2500|$|Besides its casino resort hotels, the region's leading {{attraction}} is The Henry Ford, America's largest indoor-outdoor museum complex, a National Historic Landmark museum entertainment complex with an IMAX theater {{next to the}} Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn. The Detroit Institute of Arts in the cultural center downtown is another leading attraction and national historic site. [...] The Detroit Festival of the Arts in Midtown draws about 350,000 people. The Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak has an Arctic Ring of Wildlife exhibit with an underwater viewing tunnel that includes the largest polar bear exhibit in the U.S. Together, The Henry Ford, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and the Zoo attract about 2,500,000 visitors annually. [...] Detroit {{is also home to}} the Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant. [...] Built in 1904 and now running as a museum, it is the oldest car factory building in the world open to the public and was the birthplace of the Ford Model T.|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{created a}} huge {{publicity}} machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads {{about the new}} product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed—several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees Clarence Avery, Peter E. Martin, Charles E. Sorensen, and C. Harold Wills. (See Ford <b>Piquette</b> Avenue Plant) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Fisher Body Plant 21 {{is located}} on the {{southeast}} [...] corner of <b>Piquette</b> and St. Antoine. [...] It was designed in 1921 by Albert Kahn for Fisher Body, who manufactured Buick and Cadillac bodies in the plant until 1925. [...] The plant is six stories tall, with a footprint of [...] by [...] and an interior area of 536,000 square feet. [...] During the Great Depression, Fisher suspended production and the building was used as a soup kitchen and homeless shelter. [...] The plant was used as an engineering design facility from 1930–1956; during World War II, the factory produced P-80 Lockheed Shooting Star Planes, Vought F4U Corsair Shipboard Fighters, and some assemblies for B-25 Mitchell bombers. [...] After 1956, the plant was used to build Cadillac limousine bodies; GM closed the plant in 1984. [...] After GM left, several paint companies used the building; it closed for good in 1994. [...] In 1999, as a result of unpaid property taxes, the building became the property of the City of Detroit and was re-addressed as 6051 Hastings St.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "wine" [...] spanned a broad {{spectrum}} of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. The finest wine was reserved for the upper classes of Rome. Below that was posca, a mixture of water and sour wine that had not yet turned into vinegar. Less acidic than vinegar, it still retained some of the aromas and texture of wine and was the preferred wine for the rations of Roman soldiers due to its low alcohol levels. Poscas use as soldiers' rations was codified in the Corpus Juris Civilis and amounted to around a liter per day. Still lower in quality was lora (modern-day <b>piquette),</b> which was made by soaking in water for a day the pomace of grape skins already pressed twice, and then pressing a third time. Cato and Varro recommended lora for their slaves. Both posca and lora were the most commonly available wine for the general Roman populace and probably would have been for the most part red wines, since white wine grapes would have been reserved for the upper class.|$|E
