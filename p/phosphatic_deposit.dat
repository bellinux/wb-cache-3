40|$|In the Ouled Abdoun {{sedimentary}} basin (Morocco), the phosphatic series {{is composed of}} regular interbedded phosphatic and marly limestone layers. Exploitation of the phosphate in some deposits in this basin collides frequently with problems bound to the existence, in the phosphatic series, of disturbed areas (sterile bodies) qualified as derangements by the mining engineers of the Office Cherifian Phosphate Group (OCP). Their presence in the phosphatic layers causes two kinds of problems: (1) since the whole phosphatic sequence is overlain by a Quaternary cover, {{we do not know}} their volume proportion in the phosphatic layers, and therefore the reserves estimations can be wrong (2) they are generally hard, so they complicate the phosphate extraction. Indeed, in an area containing sterile bodies, boring grid may always be tightened and boreholes filled with dynamite. The required borehole tools and use of explosives are time consuming and therefore increase drastically the cost of phosphate extraction. Their localisation would permit the mining engineers to get around them during the exploitation. &# 13; &# 13; Several geophysical works have carried out in the achieved in Khouribga area to localize and delimit these sterile bodies. Electric resistitivy was established as a suitable geophysical parameter to map them, but the slowness and difficulty of data collection hinders the application of these geophysical methods to the whose phosphatic deposits area (about 25000 ha). Their application in all the Ouled Abdoun basin requires the comprehension of the origin of the sterile bodies, in order to specify their formation process and to predict consequently their spacial distribution in each <b>phosphatic</b> <b>deposit.</b> &# 13; &# 13; Our study concerns to sedimentological and diagenetic analysis of disturbed aereas and their immediate vicinity. It made it possible to identify {{for the first time the}} existence of an evaporitic series intensely karstified at the top of the Senonian, under the phosphatic series. The senonian karsts are undoubtedly at the origin of the derangements, which are defined as the collapsing phenomena at the base of underground cavities. &# 13; &# 13; These bodies have a polyphase structuring and a genesis that is the consequence of on several processes (fracturing, infiltration, dissolution, collapse). Their installation began from the end of Senonian, and continues up to the Quaternary. [fr] Dans le bassin sédimentaire des Ouled Abdoun (Maroc), la série phosphatée est formée d’une intercalation régulière de niveaux phosphatés et marno-calcaires sur environ 50 m de puissance. Localement, cette régularité est perturbée par la présence fréquente de structures communément appelés « dérangements ». Il s’agit de masses non stratifiées, stériles, qui perturbent et alourdissent les travaux d’exploitation des couches phosphatées. Les études géophysiques expérimentales, réalisées dans les zones dérangées de la série phosphatée, ont démontré la possibilité de les cartographier sous couvertures à l’échelle décamétrique. Leur généralisation sur toute la superficie du bassin des Ouled Abdoun, nécessite une compréhension du phénomène à l’origine de ces structures. &# 13; Notre étude concerne l’analyse sédimentologique et diagénétique des zones dérangées et de leur voisinage immédiat. Elle a permis d’identifier pour la première fois l’existence d’une série évaporitique intensément karstifiée au sommet du Sénonien, sous la série phosphatée. Les karsts sénoniens sont incontestablement à l’origine des dérangements ou fontis que l’on défini comme étant des phénomènes de collapses à l’aplomb de cavités souterraines.

40|$|From {{the late}} Oligocene {{to the late}} Miocene, the central Mediterranean area was {{interested}} by an extensive deposition of phosphate-rich sediments. They are usually represented by 10 - 20 cm thick, sub-horizontal hardgrounds, made of phosphatic sediments arranged into thin layers separated by erosion surfaces. Macrofossils are very abundant, their assemblage composed of colonial and solitary corals, molluscs, echinoderms, brachiopods, bryozoans and fish teeth. In the past decades, the Mediterranean <b>phosphatic</b> <b>deposits</b> {{have been the subject}} of several studies, mainly aimed to understand their depositional processes and the mechanisms leading to phosphogenesis. In particular, the formation of these sediments has been recently interpreted as associated to the occurrence of a complex system of upwelling currents, flowing into the central Mediterranean from the deeper, eastern region of the basin. However, most of the contributions mainly relies on stratigraphic, sedimentary and geochemical features, whereas the macrofossil assemblage, despite its abundance and diversity, has never been analyzed in detail. The main goal of this study is thus a thorough investigation, mainly from a palaeontological/palaeoecological perspective, of the <b>phosphatic</b> <b>deposits</b> of the Salento Peninsula (named “Aturia” level). Special attention is given to the coral and mollusc associations, particularly sensitive to changes in the main environmental stressors and representing the most abundant biotic components of the <b>phosphatic</b> <b>deposits.</b> The Salento Aturia level is up to 25 cm in thickness and made of several phosphatic layers separated by erosion surfaces. Microstratigraphic and microfacies analyses allow to identify two distinct facies. A coral rudstone, about 7 - 10 cm thick, constitutes the base of the hardground, while on the top lies a detrital rudstone, made of the succession of thinner layers mainly composed of phosphatic fragments. Most of the macrofossils are concentrated within the coral rudstone and particularly abundant are corals, associated to molluscs and to a lesser amount to brachiopods, echinoderms, bryozoans, serpulids and fish teeth. The coral assemblage is composed at least by 16 taxa belonging to 4 families, represented in order o...|$|R

40|$|The {{paleogeographic}} {{reconstruction of}} the late Neoproterozoic assumes a marked significance {{due to the fact}} that the interactions between the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere during this time strongly influenced the evolution of life and initiated a remarkable phase of organic evolution, well documented in the rocks of this age. Time-related changes in these carbon reservoirs and processes during the late Proterozoic have played an important role in the evolution of the environment and of life (Des Marais, 1997). Brasier (1992) discussed, at length, various factors which pushed the shallow marine ecosystem of the late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian towards P-limitation and suggested that nitrate fixation, density stratification and massive removal of P in the sediments were responsible for the formation of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>deposits</b> within this time interval. The East Gondwana assembly of continents provides fine examples of stratigraphic successions in which the ideas related to oceanic stratification, phosphate deposition, enhanced organic production and carbon isotope fluctuations can be verified and correlated from continent to continent (Banerjee and Majumdar, 1999). 1 The Birmania Basin is an oval-shaped, isolated remnant of the Marwar Basi...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{collapse}} of marine ecosystems during the end-Cretaceous mass extinction involved {{the base of}} the food chain [1] up to ubiquitous vertebrate apex predators [2 – 5]. Large marine reptiles became suddenly extinct at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary, whereas other contemporaneous groups such as bothremydid turtles or dyrosaurid crocodylomorphs, although affected at the familial, genus, or species level, survived into post-crisis environments of the Paleocene [5 – 9] and could have found refuge in freshwater habitats [10 – 12]. A recent hypothesis proposes that the extinction of plesiosaurians and mosasaurids could have been caused by an important drop in sea level [13]. Mosasaurids are unusually diverse and locally abundant in the Maastrichtian <b>phosphatic</b> <b>deposits</b> of Morocco, and with large sharks and one species of elasmosaurid plesiosaurian recognized so far, contribute to an overabundance of apex predators [3, 7, 14, 15]. For this reason, high local diversity of marine reptiles exhibiting different body masses and a wealth of tooth morphologies hints at complex trophic interactions within this latest Cretaceous marine ecosystem. Using calcium isotopes, we investigated the trophic structure of this extinct assemblage. Our results are consistent with a calcium isotope pattern observed in modern marine ecosystems and show that plesiosaurians and mosasaurids indiscriminately fall in the tertiary piscivore group. This suggests that marine reptile apex predators relied onto a single dietary calcium source, compatible with the vulnerable wasp-waist food webs of the modern world [16]. This inferred peculiar ecosystem structure may help explain plesiosaurian and mosasaurid extinction following the end-Cretaceous biological crisis...|$|R
40|$|From the Late Oligocene to the Late Miocene, {{the central}} Mediterranean area was {{characterized}} by the extensive deposition of phosphate-rich sediments. They are usually represented by 10 to 20 -cm-thick hardgrounds made of phosphatic and glauconitic sediments containing a rich macrofossil association. This study represents the first thorough investigation of the biotic assemblage of Mediterranean phosphorites aimed at collecting new information on the environmental factors controlling their deposition. The Serravallian/Tortonian <b>phosphatic</b> <b>deposits</b> of the Salento Peninsula (“Aturia level”) have been selected for the abundance of fossil remains and special attention {{is given to the}} coral–mollusc association. Two different facies have been recognized: a basal coral rudstone that includes most of the macrofossils, superimposed by a detrital rudstone made of thin layers mainly composed of phosphatic fragments. These two facies are separated by a phosphatic crust several millimeters in thickness. The coral assemblage contains at least 17 azooxanthellate taxa belonging to four families, while the molluscs are represented by a rich gastropod fauna (26 species), associated with bivalves (18 species) and cephalopods (two species). Four distinct depositional phases have been recognized, with the coral rudstone representing the key-facies to reconstruct the onset of the “Aturia level” and the original environment of its fossil content. The composition of the coral–mollusc association has been reliably compared with present-day analog taxa, suggesting the occurrence of a heterogeneous seafloor formed by rocky substrates and accumulations of soft sediment, at around 100 – 350 -m water depth, and under the influence of moderate-to-strong bottom currents rich in nutrients and resuspended organic matter...|$|R

40|$|Pelagic Cretaceous sediments, {{deposited}} {{in a range}} of palaeotectonic and palaeogeographic settings, from continents to oceans, are commonly black and bituminous. 3 particular time-envelopes define the major occurrences of such facies: late Barremian-Aptian-Albian, the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary and, to a lesser extent, the Coniacian-Santonian. These intervals define the duration of so-called Oceanic Anoxic Events during which global marine waters were relatively depleted in oxygen, and deposition of organic matter, derived from both terrestrial and planktonic sources, was widespread. Cretaceous OAEs correlate closely with transgressions, and such a correlation exists throughout the stratigraphical column. Flooding of land-masses is thought to have transported much terrestrial plant matterial seawards; the progressive increase in shelf-sea area is thought to have stimulated production of marine plankton. Bacterial consumption of this organic matter favoured the development of poorly oxygenated mid- to late Cretaceous waters in which many of the characteristic facies of the Period, including glauconitic sandstones and <b>phosphatic</b> chalks, were <b>deposited.</b> The full text of this article is not available in ORA, but {{you may be able to}} access the article on the publisher's website ([URL] N.

40|$|In the mid-Cenozoic, New Zealand {{underwent}} slow subsidence {{interspersed with}} unconformity development, however significant controversy exists around both {{the extent of}} submergence below sea level {{during this period of}} maximum drowning, as well as the causes of these unconformities. Detailed field observations, combined with extensive petrographic analyses, stable isotopes, cathodoluminescence, and thin section staining were used to develop lithofacies, depositional, and sequence stratigraphic models of the mid-Cenozoic succession in the Waitaki region, South Island, to address these controversies. Twelve facies types have been described for Late Eocene-Early Miocene sedimentary rocks, leading to the identification of two major (Mid Oligocene & Early Miocene) and one minor (Late Oligocene) sequence boundaries. Surtseyan volcanism in the east produced a palaeohigh, resulting in a submerged rimmed cool-water carbonate platform, with low-lying land to the west. This eastern palaeohigh developed karst during sea-level lowstands, which correlate with silty submarine bored hardgrounds in the west. Glauconitic and <b>phosphatic</b> facies <b>deposited</b> during early marine transgression suggest an authigenic factory supplied by terrigenous clays existed during lowered sea level that was progressively shut down in favour of a carbonate factory as sea level rose and terrigenous supply decreased. The eastern palaeohigh served to nucleate this carbonate factory by raising the sea floor above the influence of siliciclastic sediment supply and providing a shallow substrate for marine colonisation. The higher energy eastern facies display dissolution of aragonitic taxa, while deeper western facies retained an aragonitic assemblage. This early bathymetric high created a barrier to submarine currents, but was gradually reduced by erosion during subsequent lowstands. Calcareous facies were often subjected to minor seafloor cement precipitation to shallow burial diagenesis, while eastern facies developed some meteoric cement during subaerial exposure. Comparisons between sea-level change in the study area and the New Zealand megasequence indicate eustatic changes as the primary driver of water depth in the Waitaki region until the development of the modern plate boundary in the Early Miocene...|$|R

In later essays and papers he dealt with the structure and mineral composition of many igneous and sedimentary rocks, and with the phenomena of metamorphism in Belgium and other countries. In acknowledgment of his work, the Bigsby Medal was awarded to him in 1885 by the Geological Society of London.

Iron-bearing Shatti deposits, a maximum of 90 m thick, comprise five coarsening-upward regressive sequences that record intermittent detrital influx along a low-energy coast. Quartz arenite sandhodies include long breaker bars on a chenier coast, thin storm-generated littoral sheet sands, wave-dominated delta-front sands, thin crevasse splays, and minor deeply scoured channel fill. Processes and products along the Shatti shoreline ranged from those characteristic of the low-energy shelf of southwestern Louisiana to those of fluvial-wave interaction on the Rhone Delta. Shatti sequences are marked by the absence of large well-winnowed shoreface sandhodies and other evidences of major transgressive n arshore sedimentation a d also of any associated platform carbonate facies.

Most of the thicker oolitic ironstones overlie coarsening-upward deltaic sequences where they accumulated during episodes of delta abandonment. Some interfinger laterally with sheeted shoreline sandhodies. The ooids were formed on low-energy mudflats and then concentrated in thick nearshore bars by local currents. Interruptions in accretion produced burrowed, ferruginous horizons. When building ceased, the ooid bars were deeply penetrated by large vertical burrowers. Commonly an ooid bar was succeeded by or graded laterally into a thin, ferruginous <b>phosphatic</b> intraclast lag <b>deposit</b> that developed when relatively higher coastal energy of storms or renewed transgression winnowed the sediment-starved mudflats.

40|$|Small fossils are {{preserved}} as phosphatic (carbonate fluorapatite) micro-steinkerns (~ 0. 5 mm diameter) in Upper Ordovician beds from Iowa to the Cincinnati area. Molluscs are common, but bryozoan zooecia, echinoderm ossicles and other taxa are present. These micromorphic mollusks have been interpreted as ecologically-dwarfed and adapted to oxygen-starved conditions, an interpretation with implications for ocean anoxia. An alternative explanation for small phosphatic steinkerns is taphonomic. Stable phosphate may have selectively filled small voids, preserving small fossils that include larval/young molluscs. Reworking would have concentrated small phosphatic steinkerns from multiple generations whose calcareous shells were destroyed along with larger unfilled shells, resulting in small fossils progressively replacing larger fossils. With thin sections and insoluble residues, we document {{evidence suggesting that}} this taphonomically biased process created these fossil assemblages. Gastropods and monoplacophorans in thin section are often only partially filled with phosphate—starting at the apex—also evidenced by meniscus-like terminations common in whole steinkerns released by acid digestion. Umbilical steinkerns, much narrower than body-chamber fillings, are also present, and represent shells much larger than those of body-chamber steinkerns. Despite most steinkerns being similarly sized, stages of development are evidenced by progressive secondary nacre accretion that thickened the apical area of growing shells, again suggesting a size limit to these steinkerns. Bivalve steinkerns are similarly sized but without signs of partial filling because of their enclosed nature. However, phosphatic fillings between the hinge teeth of much larger bivalves suggest again that phosphate fillings were size-selective. Imprints of larger fossils are found in <b>phosphatic</b> particles apparently <b>deposited</b> within the sediment between grains. Bryozoans and echinoderms {{are preserved}} as zooecia/stereom fillings. The fossils are comparable to non-phosphatic counterparts, and were preserved because of their many small pores.

40|$|<b>Phosphatic</b> chalks were <b>deposited</b> {{during the}} mid-Santonian to early Campanian between 85 Ma and 83 Ma in NE France and {{southern}} England. The beds contain abundant brown granular phosphate, largely consisting of phosphate-filled and coated foraminiferal tests, phosphatized macrofossil fragments, faecal pellets, phosphatized intraclasts and vertebrate remains. Phosphate contents typically range from 5 – 20 % P 2 O 5. Beds 1 – 20 m thick occur within elongate 1 km long, 250 m wide and 30 m deep erosional basins (‘cuvettes’), {{cut into the}} underlying Coniacian–Santonian white chalks. Several superimposed cuvettes with consistent orientations may occur. Cuvettes are floored by phosphatized, bored and encrusted hardgrounds, and contain unique faunal assemblages that include ahermatypic colonial corals, and encrusting oyster and worm patches. Belemnites, fish and reptile remains are common. Extensive reworking by currents and biota occurred during the deposition of the phosphate. Gravity flow led to the dislocation and redeposition of basal hardground blocks {{and the formation of}} synsedimentary slump folds. Phosphatic chalks accumulated in water depths of between 70 m and a few hundred metres in oxic, current-swept areas of an open epicontinental sea of normal salinity. High surface productivity, moderate organic-carbon fluxes, reduced sedimentation rates and high rates of sediment mixing led to the precipitation of phosphate within hardground surfaces and carbonate grains. Bacterial decomposition of organic matter raised phosphate contents in pore waters and promoted the geochemical conditions necessary for phosphate precipitation. Phosphate precipitates, now transformed to carbonate fluorapatite, include μm-sized ovoid bodies and massive coatings interpreted to be of microbial origin. Phosphatization was a rapid process occurring under mixed aerobic/anaerobic redox conditions in the upper decimetre of the sediment column, close to the sediment–water interface. Phosphatization took place predominantly {{within the confines of the}} cuvettes, where phosphate grains became concentrated by current winnowing and transport. Phosphatic chalk sedimentation occurred on the NE and northern margins of the Anglo-Paris Basin following regressive events that enabled bottom currents to erode the cuvettes and maintain productivity and the other sedimentary conditions necessary for phosphate accumulation...|$|R
