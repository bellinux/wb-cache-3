5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given).

5|$|The low natural concentration, and {{the close}} {{similarity}} of <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> properties {{to those of}} lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved.

5|$|According {{to their}} shared <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> properties, the {{elements}} {{can be classified}} into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> properties that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E

Effect of <b>physical</b> modification <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> modification {{on the performance of}} fluorgypsum was studied, and the mechanism of modification was discussed by testing the phase composition and microstructure of modified fluorgypsum, using XRD and SEM. The results showed that fluorgypsum activity was excited effectively by <b>physical</b> modification <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> modification. <b>Physical</b> modification decreased CaSO 4 grain size and structure regularity, and increased fluorgypsum specific surface area, and the optimum specific surface area was 4600 - 4900 cm 2 /g. Chemical modification accelerated fluorgypsum hydration and CaSO 4 • 2 H 2 O growth, and increased CaSO 4 • 2 H 2 O grain size and slenderness ratio. The strength of fluorgypsum was exerted effectively by chemical modification...|$|R

5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals.

Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum.

5|$|Silver {{is similar}} in its <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> {{properties}} to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of the periodic table, copper and gold. Its 47 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4d105s1, similarly to copper (3d104s1) and gold (4f145d106s1); group 11 {{is one of the}} few groups in the d-block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations. This distinctive electron configuration, with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.|$|E
