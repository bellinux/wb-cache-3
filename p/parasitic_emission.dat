This paper presents {{the impact of the}} accelerated thermal aging on the electromagnetic emission (EME) of a buck DC-DC converter. The experimental analysis indicates that the aging degradation of several passive components (electrolytic capacitor and powder iron inductor) is the main source of EME evolution. Based on experimental measurement and physical analysis, the empirical degradation models of related passive devices are proposed. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} predict the electromagnetic emission evolution of a buck DC-DC converter under a thermal aging, by using these passive device degradation models. 1. Introduction The consideration of the electromagnetic robustness (EMR) of integrated circuits (IC) appeared in these last years, i. e. the evolution of <b>parasitic</b> <b>emission</b> and susceptibility to electromagnetic interferences with time for electronic devices working in harsh environments. Publications such as [1] have demonstrated that the electromagnetic emission (EME) of digital circuits and I/O buffers changes with time because of the activation of intrinsic degradation mechanisms. As presented in a few works, the simulation can be utilized to predict the long-term EMC behavior. For example, in [2], the simulation results confirmed the evolution of the electromagnetic susceptibility of a phase-locked loop before and after aging stress. A switch-mode power supply (SMPS) is selected as the device under test in this study. Because of their high power efficiency, switch-mode power supplies are widely used in electronic applications [3]. However, one main drawback of SMPS is the noise delivered by the switching activity, responsible for conducted and radiated electromagnetic emission. In this way, the management of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>emission</b> of SMPS is a frequent topic in the literature on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Various papers dealt with the origin and the modeling of electromagnetic emission, and also the development of design guidelines to improve these issues [4] [5]. Several recent studies presented the long-term behavior of SMPS. Due to the degradation of the electrolytic capacitor which is used to filter the output voltage of SMPS, an increase of the ripple of the output voltage of SMPS was illustrated in [6] [7]. Another consequence is the increase of electromagnetic emission, as shown in [8], where the increase of the EME of a DC-DC converter after thermal stress is associated with the degradation of output filtering passive devices, not only the capacitor but also the inductor in the output side. As a following study of [8], this paper focuses o...|$|E

To improve device quality, {{it is very important to}} understand how the high temperatures used during the growth process can modify the quality of the epitaxial material. With this paper we present a study of the modifications in the properties of InGaN/GaN LED structures induced by high temperature annealing: thermal stress tests were carried out at 900 °C, in nitrogen atmosphere, on selected samples. The efficiency and the recombination dynamics were evaluated by photoluminescence measurements (both integrated and time-resolved), while the properties of the epitaxial material were studied by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) and Rutherford Backscattering (RBS) channeling measurements. Results indicate that exposure to high temperatures may lead to: (i) a significant increase in the photoluminescence {{efficiency of}} the devices; (ii) a decrease in the <b>parasitic</b> <b>emission</b> bands located between 380 nm and 400 nm; (iii) an increase in carrier lifetime, as detected by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements.

30|$|Ultraviolet beams in the {{wavelength}} regime of 200  nm~ 280  nm have found potential applications in water purification system [1, 2]. Considering the low DC driving voltage {{and the more}} compatibility with the water purification system, AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV LEDs) are selected as the excellent candidate. It is worthy of mentioning that treating {{the water with a}} big volume requires the purification system to provide the high-power UVC light source. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for AlGaN-based DUV LEDs with the emission wavelength shorter than 280  nm is not satisfied at this moment [3]. The major limiting factor for the poor EQE partly arises from the large threading dislocation density (TDD) in the Al-rich quantum wells [2, 3]. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) quickly decreases once the TDD is in the order of 109  cm− 2 [3]. Even if the TDD is reduced to the order of 108  cm− 2 that can enable the IQE of 60 ~ 80 %, the effect of the efficiency droop may cause the EQE to be lower than 5 % for the bare UVC LEDs when the injection current density exceeds 80 A/cm 2 [4]. Note, the light extraction efficiency (LEE) for bare UVC LED chips is ~[*] 10 % according to FDTD calculations [5]. One of the leading interpretations for the efficiency droop of III-nitride-based LEDs is the electron spillover into the p-type hole injection layer [6]. The Al-rich AlGaN p-type hole injection layer possesses a free hole concentration even lower than 1 [*]×[*] 1017  cm− 3 [7], tending to cause a severer electron leakage level. Mehnke et al. have measured the <b>parasitic</b> <b>emission</b> that takes place in the p-type hole injection layer and the <b>parasitic</b> <b>emission</b> is well attributed to the electron leakage [8]. To reduce the electron escape from the multiple quantum wells (MQWs), one can increase the electron capture rate by inserting single spike layers in the quantum barriers [9]. The spike layers possess the Al composition higher than the quantum barrier so the polarization induced electric field in the spike layers can well reduce the drift velocity of the electrons. The improved capture efficiency is therefore enabled only if the DUV LED is grown along the [0001] orientation. Another effective method to enhance the electron capture rate is to increase the conduction band offset between the quantum barrier and the quantum well, which can be realized by properly increasing the Al composition [10], while the quantum barrier architecture can be further evolved by having the Al composition graded [11]. As has been mentioned previously, the free hole concentration for the Al-rich p-type AlGaN hole injection layer is low which leads to the poor hole injection capability into the MQW region. The poor hole injection is also regarded as the cause of the electron leakage [12]. A promising method for increasing the hole thermionic emission across the p-type electron blocking layer (p-EBL) is to energize the holes by adopting the electric field reservoir [13]. The hole transport can also be favored if the p-AlGaN-based hole injection layer with the stair-cased Al composition is utilized for DUV LEDs [14]. The stair-cased Al composition can be further replaced by the graded Al composition for the AlGaN layer to enhance the hole concentration [15 – 17]. Besides engineering the hole injection layer, alternative p-EBLs have also been suggested to reduce the hole blocking effect, e.g., inserting a thin AlGaN layer with a lower Al composition [18]. A very important structure for the p-EBL candidate is the superlattice p-EBL. Tremendous research efforts have been made to explore the impact of the GaN/AlGaN superlattice for GaN-based blue LEDs [19 – 21]. Nevertheless, the AlGaN p-EBL for blue LEDs has the AlN composition lower than 20 %, making the hole blocking effect for blue LEDs not as severe as that for DUV LEDs. Therefore, the EQE improvement is smaller than 20 % and efficiency droop is still obvious even if the GaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL is adopted for blue LEDs. DUV LEDs employ Al-rich p-EBLs, giving rise to an even more challenging hole injection issue [1]. To solve the Al-rich p-EBL-caused hole blocking effect, superlattice p-EBL is also suggested for DUV LEDs, e.g., AlInGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL [22] and AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL [23]. However, the experimental proof of the superlattice p-EBL that helps to obtain high and nearly efficiency-droop-free EQE lacks for DUV LEDs at this stage. Therefore, this work experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of a specifically designed AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL in enhancing the EQE and significantly suppressing the efficiency droop for DUV LEDs. The enhanced EQE is well attributed to the improved hole injection into the MQW region while the reduced electron leakage level helps to remarkably suppress the efficiency droop. Detailed mechanism will be presented in this work subsequently.|$|E

The onset of the modulations occurs above a target-dependent laser energy threshold and is found to correlate with <b>parasitic</b> laser <b>emission</b> preceding the ultrashort laser pulse. The analysis of the underlying plasma dynamics by using numerical simulations indicates that plasma instabilities lead to the filamentation of the laser-accelerated electron distribution. The resulting spatial pattern in the electron distribution is then transferred to the proton distribution during the acceleration process. The plasma instabilities, which the electron current is subjected to, are a surface-ripple-seeded Rayleigh-Taylor or a Weibel instability. Regarding their occurrence, both instabilities show a strong dependence on the initial plasma conditions at the target. This supports the experimentally observed connection between the temporal intensity profile of the laser pulse {{and the development of}} spatial modulations in the proton distribution. The study is considered the first observation of (regular) proton beam modulations for TNSA in {{the regime of}} ultrashort laser pulses and micrometer thick target foils. The experiments emphasize the requirement for TNSA laser power scaling studies under the consideration of realistic laser-plasma interaction conditions. In that way, the potential of the upcoming generation of Petawatt power lasers for laser-driven proton acceleration can be assessed and fully exploited. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, experimental pump-probe techniques are investigated. With an imaging method termed high depth-of-field time-resolved microscopy in a reflective probing setup, micrometer-size local features of the near-critical density plasma as well as the global topography of the plasma can be resolved. The spatio-temporal resolution of the target ionization and heating dynamics is achieved by probing the target reflectivity, whereas the angular distribution of the reflected probe beam carries signatures of the plasma expansion. The presented probing technique avails to correlate the temporal intensity profile of a laser pulse with the spatio-temporal plasma evolution triggered upon laser-target interaction...|$|R
