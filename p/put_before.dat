5|$|In 1831, Breathitt was one {{of several}} {{candidates}} <b>put</b> <b>before</b> the General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate. He received 66 of 137 votes, 3 votes short of a majority. Other unsuccessful nominees included John J. Crittenden (68 votes), Richard Mentor Johnson (64 votes), and Charles A. Wickliffe (49 votes). After 15 ballots, the Assembly still had not chosen a nominee, and postponed the matter until the next session. At that session, Henry Clay was chosen to fill the seat.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be <b>put</b> <b>before</b> the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, Zahorchak's {{proposal}} for district wide reform will be <b>put</b> <b>before</b> the Allentown School Board.

Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan.|$|E

One of the proposed lines, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Lake City, included a station adjacent to Roosevelt High School at Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 65th Street.

5|$|The {{history of}} Al Khawalid {{dates to the}} 1920s, when the Khalids opposed the British-led {{administrative}} reforms and launched a military crackdown on the Shia who supported the reforms. The perpetrators were later <b>put</b> <b>before</b> a court that sentenced them to exile. They gradually returned to Bahrain, where they were kept outside government despite developing personal relations with those in power. They regained some influence since the late 1960s, but remained outside the inner decision-making circle. During this period, {{senior members of the}} Khalids were critical of the ruling family, opposed political reforms and held a grudge against the British.|$|E
5|$|Ashbrook was {{defeated}} {{for re-election in}} the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not end until March 4 of the following year. He was friendly with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republican–Indiana), and persuaded him to schedule {{a hearing on the}} peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was <b>put</b> <b>before</b> it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as the redesign involved no expense.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Bradley's {{name was}} again <b>put</b> <b>before</b> the General Assembly as a {{candidate}} for the U.S. Senate, but he was defeated by James B. Beck by a vote of 94–31. Later that year, he received 103 of 832 votes for the Vice-Presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican National Convention, losing the nomination to Levi P. Morton. Upon the unsolicited recommendation of Senator Beck, President Benjamin Harrison nominated Bradley as Minister to Korea in 1889, but Bradley declined the nomination, opting to remain in Kentucky and pursue future political opportunities there. He was elected to the Republican National Committee three times between 1890 and 1896. In 1896, he was the Kentucky delegation's choice for Presidential nominee.|$|E
5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters <b>put</b> <b>before</b> them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|The United States trade dollar was {{a dollar}} coin minted by the United States Mint {{to compete with}} other large silver trade coins that were already popular in East Asia. The idea first came about in the 1860s, {{when the price of}} silver began to decline due to {{increased}} mining efforts in the western United States. A bill providing in part for the issuance of the trade dollar was eventually <b>put</b> <b>before</b> Congress, where it was approved and later signed into law as the Coinage Act of 1873. The act made trade dollars legal tender up to five dollars. A number of designs were considered for the trade dollar, and an obverse and reverse created by William Barber were selected.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to release the}} declaration {{was taken by the}} British War Cabinet on 31 October 1917. This followed discussion at four War Cabinet meetings (including the 31 October meeting) over the space of the previous two months. In order to aid the discussions, the War Cabinet Secretariat, led by Maurice Hankey and supported by his Assistant Secretaries – primarily Sykes and his fellow Conservative MP and pro-Zionist Leo Amery – solicited outside perspectives to <b>put</b> <b>before</b> the Cabinet. These included the views of government ministers, war allies – notably from President Woodrow Wilson – and in October, formal submissions from six Zionist leaders and four non-Zionist Jews.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} {{sovereignty}} movement became on what terms sovereignty would be <b>put</b> <b>before</b> the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the independantiste wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ's general historical preference for an economic relationship {{with the rest of}} Canada to be offered alongside sovereignty, as he thought this would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. As a practical matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.|$|E

It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E

5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he <b>put</b> <b>before</b> them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E
5|$|Three {{states did}} not {{complete}} action on the twelve articles of amendment when they were initially <b>put</b> <b>before</b> the states. Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify. Both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court ratified {{a number of the}} amendments (the Senate adopted 10 of 12 and the House 9 of 12), but failed to reconcile their two lists or to send official notice to the Secretary of State of the ones they did agree upon. Both houses of the Connecticut General Assembly voted to ratify Articles Three through Twelve but failed to reconcile their bills after disagreeing over whether to ratify Articles One and Two. All three later ratified the Constitutional amendments originally known as Articles Three through Twelve as part of the 1939 commemoration of the Bill of Rights' sesquicentennial: Massachusetts on March 2, Georgia on March 18, and Connecticut on April 19. Connecticut and Georgia would also later ratify Article Two, on May 13, 1987 and February 2, 1988 respectively.|$|E
5|$|While {{conducting}} {{an investigation of}} the Mint at San Francisco, deputy comptroller of the currency John Jay Knox began discussing the monetary situation with Louis A. Garnett, a man who had worked as both the treasurer and assayer of the San Francisco Mint. Garnett recommended that the United States mint a commercial dollar that would be exported to the Orient to compete with other countries' silver trade coins that were already popular in that region. Garnett's rationale was {{that the majority of the}} coins would be hoarded or melted in Asia and would never be presented for redemption, allowing the government to make a profit from the seigniorage. During his time in San Francisco, Knox also discussed the proposed commercial dollar with Henry Linderman, who was working as a special agent for the Treasury Department at that time. In 1870, Knox wrote a report to the Treasury and wrote the draft for a bill on coinage. Knox's bill was approved by George Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury. After modification and review from current and former government officials, the bill was <b>put</b> <b>before</b> Congress.|$|E
