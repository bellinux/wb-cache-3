40|$|Background: The {{most common}} {{complication}} of lumbar <b>puncture</b> (LP) occurring in over {{thirty percent of}} patients is headache. The position after lumbar <b>puncture,</b> needle type and size, and volume of the extracted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been evaluated as contributory factors in occurrence of post lumbar <b>puncture</b> headache (PLPH), but the position before lumbar <b>puncture</b> has not been evaluated. Methods: The occurrence of post lumbar <b>puncture</b> headache was evaluated in 125 patients undergoing lumbar <b>puncture,</b> divided randomly into sitting and lateral decubitus groups in the following five days. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty eight patients (30. 4 %) reported headache after lumbar <b>puncture</b> in the two groups, and post lumbar <b>puncture</b> headache was significantly lower in the lateral decubitus position (p = 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} between genders in the post lumbar <b>puncture</b> headache occurrence (p = 0. 767).

2500|$|These {{statements}} are clarified {{by considering the}} type of a Riemann sphere [...] {{with a number of}} <b>punctures.</b> With no <b>punctures,</b> it is the Riemann sphere, which is elliptic.

One can map from one <b>puncture</b> to two, via the exponential map (which is entire and has an essential singularity at infinity, so not defined at infinity, and misses zero and infinity), but all maps from zero <b>punctures</b> to one or more, or one or two <b>punctures</b> to three or more are constant.|$|R
5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on plants by <b>puncturing</b> and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.|$|E

5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a <b>puncturing</b> and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Surgical {{procedures}} for pacemaker implantation vary among facilities. The extrathoracic venous <b>puncture</b> method has been utilized for lead insertion, although patients' body movements can displace the targeted vein {{from the area}} into which a contrast agent has been injected for imaging. Failed <b>punctures</b> cause edema around the <b>puncture</b> site, spasm, or venous collapse due to bleeding, which may render another <b>puncture</b> impractical. To overcome these problems, we report a new technique for the extrathoracic <b>puncture</b> method. Methods and results: From April 2007 through March 2011, we performed 35 new dual chamber pacemaker implantation procedures. This study compared a conventional <b>puncture</b> group (from April 2007 through March 2009; Group A) with a catheter-guided <b>puncture</b> group (from April 2009 through March 2011; Group B). We analyzed procedure time and procedure-related complications in each group. The procedure time was 138. 6 ± 41. 8  min in the conventional <b>puncture</b> group (Group A) and 109. 8 ± 23. 2 in the catheter-guided <b>puncture</b> group (Group B). There was {{a significant reduction in}} the procedure time in the catheter-guided <b>puncture</b> group (Group B) compared with the conventional <b>puncture</b> group (Group A; p= 0. 016). No patients in either group had pneumothorax, hematoma, or any other complications. Conclusion: Our <b>puncture</b> method involving catheter insertion appears to be safe and effective...|$|R
5|$|Sebastian Vettel led a Ferrari 1-2 {{in third}} {{practice}} ahead of Räikkönen, setting {{a time of}} 1:31.683. The two Mercedes drivers of Rosberg and Hamilton followed, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean. On the soft compound tyres, both Mercedes drivers had set identical times, before Rosberg edged out Hamilton on the super-softs. Higher temperatures {{in the afternoon sun}} meant that the times dropped from second practice. Felipe Massa ran a new, shorter nase for Williams, but managed only the ninth fastest time, more than half a second slower than teammate Bottas. Not running the super-soft tyres, Toro Rosso got its two drivers on 15th and 16th place respectively. Jolyon Palmer was 20th fastest before <b>puncturing</b> a tyre {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} {{accidents}} concerned {{testing of the}} station's TORU manual docking system to manually dock Progress M-33 and Progress M-34. The tests were to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive Kurs automatic docking system from Progress spacecraft. Due to malfunctioning equipment, both tests failed, with Progress M-33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M-34 striking Spektr and <b>puncturing</b> the module, causing the station to depressurise and leading to Spektr being permanently sealed off. This in turn led to a power crisis aboard Mir as the module's solar arrays produced {{a large proportion of}} the station's electrical supply, causing the station to power down and begin to drift, requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.|$|E
5|$|When attacked, {{the common}} toad adopts a {{characteristic}} stance, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. Its chief means of defence {{lies in the}} foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin. This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it. Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats and mink, and even domestic cats. Birds that feed on toads include herons, crows and birds of prey. Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal's liver, thus avoiding the toxin. The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae, diving beetles and water boatmen. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by <b>puncturing</b> the tadpole's skin and sucking out its juices.|$|E

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually {{take place on}} Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, <b>puncturing</b> Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E
