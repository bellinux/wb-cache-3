40|$|We have {{implemented}} a <b>pitch</b> <b>detector</b> based on Licklider’s “Duplex Theory ” of pitch perception, and tested it {{on a variety}} of stimuli from human perceptual tests. We believe that this approach accurately models how humans perceive pitch. We show that it correctly identifies the pitch of complex harmonic and inharmonic stimuli, and that it is robust in the face of noise and phase changes. This perceptual <b>pitch</b> <b>detector</b> combines a cochlear model with a bank of autocorrelators. By performing an independent autocorrelation for each channel, the <b>pitch</b> <b>detector</b> is relatively insensitive to phase changes across channels.

40|$|The {{fact that}} {{different}} sound environments need different sound processing is no secret, {{but how to}} select between the different programs {{is very different from}} hearing aid to hearing aid. Complete automatic and reliable classification is desirable, because many hearing aid users are not able to select programs themselves.

40|$|Speech coding {{at the low}} bit-rate of 2400 bits {{per second}} {{requires}} an accurate and robust pitch period computed at low algorithmic delay to produce a perceptually satisfactory result. Low bit-rate speech coding algorithms such as those based on Prototype Waveforms can offer a speech quality comparable to higher bit rate counterparts. In this thesis two new algorithms, the 2 ̆ 7 Prototype Waveform <b>Pitch</b> <b>Detector</b> 2 ̆ 7 (PWPD) and, the 2 ̆ 7 Dynamic Programming/Viterbi 2 ̆ 7 (DPA^) <b>Pitch</b> <b>Detector</b> are introduced which can determine the pitch at frequent 5 ms intervals.

40|$|Abstract—A {{comparative}} performance {{study of}} seven pitch detection algorithms was conducted. A speech data base, consisting of eight utterances spoken by three males, three females, and one child was con-structed. Telephone, close talking microphone, and wideband record-ings {{were made of}} each of the utterances. For each of the utterances in the data base; a "standard " pitch contour was semiautomatically measured using a highly sophisticated interactive pitch detection pro-gram. The "standard " pitch contour was then compared with the pitch contour that was obtained from each of the seven programmed <b>pitch</b> <b>detectors.</b> The algorithms used in this study were 1) a center clipping, infinite-peak clipping, modified autocorrelation method (AUTOC), 2) the cepstral method (CEP), 3) the simplified inverse fil-tering technique (SIFT) method, 4) the parallel processing time-domain method (PPROC), 5) the data reduction method (DARD), 6) a spectral flattening linear predictive coding (LPC) method, and 7) the average magnitude difference function (AMDF) method. A set of measure-ments was made on the pitch contours to quantify the various types of errors which occur in each of the above methods. Included among the error measurements were the average and standard deviation of the error in pitch period during voiced regions, the number of gross errors in the pitch period, and the average number of voiced—unvoiced clas-sification errors.

40|$|Abstract—A {{high-quality}} <b>pitch</b> <b>detector</b> {{has been}} built in digital hard-ware and operates in real time at a 10 kl-Iz sampling rate. The hardware is capable of providing energy as well as pitch-period esthnates. The pitch and energy computations are performed 100 times/s (i. e., once per 10 ms interval). The algorithm to estimate the pitch period uses center clipping, infinite peak clipping, and a simplified autocorrelation analysis. The analysis is performed on a 300 sample section of speech which is both center clipped and infinite peak clipped, yielding a three-level speech signal where the levels are — 1, 0, and + 1 depending on {{the relation of the}} original speech sample to the clipping threshold. Thus computation of the autocorrelation function of the clipped speech is easily implemented in digital hardware using simple combinatorial logic, i. e., an up-down counter can be used to compute each correla-tion point.

40|$|Abstract — We aim {{to detect}} salient mispronunciations in {{intonation}} of English speech uttered by Mandarin speakers. The goal of our {{project is to}} detect intonation errors and provide corrective feedback to English second language (ESL) learners. An intonational event includes the pitch accent and edge tone, and the intonation {{is closely related to}} the nuclear tone of an intonational phrase (IP). Hence, we first develop a <b>pitch</b> accent <b>detector</b> to delineate the scope of analysis in an utterance. Then we develop a nuclear tone detector to classify the intonation of the IP as either rising or falling. The <b>pitch</b> accent <b>detector</b> is a Gaussian mixture model using the features based on energy, pitch contour and the duration of the vowels. The intonation detector is a Gaussian discriminator using three features derived from the pitch contour. Annotated L 2 English speech from 40 Mandarin speakers is used in a 10 -fold cross-validation setting.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} optimal CT acquisition parameter settings for each make and model of scanners used in a large Radiation Oncology (RO) Department, considering the special requirements of CT simulation. Two CT phantoms were used to evaluate the image quality of the five different multichannel CT scanners using helical scan mode. We compared the effects of various <b>pitch,</b> <b>detector</b> configurations, and rotation time parameters on image artifacts, and on spatial and contrast resolution. We found that helical artifact was closely related to <b>pitch</b> and <b>detector</b> configuration settings. This artifact was scannerspecific and generally more obvious when the channel width or detector collimation was equal to the image thickness. Different acquisition parameter settings produced slight differences in observed high- and low-contrast resolution. Short rotation time degraded image quality for certain scanners, but only slightly, while other rotation times, such as 0. 75 sec/rotation and above, had no obvious effect on resolution. An optimized combination of acquisition parameters was determined for each scanner make and model, based on phantom image quality and other considerations for clinical applications. This information may be directly useful for physicists whose CT simulation scanners match one of the five examined in this study. If not, the strategy reported here may be used as a guide to perform a similar evaluation of the scanner...|$|R
