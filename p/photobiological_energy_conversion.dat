40|$|We {{study the}} role of <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> in phase {{regulation}} of frequency entrainment. For an open dynamical system that interacts with its environment, <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> in the system {{is the key to}} a wide variety of nonlinear phenomena including frequency entrainment. In this paper, using the standard notion of energy, we study the phenomena of frequency entrainment by periodic forces in two different types of oscillations: libration and rotation. Theoretical analysis shows a relationship between phase regulation and <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> in the entrainment phenomena. Both of them are explained as a common phase regulation. On the other hand, no common relationship between transient behaviors and <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> is identified for the two different types of oscillations. For libration, the development of frequency entrainment does not depend on the <b>energy</b> <b>conversion.</b> The <b>energy</b> input to the oscillator affects the amplitude of libration. For the rotation, the development of frequency entrainment is governed by the amount of <b>energy</b> <b>conversion.</b> The <b>energy</b> input to the system directly regulates the phase of rotation, in other words, controls the entrainment phenomenon.
