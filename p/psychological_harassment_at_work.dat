In collecting data, two questionnaires were used: one socio-professional and another for identifying the behaviors involving psychological harassment experienced by the subjects in the previous twelve months, along with the duration and frequency of the behaviors. At the end of the questionnaire, a dichotomous question was added, which addressed nurses' perceptions in relation to feeling victimized by <b>psychological</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Both the questionnaires were applied in electronic and print format between May and September 2010. The data was analyzed through descriptive statistics. The results showed that some of the subjects felt that they were victims of psychological harassment. Only the variables related to characterization of the psychological harassment presented significant association. The following were highlighted among the most-referred-to behaviors: "They question your decisions" and "You receive verbal attacks criticizing work you have done". It's important to open spaces for discussing violence at work, so that managers may establish strategic measures for preventing and containing this type of violence, so as to ensure health, dignity and well-being at work. It is also important to discuss this issue in the academic space, so as to give the theme greater visibility, such that future nurses will be able to identify and appropriately confront this type of violence...|$|E

40|$|Fundamento y objetivo: El acoso laboral sistemático (ACS), a pesar de las diferentes tratamientos farmacológicos a largo plazo y tratamientos no farmacológicos, conduce a una alta tasa de incapacidades permanentes y graves trastornos mentales. El objetivo de esta comunicación es analizar la prescripción de medicamentos para el tratamiento de enfermedades, trastornos, síntomas y signos que experimentan los afectados de ACSa, teniendo en cuenta el diagnóstico establecido por los MAP o psiquiatras. Configuración y método: Estudio observacional, longitudinal, basado en la revisión de los registros médicos de las personas afectadas por HSW. Principales medidas de resultado: datos socio-demográficos, días de incapacidad temporal, el período de HSW psicológica, los principales diagnóstico de {{acuerdo a}} la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades (CIE- 10), la prescripción patrón de acuerdo con la clasificación ATC. Resultados: 50 pacientes fueron incluidos en el estudio (edad media: 45, 5 años; 62 % mujeres). Los períodos medios de ACS y de ILT eran 4 años y 413 días respectivamente. Los principales diagnósticos fueron 76, 5 % F 40 - 48 y el 23, 1 % F 30 - 39 por médico de cabecera y el 49, 4 % F 30 - 39 y del 42, 1 % F 40 - 48 por el psiquiatra. El número total de prescripciones fue 909, incluyendo 67 diferentes principios activos, principalmente del grupo N de la clasificación ATC (88 %), dirigidos a mitigar los síntomas mentales y lograr la remisión completa de los síntomas de la enfermedad mental. El restante (12 %) se utiliza para tratar el estado psicosomático aparato locomotor, digestivo, cardiovascular, endocrino, dermatológicas infecciosas, respiratorias y los trastornos de dolor crónico. Los psiquiatras se centran su actividad en la depresión y, así, su prescripción es el 49 % de los antidepresivos en comparación con el 29 % de los ansiolíticos. Además, la prescripción de antidepresivos aproximadamente {{coincide}} con el porcentaje de pacientes con diagnóstico de depresión (43 %), mientras que el porcentaje de casos diagnosticados de ansiedad (53 %) es muy superior que receta ansiolíticos. Sin embargo, la Guía NICE para los estados depresivos que en el caso de los asociados síntomas de la depresión y la ansiedad, la depresión merece una atención prioritaria. Conclusiones: Los diagnósticos de los psiquiatras son consistentes con los criterios establecidos en la literatura internacional al describir los trastornos mentales graves y discapacitantes que afectan a HSW psicológico. La prescripción de antidepresivos está de acuerdo con el enfoque de diagnóstico informado por todos los especialistas, y también está de acuerdo con las recomendaciones de NICE Directrices para la depresión. Objectives: The first {{aim of this}} study was to examine the possible association of long standing Systematic <b>psychological</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> (SPHW) with psychiatric disorders and its characteristics. The second aim was to analyze drug prescription used to treat diseases, disorders, symptoms, and signs of those affected with psychological SPHW, taking into account the established diagnosis by the General Physician (GP) or Psychiatrists. Method and study subjects: Design: Longitudinal observational study with follow up focused on persons undergoing a long duration SPHW; based on the review of medical records of people affected by SPHW Total length of the follow up period was 6 years, from 2006 to 2012. Mean duration of follow up was 3. 1 years (range 1. 1 - 6. 3 years). Setting: Patients who voluntarily attend to a Catalonia Harassment Victims association (Associació de Víctimes d’Assejament laboral de Catalunya: AVALC) asking for psychological and laboral aid. Subjects: 132 persons were recruited along a seven years period, 84 women (63. 6 %) and 48 men (36. 4 %). Mean age was 45. 5 years (SD ± 9. 8), 43. 8 years for women and 48. 3 years for men (p= 0. 114). SPHW was measured by self-reported data. All participants were assessed using several neuropsychological instruments such as the Beck Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Echeburua Scale, the PDS (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale) and the LIPT (Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terrorization). Medical records were examined to verify all the diagnosis affecting to the participants. After checking the medical records, only 50 cases (37. 3 %), 31 women and 19 men, had verified psychiatric diagnostics, according to ICD- 10 criteria. Main outcome measures: - Socio-demographic data: age, gender - Work environment: types of harassers, mainly distributed by work sectors, public administration workers and private organizations workers, days of temporary disability, period of SPHW. - Main diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases ICD- 10 - Type of assistance: primary care, mental health unit, emergency department, neurologist or occupational health unit. - Previous pharmacotherapeutical history including all prescribed drugs (generic or brand) related with working problems and concomitant medication, number of prescriptions, active principles (DCI), reason for prescription, dose and dosing interval, duration of treatment, and number of drugs per patient. - Established treatment planning (pharmaceutical care) designed to detect, prevent and solve potential or acute problems related with the prescribed drugs, such as adherence, interactions, collateral effects, negative outcomes, effectiveness and safety. - Prescription pattern according to Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical Classification System (ATC classification). - Most prescribed active principles and percentages of utilization.

Background/Introduction The phenomenon of systematic <b>psychological</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> (SPHW) first described by Heinz Leymann, refers to systematic and prolonged exposure to frequent hostile behaviours at work. SPHW is commonly considered as an expression of violent behaviour. SPHW has been defined as ‘‘harassing, offending, socially excluding someone or negatively affecting someone’s work tasks [...] . ” it has to occur repeatedly and regularly (e. g., weekly) and over a period of time (e. g., about six months). However, there is no accepted common definition as yet and different terminology is used as synonym of bullying (e. g., harassment, mobbing, emotional abuse, victimisation, psychological abuse at work). Research about this topic has dramatically increased in the last years. These behaviours may lead to the stigmatisation and victimization of the exposed individuals. A reciprocal relationship between SPHW and mental distress has been described. Several studies have shown that SPHW is associated with mental distress. Furthermore, mental distress was shown to be a predictor of bullying. It seems that experiencing workplace bullying can contribute to mental distress, but individual characteristics may also contribute to the perception of bullying. Thus, a significant relationship between general proneness to negative feelings and work victimization has been described. A theoretical framework, the cognitive theory of trauma, proposes the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the result of systematic psychological harmful events. The traumatic potential of bullying is unquestionable. So, the path from job demands to PTSD through bullying seems plausible. PTSD is a severe anxiety disorder that can be developed after exposure to any event that results in psychological trauma. Diagnostic symptoms for PTSD include re-experiencing the original trauma(s) through flashbacks or nightmares, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, and increased arousal, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, anger, and hyper vigilance. Diagnostic criteria require that symptoms last more than one month and cause significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Exposure to intense bullying at work may change the individual’s perceptions of their work-environment and life in general to one of threat, danger, insecurity and self-questioning, which may result in emotional, psychosomatic and psychiatric problems, even affecting the personal and familiar relationships of the victims. Most studies examining the relationship between psychosocial work characteristics and mental health outcomes, ranging from symptoms and psychological distress to diagnosed psychiatric disorders, have been cross-sectional and, therefore, the causal association between work stressors and mental health remains uncertain. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe and analyze the possible relationship between SPHW characteristics and the subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, such as the presence of PTSD symptoms as a possible consequence of workplace bullying-related victimization. PTSD in the workplace may be a common problem and there has been scarce research about this topic (32). RESULTS Mean duration of SPHW was 4. 0 years (SD ± 2. 8), 3. 7 years for women and 4. 6 years for men (p= 0. 226). 14 % of participants suffered SPHW along 3 years or less, 48 % from 3 to 6 years, 30 % from 6 to 9 years and 8 % more than 9 years. In 62. 7 % of cases, the harassers were hierarchic superiors and in 9. 4 % of cases companions and/or collaborators contributed to bullying. In 62. 7 % of cases, the harassers were hierarchic superiors and in 9. 4 % of cases companions and/or collaborators contributed to bullying. Cases were mainly distributed by work sectors as follows: 28. 4 % public administrations, 23. 2 % commercial sector, 23. 2 % industrial sector and 14. 0 % services. In our sample, we included 35. 6 % of public administration workers and 64. 4 % of private organizations workers. Despite of the greater proportion of private organization workers, we found a high number of worked years in the same organization: 25 % of cases with 20 or more years worked at the same organization. The distribution was as follows: 8. 3 % less than 1 year, 25. 0 % from 1 to 5 years, 26. 5 % from 5 to 10 years, 6. 8 % from 10 to 15 years, 8. 3 % from 15 to 20 years, 12. 1 % from 20 to 25 years, 4. 5 % from 25 to 30 years, 6. 1 % from 30 to 35 years and 2. 3 % from 35 to 40 years. The mean number of diagnoses for each patient was 4. 2 (range 1 - 7). Persons with previous mental disorders were excluded. The remaining participants met no criteria or were lost along the follow-up period. All of them showed a follow-up period longer than 30 months. Mean duration of follow up for this group was 3. 8 years (range 2. 7 - 6. 3 years). The main diagnoses were 76. 5 % F 40 - 48 and 23. 1 % F 30 - 39 by GP, and 49. 4 % F 30 - 39 and 42. 1 % F 40 - 48 by psychiatrist. The most frequent psychiatric diagnoses were Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was the most often diagnosed disorder (44. 0 %). Major depression has been developed by 20 % of patients with important comorbidity, mainly physical symptoms as insomnia, headache, digestive disorders, etc. Significant differences were found in the association of SPHW length with type of subsequent psychiatric diagnosis (p= 0. 015) and public/private job (p= 0. 047). Psychiatric diagnoses by gender showed significant differences for PTSD (p= 0. 043), generalized anxiety (p= 0. 041) and minor depression episodes (p= 0. 049). One case of suicide was registered (0. 8 %) and 3 cases of autolysis attempts (2. 3 %). All participant patients presented sick leaves. Mean length of temporary disability was 13. 8 months (SD ± 6. 7), 13. 2 months for women and 14. 8 months for men. Sick leaves duration was slightly higher for men, but no significant differences by gender were observed (p= 0. 417). On the other hand, significant differences were observed in the mean duration of sick leaves by diagnosis. Mean values were 9. 5 months for adaptation disorders, 11. 6 months for generalized anxiety, 11. 7 months for minor depression episodes, 11. 9 months for major depression and 17. 2 months for PTSD (p= 0. 019). We also found significant differences in the mean duration of sick leaves by public/private job. Mean values were 11. 7 months for private jobs and 17. 6 months for public employments (p= 0. 002). Significant differences were found in the mean age of the psychiatric diagnoses. Cases with diagnosis of adaptation disorders were the youngest and with diagnosis of major depression were the oldest (p= 0. 019). SPHW length seems related with the type of subsequent psychiatric diagnosis. The mean SPHW length was longer for the more severe disorders, PTSD and depression, and shorter for anxiety and adaptation disorders. So, 1. 9 years for adaptation disorders, 2. 2 years for generalized anxiety, 3. 9 years for minor depression, 4. 6 years for major depression and 5. 1 years for PTSD (p= 0. 015). Significant differences were also found in the association between SPHW length and public/private job. Mean values were 3. 4 years for private jobs and 5. 0 years for public jobs (p= 0. 047). There were 909 prescriptions, including 67 different active principles (88 %). Most of them were from the N group of the ATC classification, which targeted a mitigation of mental symptoms and achievement of complete remission. The remaining 12 % prescriptions were used to treat psychosomatic symptoms including locomotive, digestive, cardiovascular, endocrine, infectious, dermatological, respiratory, and chronic pain disorders. In our study, 92 % of patients are treated with both anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. General Physicians focus on anxiety, these accounts for 70 % of anxiolytic prescribing, in comparison to them being responsible for 20 % of antidepressant prescribing. Nevertheless, the NICE Guidelines for Depression state that if a case is presented in which symptoms of both depression and anxiety coexist, the former deserves priority attention. Psychiatrists focus on depression; this accounts for 49 % of antidepressant prescribing, in comparison to them being responsible for 26. 3 % of anxiolytic prescribing. Furthermore, the number of antidepressants prescribed is roughly in accordance with the percentage of patients diagnosed with depression (43 %), while the percentage of diagnosed anxiety cases (53 %) is higher than the amount of anxiolytics prescribed. Treatment pattern has been successful in 34 % of SPHW with comorbidity, post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) and major depression episodes (MDE). Gender differences have been observed in the successful rates: 47. 4 % for men and 25. 8 % for women. 38 % of SPHW with associated major depression disorder (MDD) have achieved a remission. Gender differences have been observed in the successful rates: 47. 4 % for men and 32. 3 % for women. The total number of patients in not remission is 17 (34 %), 10 women (20 %) and 7 men (36. 8 %). These patients are treated with both antipsychotic drug (N 05 A) and another antidepressant (N 06 AX) drugs. Antipsychotic drugs are almost exclusively prescribed by psychiatrists in 88 %. DISCUSSION An important limitation of the study is its lack of generalization, because we have focused on diagnosed cases and not in general population. But, in the other hand, there is scarce research focused on persons with a long history of intense bullying. A second limitation is that the data were self-reported, which raises the issue of common method variance. However, other methods, such as observer ratings of working conditions, may be equally affected by bias. Participants in the study have undergone very long periods of SPHW, so it can be expected that psychological or psychiatric consequences should be more severe than those reported by other studies. It has been described a significant correlation between the duration and intensity of SHPW and the subsequent psychiatric symptoms. PTSD is a severe consequence of important traumatic events. Heterogeneity in PTSD diagnosis is a complex factor which should be assessed. It is not the purpose of this paper to solve the complex issue of the appropriateness of PTSD diagnosis as a consequence of bullying, which is related to the conceptualization of bullying as an overwhelming traumatic event. However, association between SPHW and PTSD have been reported by a large number of studies, most of them having a cross-sectional design. In our data, PTSD incidence in patients SPHW is higher than the described in the literature. It may be partially due to the longitudinal design of the study. The long length of SPHW jointly with the prolonged follow up period (mean value: 3. 1 years) could lead into a higher PTSD development ratio. A key question in this relationship is how long do the psychological effects of bullying persist over time, independently of SPHW duration. This question remains uncertain and reveals the need of longitudinal studies with long enough periods of follow up. Association between depression and SPHW is well documented. Moreover, a meta-analysis collecting epidemiological data calculated summary estimates for the effects of work stress: the average risk of depression across all studies weighted by the number of participants was 1. 2 to 1. 4 fold. Our results show a 20 % incidence of major depression cases, probably due to the characteristics of SPHW, specially its long length. Gender has been found to be the strongest predictor of Post-Stress Traumatic Disorder (PSTD). Our results agree with the important role of gender. Although WPB duration seems to be highly correlated with the development of PTSD, our data show longer length of SPHW with lower incidence of PTSD for males and shorter length of SPHW with higher rates of PTSD for females. A great number of patients were lost along the follow-up period (32. 1 %) and, so, it could not be verified the correct diagnosis, if any, and its possible relation with SPHW. However, the heavy utilization of psychotropic drugs seems to be a strong indicator of severe mental disorders. The high number of withdrawals may be probably due to the characteristics of participants. Persons attending a victims association in a desperate situation, after a long suffering time, need strong and urgent aid. Solving the SPHW problem is a complex and difficult question, so patients go on looking for new options. Comorbidity is the main prognosis factor for transitory disability length. The high number of diagnoses for each patient observed in our study probably influences the long length of sick leaves. Major psychiatric disorders are commonly related to work disability and, usually, they are an important potential factor for unemployment. It has been argued that the association between work characteristics and health is due to confounding by social class. Thus, poor work environmental characteristics are merely a marker of low socioeconomic position. But even after adjustment for social position, in occupational cohorts of homogeneous social status, work characteristics are still important determinants of psychological distress. Mental health problems can take years to develop but the cross-sectional studies explore a reduced time period. In our data the minimum follow-up period is 30 months, so the described relationship between WPB and psychiatric disorders should be more consistent. CONCLUSIONS Longer length of SPHW is associated with more severe psychiatric diagnoses. As mental health problems can take years to develop, long follow up periods are needed to identify the psychiatric consequences of SPHW. The diagnoses made by psychiatrists were consistent, but GP diagnoses weren’t it, with the criteria established in the international literature describing severe and disabling mental disorders affecting psychological of SPHW. The prescribing of antidepressants correlated with the diagnostic approach used by specialists, and was also in accordance with the NICE Guidelines for depression. SPHW despite of different long-term pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, leads to a high rate of permanent disabilities and severe mental disorders. Prescription of drugs in Mental Health settings by GP is based on so-called target symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia and somatic) representing 93. 9 % of total prescription. However, Psychiatrists prescription is based on an another target symptoms (psychosis diseases, depression, anxiety, insomnia, suicide risk, aggressive behaviour, attention, phobia, mania, neurosis, agitation, comorbid psychiatric disorders) Chronic insomnia in patients with major depression disorder (MDD) is underdiagnosed and undertreated, despite of its high prevalence in this type of patients with SPHW...|$|E
40|$|Cet article brosse un {{portrait}} des plaintes écrites déposées à la Commission des normes du travail du Québec entre le 1 er juin 2004 et le 30 avril 2005. Au total, 236 plaintes de harcèlement psychologique au travail ont constitué le corpus d’analyse. Les principaux résultats montrent que parmi l’ensemble des cas analysés, 63  % des plaignants sont des femmes. Près de 95  % des plaignants ont avancé avoir subi du harcèlement à caractère répétitif. Les cinq premiers motifs de plainte sont les propos et les gestes vexatoires, les atteintes aux conditions de travail, la menace de congédiement, la mise en échec de la personne et l’isolement. Par ailleurs, ce sont généralement les gestionnaires qui sont désignés comme personnes mises en cause. À la lumière de ces résultats, il est important que les organisations se dotent de systèmes de veille pour détecter les cas et d’outils de gestion pour désamorcer les situations qui comportent un potentiel de harcèlement psychologique. Following in {{the wake}} of several European countries, Quebec adopted a bill in December 2002 to modify the Labour Code and other legislative measures by the introduction of measures pertaining to psychological harassment (art. 81. 18 to 81. 20). These standards, which are accompanied by specific means of legal recourse (art. 123. 6 to 123. 16) and fall under the responsibility of the Commission des normes du travail (CNT), came into effect on June 1, 2004 (Lippel, 2005). This article presents an overview of the written complaints filed with the Commission des normes du travail (CNT) between June 1, 2004 and April 30, 2005. At the present time, most of the studies on psychological harassment, moral harassment or other forms of violence in the workplace use a survey with worker populations (Brun and Plante, 2004; Byrne, 1997; Hirigoyen, 1998, 2001; Hoel, Rayner and Cooper, 2003; Leymann, 1996 a, 1996 b; Salin, 2003; Vandekerkhove and Commers, 2003; Wornham, 2003). Although these surveys are very useful, they have the limitation of being centred on identifying the types of events, the forms, or the sources of psychological harassment in the workplace. Scientific studies are rare (Garcia, Hacourt and Bara, 2005; Lapeyrière, 2004; Lewis and Orford, 2005); this type of study focuses on the inside story of cases of psychological harassment, the difficulties of putting into the experience into words, the doubts that the outward expression of facts may raise, and the ambiguities hidden by complex situations. For this reason, our research study adopted the point of view and the arguments put forward by the main players, that is to say, the men and women filing the complaints, as well as the situations that are being denounced. Our objective was to give an overview of the complaints filed with the Commission des normes du travail over a period of one year. In so doing, we hope to better understand the complexity of the phenomenon of psychological harassment through the situations as experienced and expressed by the complainants. In total, 236 complaints of <b>psychological</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and more than 1, 500 pages written by the complainants made up the corpus for analysis. The research method used includes a first section on socioprofessional and economic factors (e. g., sex, age, profession, employment status, etc.), a second section on the business itself (e. g., sector, number of employees, etc.) and a third section focused on the complaint itself (e. g., causes, frequency, form, witnesses, consequences, etc.). The main study results show that among the set of cases analysed, 63 % of complainants are women. Two-thirds of the complaints (68 %) mention one individual as being involved, while 32 % of cases identify several people as being the source of the psychological harassment. More than 95 % of the complainants claimed to have been the target of harassment that was repetitive in nature. The five most common causes for complaint are vexatious words and gestures (132 complaints), infringement on working conditions (77 complaints), threat of firing (49 complaints), causing failure for the person (39 complaints), and isolation (39 complaints). Psychological harassment is socially distributed, that is to say, that it touches, as either author or victim, many employment categories, whether one be a secretary, technician, or senior management. As well, managers usually are identified as people being involved. In the majority of cases analyzed, attempts to find a resolution (e. g., discussion with the person involved, information given to the supervisor, complaint letter, etc.) are solely made by the complainant; colleagues are almost always uninvolved, and only in rare cases has another colleague intervened to make a situation stop or to speak out against a situation of which those in the complainant’s immediate environment are aware. The phenomenon of psychological harassment is far from being simple; the remarks and the stories that we have related clearly show that these are complex situations for many reasons. One of these reasons is that psychological harassment is a direct manifestation of the private nature of violence (Cooney, 2003) that concerns individuals rather than groups, and is addressed at individuals and in the context of face to face relations, that is to say, without the presence of any direct witnesses. Psychological harassment is also socially distributed, meaning that it involves, in terms of victims or perpetrators, people from all types of employment: secretary, technician, or upper management. However, the direction of psychological harassment is not randomly distributed. Generally, managers are identified as instigators, and women state they are harassed by men. In analysing the 236 cases, we were astonished by the large number of cases of psychological harassment involving situations of rudeness, vexatious or blasphemous remarks (132 / 236 complaints). An insult, “the sentence that kills!” and public denigration are common among the complaints of psychological harassment filed at the Commission des normes du travail. The situation seems to be similar in the United States, where, according to research by Pearson and Porath (2005), 20 % of workers surveyed said they are the target of rude remarks at least once a week. The respect of others is a value which is losing ground, and individualism often justifies any remark when a person wishes to reach his or her ends. The individualization of conflicts is also revealed in the attempts at case resolution. In fact, in most of the cases studied, attempts at resolution (e. g., discussion with the person involved, information for the supervisor, letter of complaint, etc.) come directly from the complainant. Colleagues are almost always uninvolved; rare are the cases where another colleague has intervened in order {{to put a stop to}} or to speak out against a situation which is known in the immediate environment of the complainant. It is also important to mention that, in general, a person does not know how to intervene or stop a conflict (Lapeyrière, 2004). Other staff members usually plead being unsure or the overly complex nature of the situation. One of the challenges linked to psychological harassment in the workplace for employers and employees is to not become caught up within a legal debate, wondering if the situation does or does not fit with the definition provided by the law. From a point of view of good management within the organization and so as to avoid the courts becoming involved in cases, the problems brought forward by the complainants must first and foremost be analyzed in the light of individual and collective ethics (Wornham, 2003) and in the light of problems associated with work relations (Legoff, 2003). Whether or not it may be a case of harassment, the situations we have analyzed are, in many cases, quite simply inadmissible in modern organizations and may, as well, lead to psychological or physical health problems (Vartia, 2004). Seen from an ethical and a public health perspective, the employer and the employees have the duty of making sure that such situations not occur (Leclerc, 2005). For these reasons, it is important to establish boundaries which may not be crossed, to define as clearly as possible what is acceptable and what is not, to make it understood that respect of another person’s dignity is not a privilege, but rather a right and a fundamental duty and that it is crucial not to wait until the situation is deemed unacceptable before an intervention is made.

Cerca del 95 % de demandantes sostuvieron haber sufrido hostigamiento sicológico de manera repetitiva. Los cinco primeros motivos de queja son las declaraciones y gestos ofensivos, el perjuicio de las condiciones de trabajo, la amenaza de despido, inducir la persona al fracaso y el aislamiento. Mas aún, son generalmente los directivos que son designados como personas acusadas. A la luz de estos resultados, es importante que las organizaciones se doten de sistemas de vigilancia para detectar los casos y que se procuren útiles de gestión capaces de frenar las situaciones que comportan un potencial de hostigamiento sicológico...|$|E
40|$|The {{developing}} advertisement {{business is}} one indicator if the highly increased company’s need of marketing acrivity. Direct promotion is one vastly used marketing strategy, whereas sales promotion girls (SPG) are {{sent by the}} advertisement company, to promote the consumers, a particular product. SPG are {{used to create a}} certain image on the supplied particular product to attract the consumers. In order to make an excellent promotion, job involved SPG who comprehend the working aspects are necessary. On the other hand, the company {{should be aware of the}} SPG’s needs to increase their job involvement. This excellent promotion will not work if the organizational stressor factor, such as sexual <b>harassment,</b> appears <b>at</b> <b>work</b> place. To obtain a high SPG’s job involvement, it is necessary to be aware of their attitude towards sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> the <b>work</b> place. This research presents the attitude toward sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> place as independent variable and job involvement as dependent variable. Registered SPG from TIGASISI SPG agency adv. are used as population. Sampling technique used is total sampling, whereas 50 people involved. The validity test is conducted through Karl Pearson’s product moment correlation procedure. The result shows that there’s a negative significant correlation on SPG’s attitude towards sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> place and their job involvement. Correlation coefficient value is (r) = 0, 579 while error probability (p) = 0, 000. This concluded that employees with negative attitude toward sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> place have high job involvement and so is the opposite. The attitude towards sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> place effectively contributes to job involvement as much as 33, 5 %, while the rest of 66, 5 % is from other variables haven’t yet researched...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the European Community Strategy 2007 - 2012 on health and safety <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is working towards prevention of <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> which suggests that <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is a widespread problem. The UK current law presents a complicated and disparate picture, one that is little help to victims of harassment. As a rule harassment should be related to a particular ground of discrimination recognised by law. A victim who wishes to bring a claim for <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> should demonstrate that he or she has been harassed because of his/her, race, sex, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief, or age. Often therefore victims tend to avoid legal action, worried that disclosure could lead to victimisation. When they do though, they are often in a weaker position than their employer. In order to avoid bad publicity organisations tend ‘to believe’ harassers equipping themselves with defences and qualified lawyers. It is ultimately for tribunals or courts to establish whether particular conduct amounts to harassment and has a detrimental effect on the victim. Not surprising that in many cases courts decide in favour of organisations against employees. The objectives of the paper are as follows: •Consider the current UK legal provisions relating to <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and particular problems in applying law into practice •Discuss strengths and weaknesses of the law and its practical application...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{relationships}} among low back pain (LBP), inadequate physical activity, and sleep deficiency among patient care workers, and of these outcomes to work context. MethodsA cross-sectional survey of patient care workers (N= 1572, response rate= 79 %). Results 53 % reported LBP, 46 %, inadequate physical activity, and 59 %, sleep deficiency. Inadequate physical activity and sleep deficiency were associated (p= 0. 02), but LBP was not significantly related to either. Increased risk of LBP {{was significantly related to}} job demands, <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> decreased supervisor support, and job title. Inadequate physical activity was significantly associated with low decision latitude. Sleep deficiency was significantly related to low supervisor support, <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> low ergonomic practices, people-oriented culture, and job title.

40|$|Après avoir défini ce qu'il faut entendre par harcèlement sexuel au travail, les auteurs proposent une grille d'identification {{permettant}} de classifier selon la forme et le degré les différents comportements qui caractérisent le harcèlement sexuel au travail. The {{first part of}} this study investigated the different definitions of sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The authors also proposed a theoretical and operational definition of this complex concept. The second part of the study suggested an operational framework integrating not only the different forms but also the degrees under which this phenomenon materialised. A review of the literature identified two dominant trends: the legalistic school with a mainly descriptive definition and the feminist school more interested in the balance of power between men and women. It is this notion of power and the resulting abuses that should in effect predominate in a definition of sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Nevertheless, the feminist analysis alone cannot define the total phenomenon even though the most common relationship is that of a woman-harassee and a manharasser. A subsequent analysis of power in the workplace brings out the constant presence of an hierarchy which vests superiors with many prerogatives. This internal social structure in any enterprise potentially leads to abuses of power. Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> may therefore be categorized as one of the dimensions of <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> the sexual dimension encompassing the relation of power between men and women found at the heart of feminist analysis. This analysis adds to the notion of hierarchical power, that of social domination of women by men, particularly in sexual matters. Women are thus discriminated against since they are not considered solely as workers but also as sexual females having to be subjected to male advances. Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> may thus be defined as follows: a behaviour of a sexual connotation as a manifestation of power making a person a sexual object in his/her workplace. The operational definition must take into account three important dimensions: power (operative in function of the degree of the behaviour reached: annoyance, coercion or assault), sexuality (three forms of behaviour: non verbal, verbal or physical) and the workplace (the harasser having a tie to the workplace of the harassee though the harassment mayor may not occur in the workplace). The literature retains two elements essential to an operational definition: the notion of non-consent or non-reciprocity (clearly indicated by the degree of the behaviour) and that of repeatedness. This last element must be qualified, as legal experts and theorists have done, in function of various criteria. For example, as regards the degree of behaviour, it is obvious that an assault {{does not have to be}} repeated «in order to determine correctly its nature». Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> may therefore be defined operationally as being any behaviour of sexual connotation, generally repetitive, non-reciprocal, with the object or the effect of annoying or coercing a worker to do something that he/she would not otherwise do. In order to present an operational framework enabling systematic research on the presence of such behaviour, it is possible to situate each type of behaviour in function of the form and the degree reached, and this is what is show in Table 2. This exercice in definition provides for the study of the characteristics of the problem as experienced in a firm or in the whole of society. It also situates very well sexual harassment within the framework of relations of power stemming from the structure of workplaces to which is added the balance of power between men and women in all spheres of society, the workplace included. Because women are in the workplace to stay and to take their place against all odds amongst which sexual harassment, it is obvious that changes in perceptions and attitudes are expected of men...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{illustrate}} how, within the nursing profession, work ability can be deteriorated by a job alienation mechanism which acts differently according to age. From the total number of nurses participating in the NEXT Study, a sample of 27, 146 nurses was selected. In addition to age, “Job demands”, “Job control” and “Harassment at work” were considered as determinants of job alienation. “Overcommitment”, “Uncertainty about patients' treatment” and “Work meaning” were used as symptoms of job alienation. Finally, “Work Ability Index” (WAI) was employed as the outcome variable. A structural equation model was used to test the job alienation hypothesis. The model demonstrated a good fit with the data. Overcommitment, uncertainty about patients' treatment and work meaning had a direct effect on WAI. High job demands, high <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> low job control and age had both direct and indirect effects (via overcommitment, uncertainty about patients' treatment and work meaning) on WAI. Low work ability in older nurses is due to ageing and to an increase in overcommitment yielded by perceived high demands, low job control and high <b>harassment</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> On the contrary, among the nurses under 50 years old, decrease of WAI turned out to be more associated with higher uncertainty about patients' treatment and lower work meaning, which both affect the possibility to reach more professional competence and develop occupational expertise...|$|R
