40|$|In this Highlight, {{the impact}} of {{metering}} of electric tube wells on groundwater use in West Bengal, India was quantified. Quantification of impact was made feasible through surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 and then again a follow-up survey in 2010 by revisiting the same villages and households. Difference in difference framework was used to quantify the impact. The major {{result is that the}} expected impact on reducing <b>pumping</b> <b>hours</b> was felt only in the boro season. There is also some evidence that this decrease was not confined to irrigation on own-farm, but that water sales and purchases were also adversely affected as a consequence. Yet the metering did not influence either cropping patterns, or the output of boro paddy. The latter could well be explained by over use of water among those who irrigate their own farms, so that reductions in water use do not translate into decreased output. These impacts have to be seen against the backdrop of an overall decline in <b>pumping</b> <b>hours</b> that was seen in both control and treatment groups, which may have served to swamp {{the impact of}} the metering...|$|E
40|$|Application of crop {{simulation}} models at larger spatial scales is very essential to develop {{best management practices}} {{in order to maximize}} yields and reduce environmental pollution. In the present study, spatial analysis of long- term simulations were carried out with DSSAT spatial analysis tool linked with GIS to estimate irrigation requirements and nitrate leaching under alternate rice establishment methods in the Wargal watershed, Andhra Pradesh, India. Rice yields were compared among three management scenarios: rainfed, aerobic and flooded systems. Grain yield, seasonal water balance components, nitrate leaching and water use efficiency were calculated, visualized and mapped with GIS. The rice productivity increased by 22 % and 27 % under aerobic and flooded management compared to rainfed rice. The adoption of new water efficient aerobic rice cultivation in the watershed resulted in 36 % water saving with a relatively small yield reduction of 4 %, thus increasing the water productivity to 0. 77 g kg- 1 in aerobic compared to 0. 56 g kg- 1 in flooded rice. The aerobic rice method reduced the overall water <b>pumping</b> <b>hours</b> to 88 h ha- 1 during rice crop season compared to 299 h ha- 1 with flooded rice cultivation, resulting in 71 % energy savings...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the upper}} part of the Central Plain of Thailand which covers about 38, 000 km 2, due to the {{government}} price-subsidized policy, farmers tend to grow rice more often now, resulting in a high demand for irrigation water, with the latter being drafted increasingly from groundwater resources. This has not only put pressure on the regional aquifers but, owing to river-groundwater interactions, also on the surface waters in the region. As part of a major national effort, conjunctive water use pat-terns are to be explored to optimise the water resources in the upper Central Plain for the various stake-holders involved. In the present study, conjunctive use pattern of surface- as well as groundwater are investigated by field surveys and groundwater flow modelling, using the MODFLOW model. The groundwater model of the upper Central Plain is developed to simulate the groundwater movement over the last 10 years, before an investigation of the groundwater use was conducted. The latter can be categorized into three main types, namely, industrial, domestic and agricultural. Groundwater use pat-terns were considered for different seasons (wet and dry) and different water availability situations. A pilot area in the study area was selected to investigate the actual water use patterns, farmers ’ irriga-tion behaviour and constraints; i. e. harvest terms, groundwater <b>pumping</b> <b>hours,</b> pumping ability, etc. The conjunctive patterns vary significantly in response to the water availability situation, such that th...|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{case study}} of Rajsamadhiyala {{watershed}} in the semi-arid tropical area of Gujarat in India revealed that rainwater harvesting through watershed management doubled the production of groundnut and other major crops, increased cropping intensity by 32 % in eight years. With improved groundwater availability diversification with high-value crops like cumin, vegetables and fruits was observed. Food, fodder, fuel sufficiency substantially improved along with the increased incomes, literacy and social development. Substantial investment of 16. 25 million rupees [US$ 0. 36 million) in rainwater harvesting in one village created storage capacity to harvest 16 % of mean annual rainfall of 503 mm which is equivalent to 100 % of potential runoff during a normal year. Considering percolation seepage and evaporation losses 40 % of annual mean rainfall could be harvested and stored. However, because of geological formation in the Deccan plateau where soils are formed over a layer of weathered trap laid on hard rock during normal rainfall years, these structures overflow 2 - 3 times in the rainy season. Downstream villages Aniyala and Kasturba Dham benefited in terms of increased groundwater availability, reduced siltation and flooding through the base flow seepage water and excess runoff. Detailed studies in two downstream villages showed increased productivity, however, by 25 - 30 %, improved groundwater availability by 25 %, and reduced distressed migration. Dedicated leadership helped the villagers to chalkout the path to prosperity. Vast potential to increase productivity by 80 - 90 % remains to be harnessed through adoption of increased water use efficiency measures, as most benefits are due to increased water availability only. However, looking at the trends of over-exploitation of groundwater by doubling the number of borewells and <b>pumping</b> <b>hours</b> call for urgent steps to develop suitable social/legal mechanisms for sustainable use of water resources through integrated water resource management.

40|$|Water {{is needed}} for all forms of human {{development}} and is equally essential to most major industries. Most water today is transported by gravity. However, a growing volume is being conveyed through pumped pipeline systems that are consuming staggering amounts of electricity. Additionally, the cost of electricity is rising in most countries, increasing the cost of operations for municipalities and utilities that operate these water networks. There is significant need to review existing pumped pipeline systems to identify pipelines improvements {{that can be made}} to improve energy efficiency. These pipelines can be improved by hydraulic or operational changes to increase their operational efficiency. Decreased energy use will lower operating costs and reduce the environmental effects of electrical production. A pipeline improvement selection and prioritization (PISP) system was developed to evaluate a group of pipelines, determine the appropriate improvement option(s) for each, and prioritize the order in which the improvements should be implemented. The PISP system models hydraulic degradation and energy cost escalation to determine the baseline operating cost of the system over a long term (20 year) analysis period. The system then models the effect of five selected hydraulic improvements (foam swabbing, rigid pigging, intensive cleaning and scraping, rehabilitation, and total replacement) and eight operational improvements (eight different scenarios of limiting and altering the <b>pumping</b> <b>hours</b> to selected time periods) to determine the potential cost savings over the analysis period and the pipelines with the greatest savings are prioritized. The operational and hydraulic characteristics of the prioritized pipelines are then field tested to verify the results of the analysis and make a final recommendation for pipeline system improvements. The PISP system was applied to analyse nine selected pipelines from the City of Tshwane’s bulk water system. • The preliminary evaluation prioritized three pipelines that were in relatively poor hydraulic condition, and three pipelines that were likely to see significant cost savings from operational changes. • The economic evaluation found a potential savings of approximately R 100 million for the analyzed pipelines over the twenty year analysis period. • It also determined that the Roodeplaat Raw Water Pipeline – supplying water to the Roodeplaat WTP – and the Roodeplaat to Montana Pipeline – conveying water from the Roodeplaat WTP to the Montana Reservoir – would have the greatest potential cost savings. • The final results suggest that utilizing pump scheduling a 12 - 15 % reduction in yearly electrical cost can be achieved through operational improvements with minimal capital investment. With the addition of a reservoir upstream of the WTP and the expansion of the WTP’s clear water reservoir, the cost savings could be increased to the approximately 25 %. • No hydraulic improvements to either pipeline resulted in a long term cost savings for the twenty year analysis period. However, a general inspection found two unnecessary strainers, the removal of which would result in an additional savings of an estimated R 100 000 a year. The development of the PISP system highlighted the need to include potential additional reservoir storage to optimize pump system operation. The additional storage allows for the pumps to be operated only when the electrical cost is lowest. Building on these results is an important step in developing a complete system for optimal pumped pipeline operation.

40|$|Continued {{progress}} in water resources {{development in the}} future will depend upon the utilization of the existing irrigation potential. An irrigation tank is a small reservoir to catch and store water during rainy season and use it for irrigation during dry season. They recharge groundwater, which is not only a major source of drinking water for numerous rural and urban communities, but also serve as a supplementary source for tank water. Due to the loss in tank storage capacities, wells have become an important source of supplementary water. Since farmers initially use tank water for cultivation, the risk associated with getting adequate water, especially late in the season, has encouraged farmers to use wells for supplemental irrigation particularly later in the crop season. Since only a few farmers in the tank command area own wells, and there is a growing demand for well water, the well owners in most cases act like local monopolists. The study was undertaken with the objective to study the water market in the two districts of Tamil Nadu viz., Sivagangai and Coimbatore. Inverse demand function, Output function and Cost function were used to study the monopolistic behavior of water market. The profit maximizing levels of well yield, price of water and <b>hours</b> of <b>pumping</b> are 4. 6 meters, Rs 10 and 8. 6 hours, respectively. Well owners maximize profits from water sales when the water level in the well is at about five meters and the price of <b>pumping</b> <b>hour</b> is Rs. 10 and this correspond to about nine <b>hours</b> of <b>pumping</b> per day from the well.

The purpose is to select an optimum direct coupling Photovoltaic Pumping System (PVPS) configuration suitable to provide the maximum daily average quantity of water to satisfy the need of a remote farms consumption, situated in Hassi-Gara region, about 110 km south of Ghardaia, where the borehole and well heads vary from 10 m until 40 m. Photovoltaic (PV) powered by different selected PV arrays, based on PV Isofoton (110 / 24) modules, the two mentioned DC pumps were put into tests for different heads, at our PV pumping test facility, under winter outdoor conditions of Ghardaia site. Through the study and the interpretation of the obtained performances data, including the daily cumulative water and the overall efficiency of each selected (PVPS) configuration, two different direct coupling (PVPS) configurations have been selected to be eventually installed: The first (PVPS) configuration consists of the Water Max A 64 (300 W) submersible DC pump, PV powered by the PV array which consists of (2 X 2) Isofoton PV modules, is suitable to meet the need of an average daily water volume ranges from 6 m 3 until 8 m 3, however the second (PVPS) configuration which comprises the Shurflo (130 W) submersible DC pump, PV powered by the (2 x 1) Isofoton (110 / 24) PV modules can meet the need of the medium average daily water discharge less than 4 m 3.
