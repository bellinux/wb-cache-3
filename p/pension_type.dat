We then develop a methodology to draw a large dataset from the CSWL that is much more representative of the retired population in terms of <b>pension</b> <b>type,</b> gender and age. This procedure also makes it possible for users to choose between goodness of fit and subsample size. In order to illustrate the practical significance of our methodology, the paper also contains an application in which we generate a large subsample distribution from the 2010 CSWL.

40|$|In {{the last}} thirty years there has been a {{considerable}} change in the way people save for retirement. The once traditional defined benefit plans are steadily being replaced by now dominant defined contribution plans. This shift in the type of pensions offered to the worker, can potentially affect job choice and savings decisions. By examining the trade-off that workers face when choosing between compensation in the form of wages versus pension contributions, this paper explores the behavioral effects resulting from changes in the workers ’ environment and the potential impact of policy interventions. I formulate a lifecycle model, in which individuals search for jobs, consume, save on their own and through their employer-provided pension, so as to maximize utility. Job offers are wage-pension packages, consisting of a total compensation component, and a pension plan, which could be defined benefit, defined contribution or neither. Each worker’s job acceptance and rejection decisions is the result of interplay between his preferences and the set of different incentives and risks that each pension plan comes with. The structural model is simulated and will later be estimated using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The estimates of the structural parameters can be used to address a set of policy question such as: How does the shift in <b>pension</b> <b>type</b> coverage impact wage growth and job-to-job transitions? Which compensation packages lead to higher retirement savings...|$|E

The importance of such discretionary participation and savings responses is accentuated by both the presence of DC pensions, and, presumably, learning that such pensions can be used to stabilize finances prior to retirement. Besides the impact of the overall economic climate, individual, family level events and cash flow changes are expected {{to play a role in}} the decision to add to or withdraw from a DC pension plan. Preliminary studies suggest that the savings response by households to recent economic uncertainties during 2009 - 2011, was greater overall savings and an increase in liquid asset holding, a result consistent with classic predictions of a response to economic turmoil.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} participants' age distribution on the asset allocation of Dutch pension funds, using a unique data set of pension fund investment plans for 2007. Theory predicts a negative effect of age on (strategic) equity exposures. We observe that pension funds do indeed take {{the average age of}} their participants into account. However, the average age of active participants has been incorporated much more strongly in investment behaviour than the average ages of retired or dormant participants. This suggests that both employers and employees, who dominate pension fund boards, tend to show more interest in active participants. A one-year higher average age in active participants leads to a significant and robust reduction in the strategic equity exposure by around 0. 5 percentage point. Larger pension funds show a stronger age-equity exposure effect than smaller pension funds. This age-dependent asset allocation of pension funds aligns with the original life-cycle model by which young workers should invest more in equity than older workers because of their larger human capital. Other factors, viz. fund size, funding ratio, and average pension wealth of participants, influence equity exposure positively and significantly, in line with theory. <b>Pension</b> plan <b>type</b> and <b>pension</b> fund <b>type</b> have no significant impact.

Using {{a variation in the}} household composition- having a pensioner in the household- as an instrument, we show that Chileans with more knowledge about the pension system {{are more likely to have}} additional financial savings, but not within the voluntary pension saving plans offered by the pension system. We find that getting one additional answer right in the pension literacy survey (out of six) generates approximately a 50 % additional chance that the individual will save at least in one of the surveyed periods, and a 25 % percent additional chance that the individual will save in both surveyed periods. We also test for evidence that pension literacy affects worker choices regarding their pension savings (what we call financial gymnastics). We find that more literate workers are more likely to engage in <b>pension</b> fund <b>type</b> switching and that independent workers are more likely to voluntarily enter the pension system as affiliates if they have more pension finance literacy.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an empirical typology of pension {{regimes in the}} European Union, the US, Canada, Australia and Norway. The categorisation is based on 34 quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the mandatory parts of the pension systems in these countries. The empirical analysis shows that Esping-Andersen’s classical distinction between liberal, corporatist and social-democratic welfare regime types does not entirely hold {{in the case of}} pension systems. The empirical traits of the various pension systems can be summarised on two main dimensions: the general level of pension provision and the existence of private schemes within the mandatory part of the pension system. On these dimensions four clusters of countries, or <b>pension</b> regime <b>types,</b> have been identified empirically. Two of those are as one would theoretically expect: the corporatist group has rather high earnings-related pension benefits, while the liberal <b>pension</b> regime <b>type</b> provides a more basic, means-tested pension. However, two other clusters are not in line with the standard classification of welfare regimes. In the ‘moderate pensions’ cluster, the level of pension provision is lower than in the corporatist countries, but it surpasses the standards attained by countries with a liberal pension regime. In countries belonging to the ‘mandatory private’ cluster, the government obliges employees to participate in private pension schemes, which are generally funded and based on defined contributions. The pension level in this group is moderate or high...|$|R

The analysis suggests the discrepancies are sizable and are mainly due to misreports by respondents. Discrepancies between respondent and firm reports of plan type are first documented for different years and from different data sources. Changes over time in respondent and firm reports are analyzed for those who say their plans did not change. Plan type from payroll data produced by Watson Wyatt, a pension consulting company, is examined and compared to respondent reports for employees covered by Watson Wyatt plans. The Watson Wyatt payroll data report plan type without error, and yet we find the patterns of discrepancies between respondent and firm provided data {{are the same as}} for the HRS employer and respondent data. We also explore other evidence gathered by the HRS in the course of interviews and various experiments. Our findings that errors are mainly the result of misreporting by respondents, together with findings from experiments, suggest a number of changes in survey design that can help to reduce reporting error. They also suggest that models of retirement and saving behavior should allow for imperfect knowledge by decision makers. ...|$|R
