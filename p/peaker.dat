Box 800, NL– 9700 AV Groningen In {{this paper}} I {{discuss the issue}} of the {{so-called}} 25 µm–peakers, which were discovered with IRAS, and consist almost solely of broad-line radio galaxies. I find that this peak is caused by the absence of colder dust that emits at 60 µm and not by an excess of hot dust, as suggested by the name. On optical images, the 25 µm <b>peakers</b> show a lack of extended dust. The <b>peakers</b> are consistent with being in a later evolutionary stage, in which all the extended dust has been formed into stars and the dust torus is smaller. If the 60 µm dust is heated by stars, there might be a correlation between the star-formation rate {{and the power of the}} AGN...|$|R

50|$|A <b>peaker</b> plant may operate {{many hours}} a day, {{or it may}} operate {{only a few hours}} per year, {{depending}} on the condition of the region's electrical grid. Because of the cost of building an efficient power plant, if a <b>peaker</b> plant is only going to be run for a short or highly variable time it does not make economic sense to make it as efficient as a base load power plant. In addition, the equipment and fuels used in base load plants are often unsuitable for use in <b>peaker</b> plants because the fluctuating conditions would severely strain the equipment. For these reasons, nuclear, geothermal, waste-to-energy, coal and biomass are rarely, if ever, operated as <b>peaker</b> plants.|$|E

30|$|Environmental {{benefits}} {{are provided by}} enabling power utilities to avoid the use of peaking power plants or “peakers”. <b>Peakers</b> typically have higher greenhouse gas emissions. However, most important environmental benefits can be achieved via a large-scale integration of renewable resources such as wind and solar. Because demand response {{can act as a}} form of energy storage, it can facilitate in managing periods of excessive generation through the provision of load-following and regulation services that can both increase or decrease demand.|$|R
50|$|This {{relationship}} is not straightforward; for instance, an LDC may buy {{large amounts of}} base load power from a nuclear plant at a low fixed cost and then buy peaking power only as required from natural gas <b>peakers</b> {{at a much higher}} cost, perhaps five to six times. Depending on their billing policy, this might be billed to the customer at a flat rate combining the two rates the LDC pays, or alternately based on a time-based pricing policy that tries to more closely match input costs with customer prices.|$|R
40|$|Aims: The ``bright'' High Frequency <b>Peakers</b> (HFPs) {{sample is}} a mixture of blazars and {{intrinsically}} small and young radio sources. We investigate the polarimetric characteristics of 45 High Frequency <b>Peakers,</b> from the ``bright'' HFP sample, {{in order to have a}} deeper knowledge of the nature of each object, and to construct a sample made of genuine young radio sources only. Methods: Simultaneous VLA observations carried out at 22. 2, 15. 3, 8. 4 and 5. 0 GHz, together with the information at 1. 4 GHz provided by the NVSS at an earlier epoch, have been used to study the linearly polarized emission. Results: From the analysis of the polarimetric properties of the 45 sources we find that 26 (58 %) are polarized at least at one frequency, while 17 (38 %) are completely unpolarized at all frequencies. We find a correlation between fractional polarization and the total intensity variability. We confirm that there is a clear distinction between the polarization properties of galaxies and quasars: 17 (66 %) quasars are highly polarized, while all the 9 galaxies are either unpolarized (< 0. 2 %) or marginally polarized with fractional polarization below 1 %. This suggests that most HFP candidates identified with quasars are likely to represent a radio source population different from young radio objects.

40|$|Abstract. Here {{we present}} a sample of sources with convex radio spectra peaking at {{frequencies}} above a few GHz. We call these radio sources High Frequency <b>Peakers</b> (HFPs). This sample extends to higher turnover frequencies than the samples of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) and GHz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio sources. HFPs are rare due to the strong bias against them caused by their turnover occurring at frequencies about one order of magnitude higher than in CSS-GPS samples. The sample has been selected by a comparison between the Green Bank survey (87 GB) at 4. 9 GHz and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) at 1. 4 GHz. Then the candidates have bee...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on electrical energy storage (EES) is technical and complex which this paper aims to simplify. It quantifies the current scale, costs {{and value of}} different types of EES and compares them to peaking generators and interconnectors. Worldwide, dams have 2, 700 times the storage capacity of pumped storage, which accounts for 99 % of conventional EES, batteries making up the rest. Indirect use of hydro power, and in future, electric vehicles, adds to their value and if accessible at reasonable cost, would be cheaper than conventional EES. EES, <b>peakers</b> and DC interconnectors can offer flexibility services which considerably enhance their value, but hopes of a battery revolution enabling a smarter electricity system should not be exaggerated...|$|R

40|$|Non-pumped hydroelectricity-based {{energy storage}} in New Zealand has only limited {{potential}} to expand to meet projected growth in electricity demand. Seasonal variations of hydro inflows have {{also led to}} several 'dry-year' events {{over the last decade}} and dedicated fast-start 'peaker' capacity may also be required to support wind power as it approaches a 20 % generation share. In this research, the New Zealand electricity industry has been surveyed in regard to the feasibility of reducing CO 2 -e emissions through the introduction of pumped hydroelectricity and utility-scale batteries by 2025. A desk-based review of the economic costs of these technologies has also been performed and their drivers and barriers critically assessed. Most respondents to the survey projected that peak power demand will continue to increase and this will result in new-build centralised (~ 150 MW) thermal reserve power sources. In New Zealand, the costs of pumped hydro and batteries are seen to be prohibitive to their introduction, even though they are almost universally assumed to be technically capable of providing renewables support and peak power adequacy. The perception of the poor economic viability of pumped hydro may, in part, be due to the relatively high capital cost estimate associated with the Manorburn-Onslow proposal (~NZ$ 3 billion). This research has shown, however, that smaller, 'more-internationally-representative' pumped hydro schemes, if available in NZ with low associated environmental impact, are cost-competitive with thermal <b>peakers,</b> especially diesel <b>peakers.</b> Conversely, utility-scale batteries have very high storage costs per kWh and {{are most likely to be}} used only for very high value applications where there is a strong technical advantage, such as the six-second fast instantaneous reserve...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Under regulation, operating-reserve {{policy and}} {{investment}} policy are completely separate. In a market, they are tightly linked through expectations. Currently, regulators and engineers intervene in markets {{to determine how}} much will be paid when operating reserves are in short supply. These prices determine the revenue stream that pays the capital costs of new <b>peakers</b> and pays an equal amount toward the capital costs of all other generators. In this way, operating-reserve and price-cap policies determine investment in generation and the equilibrium level of installed capacity. Typically, FERC determines a price limit, and engineers, by setting an operating-reserve requirement, determine the expected duration of price spikes. Currently, these policies are set without coordination and without analysis of the long-run consequences.
