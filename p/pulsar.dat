5|$|In early 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two planets orbiting the <b>pulsar</b> PSR 1257+12. This discovery was confirmed, and is {{generally considered to be}} the first definitive detection of exoplanets. These <b>pulsar</b> planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the <b>pulsar,</b> in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of giant planets that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.|$|E
5|$|PSR B1534+11 is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of two neutron stars orbiting each other, {{one of which is}} a <b>pulsar</b> with a period of 37.9 milliseconds. Situated approximately 1000 parsecs distant, the system was used to test Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, validating the system's relativistic parameters to within 0.2% of values predicted by the theory. The X-ray emission from the system {{has been found to be}} present when the non-pulsar star intersects the equatorial <b>pulsar</b> wind of the <b>pulsar,</b> and the system's orbit has been found to vary slightly.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first <b>pulsar</b> in a globular cluster in 1986—a millisecond <b>pulsar</b> in the Messier 28 globular cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double <b>pulsar,</b> PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the general theory of relativity is accurate to 99.5%.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pulsars,</b> {{a type of}} neutron star, are {{examples}} of radio stars. [...] Rotation-powered <b>pulsars</b> are, as the name suggests, powered by the slow-down of their rotation. The rotation powers a magnetic field, which generates the radio emissions. Not all rotation-powered <b>pulsars</b> generate their pulses in the radio spectrum. Some of them, from the millisecond <b>pulsars,</b> generate X-rays instead. Aside from radio <b>pulsars</b> and X-ray <b>pulsars,</b> there are also gamma ray <b>pulsars,</b> which are mostly magnetars. Some radio <b>pulsars</b> are also optical <b>pulsars.</b>|$|R

40|$|We report {{surveyed}} {{regions and}} flux limits for several large-area surveys at 430 MHz for radio <b>pulsars</b> using the 305 m reflector at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The surveys used integration times between 8 and 67 s and covered a total area of ~ 515 square degrees. No previously undiscovered <b>pulsars</b> were detected in these regions, although all previously known <b>pulsars</b> were detected.

5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a <b>pulsar</b> can be very rapid. The <b>pulsar</b> {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the <b>pulsar</b> will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E
5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the <b>pulsar).</b> In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary <b>pulsar,</b> determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the <b>pulsar</b> and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The first {{observation}} of {{a decrease in}} orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by Hulse and Taylor, using the binary <b>pulsar</b> PSR1913+16 they had discovered in 1974. This was the first detection of gravitational waves, albeit indirect, {{for which they were}} awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. Since then, several other binary pulsars have been found, in particular the double <b>pulsar</b> PSR J0737-3039, in which both stars are pulsars.|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of millisecond pulsations from neutron stars in low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems has substantiated the theoretical prediction that links millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> (MSRPs) and LMXBs. Since then, {{the process that}} produces millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> from LMXBs, followed by spin-down due to dipole radiation has been conceived as the 'standard evolution' of millisecond <b>pulsars.</b> However, the question whether all the observed millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> could be produced by LMXBs has not been quantitatively addressed until now. The standard evolutionary process produces millisecond <b>pulsars</b> with periods (P) and spin-down rates (Pdot) that are not entirely independent. The possible P-Pdot values that millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> can attain are jointly constrained. In order to test whether the observed millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> are the unequivocal descendants of millisecond X-ray <b>pulsars</b> (MSXP), we have produced a probability map that represents the expected distribution of millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> for the standard model. We show with more than 95 % confidence that the fastest spinning millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> with high magnetic fields, e. g. PSR B 1937 + 21, cannot be produced by the observed millisecond X-ray <b>pulsars</b> {{within the framework of}} the standard model.

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary <b>pulsar,</b> a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the <b>pulsar,</b> observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the <b>pulsar</b> PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus <b>Pulsar,</b> has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible {{in the night sky}} for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E
5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other <b>pulsar</b> known to produce giant pulses was the Crab <b>pulsar,</b> and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the <b>pulsar,</b> lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond <b>pulsar.</b> In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E
50|$|These accreting {{millisecond}} X-ray <b>pulsars</b> {{are thought}} to be the evolutionary progenitors of recycled radio millisecond <b>pulsars.</b> A total of thirteen accreting millisecond X-ray <b>pulsars</b> have been discovered as of January 2011. Three of them are Intermittent millisecond X-ray <b>pulsars</b> (HETE J1900.1-2455, Aql X-1 and SAX J1748.9-2021), i.e. they emit pulsations sporadically during the outburst.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the number of}} {{millisecond}} radio <b>pulsars,</b> in globular clusters, should be larger than 100, applying the standard scenario that all the <b>pulsars</b> descend from low-mass X-ray binaries. Moreover, most of the <b>pulsars</b> are located in a small number of clusters. The prediction that Teran 5 and Liller 1 contain at least about a dozen millisecond radio <b>pulsars</b> each is made.

40|$|Pushed by the accumulating {{observations}} of radio <b>pulsars</b> and accreting neutron stars (NSs), extensive {{studies have been}} performed to understand the evolution of magnetic fields in neutron stars. The radio <b>pulsars</b> are generally categorized into two classes: young (< 107  yr) <b>pulsars</b> with the magnetic field strength B  1010 ~ 13 G, and the old millisecond radio <b>pulsars,</b> which have magnetic field strength as low as 108 ~ 9 G. While most radio <b>pulsars</b> are isolated objects, the millisecond <b>pulsars</b> are predominantly in binaries, suggesting that the magnetic fields decay with time, perhaps by an accretion of matter from the binary companion. For the isolated radio <b>pulsars,</b> it remains as an open question whether the NS magnetic fields do or do not decay with time. Recently, the discovery of magnetars...|$|R
5|$|However, {{they are}} not thought to be {{favorable}} locations {{for the survival of}} planetary systems. Planetary orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the perturbations of passing stars. A planet orbiting at 1 astronomical unit around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster such as 47 Tucanae would only survive on the order of 108 years. There is a planetary system orbiting a <b>pulsar</b> (PSR B1620−26) that belongs to the globular cluster M4, but these planets likely formed after the event that created the <b>pulsar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a <b>pulsar.</b> This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio <b>pulsar</b> too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are fewer}} records of {{supernova}} SN 1181, which {{occurred in the}} constellation Cassiopeia just over a century after SN 1054. It was noted by Chinese and Japanese astronomers, however. The <b>pulsar</b> 3C58 may be the stellar relic from this event.|$|E
5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of the <b>pulsar.</b> Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the <b>pulsar</b> are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the <b>pulsar</b> from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around the <b>pulsar.</b> The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the <b>pulsar,</b> but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E

40|$|Rotation-powered {{millisecond}} radio <b>pulsars</b> {{have been}} spun {{up to their}} present spin period by a $ 10 ^ 8 $ - $ 10 ^ 9 $ yr long X-ray-bright phase of accretion of matter and angular momentum in a low-to-intermediate mass binary system. Recently, the discovery of transitional <b>pulsars</b> that alternate cyclically between accretion and rotation-powered states on time scales {{of a few years}} or shorter, has demonstrated this evolutionary scenario. Here, we present a thorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classes of millisecond <b>pulsars</b> to assess the evolution of their spin period between the different stages. Accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively during thermonuclear type I X-ray bursts (nuclear-powered millisecond <b>pulsars)</b> are found to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accreting sources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accreting millisecond <b>pulsars)</b> are not. On the other hand, if accreting millisecond <b>pulsars</b> and eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond <b>pulsars</b> form a common class of transitional <b>pulsars,</b> these are shown to have a spin distribution intermediate between the faster nuclear-powered millisecond <b>pulsars</b> and the slower non-eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond <b>pulsars.</b> We interpret these findings in terms of a spin-down due to the decreasing mass-accretion rate during the latest stages of the accretion phase, {{and in terms of the}} different orbital evolutionary channels mapped by the various classes of <b>pulsars.</b> We summarize possible instrumental selection effects, showing that even if an unbiased sample of <b>pulsars</b> is still lacking, their influence on the results of the presented analysis is reduced by recent improvements in instrumentation and searching techniques.
