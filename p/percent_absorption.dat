5000|$|Considering the {{photothermal}} mechanism alone, the photoacoustic {{signal is}} useful in measuring the light absorption spectrum, particularly for transparent samples where the light absorption is very small. In this case the ordinary method of absorption spectroscopy, based on difference of the intensities of a light beam before and after its passage through the sample, is not practical. In photoacoustic spectroscopy {{there is no such}} limitation. the signal {{is directly related to the}} light absorption and the light intensity. Dividing the signal spectrum by the light intensity spectrum can give a relative <b>percent</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrum, which can be calibrated to yield absolute values. This is very useful to detect very small concentrations of various materials. Photoacoustic spectroscopy is also useful for the opposite case of opaque samples, where the absorption is essentially complete. In an arrangement where a sensor is placed in a gaseous phase above the sample and the light impinges the sample from above, the photoacoustic signal results from an absorption zone close to the surface. A typical parameter which governs the signal in this case is the [...] "thermal diffusion length", which depends on the material and the modulation frequency and ordinarily is in the order of several micrometers. The signal is related to the light absorbed in the small distance of the thermal diffusion length, allowing the determination of the absorption spectrum. This allows also to separately analyze a surface that is distinct from the bulk. By varying the modulation frequency and wavelength of the probing radiation one essentially varies the probed depth, which results in the possibility of depth profiling [...] and photoacoustic imaging, which discloses inhomogeneities within the sample. This analysis includes also the possibility to determine the thermal properties from the photoacoustic signal.|$|E

Iron overload was defined as the presence of stainable iron in more than 50 % of hepatocytes in a liver biopsy specimen. The percentages of patients with a true-positive (abnormal) or true-negative (normal) result were: serum iron concentration 65 %, transferin saturation 85 %, serum ferritin concentration 78 %, serum ferritin:serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) index 78 %, <b>percent</b> iron <b>absorption</b> 58 %, <b>percent</b> iron <b>absorption</b> in relation to serum ferritin concetration 80 % and <b>percent</b> iron <b>absorption</b> in relation to serum ferritin:SGOT index 93 %. The calculated predictive value of a normal test result for the exclusion of iron overload in patients with liver disease, a group with an assumed prevalence of iron overload of 10 %, was 98 % to 99 % for transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration used alone and 100 % for these measures used together; the predictive value of an abnormal result for the diagnosis of iron overload was less than 50 % for all of the above measures used alone or in combination. Hence, in patients with an increased serum ferritin concentration or transferrin saturation, or both, determination of the hepatocellular iron content of a specimen from a percutaneous liver biopsy is required for the diagnosis of iron overload...|$|R
40|$|A {{mixture of}} arsenic {{contaminated}} soil and reactive powder concrete (RPC) {{was developed to}} study the effect of arsenic contaminated soil on RPC mortar {{and the effectiveness of}} the mortar in containing the contaminant. The sufficient containment of arsenic contaminated waste products is important to protection of ground and surface water sources. A three phase experiment was designed to study the permeability, absorption coefficients, and Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) leachate concentrations resulting from the application of a range of arsenic concentrations. The results showed that the permeability values for mixes containing different arsenic concentrations did not increase noticeably with adequate curing time. The percentage of absorption slightly increased with increasing arsenic content as did the TCLP leachate concentrations. Statistical analyses, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Paired T-test, were performed to analyze <b>percent</b> <b>absorption,</b> and TCLP results.

30|$|The <b>percent</b> <b>absorption</b> of the dye by the {{different}} fabrics varied significantly, where both mordanted and unmordanted fabrics showed an efficient dye uptake by adopting different mordanting methods. Satisfactory results were also recorded in unmordanted samples; however, <b>percent</b> <b>absorption</b> of the mordanted fabrics recorded higher and efficient values with both Salix alba (wood ash) and Populus deltoides (wood ash) (Fig.  1 a, b). The highest {{value of the}} <b>percent</b> <b>absorption</b> was recorded with Populus deltoides (wood ash) mordant by the pashmina fabric adopting pre-mordanting method (Fig.  1 b). Pashmina fabric recorded the highest absorption results, including and excluding the mordants {{than all the other}} test fabrics. These results {{may be due to the}} presence of multifunctional groups in the protein polymer (-NH 2,-OH,-COOH) in the pashmina fabric which provides a bridge between the dye and the fabric, resulting efficient absorption than the other fabrics (Temani et al. 2011). The lowest values of the <b>percent</b> <b>absorption</b> was recorded by cotton fabric adopting pre-mordanting method using both Salix alba L. and Populus deltoides (wood ash) (Fig.  1 a, b). The cotton fabric does not show satisfactory results as compared to other test fabrics. Cotton fabric with least absorption values recorded highest value with Salix alba (wood ash) adopting pre-mordanting method, which may be due to weak coordination complexes formed between cellulosic polymer and dye molecules (Fig.  1 a). This low coordination tendency of cotton with the dyes and mordants may have resulted in low dye absorption. Tiwari et al. (2010) also reported lesser dye ability of cotton than that of the wool. In wool fabric, highest value of absorption was recorded with Populus deltoides (wood ash) adopting pre-mordanting method. The efficient absorption of the wool fabric is due to its fibre containing equal amount of amino and carboxyl groups which ionize and form zwitter ion. At low pH, the hydrogen ions are absorbed by carboxyl groups present in wool. At high pH, the protein looses hydrogen ions leaving behind ionized groups. Thus, wool and pashmina can absorb maximum dye in acidic medium (Mathur and Bhandari 2001). Silk fabric recorded the highest value with Populus deltoides adopting simultaneous mordanting; and mordanted samples showed better percent dye absorption than the unmordanted samples, thus confirming the best absorption results of the natural dyes when used in combination with natural mordants (Fig.  1 b). The variation in absorption by {{the different}} fabrics with each mordant, adopting different methods, may be due to the formation of the chemical bridge through the mordant that enhances the binding capacity of dye molecules to the fabric thus also prevents the bleeding and fading of colour (Prabhu and Bhute 2012).|$|E

Prior to Superpave, the Indiana Department of Transportation aggregate frictional requirements {{were based on}} average daily traffic volumes and were divided into low, medium, and high volume categories. With the implementation of Superpave in Indiana, aggregate frictional requirements were reassigned to categories based on equivalent single axle load values. The purpose of the research is to determine whether average daily traffic or equivalent single axle load has a greater effect on the frictional resistance of a hot-mix asphalt pavement, to confirm and update, if necessary, the current equivalent single axle load based breakpoints for aggregate frictional requirements, and to evaluate the effects of aggregate physical properties on frictional resistance. Statistical analyses were conducted on inventory skid data to observe the effects of average daily traffic and equivalent single axle loads. It was determined that average daily traffic may have a greater effect on frictional resistance than equivalent single axle load. Additional statistical {{analyses were conducted to}} verify categorical breakpoints which indicated that the former average daily traffic breakpoints are correct and that the upper bound equivalent single axle load breakpoint may need some modification. Aggregates were tested for acid insolubility, differential wear, and frictional resistance. Acid insolubility results and physical property data obtained from quality assurance files were correlated to aggregate frictional resistance. Collected quality assurance data included bulk specific gravity, <b>percent</b> <b>absorption,</b> percent loss from impact, and percent loss from brine freeze/thaw.

These films were evaluated for Thickness, Percent moisture loss, <b>Percent</b> moisture <b>absorption,</b> Drug content, Weight variation and folding endurance. In-vitro drug release kinetics was studied using Franz-diffusion cell. Drug release followed zero order kinetics. Drug loading at different concentrations found to have less effect on the film forming properties of the constituent polymers. Results have shown enhanced flux per unit time across rat skin. In conclusion combination of ethyl cellulose, poly vinyl alcohol, eudragit RL 100, eudragit L 100 and Di-n-butylphlthalate can potentially be optimized to develop an effective transdermal drug {{delivery system}} for metoprolol tartarat...|$|R
40|$|Kinds of the particleboards are {{produced}} in Iran. The products are different together {{with respect to}} some physical and mechanical criteria, also {{quality and quantity of}} the production is growing. Successful competition of the products will need to acknowledge criteria intensities of the products. There are five major criteria which have influence on particleboard products ranking, including, moisture percent; density; thickness swilling percent; water <b>absorption</b> <b>percent</b> and bending strength. Three levels of the criteria intensities have been evaluated: high (H), medium (M) and low (L). AHP and Expert Choice 2000 have been used to evaluate weighing values of particleboards criteria and their intensities with respect to manufacturer's aspects. The results indicated that density of the products and its high intensity has the highest priority...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{cellulosic}} {{materials as}} reinforcement in composites can greatly enhance their properties. The thrust {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of date palm seed particle on the properties of reinforced polyester. Unsaturated polyester resin was reinforced with date palm seed particles of 0. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 8 mm particle sizes using variable particle loadings of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 wt%. The composites obtained were subjected to various types of mechanical and physical tests in order to assess their performance. The optimum tensile strength of 16. 7619 N/mm 2 and elastic modulus of 343. 8 N/mm 2 were attained at 15 wt% and 10 wt% loading (using 0. 5 mm particles) respectively and <b>percent</b> water <b>absorption</b> was found to be least for 0. 5 mm particle size. The hardness was enhanced to the maximum of 74 HRF (Rockwell Hardness Factor) by 2 mm particle size at 25 wt% loading. Pure unsaturated polyester resin recorded tensile strength of 17. 5959 N/mm 2, elastic modulus of 316. 7 N/mm 2 and hardness of 33. 5 HRF. The results indicated that the use of date palm seed particles as reinforcement can enhance the properties of polyester composites...|$|R
