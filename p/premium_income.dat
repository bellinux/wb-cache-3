25|$|Global {{insurance}} premiums grew by 2.7% in inflation-adjusted terms in 2010 to $4.3 trillion, climbing above pre-crisis levels. The return to growth and record premiums generated {{during the year}} followed two years of decline in real terms. Life {{insurance premiums}} increased by 3.2% in 2010 and non-life premiums by 2.1%. While industrialised countries saw an increase in premiums of around 1.4%, insurance markets in emerging economies saw rapid expansion with 11% growth in <b>premium</b> <b>income.</b> The global insurance industry was sufficiently capitalised to withstand the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and most insurance companies restored their capital to pre-crisis levels {{by the end of}} 2010. With the continuation of the gradual recovery of the global economy, it is likely the insurance industry will continue to see growth in <b>premium</b> <b>income</b> both in industrialised countries and emerging markets in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Advanced economies {{account for}} the bulk of global insurance. With <b>premium</b> <b>income</b> of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most {{important}} region in 2010, followed by North America $1.409 trillion and Asia $1.161 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in <b>premium</b> <b>income</b> during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace. The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China. According to Sam Radwan of ENHANCE International LLC, low premium penetration (insurance premium as a % of GDP), an ageing population and the largest car market in terms of new sales, premium growth has averaged 15–20% in the past five years, and China {{is expected to be the}} largest insurance market in the next decade or two.|$|E
25|$|Tax rules {{recognize}} that {{some types of}} businesses do not earn income in the traditional manner and thus require special provisions. For example, insurance companies must ultimately pay claims to some policy holders from the amounts received as premiums. These claims may happen years after the premium payment. Computing the future amount of claims requires actuarial estimates until claims are actually paid. Thus, recognizing <b>premium</b> <b>income</b> as received and claims expenses as paid would seriously distort an insurance company's income.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out if the <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> from {{university}} entrance differs with respect to prior achievement as measured by previous grades. Using income at the age of 28 to 30, we analyze if high-achievers have larger <b>income</b> <b>premiums</b> from entering university than low-achievers in a sample of Swedish upper secondary school students. We find that income differences generally are positive, albeit larger for females than for males. It is also found that the <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> is larger for high-achievers than for low-achievers. However, especially for males, the <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> rises only marginally with prior achievement for a large part of the grade distribution, indicating that there are only small differences in the returns to university entrance for a majority of upper secondary school graduates.

50|$|Building on {{the success}} of its 2013 “Public Status” Mutual Fund, Castlestone {{unveiled}} its Equity High Yield & <b>Premium</b> <b>Income</b> Fund in March 2014. Designed to generate sustained growth in the long term, the Fund offers investor benefits such as transparency, liquidity, and no leverage. The Fund invests in stocks with dividend yields ranging from 4% to 6%, particularly consumer staples with noteworthy defensive attributes. The Fund generates <b>premium</b> <b>income</b> by writing covered calls, which limits potential downside in the event of equity market decline. At the time of the announcement, the Castlestone Equity High Yield & <b>Premium</b> <b>Income</b> Fund included semi-monopolistic assets with relatively inelastic demand. Early portfolio stocks include HSBC, AstraZeneca, and Sydney Airport. The Fund connects investors with a variety of high dividend yield and <b>premium</b> <b>income</b> strategies, many of which were offered by stable, large capitalisation companies. The Fund also represented a substitute for long-only developed market equity funds.|$|E

40|$|Mobility {{serves as}} an {{indicator}} of the relationship between short and long run inequality. Understanding mobility is crucial for deriving policies that affect household’s incomes. Since long run income is more equally distributed than short run income {{it is important to understand}} the mechanics of income mobility. In this paper we have used a unique household dataset spanning more than 3 decades from rural India to derive what may be broadly classified as the triggers of income mobility. We believe and wish to show that location and outcome of location place a crucial role in determining the magnitude of income mobility. Given that in low income countries migration is a significant cause for income mobility, we show that its magnitude is influenced by the relationship between <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> (benefits accruing to the household due to location) and migration. There is thus a three way relationship between <b>income</b> <b>premium,</b> migration and <b>income</b> mobility. We find that increases in household <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> will reduce the likely hood of a given household (members of that household migrating). Consequently we are more likely to observe a reduction in overall income mobility. A policy implication of this finding is that if development is not uniform across the economic space. Income mobility will decline in the long run...|$|R
30|$|In {{low income}} {{countries}} penalties for non-professional own-account workers vs. formal employees and for informal vs. formal employees are small. In {{middle income countries}} penalties for non-professional own-account workers vs. formal employees and for informal vs. formal employees are larger than in low income countries and are statistically different from zero. Penalties for non-professional own-account workers are largest and highly statistically significant in high income countries. Panels a and b in Fig.  2 further illustrate this pattern, presenting the distribution of self-employment earnings penalties and <b>premiums</b> by country <b>income</b> level. Most (but not all) low income countries exhibit a non-professional own-account earnings <b>premium,</b> middle <b>income</b> countries’ earnings differentials cluster around zero (although most are penalties), and almost all high income countries exhibit penalties for non-professional own-account workers.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the compound Poisson risk model with debit interest and dividend payments. The model {{assumes that the}} company is allowed to borrow at some debit interest rate when the surplus turns negative, and that the <b>premium</b> <b>incomes</b> are paid out as dividends to shareholders when the surplus reaches a horizontal barrier of level b. We first derive integro-differential equations for the expected discounted value of all dividends until absolute ruin, V b (u), which is twice continuously differentiable. In the case of exponential claim amounts, we obtain explicit expressions for V b (u) and the optimal barrier b * which maximizes V b (u). We then perform a similar study for the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function. Again, when claims are exponentially distributed, we are able to find explicit expressions for the joint distribution of the surplus just prior to absolute ruin and the deficit at absolute ruin, which is a special case of the Gerber-Shiu function. © 2008 Elsevier B.
