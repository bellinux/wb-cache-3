50|$|The car was {{equipped}} with advanced features, including <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> and <b>wheel</b> steering. The engine was mounted transversely, with the flywheel rotating {{in the direction of}} travel. The water-cooled engine drove the rear wheels through a belt transmission. The belt was tensioned by moving the engine forward or backward in the frame. The steering wheel was on a vertical column {{on the right side of}} the car, such that it could only be operated by the driver's right hand.|$|R
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the wheeled TMA, which {{incorporates}} T- 150 K tractor and KPG- 2 deep loosener-manurer, the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> of <b>wheeled</b> vehicles. The mathematical simulator of unsettled drift of pneumatic wheel {{with regard to}} the sliding on the bearing surface, the TMA simulator based on it to study the dynamic stability in the horizontal plane have been developed. The developed mathematical simulators allow to determine the dimensions of TMA members, which are rational from the standpoint of dynamic stability at the minimal body of experimental study. Four Inventor's Certificates have been obtained for the construction of test bed of tyres and for the devices to determine the tyre deformation. The techniques of experimental and computing determination of characteristics of tyre drift have been introduced in the Chelyabinsk and Kransnoyarsk Workses of Lorry Trailers and others.

50|$|Motorcycle {{wheels are}} made to cope with radial and axial forces. They also provide a way of {{mounting}} other critical components such as the brakes, final drive and suspension. Wheels, and anything directly connected to them, {{are considered to be}} unsprung mass. Traditionally motorcycles used spoked wheels with inner tubes and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres.</b> Although cast <b>wheels</b> were first used on a motorcycle in 1927, it would not be until the 1970s that mainstream manufacturers would start to introduce cast wheels on their roadgoing motorcycles. Spoked wheels are usually made with steel spokes and steel or aluminium rims. Cast wheels are predominantly made from aluminium or an alloy of, but can also be made from more exotic materials such as magnesium or carbon fibre.|$|R
50|$|John Boyd Dunlop {{developed}} the first practical <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> in 1887 in South Belfast.

50|$|John Boyd Dunlop (5 February 1840 - 23 October 1921) was a Scottish-born {{and educated}} {{inventor}} and veterinary surgeon who {{spent most of}} his career in Ireland.

He sold his rights to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> to a company he formed {{with the president of the}} Irish Cyclists' Association, Harvey Du Cros, for a small cash sum and a small shareholding in their <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> business. Dunlop withdrew in 1896. The company that bore his name, Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company, was not incorporated until later using the name well known to the public, but it was Du Cros's creation.|$|R

50|$|Pacific Dunlop has {{its roots}} in the Irish Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company, which {{established}} the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia in 1893, which included a local finishing factory and office in Melbourne to supply the market with bicycle tyres. In 1899 downturn in cycling's popularity and speculation from the parent company led to the sell-off of Dunlop's Australasian and North American operations, and the Dunlop <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> Company of Australasia was floated with 80,000 shares, costing £1 per share. The company was listed on Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide stock exchanges.|$|R

50|$|Dunlop {{developed}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> for his son's tricycle {{and soon}} had them made commercially in Scotland. A cyclist using his tyres began to win all races {{and drew the}} attention of Harvey Du Cros. Dunlop sold his rights into a new business with Du Cros for some cash and a small shareholding. With Du Cros he overcame many difficulties experienced by their business, including {{the loss of his}} patent rights. In 1892 he retired from his veterinary practice and moved to Dublin soon after Harvey Du Cros with his assistance successfully refloated Booth Bros of Dublin as the <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tyre</b> and Booth's Cycle Agency. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> revolutionised the bicycle industry, which had boomed after the 1885 introduction of J K Starley's safety bicycle.|$|R
