5|$|Only 16 of {{the crew}} were not rescued by Rhode Island before Monitor sank and the {{forensic}} anthropologists at JPAC were able {{to rule out the}} three missing black crewmen based on the shape of the femurs and skulls.

On 8 March 2013 their remains were buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.|$|E
5|$|Six {{tanks were}} used for each span and left in place for three hours; the 18 tanks used in total allowed three spans to be tested simultaneously. At {{the end of the}} three hours the tanks were emptied and dragged along the deck to test further spans. The first six spans <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> problems, but under load the seventh span collapsed, {{bringing}} down the eighth and final span, leaving the pier head and pavilion standing.|$|E

5|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called PlanetX, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which {{appeared}} in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone {{looking up at the}} night sky.|$|E
5|$|Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican {{congressman from}} Pennsylvania and ardent abolitionist, agreed that voting rights should be {{universal}}. In 1866, Stanton, Anthony, {{and several other}} suffragists drafted a universal suffrage petition demanding {{that the right to}} vote be given without consideration of sex or race. The petition was introduced in the United States Congress by Stevens. Despite these efforts, the Fourteenth Amendment was <b>passed,</b> <b>without</b> adjustment, in 1868.|$|E
5|$|The 1880s {{were the}} most active decade for the United States, {{with a total of}} 25hurricanes {{affecting}} the nation. By contrast, the least active decade was the 1970s, with a total of only 12hurricanes affecting the American coastline. A total of 33seasons on record <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> an Atlantic hurricane affecting the country—the most recent of which was the 2015 season. Seven Atlantic hurricanes affected the country in the 1886 season, which was the year with the most United States hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|After further refusals {{from the}} USAF and DoD {{to provide the}} four {{officers}} for interview, Roth's committee gave the DoD and USAF until 14:30 on 31 October 1996 to provide the officers. The deadline <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> the officers appearing before the board. The next day the board sent senate subpoenas directly to the USAF headquarters office at the Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning that the senate was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Ford rebuilt the state's Democratic machine, which would help elect him and others, including Senator Walter Huddleston and Governor Martha Layne Collins. When Governor Nunn asked the legislature to increase the state sales tax in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 percent, Ford opposed the measure, saying it should only pass if food and medicine were exempted. Ford lost this battle; the increase <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> exemptions. From 1970 to 1971, Ford {{was a member of}} the Executive Committee of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|From the Nore, Bellerophon {{proceeded}} to the Downs {{and joined the}} fleet stationed there. She spent three weeks in the roadstead, exercising her guns, before moving to Spithead. The diplomatic crisis with Spain had largely abated by October 1790, and Bellerophon was sent to Sheerness in late November. She remained in commission, still under Pasley, during the Russian Armament in 1791, but when this period of tension also <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> breaking into open war, Bellerophon {{was sent back to}} Chatham and paid off there on 9 September 1791.|$|E
5|$|In 1724 {{the feast}} of the Visitation fell on the fourth Sunday after Trinity, thus the next cantata Bach {{composed}} was a chorale cantata for the fifth Sunday after Trinity. Bach did apparently not compose a cantata for the sixt Sunday after Trinity in 1724 while absent from Leipzig. Bach's second year in Leipzig <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> composing a chorale cantata specifically for the fourth Sunday after Trinity. He composed one for this occasion in 1732, Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV177, one of the later additions to the chorale cantata cycle. Also for TrinityVI Bach composed a chorale cantata at a later date (BWV9).|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{during a}} break from {{his work on the}} fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final {{overseas}} journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc, and he wanted to visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United won {{the match}} 6–5 on penalties, after a 1–1 draw {{following}} extra time. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Manchester United in the 26th minute with a header from a cross by Wes Brown, but Frank Lampard equalised shortly before half-time. The second half {{and most of}} extra time <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> incident until Chelsea's Didier Drogba was sent off for slapping Nemanja Vidić four minutes from the end. In the penalty shoot-out, Ronaldo missed Manchester United's third kick, giving John Terry the {{chance to win the}} game for Chelsea, only for him to slip and hit the post. Edwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka's effort from Chelsea's seventh kick to give Manchester United their third European Cup title.|$|E
5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, but they had only just started to move towards the Château when three tanks were destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles could be heard moving up to the front during the night.|$|E
5|$|The List of Florida hurricanes {{encompasses}} approximately 500tropical or subtropical cyclones {{that affected}} {{the state of}} Florida. More storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state, and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones that hit the region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring {{prior to the start}} of Hurricane Hunters flights in 1943. Additionally, the cumulative impact from the storms totaled over $141billion in damage (2017USD), primarily from Hurricane Andrew and hurricanes in the 2004 and 2005 seasons.|$|E

5|$|After {{the game}} resumed, Labine scored on {{back-to-back}} singles by Reese and Snider. The Giants then {{came up to}} bat, failing to earn a hit as the score became 6–0 after six innings. To start the seventh inning, Al Corwin replaced Bill Rigney for the Giants, who had pinch hit for Spencer. Andy Pafko {{hit a home run}} to start the inning, and Hodges walked; he later scored on the fifth and final error made by the Giants to make the score 8–0. The bottom of the seventh and the eighth inning <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> a hit. In the ninth inning, Walker hit a home run, the fourth of the game, to make the score 10–0. The Giants failed to get a hit {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, ending the game. Labine pitched a six-hit shutout, not allowing a hit in the final four innings as the series went to a deciding third game.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{finished}} the league season {{without a single}} defeat and earned the tag of The Invincibles, a tag once given to the 1888–89 Preston North End team, the only previous team {{to go through a}} league season undefeated. Van Nistelrooy's missed penalty, therefore, was a crucial moment in Arsenal's season. The return fixture between the two sides at Highbury finished as a 1–1 draw and <b>passed</b> <b>without</b> incident. Manchester United finished in third place in the league table behind Chelsea but defeated Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. Their run included a semi-final victory against Arsenal courtesy of a Paul Scholes goal. The following season, after Manchester United had brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end after 49 matches, the two clubs were involved in another incident at Old Trafford, variously dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford II, the Battle of the Buffet or simply the Battle of Old Trafford.|$|E
