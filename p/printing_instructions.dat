40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} this {{research}} was to verify the level of usefulness of the <b>printed</b> <b>instruction</b> sheets in the management of patients suffering from allergic contact dermatitis. We have estimated the level of knowledge and long term memory of the patients, concerning the pieces of information contained in the <b>printed</b> <b>instructions.</b> We wanted to establish if patients derived any improvement in symptoms by following the rules written in the instructions. Materials and methods: we started our research by asking 400 randomly selected patients, from the Italian cities of Naples, Catania, Ferrara and Verona to fill in a questionnaire. Patients were asked several questions concerning the usefulness of the <b>printed</b> <b>instructions,</b> how often they consulted them and if their compliance helped improve their condition. Results: about 75 % of the patients considered the <b>printed</b> <b>instructions</b> useful; by observing the instructions regularly they reported improvements {{in the course of their}} disease. Some pieces of information concerning the objects and the materials to avoid, for example, have remained the same for 5 years, since the <b>printed</b> <b>instructions</b> were first received. We noted that the categories who remembered less information were older people and, above all, patients who were socially disadvantaged. Conclusions: the <b>printed</b> <b>instruction</b> sheets were useful for the majority of the patients, who derived satisfactory benefits from observing them; therefore we recommend that all physicians use this means of communication to give information. The language in the instruction sheets should be used friendly to make it accessible to people from all social groups...|$|R

40|$|The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg {{model on}} a chain with nearest and next nearest {{neighbor}} couplings is mapped onto the $SO(3) $ nonlinear sigma model in the continuum limit. In one spatial dimension this model is always in its disordered phase and a gap opens to excited states. The latter form a doubly degenerate spin- 1 branch at all orders in $ 1 /N$. We argue that this feature should {{be present in the}} spin- 1 Heisenberg model itself. Exact diagonalizations are used to support this claim. The inapplicability of this model to half-integer spin chains is discussed.

40|$|In this study, {{experienced}} {{navigation system}} users (N = 20) drove a given unfamiliar route twice: once with {{the navigation system}} activated and once with a <b>printed</b> <b>instruction</b> including a route instruction. Quantitative analysis indicated that drivers passed intersections slower when they used the <b>printed</b> <b>instruction</b> than when they used the navigation system. Drivers looked more often and in proportion longer to the side scene when they used the <b>printed</b> <b>instruction</b> and made less and proportionally shorter glances away from the road scene and to the instruction than when they were supported by the navigation system. No difference was found between these two conditions in the total number of glances and the amount and duration of glances to the forward scene. A qualitative analysis provided understanding of the quantitative results: the type of route guidance was identified to influence drivers’ motive for scanning the side road scene. When the navigation system was used the motive was primarily to look for potential hazards and when the <b>printed</b> <b>instruction</b> was used the motive was more focused to look for salient orientation points. The outcomes of the study are discussed in terms of looking motive and the ‘look but failed to see’ phenomenon. (Author/publisher...|$|R

40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{appearance}} of a Haldane gap in quasi one-dimensional antiferromagnets in the long wavelength limit, via the nonlinear σ-model. The mapping from the three-dimensional, integer spin Heisenberg model to the nonlinear σ-model is explained, taking into account two antiferromagnetic couplings: one along the chain axis (J) and one along the perpendicular planes (J_) of a cubic lattice. An implicit equation for the Haldane gap is derived, as a function of temperature and coupling ratio J_/J. Solutions to these equations show the existence of a critical coupling ratio beyond which a gap exists only above a transition temperature T_N. The cut-off dependence of these results is discussed.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether elderly patients with vestibular dysfunction are able to preserve physical functional level, reduction in dizziness, and the patient’s quality of life when assistive computer technology is used in comparison with <b>printed</b> <b>instructions.</b> Materials and Methods. Single-blind, randomized, controlled follow-up study. Fifty-seven elderly patients with chronic dizziness were randomly assigned to a computer-assisted home exercise program or to home exercises as described in <b>printed</b> <b>instructions</b> and followed for tree month after discharge from an outpatient clinic. Results. Both groups had maintained their high functional levels three months after finishing the outpatient rehabilitation. No statistically significant difference was found in outcome scores between the two groups. In spite of moderate compliance levels, the patients maintained their high functional level indicating that the elderly should not necessarily exercise for the first three months after termination of the training in the outpatient clinic. Conclusion. Elderly vestibular dysfunction patients exercising at home seem to maintain their functional level, level of dizziness, and quality of life three months following discharge from hospital. In this specific setup, no greater effect was found by introducing a computer-assisted training program, when compared to standard home training guided by <b>printed</b> <b>instructions.</b> This trial is registered with NCT 01344408...|$|R
40|$|The term 3 D printer {{refers to}} {{machines}} capable of additive manufacturing, which means creating objects by sequential layering. Additive manufactured objects {{can be used}} in the whole product life cycle, from rapid prototyping through small series production up to full production. In addition to the hardware itself it is necessary to use tools and applications like "slicing tools", post-production adjustments, process models and testing and verifying scenarios. With slicing tools it is possible to convert digital 3 D models into <b>printing</b> <b>instructions</b> for 3 D printers. The general approach is: The model is cut into horizontal slices which are then used to create extrusion paths similar to milling paths in the traditional CNC field, which are then being filled with material, mostly plastic material. Commonly the amount of extruded material is being calculated subsequently (price and time estimate). The goal {{of this study is to}} compare available slicing tools on multiple 3 D printers under defined aspects using different configurations. The main contributions of this study are: 1. Collecting methods and tools to judge print results, 2. Analysis of the available slicing tools and 3 D printers with appropriate tests and comparisons and 3. Evaluating the slicing tools using the analysis as solid foundation. Der Begriff 3 D-Drucker bezieht sich auf Geräte der additiven Fertigungstechnologie, die Gegenstände durch sequentielle Schichtung erstellen. Objekte, die additiv gefertigt werden, können überall im Produktlebenszyklus, von Rapid Prototyping über die Kleinserienproduktion bis zur Vollproduktion auftreten. Zusätzlich zur eigentlichen Hardware werden Werkzeuge bzw. Anwendungen wie beispielsweise "Slicing Tools" und Post-Produktions Anpassungen, sowie Vorgehensmodelle und Test- und Prüfszenarien nötig. Mit Hilfe dieser Slicing Tools ist es möglich digitale 3 D-Modell in Druckanweisungen für 3 D-Drucker zu konvertieren. Das allgemeine Vorgehen ist hierbei das folgende: das Modell wird in horizontale Scheiben (Schichten) geschnitten, aus welchen dann Fahrbahnen erzeugt werden, ähnlich der Fräsbahnen im traditionellen CNC-Umfeld, um diese mit Material (meist Kunststoff) zu füllen. Anschließend wird häufig auch die Menge des zu extrudierenden Materials (Kosten- und Zeitabschätzung) berechnet. Diese Fachstudie hat zum Ziel auf verschiedenen 3 D-Druckern einen Vergleich der zur Verfügung stehenden Slicing Tools unter verschiedenen Aspekten mittels verschiedener Konfigurationen durchzuführen. Die drei Hauptaufgaben dieser Fachstudie sind: 1. Das Sammeln von Methoden und Werkzeugen zur Beurteilung der Druckergebnisse, 2. Die Analyse der zur Verfügung stehenden Slicing Tools und 3 D-Drucker mittels geeigneter Tests und Vergleiche und 3. Das Bewerten der Slicing Tools auf Basis der Untersuchungen...|$|E
