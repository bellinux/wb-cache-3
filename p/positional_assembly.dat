40|$|Assembly lines {{take the}} {{attention}} of researchers and companies because of its great effect on efficiency. Efficiency in assembly lines has an important role on cost and quality which are the basic fundamentals of competition. Assembly lines contain a number of workstations and tasks (jobs) are processed in these stations and are moved from station to station. The tasks are assigned to each station regarding a cycle time. The cycle time is the maximum available time {{for the production of}} a job at any workstation. The assingning of jobs to workstations is based on the objective of minimizing the workflow among the workstations, reducing the throughput time as well as the work in progress and thus increasing productivity. If the jobs are not allocated in balance, this will cause idle workstations and waste of workforce besides the loss of overall efficiency. In this study, an assebly line balancing problem was examined for a five pocket denim trousers in a clothing company. Firstly, priority associations and standard durations of operations of denim trousers were determined.

The goal {{of this article is}} to show that gapped kmer matching with cross-diagonal collation suffices for anchoring across close evolutionary distances and for the purpose of human resequencing. We propose a benchmark for evaluating the performance of anchoring programs that captures key parameters in specific applications, including duplicative structure of genomes of humans and other species.

Increasing the temp. results in aggregation and assembly of ELPs, which can be very precisely controlled. Protein engineering is used as a method to produce ELPs and their fusion proteins. These fusion proteins can be assembled onto surfaces modified with the complementary ELP, when the surface is heated above Tt. Two elastin variants were constructed that each showed the expected inverse transition behavior.

40|$|Cationic {{polyelectrolyte}} doped hollow nanofibers prepared via facial coaxial electrospinning {{technology have}} been used for <b>positional</b> <b>assembly</b> of two enzymes, glucose oxidase (GOD) and Candida antactica lipase B (CALB), at two different positions, namely, in their lumen and on their surface. Therefore, the result is four combinations, including lumen (GOD+CALB), surface (GOD+CALB), surface (GOD) -lumen (CALB), and lumen (GOD) -surface (CALB). Surface attachment of enzymes was achieved by layer-by-layer (LbL) technology, which is based on the ion-exchange interactions between oppositely charged enzymes and polyelectrolyte that was doped in hollow nanofibers; whereas placing enzymes inside the lumen of hollow nanofibers was realized by in situ encapsulation during coelectrospinning. The hollow nanofibers-based biencyine systems were used for a cascade reaction in an oil-aqueous biphasic system, in which glucose was oxidized by GOD to generate H 2 O 2, which was used as substrate and oxidant for CALB-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid in the second step. The bienzyme nanofibers membrane was found to float spontaneously at the O/W interface, which is advantageous to biphasic biocatalysis. Assembly strategies of the two enzymes affect their biocatalytic efficiency significantly by influencing the utilization efficiency of H 2 O 2 in the reaction process. The highest reaction rate was attained by lumen (GOD) -surface (CALB), corresponding to 114. 45 times enhancement as compared to that of the free bienzyme system.

40|$|One {{proposed}} {{pathway to}} atomically precise manufacturing is scanning probe diamondoid mechanosynthesis (DMS) : employing scanning probe technology for positional control {{in combination with}} novel reactive tips to fabricate atomically-precise diamondoid components under positional control. This pathway {{has its roots in}} the 1986 book Engines of Creation, in which the manufacture of diamondoid parts was proposed as a long-term objective by Drexler [1], and in the 1989 demonstration by Donald Eigler at IBM that individual atoms could be manipulated by a scanning tunelling microscope [2]. The proposed DMS-based pathway would skip the intermediate enabling technologies proposed by Drexler [1 a, 1 b, 1 c] (these begin with polymeric structures and solution-phase synthesis) and would instead move toward advanced DMS in a more direct way. Although DMS has not yet been realized experimentally, there is a strong base of experimental results and theory that indicate it can be achieved in the near term. Scanning probe <b>positional</b> <b>assembly</b> with single atoms has been successfully demonstrated in by different research groups for Fe and CO on Ag, Si on Si, and H on Si and CNHCH 3. Theoretical treatments of tip reactions show that carbon dimers 1 can be transferred to diamond surfaces with high fidelity. A study on tip design showed that many variations on a design turn out to be suitable for accurate carbon dimer placement. Therefore, efforts can be focused on the variations of tooltips of many kinds that are easier to synthesize. A patent on this approach has been filed by Zyvex [3], and continued advances along these lines are being pursued by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in collaboration with various research groups [4]. This fabrication approach could meet the challenges defined by DARPA in its recently issued Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) soliciting proposals on Tip-Based Nanofabrication to make nanowires, nanotubes, or quantum dots using functionalized scanning probe tips [5]...|$|E
