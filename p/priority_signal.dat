40|$|Abstract: Since {{congestion}} {{on roads}} has deteriorated quality of bus service, attractiveness of bus has been weakened. Bus <b>priority</b> <b>signal</b> {{is a method}} to shorten control delay of bus at signalized intersections and to improve its service quality, such as reliability, in-vehicle time and waiting time. It may, however, cause congestion in general traffic. For this reason, this study attempts to develop a signal priority strategy to improve bus service quality while little inducing additional delay in general traffic by restricting target buses for priority. The effectiveness of this strategy is evaluated using microscopic simulation model, PARAMICS. The results show that this selected signal priority strategy reduces bus travel time and improves regularity of bus headway, compared with fixed signal control. Furthermore, it may regulate bus headway more powerfully and induce less delay to general traffic than non-selected signal priority...|$|E

The transit <b>priority</b> <b>signal</b> timing is optimized by using a biobjective optimization framework considering both the total delay at a segment and the delay deviation from the arrival schedules at bus stops.

The optimized TSP-based phasing plans result in the reduced delay and improved reliability, compared with the non-TSP scenario under the different traffic flow conditions in the morning peak hour.

By minimizing the total person delay at an isolated intersection, PAPSCCI can assign signal priorities to transit vehicles {{due to their}} high occupancies, while minimize the negative impact to the auto traffic. With the accurate vehicle information provided by connected-vehicle technology, PAPSCCI can estimate person delay for each passenger directly and form a MILP (mixed-integer linear program) for the optimization. Performances of PAPSCCI were evaluated through simulations. Results show decreases of both vehicle delay and person delay of all vehicle types when there are up to three bus routes running through the intersection. How different penetration rates of the connected-vehicle technology affect {{the performance of the}} PAPSCCI were tested. Necessary revisions were made to the PAPSCCI model considering different penetration rates. Results show that the effectiveness of PAPSCCI worsens with the lowering of penetration rate.

PAPSCCI model were also developed and tested with communication range of 2000 m, 1000 m, 500 m and 250 m. Expect that the 1000 m case has the best delay improvements after PAPSCCI optimization, the effectiveness of the model worsens when the communication range getting smaller.

30|$|Traffic Signal Priority Systems (TSPS) {{are giving}} less {{attention}} in the literature compared to TSCS. Such systems can be classified into six cathegories [40] which are; pre-emption versus priority (pre-emption {{can be considered as}} the highest level of priority), one approach versus conflicting approaches, active transit signal priority versus passive transit signal <b>priority,</b> <b>signal</b> mode versus multiple mode, signal intersection versus coordinated intesection, and one request at a time versus multiple request. The majority of TSPS in the literature relies on electronics techology allowing the detection of EVs, the communication between those vehicles and traffic signals. Such technology includes Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [4], RFID [31], national transportation communications for Intelligent Transport System protocol (NTCIP) [5], centralized server that supportes real traffic information and calculates the shortest path for EVs to pass by [13]. Shibuya, et al. [32] have presented an attempt for traffic management that supports EVs, called FAST emergency preemption system. Authors here have focused on the technological aspect {{to deal with the problem}} by introducing the infrared beacon as a key of a traffic signal control structure. Mirchandani & Lucas [24] introduced a transit signal priority and rail emergency preemption. The system suggested by authors, referred as Categorized Arrivals based Phase Reoptimization at Intersections (CAPRI), integrates a dynamic programming based real time traffic signal control. Despite their success and popularity, these technologies still face some limitations, including the fact that they did not consider traffic loads and adaptation of traffic light per traffic load. Other works did not focus upon prioritization between EVs. Accordingly, decision needs refinement to make some changes on the decision process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} number of delay and loss critical services in packet networks require differentiated packet handling in the forwarding plane. Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees can be given for networks using resource reservation and admission control. However, such strategies require complex control plane extensions and might lead to higher operation expenditures. Network operators therefore often use over-provisioning and traffic differentiation to offer cheaper class of service quality in their internet protocol (IP) packet networks. Priority marking and forwarding of packetized data traffic can be realized mainly using different layer two and three mechanisms. The number of differentiated classes and their autonomous system (AS) internal implementation is at the operator’s choice. This paper proposes a concept of cross-domain and cross-layer <b>priority</b> <b>signaling</b> between packet switched networks to be used at the inter-AS peering points. It makes use of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as the predominantly used routing protocol for AS peering communication. A new BGP- 4 path attribute is used to convey the structured priority information. The new concept ensures that all receiving AS peers are consistently and comprehensively informed about the QoS handling within the IP prefix originating AS. Based on this information, all ASes can perform close QoS treatment approximation in a cross-domain and cross-layer manner. The approach is now work in progress at the IETF.
