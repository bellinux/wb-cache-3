40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa {{an almost}} {{universal}} awareness of AIDS lethality and of HIV sexual transmission mechanism coexists {{together with a}} reluctance in adopting consequent preventive measures as <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> The socio-psychological literature on health-related behaviour emphasises the perception of being at risk of HIV/AIDS infection as {{being one of the}} necessary conditions for preventive behaviour to be adopted. Analysing data from the Kenya Diffusion and Ideational Change (KDIC) Project, this paper investigates the determinants of the reported degree of risk perception of getting infected by HIV/AIDS. In particular, adopting a social interaction approach, we argue that individual risk perception is shaped by social network influences. We use information about conversation related to AIDS and HIV infection risk occurring among individuals and their social network members. We are able to show to what extent neglecting individuals' reciprocal influences into explanatory models leads to a mis-estimation of the weight of other factors, as AIDS related knowledge and behavioural factors...|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{contraception}} (EC) is any {{method of}} contraception which is used after intercourse and before the potential time of implantation, {{in order to prevent}} pregnancy after an unprotected or inadequately <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> or cases of rape. Use of emergency contraception could halve the number of unintended pregnancies and the consequent need for abortion, but unfortunately many medical professionals and the public are not aware of it. Two methods are available for emergency contraception, namely emergency contraception pills (ECPs) and copper-bearing intrauterine devices (Cu-IUDs). There are two regimens of ECP, the levonorgestrel regimen and combined regimen. The levonorgestrel regimen is preferred as it is more effective and causes less side effects. ECPs should be administered as soon as possible after unprotected or inadequately protected sex, being most effective if initiated within 24 hours. Cu-IUDs can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected sexual intercourse. Emergency contraception mainly works by preventing fertilization, and does not interrupt and established pregnancy. Emergency contraception is very safe, therefore can be offered to women who have had unprotected intercourse and wish to prevent pregnancy. It must only be used as a backup method of birth control.

40|$|AIM: Risk {{behaviours}} [...] as {{they are}} defined by specialist literature for the damage these behaviours cause to young people's health and/or life [...] are {{getting more and more}} frequent among young people. They range from self-injuring behaviours to the consequences of a precocious, high-risk and/or promiscuous sexual activity, from abnormal eating behaviours to the deaths from fun. METHODS: The inquiry concerned a group of university students (100 males and 100 females), selected at random from the Faculties of Medicine and Surgery, Psychology, Economy and Jurisprudence of the University of Palermo, who were asked to answer a questionnaire composed of 91 questions and structured in 4 sections. The first section regards associate-identifying information; the second one inquires on experiences and requirements concerning sexuality; the third section explores the state of health and the use of drugs and alcohol; the fourth section looks into relations with others. RESULTS: The analysis of our data revealed that young people have different high-risk behaviours (use of drugs and alcohol, non <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> carelessness for one's and one's partner's serological state); this is associated to poor information, as complained by the people interviewed, on the prevention of sexually transmissible diseases, use of drugs and alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion is drawn that the new modalities of the assumption of risk by young people would correspond to the climate of vagueness, lack of limits, meanings and values which characterize the present society...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Over 80 % of pregnancies are {{unintended}} {{among women}} with opioid use disorder (OUD; Heil et al., 2011). Use of effective contraception is uncommon {{in this population}} (Terplan et al., 2015). Initiating and using effective contraception involves delays: to obtain the method from a provider, to become protected after initiating use. Interventions that include delay reductions among other elements have increased contraceptive use (Heil et al., 2016; Secura et al., 2014). Women with OUD have reported greater likelihood of engaging in unprotected sex at shorter delays to acquiring protection from sexually-transmitted infection (STI) than women without OUD (Herrmann et al., 2014). There is no current method for assessing how delays to pregnancy protection affect sexual decision-making. The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate a novel tool for measuring how delays to pregnancy protection affect self-reported likelihood to engage in <b>protected</b> vs. unprotected <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse...</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{key issue}} for {{achieving}} reproductive rights is criminalization of sexual violence. If {{a woman is}} not <b>protected</b> from forced <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> she is not protected from forced pregnancy, namely pregnancy from rape. In order {{for a woman to}} be able to have reproductive rights, she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce; and first of all, decide whether, when, and under what circumstances to be sexually active. In many countries, these rights of women are not respected, because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner, with forced marriage and child marriage being common in parts of the world; and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity, as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> when they do not want to (because marital rape is not criminalized in those countries) or to engage in consensual <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> if they want to (because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries). In addition to legal barriers, there are also social barriers, because in many countries a complete sexual subordination of a woman to her husband is expected (for instance, in one survey 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him), while sexual/romantic relations disapproved by family members, or generally sex outside marriage, can result in serious violence, such as honor killings.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{describes}} the sexual behavior among {{students who participated}} in the National Adolescent School-based Health Survey (PeNSE) 2012 and investigates whether social inequalities, the use of psychoactive substances and the dissemination of information on sexual and reproductive health in school are associated with differences in behavior. METHODOLOGY: The response variable was the sexual behavior described in three categories (never had sexual intercourse, had <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> had unprotected sexual intercourse). The explanatory variables were grouped into socio- demographic characteristics, substance use and information on sexual and reproductive health in school. Variables associated with the conduct and unprotected sex were identified through multinomial logistic regression, using "never had sexual intercourse" as a reference. RESULTS: Over nearly a quarter of the adolescents have had sexual intercourse in life, being more frequent among boys. About 25 % did not use a condom in the last intercourse. Low maternal education and work increased the chance of risky sexual behavior. Any chance of protected and unprotected sex increased with the number of psychoactive substances used. Among those who don't receive guidance on the prevention of pregnancy in school, the chance to have sexual intercourse increased, with the largest magnitude for unprotected sex (OR = 1. 41 and OR = 1. 87). CONCLUSION: The information on preventing pregnancy and STD/AIDS need to be disseminated before the 9 th grade. Social inequalities negatively affect risky sexual behavior. Substance use is strongly associated with unprotected sex. Information on the prevention of pregnancy and STD/AIDS need to be disseminated early...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the sexual {{behaviour}} of adolescents {{in the context of}} health and social issues and the aim of this thesis is to explore this behaviour. Today it is proven that tolerant standards of adults shape the attitudes of young people. Therefore, the work will focus on clarifying opinions and viewpoints of juvenile sex life. The research involved a total of 40 respondents, who were selected by random selection principle from secondary schools in České Budějovice. The research sample was divided according to gender quota to 20 girls and 20 boys aged 17 years. The data were processed by statistical analysis and nonparametric methods, namely the Mann-Whitney test and the chi-square test, were used for hypothesis testing. The main aim of this thesis was to explore the characteristics and consequences of sexual behaviour of adolescents in secondary schools in České Budějovice. On the basis of the goals three hypotheses were set: hypothesis no. 1 "The boys start sexual life earlier than girls", hypothesis no. 2 "Girls pay attention to <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> more than boys" and the hypothesis no. 3 "Students who think that the sex education (discussions on sexual topics) in primary schools has meaning start sexual life later". This thesis could be used by social workers in social work with minors. It could be used also by curators for work with the young. Finally, it could be used to educate children in primary schools, particularly in the subjects of sexual education or health education...|$|E
40|$|Correct and {{consistent}} condom usage remains a pivotal strategy in reaching the target {{set by the}} South African government to reduce new HIV infections by 50 % in the next 5 years. Studies have found {{that there has been}} an increase in condom usage by some categories of the population, but usage has not yet reached the desired levels {{in order to meet the}} target. This article reports on the findings of a study on condom usage in eight communities in the North West Province, which was part of a wider HIV and AIDS programme evaluation commissioned by the North West Provincial Department of Health. The main aim was to assess accessibility to condoms, and knowledge, attitudes and practices around condom use by four sampled communities in the North West Province. Eight focus group discussions were held and 50 households were interviewed. The study found positive results regarding accessibility and awareness of condoms. However, this often did not lead to the desired behavioural change of using condoms in risky sexual interactions. The majority of respondents still resisted condom usage, used condoms inconsistently, or were not in a position to negotiate <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> The main reasons reported for this were: reduced pleasure, perceived and real physical side-effects, myths, lack of information, status, financial reasons, distrust in the efficacy of condoms, family planning, cultural reasons, gender-related reasons and trust. Many of the barriers to consistent condom use cannot be overcome by strategies that target the individual. Interventions need to address underlying developmental factors such as the non-biological factors that increase the susceptibility of women to HIV infection. As this falls outside of the scope of the mandate of the Department of Health, various partnerships with other key role players need to be established and/or strengthened, such as with local government, non-governmental organisations and faith-based organisations...|$|E

5000|$|Justices Rehnquist, Burger, Stewart, and Powell {{voted with}} the {{plurality}} and Justice Blackmun concurred {{in the judgment}} only. The main reasons behind their decision were that young females already faced a significant deterrent from engaging in <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and that the statute furthered the state goal of preventing teenage pregnancy. In his written opinion, Justice Rehnquist said, [...] "the statute <b>protects</b> women from <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and pregnancy {{at an age when}} the physical, emotional, and psychological consequences are particularly severe. Because virtually all of the significant harmful and identifiable consequences of teenage pregnancy fall on the female, a legislature acts well within its authority when it elects to punish only the participant who, by nature, suffers few of the consequences of his conduct." [...] Because young women are faced with the risk of unwanted pregnancy when they engage in <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> they already face a substantial deterrent and therefore don't necessarily need {{to be included in the}} law. The risks and consequences associated with teenage pregnancy are, according to the Court, enough of a discouragement to females. However, because males don't face the same physical, mental, and emotional risks associated with sex and teen pregnancy, [...] "imposing criminal penalties on men was necessary to ‘roughly ‘equalize’ the deterrents on the sexes." [...] The Court also said that because the statute helped to further a major goal of the state, it was constitutional and should be upheld. This form of judicial review is known as intermediate scrutiny. In order to pass an intermediate scrutiny test, [...] "the challenged law must further an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest". [...] According to Justice Rehnquist, the law aided in the prevention of teen pregnancy, which was a major goal of the state of California. [...] In the trial, the state of California argued that, [...] "the language of statutory rape law and the policy and intent of the California legislature evinced in other legislation demonstrate that the prevention of pregnancy and the prevention of physical harm to female minors are the primary purposes underlying law," [...] This argument emphasizes how the gender bias found in California's statutory rape law aids in furthering the state's goal of preventing teenage pregnancy. The natural discouragements that females have in regards to <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> coupled with this statute and its singling out of males as the sole perpetrators together form a significant deterrent keeping teens from engaging in <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> The statute takes steps to avoid teenage pregnancy and therefore helps to advance the state's goals. It was because of these reasons that the Court upheld the law.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} independent risks with {{predictive value}} for specific {{sexually transmitted diseases}} in women. DESIGN [...] A prospective study of reported sexual behaviour in patients who presented for screening and diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases. SETTING [...] A genitourinary medicine clinic at the West London Hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 1025 consecutive newly attending patients who completed a sexual behaviour questionnaire between February and June 1982. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Sexual behaviour reported by standardised self-administered questionnaire and sexually transmitted diseases diagnosed by routine clinical and laboratory methods. RESULTS [...] Independent risks for gonorrhoea were teenage (RR 2. 0), black race (RR 2. 0), more than two partners {{in the past year}} (RR 2. 2) and previous pregnancy (RR 2. 1). Trichomoniasis (RR 2. 5), chlamydial infection (RR 1. 8) and pelvic inflammatory disease (RR 4. 8) also had significant predictive value. Conversely, gonorrhoea proved a risk for chlamydial infection (RR 2. 1) together with age under 25 years (RR 2. 3) and more than five partners in the previous year (RR 2. 2). Ano-genital herpes was predicted by a total of more than 10 sexual partners (RR 2. 6) and by both anal (RR 2. 2) and oral intercourse (RR 2. 9). Age under 25 years was the only independent risk for ano-genital warts (RR 2. 0). We found no evidence that either vaginal candidosis or bacterial vaginosis were sexually transmitted. The risk for any genital infection was increased by more than one sexual partner in the preceding year (RR 1. 7) and black race (RR 2. 0). CONCLUSIONS [...] Sexually transmitted diseases show both similarities and differences in the risk factors associated with their transmission. These risk profiles facilitate the targeting of health education measures for those sections of the community at greatest risk and form a baseline for the future assessment of the effects of condom <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and other safer sexual practices...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: There are {{few studies}} about the {{influence}} of the context on sexual behavior among adolescents in developing countries, such as Brazil. Adolescent pregnancy and the high incidence of sexually transmitted disease (STDs) among Brazilian youngsters are a public health problem. The object {{of this study was to}} investigate whether factors from family and school contexts are associated with sexual behavior among Brazilian adolescents. Methods: This study used data from 60, 973 adolescent participants in the National Survey of School Health. The response variable was sexual behavior, described in three categories (never had sexual intercourse, had <b>protected</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> had unprotected sexual intercourse). The explanatory variables were grouped into sociodemographic characteristics, number of risk behavior factors (regular use of alcohol, smoking, and experimenting with illicit drugs), and family and school context. Variables associated with having protected and unprotected sexual relations in each context were identified by means of multinomial logistic regression. The reference was “never had sexual intercourse. ” Results: Approximately one fourth of adolescents have already had sexual intercourse, most frequently boys. Among the adolescents who declared sexual initiation, the most part had their first sexual relation with age of 13 years or younger. Almost 21 % did not use protection the last time they had sex. The greater the number of risk factors involved, the higher the incidence of protected and unprotected sex. In the family context, living with only one or with neither parent and low parental supervision increased the frequency of protected and unprotected sex. Never eating meals with the parents augmented the incidence of unprotected sex (odds ratio [OR], 1. 60). In the school context, students from private schools were less likely to have had protected and unprotected sex (OR, 0. 58 and 0. 68). Not receiving instructions at school about pregnancy prevention increased the frequency of protected and unprotected sex (OR, 1. 33 and 1. 74, respectively). Conclusions: Family and school context factors are associated with sexual behavior. These associations are generally stronger for unprotected sex. Information about the prevention of pregnancy and STDs/AIDS has to be disseminated very early owing to the young age of sexual initiation...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} to what extent the availability of antiretroviral treatment has influenced sexual risk behavior practices in people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) in order to provide suggestions to improve HIV prevention messages. The study was conducted among adult HIV patients on ART aged 18 and above and affiliated to the Network of Zambian People Living with HIV/AIDS (NZP+) in Lusaka District. A purposive sampling method was used to select study units and a sample of 40 was selected. Data was collected from participants using a self-administered questionnaire. SPSS version 20 software computer package was used to analyze data. Chi- square was used to measure associations between dependent variables (risky sexual behavior and initiation of ART) and the independent variable (duration of time on ART). With the confidence interval set at 95 %, the P value was used to ascertain the degree of significance by using the decision rule which rejects the null hypothesis if P value is equal or less than 0. 05. The findings revealed that the participant's mean age was 2. 8 ± 1. 3 SD. More than half (68 %, n= 27) of the participants had adequate knowledge on HIV prevention while 90 % (n= 36) of participants had a good (positive) attitude towards ART. 82. 5 % (n= 33) of the participants on ART had sexual intercourse in the last 6 month, and 21. 2 % (n= 7) of these did not use a condom for secondary prevention. There was no significant correlation between being on ART and having sexual intercourse, condom usage or number of sexual partners OR (P value of 0. 45 and 0. 85), (P values 0. 37 and 0. 5) and (P value 0. 34 and 0. 57) respectively. In multivariable analysis, the majority of the respondents (35. 5 %, n= 11) indicated that continued sensitization would improve HIV prevention messages to support communities affected. Few (29 %, n= 9) stated that: "promoting abstinence among the youths or use of a condom for those that are sexually active and intensifying VCT campaign would reduce HIV transmission" and 7 % (n= 2) of the respondents suggested that; "involving the families and communities affected, civic, religious, and traditional leaders to educate both the young and adult citizens in schools, colleges and churches to support PLWH and fight against HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Stellenbosch University [URL] iii A significant association was not found between an increase in risky sexual behavior or an upsurge in the occurrence of unprotected sex, initiation of ART and duration of being on ART.

The objective {{of this study was to}} identify a set of risk behaviors and partner characteristics that mediate the association between age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and subsequent HPV infection in adolescent and young adult women. Methods. Female university students completed surveys and underwent HPV testing every 6 months for up to 3 years. HPV-positive participants were matched to HPV-negative participants (252 pairs, total N � 504). Associations were examined between risk behaviors/partner characteristics and both age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and HPV infection. Those variables associated with either age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> or HPV infection were entered into a generalized estimating equation (to account for the matched study design) modeling the association between age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and HPV infection. Results. Mean age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> was 16. 7 (� 1. 8) years, and early age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> was associated significantly with HPV infection (� �� 0. 20; odds ratio: 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 74 – 0. 90).
