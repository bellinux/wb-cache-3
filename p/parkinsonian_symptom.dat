40|$|Background. Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a {{disabling}} <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptom.</b> The Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q) reliably detects FOG {{in patients}} with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Objectives. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a German translated version of the FOG-Q and to assess its validity. Methods. The translation was accomplished using forward-backward-translation. The construct validity of the FOG-Q was examined in twenty-seven German native speaking PD patients. Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the FOG-Q with the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) II-III, the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ- 39), and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Divergent validity was assessed by correlating the FOG-Q with the MDS-UPDRS I. The internal consistency was measured using Cronbach’s alpha (Cα). Results. A good internal structure of the FOG-Q was found (Cα= 0. 83). Significant moderate correlations between the FOG-Q and the MDS-UPDRS item 2. 13 (freezing) (rs= 0. 568, P= 0. 002) and between the FOG-Q and the PDQ- 39 subscale mobility (rs= 0. 516, P= 0. 006) were found.

40|$|IMPORTANCE: Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK 2) are {{the most}} common cause of genetic Parkinson disease (PD) known to date. The {{clinical}} features of manifesting LRRK 2 mutation carriers are generally indistinguishable from those of patients with sporadic PD. However, some PD cases associated with LRRK 2 mutations lack Lewy bodies (LBs), a neuropathological hallmark of PD. We investigated whether the presence or absence of LBs correlates with different clinical features in LRRK 2 -related PD. OBSERVATIONS: We describe genetic, clinical, and neuropathological findings of 37 cases of LRRK 2 -related PD including 33 published and 4 unpublished cases through October 2013. Among the different mutations, the LRRK 2 p. G 2019 S mutation was most frequently associated with LB pathology. Nonmotor features of cognitive impairment/dementia, anxiety, and orthostatic hypotension were correlated with the presence of LBs. In contrast, a primarily motor phenotype was associated with a lack of LBs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first report of clinicopathological correlations in a series of LRRK 2 -related PD cases. Findings from this selected group of patients with PD demonstrated that parkinsonian motor features can occur in the absence of LBs. However, LB pathology in LRRK 2 -related PD may be a marker for a broader <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptom</b> complex including cognitive impairment...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) variably report sexual dysfunctions. We {{assessed}} {{sexuality in}} PD by comparing sexual function between {{a large group}} of patients with idiopathic PD and a group of subjects without PD. Methods We recruited 121 patients with mild-to-moderate PD (aged 40 – 80 years) from four Italian Movement Disorder Clinics and 123 non-Parkinsonian controls (NPC) (aged 40 – 80 years). Sexual function was assessed with four scales: the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning (BISF-M for men; BISF-W for women), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Both groups also underwent assessment with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and patients were assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire- 8 (PDQ- 8). Results No differences in total score were found between PD and NPC for any sexual function scale (BISF-M, BISF-W, IIEF, FSFI: p > 0. 05). However, the Orgasm/Pleasure Domain (BISF, D 5) was significantly lower in male patients than in controls. Conclusion Our findings fail to confirm previous findings that PD is associated with a significant sexual impairment. NPC and patients with PD have comparable sexual function in both sexes.

40|$|Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common, poorly understood, <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptom</b> {{interfering with}} daily {{functioning}} {{and quality of}} life. Assessment of FOG is complex because of the episodic nature of this symptom, {{and the influence of}} mental and environmental factors on it. Objective: To design a self-reportable reliable questionnaire for FOG. Method: A questionnaire consisting of 16 items regarding gait and falls was administered together with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to 40 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients (26 males) {{with a mean age of}} 72 : 3 ^ 9 : 3 years and mean Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage at “Off ” of 2 : 85 ^ 0 : 84. A principal component analysis with Varimax rotation was conducted on the results. Item analyses were performed and reliability computed for an abbreviated FOG questionnaire. Results: Based on these analyses, a short (six item) FOG questionnaire was constructed, which was found to be highly reliable (Cronbach alpha 0. 94) for assessment of FOG and with moderate correlation with the activity of daily living (ADL) and motor parts of the UPDRS (0. 43 and 0. 40, respectively). Moderate correlation was also found with the FOG item at the ADL part of the UPDRS (alpha 0. 66 for the “Off ” and 0. 77 for the “On ” state).

In Chapter 1 a short review on clinical application of SPECT methodology will explain its usefulness in the differential diagnosis of Movement disorders. Chapter 2 will focus on the complex regulation of the Dopamine transporter Proteome. In Chapter 3 and 4 the results of two recently published works regarding some motor and non motor aspects of Parkinson disease will be discussed in detail.

Several studies have reported on the prevalence of signs and symptoms. Symptoms questionnaires can identify potential PD cases for further neurological examination to save resources. They can also provide information about how much of the population reports specific signs and symptoms. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the self-reported prevalence of <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptoms</b> from a questionnaire, and to examine their association with age and self-reported Parkinson's disease in a large cohort. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted within a sub-cohort of the EPIC-Norfolk (European Prospective Investigation of Cancer) cohort study. Results The prevalence of six self-reported <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptoms</b> are reported for 11539 individuals who answered all symptoms questions (62 % of sub-cohort) : rest tremor (4 %), difficulty starting to walk (4 %), difficulty getting out of a chair (6 %), slower walking (34 %), smaller handwriting (micrographia- 9 %), and less acute sense of smell (olfactory dysfunction- 9 %). The presence of individual symptoms increased with age except for difficulty getting out of a chair. Conclusion The results support previous findings that the presence of self-reported <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptoms</b> is strongly associated with age and self-reported PD diagnosis.

40|$|IntroductionThe motor {{symptoms}} of Parkinson's disease (PD) present with pathological neuronal {{activity in the}} basal ganglia. Although neuronal firing rate changes in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and externus (GPe) are reported to underlie the development of PD motor signs, firing rates change inconsistently, vary confoundingly with some therapies, and are poor indicators of symptom severity. MethodsWe explored the relationship between <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and the effectiveness with which pallidal neurons transmit information. We quantify neuronal entropy and information 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c alternatives to firing rate and correlations respectively 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c in and between GPe and GPi neurons using a progressive, 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine, non-human primate model of PD. ResultsNeuronal entropy and symptom severity were not linearly correlated: in both pallidal segments, entropy increased from naive to moderate parkinsonism, but decreased with further progression to the severely parkinsonian condition. In contrast, information transmitted from GPe to GPi increased consistently with symptom severity. Furthermore, antidromic information from GPi to GPe increased substantially with symptom severity. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} as parkinsonian severity increases, more and more information enters GPe and GPi from common sources, diminishing the relative importance of the orthodromic GPe to GPi connection. ConclusionsWith parkinsonian progression, the direct and indirect pathways lose their independence and start to convey redundant information. We hypothesize that a loss of parallel processing impairs the ability of the network to select and implement motor commands, thus promoting the hypokinetic {{symptoms of}} PD.

40|$|Class of 2014 AbstractSpecific Aims: The {{specific}} aim of {{this study}} was to measure the severity of dopamine receptor 1 (D 1 R) - and dopamine receptor 2 (D 2 R) -induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) when administered with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 or opioid glycopeptide MMP- 2200. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 6 -hydroxydopamine to cause unilateral loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and subsequent striatal dopamine loss. Levodopa (7 mg/kg; i. p.) injection for 21 consecutive days caused the rats to develop levodopa-induced dyskinesias, termed AIMs in this preclinical rat model. The rats were first primed with the D 1 R agonist SKF 81297, then co-administered with MK- 801 or MMP- 2200 and AIMs scores were recorded to determine the severity of the dyskinesias. Then the same procedure was performed with the D 2 R agonist quinpirole. Main Results: MK- 801 worsened D 1 R-induced limb, axial and orolingual (LAO) AIMs (p< 0. 05) whereas there was no change in locomotor AIM scores. MK- 801 reduced D 2 R-induced LAO AIMs by 89 % (p< 0. 001). However, MK- 801 induced ipsiversive rotations, which is a <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptom</b> in this model. MMP- 2200 had no effect on D 1 R-induced LAO AIMs but significantly reduced locomotor AIMs by 50 % (p< 0. 05). MMP- 2200 significantly decreased both D 2 R-induced LAO and locomotor AIMs by 40 % and 90 %, respectively (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Both MK- 801 and MMP- 2200 had differential effects on the rodent direct and indirect striatofugal pathways with regards to AIMs. These results support that MK- 801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, and MMP- 2200, a mixed mu and delta opioid receptor agonist, modulate levodopa-induced dyskinesias through the dopaminergic and glutaminergic pathways...|$|E

NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 21 (4) 469 - 475, 1997 -Pxkinsonism is charactetised by overactive glutamatergic transmission in the cortico-striatal and subtbalamo-medial pallidal pathways. Local blockade of glutamatergic transmission in these pathways can alleviate <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptoms.</b> The {{effectiveness of the}} treatment, however, is often limited by the simultaneous appearrmce of unwanted side-effects. These side-effects, including ataxia and dissociative anaesthesia, are particularly problematic when N-methyl-o-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists are used. In an attempt o overcome these problems we have attempted to manipulate excitatory iamino acid (EAA) -mediated neurotransmission indirectly by targeting the NMDA receptor associated modulatory sites. We review evidence which demonstrates that antagonists for both the NMDA associated glycine and polyamine sites can reverse <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptoms</b> when injected intra-cerebrally in both MPTP-treated and bilateral 6 -OHDA lesioned marmosets without eliciting unwanted side-effects.

We hypothesize that motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are associated with increased information transmission from basal ganglia output neurons to motor thalamus input neurons, and that therapeutic DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) treats these symptoms by reducing this extraneous information transmission. We tested these hypotheses in a unilateral, 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rodent model of hemiparkinsonism. Information transfer between basal ganglia output neurons and motor thalamus input neurons increased in both the orthodromic and antidromic directions with hemiparkinsonian onset, and these changes were reversed by behaviorally therapeutic STN-DBS. Omnidirectional information increases in the parkinsonian state underscore the detrimental nature of that pathological information, and suggest a loss of information channel independence. Therapeutic STN-DBS reduced that pathological information, suggesting an effective {{increase in the number}} of independent information channels. We interpret these data with a model in which pathological information and fewer information channels diminishes the scope of possible motor activities, driving <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptoms.</b> In this model, STN-DBS restores information-channel independence by eliminating or masking the parkinsonism-associated information, and thus enlarges the scope of possible motor activities, alleviating <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>symptoms...</b>|$|R
