500|$|Robert Legato and Rick Berman spent {{forty minutes}} on the {{telephone}} with Shearer during the strike. While she refused to write the lines during the strike, Berman suggested dialogue and Shearer would give opinions with Legato taking down handwritten notes. Legato decided on the directing notes himself, and used a whip <b>pan</b> <b>shot</b> instead of an effects shot to film the three Datas as director Robert Becker had never used effects shots previously. Shearer wasn't happy with the final result, saying [...] "we were writing the most romantic episode in the world" [...] but that [...] "it was toned down 75%".|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{incredible}} camera setup. We rehearsed two days. The camera followed Greenstreet and Bogart from one room into another, then down a long hallway and finally into a living room; there the camera moved {{up and down in}} what is referred to as a boom-up and boom-down shot, then panned from left to right and back to Bogart's drunken face; the next <b>pan</b> <b>shot</b> was to Greenstreet's massive stomach from Bogart's point of view. ... One miss and we had to begin all over again.|$|E

50|$|A {{whip pan}} {{is a type}} of <b>pan</b> <b>shot</b> in which the camera pans so quickly that the picture blurs into indistinct streaks. It is {{commonly}} used as a transition between shots, and can indicate the passage of time or a frenetic pace of action.|$|E
5000|$|... 1/125 s: This speed, {{and slower}} ones, {{are no longer}} useful for {{freezing}} motion. 1/125 s is used to obtain greater depth of field and overall sharpness in landscape photography, and is also often used for <b>panning</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1/15 s and 1/8 s: This {{and slower}} speeds {{are useful for}} {{photographs}} other than <b>panning</b> <b>shots</b> where motion blur is employed for deliberate effect, or for taking sharp photographs of immobile subjects under bad lighting conditions with a tripod-supported camera.|$|R

50|$|The faster {{shutter speed}} allowed by fast moving {{subjects}} {{are easier to}} capture in a smoothly <b>panned</b> <b>shot.</b> With slower moving subjects, the risk is that the panning motion will be jerky, {{and it is also}} harder to keep the subject in the same position of the frame for the longer period of time.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{begins with}} a ship slowly moving through mist and a <b>pan</b> <b>shot</b> down the vessel reveals an odd {{collection}} of people - Spanish conquistadores, priests, pirates, seamen and finally to the captain of ship who is reading the burial rites over a coffin. The coffin is subsequently ditched overboard and the captain asks [...] "What happened to us? How did we all get here...?" [...] The film then cuts {{back in time to}} previous events.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a written}} {{description}} of a given sequence in a film in order of the shots. According to Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, when doing shot-by-shot analysis, we start with describing the techniques used in the shots or images we are analyzing. After that, {{we also need to}} elaborate what effects these techniques can produce when viewing the movie; for example, camera leads what we see in the film so the changes in camera angles have impact on audience's interpretations of the meanings the movie tries to convey. Some of the techniques used in film producing could be composition (foreground/background, frame/raming, etc.), cinematography (close-up, medium shot and long shot, <b>pan</b> <b>shot,</b> tilt shot, etc.), editing (montage, eyeline match, etc.), and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Kustom Kar Kommandos is a 1965 {{experimental}} film by Kenneth Anger. The 3-minute short features <b>panning</b> <b>shots</b> of a {{young man}} (Sandy Trent) buffing a customized hot rod in front of an amorphous pink background, to the tune of [...] "Dream Lover" [...] by The Paris Sisters. Imagery and the choice of camera angles imply an intense eroticism.|$|R

50|$|Keoma is a 1976 Italian Spaghetti Western film {{directed}} by Enzo G. Castellari and starring Franco Nero. It is frequently {{regarded as one}} of the better 'twilight' Spaghetti Westerns, being one of the last films of its genre, and is known for its incorporation of newer cinematic techniques of the time (such as slow motion and close/medium <b>panning</b> <b>shots)</b> and its vocal soundtrack by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis.|$|R
50|$|The video {{opens with}} a <b>pan</b> <b>shot</b> that centers on Sting (as the poet Marias) in the jumper. The music starts to play as he looks in a mirror, holds up his hands. He starts when he touches the mirror, turns. Outside the French Café des Poètes, men are casting dice in the street. A mural painter begins work, and the men start to dance. The poet climbs {{over the back of}} a booth and sits {{on the back of the}} seat. He puts on glasses, starts to sing and to write in a journal. Female dancers join the men. Outside the cafe, a {{beautiful}} woman (Styler as Casares) arrives in a car. She gets out, followed by a man (Sting as Cègeste) who seems very drunk.|$|E
50|$|One modern {{alternative}} {{to pan and}} scan is to directly adjust the source material. This is very rare: the only known uses are computer-generated features, such as those produced by Pixar and video games such as BioShock. They call their approach to full-screen versions reframing: some shots are pan and scan, while others are transferred open matte (a full widescreen image extended with added image above and below). Another method {{is to keep the}} camera angle as tight as a <b>pan</b> <b>shot,</b> but move the location of characters, objects, or the camera, so that the subjects fit in the frame. The advent of DVDs and their use of anamorphic presentation, coupled with the increasing popularity of widescreen televisions and computer monitors, have rendered pan and scan less important. Fullscreen versions of films originally produced in widescreen are still available in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} {{starts with}} water being released down the aqueduct, followed by closeup shots of Anggun focusing on {{her eyes and}} mouth. The singer then stood near the underground stream singing while the water drips on her. The scene is later followed by Anggun singing {{with the aid of}} her band. The following shot sees Anggun in Roberto Cavalli camo-print caftan swinging the elongated sleeves against the incoming wind. The band-aided singing scene repeated until the next, where she, dressed in an embellished black tulle ballgown, plays with fire lit from the tips of her silver finger caps. As the video enters its second half ending frame, the shots were mixed with Anggun and her band performing in the rain. The video ends with a <b>pan</b> <b>shot</b> of Anggun catwalking while extending her elongated sleeves, and fades out.|$|E
