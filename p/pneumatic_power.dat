5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
25|$|Bleed {{air systems}} have been in use for several decades in {{passenger}} jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> systems {{to be replaced by}} electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the Boeing 787, each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.|$|E
500|$|Located {{on a site}} {{originally}} {{occupied by}} a foreman's office when the land was used for quarrying, the new sawmill building was completed in 1899, providing electricity via two enclosed steam engines and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> across the estate. The engines were housed {{in what is now}} called the Engine Room, while the Lantern Room held multiple lead acid batteries. After opening, {{the decision was made to}} relocate the estate's entire sawmill to the building, to enable better access to electrical power. The steam engines were replaced by diesel generators, and [...] electricity was provided from the national grid post-WW2. In the 1960s, the sawmill was decommissioned and all wood sold to third party contractors to be converted into sawn wood products.|$|E

2500|$|The {{construction}} of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than [...] of material {{over and above the}} [...] excavated by the French. As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work. About 102 new large, railroad-mounted steam shovels were purchased from the Marion Power Shovel Company and brought from the United States. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic rock crushers, cement mixers, dredges, and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} test the timeliness, we also attach great {{importance}} to the response time of OS Hand. We test the closing time of the hand for grasping objects and its opening time for releasing objects. Subject to the speed of our motor, the response time is between 1.2 and 4.7  s. Considering that <b>pneumatics</b> <b>power</b> drive will respond much more rapidly, we connect the OS Hand with a robot arm and drive the hand with <b>pneumatics</b> <b>power</b> and test the response time, as is shown in Fig.  13. And the experimental results are very exciting. The hand is almost instantaneously grasping and releasing, and the response time is less than 1  s.|$|R
