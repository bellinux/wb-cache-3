40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarA {{radiation}} monitoring network with automatic warning capabilities (LMR) {{has been established}} in the Netherlands. For the detection of gamma radiation exposureratemeters manufactured by Bitt Technologies are used. The exposureratemeters consist of a <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> (type RS 02) and a readout unit (type RM 10 E). The calibration factor (Nk) and the energy response of six counter tubes was determined by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection. The calibration factors, expressed as the ratio air kerma to reading, were converted to ambient dose equivalent calibration factors using appropriate conversion factors taken from Grosswend et. al., 1988. An average ambient dose equivalent calibration factor of 10. 8 mSv. rontgen was calculated...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{radiation}} fields at synchrotron light {{sources are}} caused by bremsstrahlung from electron losses in accelerator components. Inside the enclosure and in transversal direction neutron and gamma radiation is of the same order of magnitude but high energy neutrons are much more penetrating. This causes outside the shielding neutron spectra with two broad maxima at about 1 MeV and 100 MeV. Standard Anderson Braun or Leake neutron monitors measure thermalized neutrons in a <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> by nuclear reactions which limits the measurement range to neutron energies lt; 10 MeV. This implies two considerable systematic errors Pulsed neutron beams causes dead time losses due to the time structure of injections and the moderators are not sufficient to moderate high energy neutrons down to thermal energies. We determined and fixed these measurement errors by faster preamplifiers and by a more effective moderator developed by us, which expands the measurement range up to several GeV. Examples of the application at BESSY are presente...|$|E

40|$|MIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Cosmic-ray {{fluctuations}} are {{monitored by}} neutron monitors using several {{different kinds of}} <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> <b>tubes.</b> An important component of these monitors is the electronic subsystem that registers and counts output pulses from these <b>counter</b> <b>tubes.</b> Part of the electronic subsystem is a specific preamplifier. The pulse-height distribution curve of the existing preamplifier used in the neutron monitor system at the Centre for Space Research at the North-West University {{was found to be}} incorrect, and therefore the pulse-height information cannot be used for further research on the <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> characteristics. A correct pulse-height distribution implies that the envelope of the pulse, as generated by an amplifier, has a very specific shape {{as a result of the}} physics that governs the generation of pulses in the neutron <b>counter</b> <b>tube.</b> It was therefore proposed that a new charge-sensitive preamplifier be synthesized to provide an output that provides the correct pulse-height distribution graph for a neutron monitor system. The Centre for Space Research at the North-West University is in the process of designing and building a new mini neutron monitor system. The new charge-sensitive preamplifier will be implemented into this updated system. Ultimately, the electronic subsystem must be able to provide a pulse-height distribution graph at the push of a button, thus making the preamplifier a key component in the new design. In this dissertation the theory of charge-sensitive amplifiers is researched following a design science research methodology. The results showed that a charge-sensitive amplifier can be synthesized to address both the real-world requirements and the theoretical requirements of this research. Master...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Proportional</b> <b>Counter.</b> This is {{the heart}} of a neutron monitor. After very slow {{neutrons}} are generated by the reflector, producer, moderator, and so forth, they encounter a nucleus in the <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> and cause it to disintegrate. This nuclear reaction produces energetic charged particles that ionize gas in the <b>proportional</b> <b>counter,</b> producing an electrical signal. In the early Simpson monitors, the active component in the gas was 10B, which produced a signal via the reaction (n + 10B → α + 7Li). Recent <b>proportional</b> <b>counters</b> use the reaction (n + 3He → 3H + p) which yields 764 keV.|$|R
40|$|Gold alloys can be {{analyzed}} quickly and in a non-destructive manner using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence analysis (ED-XRFA). Two factors determine {{the accuracy of the}} measurement; the repeatability precision of the instrument and the inhomogeneity of the sample. In principle, the first can be kept low, all be it, {{at the expense of the}} measurement time, which is typically between 100 sec and 1000 sec. Values of 0. 1 % 1 or better, matching the accuracy of the cupellation method (fire assaying), are possible. Inhomogeneous element distribution influences an individual measurement result. As the analyzed volume is determined by the measurement spot size, measurements should be made with as large a collimator as possible and repeated at different places. Statistical evaluations will then provide reliable statements about the uncertainty of the mean value. Whether it is preferable to use instruments with a semiconductor detector or with a <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> depends on the specific application and will be covered in greater detail later in this report. In addition, and to a limited degree, ED-XRFA permits the detection of coatings on the surface. It also allows for the differentiation between solid Au alloys and Au alloy coatings. Metallurgic constituents can also be examined using special micro ED-XRFA techniques...|$|E

Starting with the ACES configuration, each subsystem and every module is presented separately. Where appropriate, additional specifications to subunits and components are added. The scientific-metrological part of the ACES system consists of 3 plane grid spectrometers, 4 double ionization chambers with one photodiode each {{at the end of the}} chamber, and 1 double <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> <b>tube.</b> While the spectrometers and the counter tube are designed for continuous measurement of the solar EUV radiation and for registering a complete spectrum of 1 to 180 nm with a spectral resolution of 0. 5 to 3 nm every 8 hours, the ionization chambers serve for continuous calibration of the calibration. The radiometrical accuracy of solar photon fluxes to be determined by means of this system is intended to be 5 % throughout the overall satellite mission of three and more years.

40|$|A {{concept is}} {{presented}} for a balloon-borne imaging hybrid proportional counter/phoswich detector of medium to hard X-rays.
