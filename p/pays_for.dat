40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as {{they are willing to}} <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> its provision. Those with a higher income were willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability. Larger families are not willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people are lesser willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about {{his involvement in the}} mugging, and then does it anyway. Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.|$|E

5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, {{can supply}} power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E

5|$|Adrift in a Great City is a 1914 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Film Corporation that stars Florence LaBadie. The film begins with Pat Moran who <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> the passage {{of his wife and}} daughter to join him in America, but he is seriously injured on the way to greeting them. Left by themselves, the daughter works in a sweatshop and goes blind, forcing her and her mother to become beggars. By pure happenstance, the blind girl wanders to the hospital where her father is recovering and tells her story to a doctor. The father recognizes the girl as his daughter and the family is reunited, and the doctor confirms her blindness can be cured. The film was reviewed negatively by critics for its poor scenario, settings and technical execution. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − Recent {{discussions on}} roboethics have {{introduced}} {{the subject of}} sex with robots. The first sexbots {{are likely to be}} operational around the end of the current decade, their development being based on technologies that already exist in different types of commercially available artifact. The very high cost of the early generations of sexually functioning robots will cause the hire of robots for sex, rather than their purchase, to become commonplace. The most often stated motivations for hiring human sex workers are discussed in relation to how these motivations could be satisfied by robots. Five ethical aspects of robot prostitution are introduced and discussed. “I <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> sex because that is the only way I can get sex. I am not ashamed of <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> sex. I <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> food. I <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> clothing. I <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> shelter. Why should I not also <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> sex? <b>Paying</b> <b>for</b> sex does not diminish the pleasure I derive from it. ...|$|R

5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E

40|$|Current {{reforms in}} the public sector are {{characterized}} by the introduction of businesslike incentive structures, in particular the introduction of "pay for performance” schemes in public institutions. However, the public sector has some specific characteristics, which might restrict the naive adoption of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance. Our article analyzes whether the impact of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on performance is bound to conditions, and if this is the case, under which conditions <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance has a positive or a negative effect on performance. We explore this contingency in a meta-analytic review of previous experimental studies on the effects of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on performance. We further show why <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance sometimes negatively affects personal efforts. With an experimental vignette study we demonstrate (a) that motivation {{is likely to be a}} key influence on the effect of performance-related pay on performance, and (b) that <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance is generally more costly as it appears because it almost always produces hidden costs of rewards. Our findings help to explain the modest success of <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance in the public secto...|$|R
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and <b>pays</b> <b>for</b> it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E
