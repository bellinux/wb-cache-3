40|$|We present {{studies on}} the {{combustion}} synthesis of carbon materials from several perchlorinated organic compounds : tetrachloromethane (CCl 4), hexachloroethane (C 2 Cl 6), tetrachloroethylene (C 2 Cl 4), hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene (C 4 Cl 6), hexachlorocyclopentadiene (C 5 Cl 6). The porosity (obtained by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption), microstructure (SEM), structural arrangement (XRD and Raman spectroscopy), surface chemistry (FTIR) and electrochemical behavior (cyclic voltammetry) of the obtained carbons were investigated. The synthesized materials exhibit an ordered structure similar to carbon black. Their physicochemical properties strongly depended {{on the structure of}} the <b>perchlorocarbon</b> precursor. It was found that perchlorinated compounds with unsaturated bonds yielded more amorphous products. The electrochemical properties (e. g. edl capacity) depend mainly on the mesopore surface area of the carbonaceous products...|$|E
40|$|The ^(13) C {{chemical}} {{shifts of}} a variety of <b>perchlorocarbons,</b> their hydrogen-substituted derivatives, and chlorocarbon ketones have been determined and assigned to specific carbons by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The assignment of ^(13) C resonances for these substances was often aided by ^(13) -^ 1 H couplings and Overhauser enhancements observed in the carbon spectra of the hydrogen-substituted derivatives. Correlations between ^(13) C chemical shifts and structure were found for simple molecules and these correlations appear to provide the possibility of reasonable structural assignments for complex <b>perchlorocarbons...</b>|$|R
