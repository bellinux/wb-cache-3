5|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone at {{the side}} of the skull) are variable, their size is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight to a little concave. The zygomatic notches, projections at the front of the plates, are better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the <b>palate)</b> are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the <b>palate.</b> The back margin of the <b>palate</b> is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the <b>palate,</b> the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E

5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the <b>palate)</b> are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony <b>palate</b> is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short <b>palate,</b> although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of the <b>palate</b> near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the <b>palate,</b> is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in the <b>palate</b> {{between the}} incisors and the molars) are broad and long, extending {{to the front}} margins of the first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina, extending between the molars, but the foramina are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. The <b>palate</b> itself is wide and short, with its back margin between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (foramina) are present on the <b>palate.</b> The back margin of the <b>palate</b> is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} the back margin, as is present in Rhipidomys.

5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the <b>palate</b> {{between the}} incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the <b>palate</b> near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat <b>palate,</b> lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the <b>palate.</b> The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the <b>palate,</b> but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|When an {{adequate}} band of attached tissue is absent, {{it can be}} recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods {{that can be used}} to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from the <b>palate</b> can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the <b>palate</b> can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the <b>palate</b> (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony <b>palate,</b> {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary <b>palate</b> and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E

40|$|The airways {{are made}} up of ciliated {{epithelium}} which secretes mucous, protecting the respiratory tract from particles inhaled during breathing. Its is paramount to understand the physiology and the mechanisms involved in mucociliary activity. Literature suggests that Nitric oxide (NO), especially the one produced by iNOS expression, maintains the mucociliary function and the immune defense of the nasal cavity. Aim: to assess NO participation and the enzymatic pathways in the production of NO and mucociliary transport, using constructive and inductive NO synthetase inhibitors, L-NAME and aminoguanidine, respectively. Materials and methods: frog <b>palates</b> were prepared and immerse in ringer (control), L-NAME or aminoguanidine solutions. The <b>palates</b> were immerse in these solutions for four periods of 15 minutes. Mucociliary transport measures were carried out before and after each exposure. Results: control <b>palates</b> maintained stable their transportation speed. L-NAME increased, while aminoguanidine reduced mucous transportation velocity. Conclusion: unspecific cNOS block with L-NAME and relatively specific iNOS block with aminoguanidine results leads us to propose that depending on the pathway, the NO can increase or reduce mucociliary transport in frog <b>palates...</b>|$|R

The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the <b>palate</b> at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the <b>palate.</b> A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
