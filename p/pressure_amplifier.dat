40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} an optopneumatic interface integrated with a <b>pressure</b> <b>amplifier</b> stage. The interface works using photothermicity to generate a weak pressure signal in its control chambers. In photothermicity, infrared light strikes a black body a few microns thick, increasing {{the temperature of the}} black body and air close to it. If this air is in the control chamber of the optopneumatic interface, its expansion generates a pressure control signal, amplified to make it suitable for common low/high commercial pressure valves. This control enables the command of pneumatic actuators in hazardous environments, with the electrical signal transformed into optical and transported using optical fiber; all electrical parts can be located at a distance from direct application. Our results showed that the device's response times, accuracy, and repeatability are suited to many applications.

40|$|A {{pneumatic}} load compensating or {{controlling system}} for restraining a load with a predetermined force or applying a predetermined {{force to the}} load is described; it includes a source of pressurized air, a one-way pneumatic actuator operatively connected to a load, and a fluid conduit fluidically connecting the actuator with the source of pressurized air. The actuator is of the piston and cylinder type, {{and the end of}} the fluid conduit is connected to the upper or lower portion of the cylinder whereby the actuator alternatively and selectively restrains the load with a predetermined force or apply a predetermined force to the load. Pressure regulators are included within the system for variably selectively adjusting the pressurized fluid to predetermined values as desired or required; a <b>pressure</b> <b>amplifier</b> is included within the system for multiplying the pressurized values so as to achieve greater load forces. An accumulator is incorporated within the system as a failsafe operating mechanism, and visual and aural alarm devices, operatively associated with pressure detecting apparatus, readily indicate the proper or improper functioning of the system...|$|E
30|$|The {{animals were}} handled {{and cared for}} in {{accordance}} with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Thirty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 254 to 311 g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/ 100 g body weight). Each animal underwent a tracheostomy and intratracheal cannulation and was mechanically ventilated (Respirator Model SN- 480 - 7, Shinano Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) under the following conditions: FIO 2 0.21, tidal volume of 10 ml/kg with 5 cmH 2 O positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory rate of 30 to 40 cycles/min. The right carotid artery was cannulated with a catheter for continuous measurement of the arterial pressure and heart rate and for intermittent arterial blood sampling. The arterial pressure was measured with a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>amplifier</b> (AP- 641 G, SEN- 6102 M, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and data acquisition system (PowerLab 2 / 26, ML 826, ADInstruments, Bella Vista, Australia) by connecting the catheter to a transducer and calibrating at zero at the midchest. The right femoral vein was cannulated with a catheter for infusion of saline or ANP. The ANP was a generous gift from the Daiichi Sankyo Company (Tokyo, Japan).|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} mechanisms underlying allergen-induced asthmatic reactions, airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling, we {{have developed}} a guinea pig model of acute and chronic asthma using unanesthetized, unrestrained animals. To measure airway function, ovalbumin (IgE) -sensitized animals are permanently instrumented with a balloon-catheter, which is implanted inside the pleural cavity and exposed at {{the neck of the}} animal. Via an external cannula, the balloon-catheter is connected to a <b>pressure</b> transducer, an <b>amplifier,</b> an A/D converter and a computer system, enabling on-line measurement of pleural pressure (P(pl)) -closely correlating with airway resistance-for prolonged periods of time. Using aerosol inhalations, the method has been successfully applied to measure ovalbumin-induced early and late asthmatic reactions and airway hyperresponsiveness. Because airway function can be monitored repeatedly, intra-individual comparisons of airway responses (e. g., to study drug effects) are feasible. Moreover, this model is suitable to investigate chronic asthma and airway remodeling, which occurs after repeated allergen challenges. The protocol for establishing this model takes about 4 weeks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is briefly to {{describe}} intra-arterial pressure recording by means of a strain gauge <b>pressure</b> transducert and <b>amplifiers.</b> The use of resistance wire strain gauges for blood pressure recording with galvanometers has already been described. 1 " 8 The use of the strain gauge with electronic amplification as a plethysmograph has also been described. 2 Since alternating input current may be used to energize these transmitters, we found it possible to register blood pressure along with other variables on a multichannel recorder with conventional condenser coupled <b>amplifiers.</b> The blood <b>pressure</b> records thus obtained, as shown in Figure 1, consist of bands or ribbons formed by sine-wave oscillating current, rather than single lines. The whole envelope of the record represents the pressure (the increase and decrease of the latter indicated by the broadening and narrowing of the envelope), and the pulse pressure curve is bilaterally symmetrical. It is only when the pressure is zero, as indicated in the calibration, that the envelope constricts bilaterally to a line. The choice of frequency of inpu...|$|R
30|$|Thirteen male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 327 to 376 g) were anesthetized with an {{intraperitoneal}} injection of pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/ 100 g body weight). Each animal {{was allowed to}} breathe spontaneously, without mechanical ventilation. The right carotid artery was cannulated with a catheter and the arterial pressure was measured with a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>amplifier</b> as stated above. The right femoral vein was cannulated with a catheter for infusion of lactated Ringer's (LR) solution or ANP. The bilateral renal pedicles were clamped with vascular clips for 30 min and released. The rats were randomized to three groups: 1) IRI + LR group (n = 5), 2) IRI + ANP group (n = 5), and 3) sham + LR group (n = 3). From 30 min after clamping, the IRI + LR and sham + LR groups were infused with LR for 3 h {{at a rate of}} 6 ml/kg/h. The ANP infusion in the IRI + ANP group was started at the same time point and administered at the same rate and for the same duration (0.2 μg/kg/min for 3 h) using LR mixed with ANP dissolved in 2 -ml portions of distilled water. The heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, and plasma concentrations of lactate, creatinine, and potassium were measured at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 h after declamping. The plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 were determined at baseline and at 3 h using the rat ELISA kit (Quantikinetm TM, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) following the manufacturer's instruction. The samples were tested in duplicate.|$|E
40|$|In 1995 the ATF project {{sent out}} an RFP for a CO 2 Laser System having a TeraWatt output. Eight foreign and US firms responded. The Proposal Evaluation Panel {{on the second}} round {{selected}} Optoel, a Russian firm based in St. Petersburg, {{on the basis of}} the technical criteria and cost. Prior to the award, BNL representatives including the principal scientist, cognizant engineer and a QA representative visited the Optoel facilities to assess the company's capability to do the job. The contract required Optoel to provide a x-ray preionized high <b>pressure</b> <b>amplifier</b> that included: a high pressure cell, x-ray tube, internal optics and a HV pulse forming network for the main discharge and preionizer. The high-pressure cell consists of a stainless steel pressure vessel with various ports and windows that is filled with a gas mixture operating at 10 atmospheres. In accordance with BNL Standard ESH 1. 4. 1 ''Pressurized Systems For Experimental Use'', the pressure vessel design criteria is required to comply with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code In 1996 a Preliminary Design Review was held at BNL. The vendor was requested to furnish drawings so that we could confirm that the design met the above criteria. The vendor furnished drawings did not have all dimensions necessary to completely analyze the cell. Never the less, we performed an analysis on as much of the vessel as we could with the available information. The calculations concluded that there were twelve areas of concern that had to be addressed to assure that the pressure vessel complied with the requirements of the ASME code. This information was forwarded to the vendor with the understanding that they would resolve these concerns as they continued with the vessel design and fabrication. The assembled amplifier pressure vessel was later hydro tested to 220 psi (15 Atm) as well as pneumatically to 181 psi (12. 5 Atm) at the fabricator's Russian facility and was witnessed by a BNL engineer. The unit was shipped to the US and installed at the ATF. As part of the commissioning of the device the amplifier pressure vessel was disassembled several times at which time it became apparent that the vendor had not addressed 7 of the 12 issues previously identified. Closer examination of the vessel revealed some additional concerns including quality of workmanship. Although not required by the contract, the vendor furnished radiographs of a number of pressure vessel welds. A review of the Russian X-rays revealed radiographs of both poor and unreadable quality. However, a number of internal weld imperfections could be observed. All welds in question were excavated and then visually and dye penetrant inspected. These additional inspections confirmed that the weld techniques used to make some of these original welds were substandard. The applicable BNL standard, ESH 1. 4. 1, addresses the problem of pressure vessel non-compliance by having a committee appointed by the Department Chairman review the design and provide engineering solutions to assure equivalent safety. On January 24, 2000 Dr. M. Hart, the NSLS Chairman, appointed this committee with this charge. This report details the engineering investigations, deliberations, solutions and calculations which were developed by members of this committee to determine that with repairs, new components, appropriate NDE, and lowering the design pressure, the vessel can be considered safe to use...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a {{frustrated}} {{total internal reflection}} (FTIR) Q-switched and free-running Er:YAG laser, {{as well as a}} novel design transversally excited atmospheric <b>pressure</b> (TEA) oscillator-double <b>amplifier</b> corona preionised high beam quality Hydrogen-Fluoride (HF) laser system, all developed in our lab, were used in dentin ablation experiments. In the case of the Er:YAG laser, pulses of 190 ns in Q-switched operation and of 80 μs pulse width in free-running operation at 2. 94 μm were used, while HF laser pulses of 39 ns in the wavelength range of 2. 6 - 3. 1 μm in a predominantly TEM 00 beam were also used to interact in vitro with dentin tissue. Several samples of freshly extracted human teeth were used, cut longitudinally in facets of 0. 4 - 1. 5 mm thick. Ablation experiments were conducted with the laser beam directly focused on the tissue or after being waveguided through suitable mid-IR fiber/waveguide alternatively ended with quartz end-sealing caps. The correlation between the various laser beam parameters, as wavelength, pulse duration, repetition rate, energy and spatial distribution of the beam profile and the ablative characteristics (ablation rates, tissue surface morphology) of dentin surface were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{calibration}} {{of pressure}} sensors is challenging. Often, steady-state calibration is applied on pressure sensors {{used to measure}} dynamical measurements. Steady-state calibration does not represent the dynamic behavior of a sensor. With dynamical calibration {{the quality of a}} dynamical measurement increases. This is the motivation for my master s thesis, written at the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU in spring 2017. The master s thesis investigates methods for performing dynamic calibration. The best method {{is believed to be the}} use of an aperiodic pressure generator, because of its large range of frequencies and pressures, and in addition, the low cost and simple construction. The dynamic calibration method developed in this master s thesis is based on a step-response method with use of ultra-fast diaphragm valves with response time less than 5 ms. The target was to build a functional dynamic calibration system, and by use of the system, find the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor. By finding the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor, it is possible to find the uncertainty in dynamic measurements, and therefore increase the quality of the measurements. To generate a perfect working dynamic calibration system was proven to be difficult. The first problem arose when it was realized that the machining of the calibration system was not done according to the drawings. These inaccuracies resulted in air pockets in the system that was impossible to deflate, and as a consequence, signal noise was observed in the pressure step. The second problem was the behavior of the diaphragm valves. When the valve opened, the open-valve position was not fixed, and the diaphragm piston started to oscillate. This led to slow fluctuations prior to the final state after the step. The slow fluctuations worked as a low pass filter and delayed the entire system. This caused a slow rise time of the step generated. The closing position of the valves was fixed, and here the slow fluctuations did not occur, and the rise time improved. The calibration system does still not work in a perfect manner, but has a range of application. An almost suitable step was generated, and with use of Fast Fourier Transform it could be indicated that the highest natural frequency achieved by the system was 2246 Hz. By knowing this frequency and with use of a reference sensor it can be determined if a calibrated sensor does not need an extra uncertainty term. The dynamic calibration system developed could also be used to verify if a dynamic <b>pressure</b> sensor and <b>amplifier</b> behave in a correct manner. However, these methods need further investigation by experiments. Further work has also been an important part of this master s thesis...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} studies of a gas laser amplifier are presented, assuming the amplifier is operating with a saturating optical frequency signal. The analysis is primarily concerned {{with the effects of}} the gas pressure and the presence of an axial magnetic field on the characteristics of the amplifying medium. Semiclassical radiation theory is used, along with a density matrix description of the atomic medium which relates the motion of single atoms to the macroscopic observables. A two-level description of the atom, using phenomenological source rates and decay rates, forms the basis of our analysis of the gas laser medium. Pressure effects are taken into account to a large extent through suitable choices of decay rate parameters. Two methods for calculating the induced polarization of the atomic medium are used. The first method utilizes a perturbation expansion which is valid for signal intensities which barely reach saturation strength, and it is quite general in applicability. The second method is valid for arbitrarily strong signals, but it yields tractable solutions only for zero magnetic field or for axial magnetic fields large enough such that the Zeeman splitting is much larger than the power broadened homogeneous linewidth of the laser transition. The effects of pressure broadening of the homogeneous spectral linewidth are included in both the weak-signal and strong-signal theories; however the effects of Zeeman sublevel-mixing collisions are taken into account only in the weak-signal theory. The behavior of a He-Ne gas laser amplifier in the presence of an axial magnetic field has been studied experimentally by measuring gain and Faraday rotation of linearly polarized resonant laser signals for various values of input signal intensity, and by measuring nonlinearity - induced anisotropy for elliptically polarized resonant laser signals of various input intensities. Two high-gain transitions in the 3. 39 -μ region were used for study: a J = 1 to J = 2 (3 s 2 → 3 p 4) transition and a J = 1 to J = 1 (3 s 2 → 3 p 2) transition. The input signals were tuned to the centers of their respective resonant gain lines. The experimental results agree quite well with corresponding theoretical expressions which have been developed to include the nonlinear effects of saturation strength signals. The experimental results clearly show saturation of Faraday rotation, and for the J = 1 t o J = 1 transition a Faraday rotation reversal and a traveling wave gain dip are seen for small values of axial magnetic field. The nonlinearity induced anisotropy shows a marked dependence on the gas <b>pressure</b> in the <b>amplifier</b> tube for the J = 1 to J = 2 transition; this dependence agrees with the predictions of the general perturbational or weak signal theory when allowances are made for the effects of Zeeman sublevel-mixing collisions. The results provide a method for measuring the upper (neon 3 s 2) level quadrupole moment decay rate, the dipole moment decay rates for the 3 s 2 → 3 p 4 and 3 s 2 → 3 p 2 transitions, and the effects of various types of collision processes on these decay rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a growing need for a variety of custom {{tailored}} instrumentation equipment to serve in advanced nuclear applications. Most of todays of the shelf electronics (ADCs, <b>amplifiers,</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors, multiplexers [...] .) are not specified to meet the demanding requirements in these environments. This article reports on the design of an ADC suitable for use with the discrete time switched capacitor instrumentation amplifiers and reports on a multiplexer to interface multiple ADCs. The circuit in this article is intended for use in remote handling equipment in the ITER fusion reactor and may be subjected to an ionizing radiation and high temperature environment. In addition, it could serve for various other applications requiring a guaranteed functionality in these extreme environments. Examples of these applications are the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN and the MYRRHA (Multi-purpose Hybrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) reactor which is being developed at SCK-CEN, The Belgian Nuclear Research Centre in Mol, Belgium and even complex space applications. In the presentation a radiation tolerant delta Sigma ADC and multiplexer will be presented. The ADC features a 1. 5 V, 17 bit Delta Sigma ADC consuming 4. 35 mW for a 1 kHz bandwidth. The sample frequency is 1 MHz. The ADC utilizes a correlated double sampling technique (CDS) to remove offset and 1 /f noise. The 17 bit resolution is maintained upon a simulated radiation dose exceeding 1 MGy and varying temperatures between 0 ∘C and 85 ∘C. In this work there is chosen for CDS (correlated double sampling) instead of CHS (Chopper stabilization) because it intrinsically removes offset instead of modulating it to a higher frequency. Controlling the offset and hence also the 1 /f-noise is of importance as these tend to increase under radiation. Note that an increased offset could severely limit the dynamic performance of the ADC. Furthermore the conversion of pressure and temperature signals requires a low bandwidth (< 1 kHz). Because 1 /f noise dominates in this signalband, the CDS technique is the preferred solution. In this article a delta sigma ADC will be shown which makes use of the CDS technique. A Delta-Sigma modulator is the most suitable architecture as its envisaged application in the conversion of pressure and temperature signals requires a low bandwidth (< 1 kHz) and high resolution (up to 17 bit). Furthermore Delta-Sigma ADCs are less prone to mismatch since no resistive dividers or matched current mirrors are necessary as in a flash ADC. A Delta-Sigma ADC can use a single bit conversion which makes it more robust to process variations and mismatch. Since the ADC is planned for use in an extreme environment where transistor parameters are affected by varying temperatures and influences of radiation the ADCs robustness is critical. Next a multiplexer will be presented. The multiplexer is able to interface multiple channels parrallel at its input and converts this data into a serial datastream. It can multiplex 256 channels at a clock frequency of 128 MHz or has a data throughput of 256 MSample/s. The multiplexer will drastically reduce the number of cables in the instrumentation network. In addition the simulated radiation and temperature tolerance was found to be outstanding. Finally, together with a previously designed instrumentation amplifier, the ADC and multiplexer form a radiation tolerant ASIC which can interface more than hundred pressure and/or resistive sensors. status: publishe...|$|R
