5|$|On March 31, 1995, Specter {{announced}} his candidacy for President of the United States, {{to challenge the}} incumbent Bill Clinton.

5|$|American {{televangelist}} <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson,</b> {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, {{became the most}} prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history. He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging people constantly and covertly {{in the direction of}} world government for the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Beach {{is home to}} two universities: Regent University, {{a private}} {{university}} founded by Christian evangelist and leader <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson,</b> which has historically focused on graduate education but has recently established an undergraduate program as well. Atlantic University, associated with the Edgar Cayce organization, the Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE), offers M.A. degrees in Transpersonal Studies, with many New Age subjects thanks to its Edgar Cayce link. Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University are in nearby Norfolk and both the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech operate satellite campuses in Virginia Beach. Tidewater Community College, a major junior college, also has its largest campus located in the city. Virginia Wesleyan College, a private liberal arts college, {{is located on the}} border with Norfolk with the physical address of the school being in Norfolk, but the majority of the campus being in Virginia Beach.

5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson,</b> ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E

25|$|Sorkin {{drew from}} his own {{experience}} as a writer in creating the characters. The Harriet/Matt relationship was based on Sorkin's relationship with Kristin Chenoweth, who played Annabeth Schott on The West Wing.

In 2005, Chenoweth made a similar appearance on The 700 Club, sparking a negative reaction from some of her gay fans because of the views of 700 Club host <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson.</b> Unlike Matt and Harriet, Sorkin and Chenoweth did not work together on The West Wing. Sorkin left after The West Wings fourth season and Chenoweth joined the cast during season six.|$|E
25|$|Early {{polls showed}} Giuliani {{with one of}} the highest levels of name {{recognition}} and support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007 he was the leader in most nationwide opinion polling among Republicans. Senator John McCain, who ranked a close second behind the New York Mayor, had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support {{than any of the other}} declared Republican candidates, with only former Senator Fred Thompson and former Governor Mitt Romney showing greater support in some per-state Republican polls. On November 7, 2007, Giuliani's campaign received an endorsement from evangelist, Christian Broadcasting Network founder, and past presidential candidate <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson.</b> This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
25|$|The Passion of the Christ {{received}} enthusiastic {{support from}} the American evangelical community. Prior to the film's release, Gibson actively reached out to evangelical leaders seeking their support and feedback. With their help, Gibson organized and attended a series of prerelease screenings for evangelical audiences and discussed {{the making of the}} film and his personal faith. In June 2003 he screened the film for 800 pastors attending a leadership conference at New Life Church, pastored by Ted Haggard, then president of the National Association of Evangelicals. Gibson gave similar showings at Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church, Greg Laurie's Harvest Christian Fellowship, and to 3,600 pastors at a conference at Rick Warren's Saddleback Church in Lake Forest. From the summer of 2003 to the film's release in February 2004, portions or rough cuts of the film were shown to over eighty audiences—many of which were evangelical audiences. Gibson received numerous public endorsements from evangelical leaders, including Billy Graham, Robert Schuller, Darrell Bock, and David Neff, editor of Christianity Today. In an open letter published prior to the film's release, James Dobson, the founder and chairman of Focus on the Family, endorsed the film and defended it against its detractors. Similar public endorsements of the film were received from evangelical leaders <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson,</b> Rick Warren, Lee Strobel, Jerry Falwell, Max Lucado, Tim LaHaye and Chuck Colson.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson</b> of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

500|$|Still {{reeling from}} his South Carolina experience, McCain made a February 28 speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, {{including}} <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson</b> and Jerry Falwell, as divisive; McCain declared, [...] "... we embrace the fine {{members of the}} religious conservative community. But {{that does not mean}} that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders." [...] He also made an off-the-cuff, unserious remark on the Straight Talk Express that referred to Robertson and Falwell as [...] "forces of evil", that came across as angry hostility to many Christian conservatives. [...] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, as well as one in Washington.|$|E
500|$|McCain's {{campaign}} {{never completely}} recovered from his South Carolina defeat, {{although he did}} rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later.

But {{that does not mean}} that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders." [...] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush. With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000. He endorsed Bush two months later, and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign.|$|E
500|$|Despite a {{platform}} covering {{the full range}} of political subjects, Kemp's primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based on tax cuts. As part of his fiscal policy, he opposed a Social Security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending. Some viewed Kemp's supply-side stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit. [...] In late 1987, political pundits saw that Kemp needed to gain support from the far right on non-social issues. Kemp was among the majority of Republican candidates in opposition to Reagan's INF Treaty agreement with the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev despite general Republican voter approval of the treaty. [...] With aspirations of support from right-wing voters, all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same [...] "sabre-rattling" [...] stand. By early 1988, the moderates (Bush and Dole) were clearly the front-runners and Kemp was battling with <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson</b> as the conservative alternative to the moderates.|$|E
500|$|The {{same year}} the double album You Are What You Is was released.

The album included one complex instrumental, [...] "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but focused mainly on rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics targeted at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. [...] "Dumb All Over" [...] is a tirade on religion, as is [...] "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson</b> for their purported influence on the U.S. administration {{as well as their}} use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like [...] "Society Pages" [...] and [...] "I'm a Beautiful Guy" [...] show Zappa's dismay with the Reagan era and its [...] "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".|$|E
500|$|During a July {{press conference}} in Spokane, Washington, while {{lobbying}} for ballot access, Paul promised that as president he would veto spending increases for both domestic programs and the military. He asked {{in reference to the}} portrayal of his party's plank, [...] "what's extreme about a balanced budget?" [...] Paul conceded that he would not win the election but explained that votes for his ticket would give a bigger voice to Libertarian issues in American politics, and that he would only be disappointed if he did not receive at least 5% of the vote in the state. A few weeks later, The New York Times discovered that many former members of the <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson</b> campaign were helping Ron Paul's candidacy. They found that the campaign workers were disseminating literature in Michigan that criticized Bush, and stated that Paul would [...] "carry the standard" [...] of the free market. Paul commented in a San Diego Union interview that he [...] "identifwith Robertson" [...] although [...] "he's not a libertarian." [...] Paul spent the beginning of August, campaigning {{in his home state of}} Texas.|$|E
500|$|Pat Buchanan, the {{conservative}} columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio {{to campaign for}} McEwen, as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, {{a political science professor at}} the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against <b>Pat</b> <b>Robertson,</b> Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I'm just so happy I beat back those guys. I think they're so divisive." ...|$|E

During the appearance, he railed against the policies of Washington D.C., commenting {{that there was no}} difference between the two major parties, and that both supported [...] "intervention overseas,... in our personal lives... in the marketplace."
