40|$|The thesis {{was carried}} out in several {{departments}} of the Airbus Bremen site. The main ones being the following: • ESGDL 3 - kinematics department • ESGDL 5 - sizing and design department • ESGZI 1 - DMU (Digital Mock-up) department The aim of the work was to follow the standard mechanical design process as intended in an aeronautical industry all along its different phases, participating at it at several different steps and levels. Generally, the design of a part, or of the aircraft as a whole, starts in fact either from a new kinematical idea or from the will of a mechanical improvement. This requires an approach with a kinematical study at first. Afterwards, the problem is dealt via CAD systems, analytical tools for structural verification and FEM verification. Once the structural design is more or less defined, engineers proceed to the digital integration step. For big industries as the aeronautical ones, the digital integration, also called “Digital Mock-up”, plays a very important role. In the Airbus Company it allows a concurrent conception of the aircraft between the different Airbus sites all over Europe. After an introduction to Airbus Industries and Airbus Bremen site in chapter 1, chapter 2 proceeds to a description of the A 380 aircraft and its wing and wing’s main components. Chapter 3 describes the kinematics study of A 380 flap tracks, their actual configuration and their possible future development:- • The first part (paragraph 3. 3) deals with a preliminary study of a two tracks version towards a three tracks solution. In this context the purpose and the functioning modes of a flap-track are briefly described. • In the paragraph 3. 4 are analysed two applications of the new kinematics program TeflaMes. At the same time it is explained how the program works. • At the end (paragraph 3. 5) a preliminary trade-off is presented, for the selection of a new Kinematics solution which has been put forward by an important mechanical industry, MAN-T Industries that is already a contractor of Airbus Industries. Airbus Germany normally entrusts a design task to subcontractors. Nevertheless, the design activity is followed all along from Airbus engineers, who finally state on its validity once it is achieved. Results are afterwards used as an input for further activities in the Manufacturing team. In this context, chapter 4 carries out the verification of a sizing study performed on an A 380 Flap-track <b>pivot</b> <b>tube</b> by the Austrian company FACC (Fischer Advanced Composite Components), selected as contractor for the Pivot tubes and Fairings. FACC is a joint company of Fischer GmbH and Oesterreichische Salinen AG, leading in the design and manufacture of composite products for the aerospace industry:- • The first part, after an introduction to the <b>pivot</b> <b>tube</b> geometry and functionalities (paragraph 4. 3. 1), consists of the analytical study verification. • In the second part, the CAD/CAE approach is described. The work is carried out using the Catia v. 5 program. Finally, chapter 5 can be divided in two parts:- 1. The first three paragraphs include :- • Introduction to ESGZ department and in particular to ESGZI 1 team. • Description of the Airbus Concurrent Engineering approach. • What is the Product Life Cycle and how the DMU team is involved in it. 2. In the second part :- • Paragraph 5. 4. 4 presents the Airbus IT tool situation. • Paragraph 5. 5 focuses on DMU team working platform, and it describes the programs normally used from the team. • Paragraph 5. 6 analyses a dVMockup 2000 i²(dVise) application, focusing on the clash detection with the study of some real clash cases detected on the flaps and slats of the A 380 aircraft, and the explaining {{at the same time a}} few functional tools of the program. • Paragraph 5. 7, describes how the DMU review takes place. This review is an important meeting, during which the DMU team presents the overall current status of a given part of the DMU aircraft making use of real time visualization (dVise context) and showing alternative design solutions to the responsible designers. • Paragraph 5. 8, draws the conclusions of the DMU successful work in the context of A 380 and A 400 M projects. The last chapter, the number 6, points out the conclusions about the whole thesis...|$|E

In this technique. fluid {{is made to}} pass through a <b>pivoted</b> S-shaped <b>tube.</b> which tends to rotate due to the angular momentum of the fluid. A torque motor and torsion spring maintain zero displacement. the restoring force being {{a measure of the}} angular momentum, and density is measured by absorption of radiation passing through a window in the S tube.

The main tube and stem are made of steel in all models. The rear triangle and fork are either steel or titanium, depending on model. The steel sections are joined by brazing - not welding.

50|$|The 'cannon box' bearing was {{introduced}} by George Stephenson on his locomotive Locomotion of 1825 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. One of the axles was carried in a 'cannon box' bearing that was pivoted centrally and could tilt from side to side. Unlike Stephenson's earlier locomotives and their steam springs, this new suspension had no springing but was a compensated suspension: as one side was raised, the bearing <b>tube</b> <b>pivoted</b> {{and the other side}} was pushed downwards. Although not giving a stable ride for the locomotive, it did allow the wheels to follow uneven track. Rails of this period were short pieces of cast iron rather than lengths of rolled steel and had frequent, often misaligned, joints.|$|R
5000|$|Sōzu {{is a type}} {{of water}} {{fountain}} used in Japanese gardens. It consists of a segmented tube, usually of bamboo, pivoted to one side of its balance point. At rest, its heavier end is down and resting against a rock. A trickle of water into {{the upper end of the}} tube accumulates and eventually moves the tube's centre of gravity past the <b>pivot,</b> causing the <b>tube</b> to rotate and dump out the water. The heavier end then falls back against the rock, making a sharp sound, and the cycle repeats. This noise is intended to startle any herbivores such as deer or boars which may be grazing on the plants in the garden.|$|R
40|$|To provide zonal {{isolation}} and avoid leakages behind the casing {{it is important}} to obtain a high quality cementing job. High quality cement is a result of a good drilling fluid displacement. In {{order to be able to}} control the cement flow dynamics in a realistic well scenario, {{it is important to}} predict the flow pattern in the annulus and thus the position and shape of the cement interface. In a concentric annulus, it can be assumed that the distribution is radial homogenous in the annulus. But in a realistic scenario today, where it is becoming more common to drill complex and deviated wells, the casing string will often be concentric positioned in the well, causing an eccentric annulus, i. e. where the casing string is not 100 % in the centre of the borehole. Present project has investigated flow distribution in eccentric annuli. There is limited amount of mathematical models describing this distribution, and thus it has been focused on possible methods to obtain empirical data on this. Some companies such as ConocoPhillips and Halliburton have carried out research on the topic and conducted experiments on flow distribution in eccentric annulus. However, it is still required to find better low-cost methods of measuring the fluid velocity distribution. Some possible methods have been considered and discussed in this project, and the plan of conducting an experiment based on one of these methods is described in detail. This method is based on Bernoulli equation and stagnation pressure. By measuring the dynamical and static pressure at different angular positions around the annulus, one can calculate the local fluid velocity at the measured point. This experiment requires equipment such as an eccentric annular model, a pump, small <b>pivot</b> <b>tubes</b> to register dynamic and static pressure, and a suitable pressure transmitter. Some of this equipment has, however, shown to be more intricate then expected to get hold of in time within the project timeframe. This led to difficulties in performing the actual experiment within the time extent of this project. A description of how the experiment was planned and analyzed is being described, and a suggestion of how to accomplish this is being presented in a Gantt-Diagram. A mathematical model of Newtonian flow velocity profile distribution was made in Excel and Matlab for the purpose of comparison to real test results and how to make this simulation more realistic is discussed. The main findings of this work is that to satisfy conditions discussed in the project, the most feasible method for measuring the flow velocity in eccentric annulus is using pressure measurements. A plan for performing this experiment is developed, and all the experience gained during this process has been used as a basis for improvement and further follow-up. </p...|$|R
40|$|The acquirements and {{potentiality}} {{universe of}} cleaning, heating and/or sputtering effects caused by plasma species bombardment phenomenon {{on the surface}} characteristics and finishing of manufactured parts treated in DC abnormal glow discharge opens a new research and development field, called here of Plasma Assisted Parts' Manufacturing (PAP'M). The adequate control of the sputtering mechanism allows the obtainment {{of different kinds of}} surface. Therefore, the design of rough or smooth surface, presenting a modified distribution of surface porosity and texturing could be idealized, in accordance with the desired surface characteristics, as the parts are simultaneously sintered and treated. This is the second part (out of two) of the work performed in hollow cathode discharge (HCD) and it presents the first results of the surface morphology's changes in the pressed iron samples and in the internal surface of the external cathode {{as a function of the}} inter-cathode distance and gas pressure. Potential applications include small diameters' cylindrical parts and components like axles, pins, <b>pivots,</b> and <b>tubes</b> and pipes presenting small internal diameters. Sputtering effects were quantified by means of mass loss, and Ra and Rz roughness measurements and qualified by means of SEM. Results indicate the sputtering mechanism is highly dependent of the hollow cathode effect, in HCD sintering and surface texturing treatments, comprising an important contribution to the development of green technologies for surface texturing, surface engineering, and part's manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{of virus}} removal in {{subsurface}} environments is pivotal {{for assessing the}} risk of viral {{contamination of water resources}} and developing appropriate protection measures. Columns packed with sand are frequently used to quantify attachment, detachment and inactivation rates of viruses. Since column transport experiments are very laborious, a common alternative is to perform batch experiments where usually one or two measurements are done assuming equilibrium is reached. It is also possible to perform kinetic batch experiments. In that case, however, it is necessary to monitor changes in the concentration with time. This means that kinetic batch experiments will be almost as laborious as column experiments. Moreover, attachment and detachment rate coefficients derived from batch experiments may differ from those determined using column experiments. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the utility of kinetic batch experiments and investigate the effects of different designs of the batch experiments on estimated attachment, detachment and inactivation rate coefficients. The experiments involved various combinations of container size, sand–water ratio, and mixing method (i. e., rolling or tumbling by <b>pivoting</b> the <b>tubes</b> around their horizontal or vertical axes, respectively). Batch experiments were conducted with clean quartz sand, water at pH 7 and ionic strength of 20 mM, and using the bacteriophage PRD 1 as a model virus. Values of attachment, detachment and inactivation rate coefficients were found by fitting an analytical solution of the kinetic model equations to the data. Attachment rate coefficients were found to be systematically higher under tumbling than under rolling conditions because of better mixing and more efficient contact of phages with the surfaces of the sand grains. In both mixing methods, more sand in the container yielded higher attachment rate coefficients. A linear increase in the detachment rate coefficient was observed with increased solid–water ratio using tumbling method. Given the differences in the attachment rate coefficients, and assuming the same sticking efficiencies since chemical conditions of the batch and column experiments were the same, our results show that collision efficiencies of batch experiments are not the same as those of column experiments. Upscaling of the attachment rate from batch to column experiments hence requires proper understanding of the mixing conditions. Because batch experiments, in which the kinetics are monitored, are as laborious as column experiments, there seems to be no major advantage in performing batch instead of column experiments...|$|R
