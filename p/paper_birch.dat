5|$|Leccinum holopus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. It fruits on {{the ground}} (often among Sphagnum moss), singly to scattered in wet areas like cedar swamps, bogs, or soggy forests. Like most Leccinum species, the fungus is highly host-specific and associates with birch (Betula). In North America, the range of Leccinum holopus extends from eastern Canada to New York, extending west to the northern Rocky Mountains, roughly coinciding with {{the distribution of the}} <b>paper</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula papyrifera). In this range, it is common and fruits from August to October. L.holopus var. americanum is known only from North America.

5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, <b>paper</b> <b>birch,</b> American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E

40|$|Avhandling (doktorgrad) – Norges idrettshøgskole, 2011. I’d like to {{say that}} in his article Visual Experience and Motor Action: Are the Bonds Too Tight?, Andy Clark (2001) writes an almost perfect {{introduction}} to what this thesis is all about. Here, Clark uses contemporary empirical findings to criticize views which hold the assumption that conscious visual experience guides or informs motor action (p. 495). In other words; Clark argues that motor theories of mind are hostage to empirical fortune. Motor theories of mind have been popular in the philosophy of sport. Philosophical and psychological works ranging from Dreyfus (1986), Gibson (1979), Merleau-Ponty (1962) and Polanyi (1962) have been welcomed and used to develop a philosophy of sport. What if the supposition of seeing the body as primary to intentionality, action and cognition is wrong? Based on the neuroscientific findings of Milner and Goodale (1995), Clark argues that conscious visual experience and vision for action is dissociable {{to such a degree that}} intuitions about the body and perception being the seat of cognition should be given up. Instead of understanding consciousness and cognition through motor movements, we should look to memory is Clark’s suggestion. <b>Paper</b> I: <b>Birch,</b> J. E. (2009). A Phenomenal Case for Sport.

25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include <b>paper</b> <b>birch,</b> trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980). Seral species {{giving way to}} white spruce include <b>paper</b> <b>birch,</b> aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|E

25|$|According to BC's Ecoregion Classification System {{most of the}} Regional District {{is located}} in the Boreal Plains Ecoprovince of the Polar Ecodomain. This area is {{characterized}} by a continental climate with low year-round precipitation. Moist Pacific air loses its precipitation over several mountain ranges before moving over the region, while Arctic air masses are uninterrupted. About 61% of BC's bird species and 46% of all breeding species occur in this ecoprovince. This ecoprovince is divided into four ecosections: the rolling uplands with few ridges and wide valleys of the Clear Hills and Halfway Plateau ecosections, the wide plains with deeply incised rivers of the Peace Lowland ecosection, and the rolling uplands and Rocky Mountain foothills of the Kiskatinaw Plateau ecosection. These ecosections have many wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams the area is a major migratory corridor for water- and shorebirds. Moose are the most common large mammal but mule and white-tailed deer, caribou, and elk are also very common. The ecosystem also supports Dall sheep, black bear, grizzly bear, and gray wolf. There are few small mammal or reptile species. Fish species are restricted to freshwater fish like the Arctic grayling, northern pike, and slimy sculpin.
