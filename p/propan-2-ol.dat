50|$|Acid leach {{solutions}} {{from some}} copper mines can contain {{large quantities of}} Fe(III) as well as Cu(II). The “free acid” (sulfuric acid) content of these leach solutions is a critical process parameter. While thermometric titrimetry can determine the free acid content with modest amounts of Fe(III), in some solutions the Fe(III) content is so high as to cause serious interference. Complexation with necessarily large amounts of oxalate is undesirable due to the toxicity of the reagent. A thermometric titration was devised by diluting the aliquot with <b>propan-2-ol</b> and titration with standard KOH in <b>propan-2-ol.</b> Most of the metal content precipitated prior to the commencement of the titration, and a clear, sharp endpoint for the sulfuric acid content was obtained.|$|E

50|$|Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name <b>propan-2-ol),</b> {{also called}} {{dimethyl}} carbinol or, incorrectly, isopropanol, is a compound with the chemical formula C3H8O or C3H7OH or CH3CHOHCH3 (sometimes represented as i-PrOH). It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound {{with a strong}} odor. As a propyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, sometimes shown as (CH3)2CHOH. It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol. It has {{a wide variety of}} industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents.|$|E

[...] The propene is also an intermediate in the one-step propane selective oxidation to acrylic acid.In industry and workshops, propene is used as an alternative fuel to acetylene in Oxy-fuel welding and cutting, brazing and heating of metal for the purpose of bending. It has become a standard in BernzOmatic products and others in MAPP substitutes, now that true MAPP gas is no longer available.|$|E
50|$|Combining {{the names}} of {{functional}} groups with {{the names of}} the parent alkanes generates what is termed a systematic nomenclature for naming organic compounds. In traditional nomenclature, the first carbon atom after the carbon that attaches to the functional group is called the alpha carbon; the second, beta carbon, the third, gamma carbon, etc. If there is another functional group at a carbon, it may be named with the Greek letter, e.g., the gamma-amine in gamma-aminobutyric acid is on the third carbon of the carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid group. IUPAC conventions call for numeric labeling of the position, e.g. 4-aminobutanoic acid. In traditional names various qualifiers are used to label isomers; for example, isopropanol (IUPAC name: <b>propan-2-ol)</b> is an isomer of n-propanol (propan-1-ol).|$|E

50|$|A recent {{thermometric}} titrimetric {{procedure for}} {{the determination of}} FFA developed by Cameiro et al. (2002) {{has been shown to}} be particularly amenable to automation. It is fast, highly precise, and results agree very well with those obtained by the official AOAC method. The temperature change for the titration of very weak acids such as oleic acid by 0.1 mol/L KOH in <b>propan-2-ol</b> is too small to yield an accurate endpoint. In this procedure, a small amount of paraformaldehyde as a fine powder is added to the titrand before the titration. At the endpoint, the first excess of hydroxyl ions catalyzes the depolymerization of paraformaldehyde. The reaction is strongly endothermic and yields a sharp inflection. The titration plot is illustrated in Figure 13. The speed of this titration coupled with its precision and accuracy makes it ideal for the analysis of FFA in biodiesel feedstocks and product.|$|E
5000|$|Although, IP Standard {{test methods}} exist {{the more common}} methods for TBN are ASTM standardised, such as the {{potentiometric}} titration for fresh oils (Test method TBN ASTM D2896). A sample is typically dissolved in a pre-mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and acetic acid and titrated with standardised perchloric acid in glacial acetic acid for fresh oil samples. 2 The end point is detected using a glass electrode which is immersed in an aqueous solution containing the sample, and connected to a voltmeter/potentiometer. This causes an ion exchange in the outer solvated layer at the glass membrane, so a change in potential is generated which can be measured by the electrode. 5 When the end point of the chemical reaction is reached, which is shown by an inflection point on the titration curve using a specified detection system, the amount of titrant required is used to generate a result which is reported in milligrams of potassium hydroxide equivalent per gram of sample (mg of KOH/g).2Potentiometric titration for used oils (Test method TBN ASTM D4739): a sample is dissolved in a solvent mixture of Toluene/ <b>Propan-2-ol</b> /Chloroform with 0.5% deionised water and then titrated with standardised alcoholic hydrochloric acid. The detection system {{is equivalent to the}} fresh oil method. The used oil method uses a less polar solvent and weaker titrant, which will not dissolve the wear metals produced during operation, hence it is more suitable to analyse used oils. 6 ...|$|E
