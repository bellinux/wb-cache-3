5|$|In Bulgarian and South Slavic {{folklore}} in general, Momchil is glorified {{in numerous}} songs and epic tales as a brigand, {{defender of the}} <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> prominent fighter against the Turks. Indeed, {{some of the earliest}} heroic songs in Bulgarian folklore tradition deal with Momchil's exploits. In some folklore material, Momchil, referred to as a duke, acts as the uncle of Prince Marko, another legendary figure who in epic poetry is a fighter against the Turks. In the folklore version of Momchil's last battle, his wife, and not the citizens of Peritheorion, betrays him and is to blame for his death. On the other hand, Momchil's legendary sister Yevrosima is described as the mother of Prince Marko as well as a major influence on him.|$|E

It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> design range of , depending on variant.

5|$|The Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence.

The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and Kyrgyzstan.

5|$|There is {{relatively}} little published on {{or in the}} Nafaanra language. The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is Delafosse (1904), containing some notes on the Nafana <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fairly extensive comparative Senufo word list, though it lacked any proper tonal marking. Rapp (1933) is an appendix to {{an article on the}} Kulango language containing a German-Nafaanra (Nafana-Sprache) word list of around 100 items, gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa. Rapp notes in passing that special attention was paid to the marking of the tones.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 2,254houses were flooded in the country, forcing {{thousands}} of people to evacuate. Overall, 2,694houses were damaged, and another 12 were destroyed. Many houses lost their roofs, and high winds left 608,130buildings without power in Honshu, along with thousands of power on Hokkaido. Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines. High rainfall caused mudslides near Tokyo, which destroyed a few buildings, and caused the Tama River to reach above-normal levels. Across Japan, the typhoon disrupted transportation by forcing highways to be closed. Storm debris injured several <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> steel window frame struck and killed a man in Yokohama. A tree fell onto a car, injuring one person. Insured damage in Japan totaled $2.14billion (¥261billion 2002JPY). In Iwate Prefecture, there was about $73million (¥8billion 2002JPY) in damage, mostly from damaged roads and public buildings. Agriculture damage in the prefecture $18.3million (¥2billion 2002JPY) {{for the first time}} since Typhoon Mireille in 1991.

5|$|During his exile at Cephellania, Hybrida {{pretended to}} act as {{governor}} of the island which the people secretly allowed. In 49 BC, his nephew, Mark Antony, {{was elected to the}} role of tribune of the <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> legate of Caesar's in Italy. Despite this, Hybrida remained in exile until 47 BC when he returned to Rome at the request of Caesar himself. One possible explanation for this is that Mark Antony was indebted to Hybrida; as Hybrida was in exile and had no civil rights, he could not enforce a payment and this suited Mark Antony. Hybrida was a candidate for censorship around 45 BC; his character and support from Mark Antony, however, made his attempt at the position a failure. The final mention of Hybrida during his life comes from Cicero who commented upon Mark Antony's divorce from Antonia Hybrida Major and the insult this conferred upon Hybrida himself.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E
