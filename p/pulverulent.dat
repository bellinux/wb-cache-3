L'esbós fitosociològic obtingut és semblant al de les costes del SE d'Espanya, previament estudiat pels autors, en condicions ecològiques similars. Especialment destacable es la banda taronja de l'ass. Xanthorietum resendei subass. caloplacetosum gloriae, sobre roques costaneres assolellades (10 - 100 m) i la groga pàllida de l'ass. Pertusarietum gallicae, sobre superfícies no assolellades, amb una presència i dominància {{important}} de Lecanora sulphurella, típica de les illes. Altres associacions interessants són: Peltuletum obscuranto-euplocae, sobre superfícies d'escorrentia, Solenopsoro-Diploicietum subcanescentis, sobre superfícies ombrejades, riques en materials <b>pulverulents</b> i Roccellion canariensis, amb dues comunitats costaneres, ombrofobes, una d'elles no descrita en l'actualitat, rica en Dirina massiliensis (= D.

The phytosociological sketch obtained fits well with that of SE Spain coasts, previously studied by the authors, in similar ecological conditions. Specially remarkable is the orange belt of the Xanthorietum resendei subas. caloplacetosum gloriae, on the sunny coastal rocks (10 - 100 m), and the pale yellowish Pertusarietum gallicae, on not insolated surfaces, with an important presence and dominance of Lecanora suiphurella, typical of the island. The high variability of this community is described. Other interesting associations are the Peltuletum obscuranto -euplocae, on rain-tracks, Solenopsoro-Diploicietum subcanescentis, on shaded rock surfaces, rich in terreuns materials, and Roccellion canariensis, with two coastal ombrophobous communities, one of them undescribed, rich in Dirina massiliensis (=D.

40|$|Context: Congenital {{cataracts}} {{are one of}} {{the common}} eye disorders leading to visual impairment or blindness in children worldwide. We found a Chinese family with autosomal dominant <b>pulverulent</b> cataract. Aims: To identify the pathogenic gene mutation in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant inherited <b>pulverulent</b> cataract. Subjects and Methods: After obtained informed consent, detailed ophthalmic examinations were carried out; genomic DNAs were obtained from seven family members in a three-generation Chinese family with three affected. All exons of candidate genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and were sequenced performed by bidirectional sequencing. Results: By sequencing the encoding regions of the candidate genes, a missense mutation (c. 176 C>T) was detected in gap junction protein alpha 3 genes (GJA 3), which resulted in the substitution of highly conserved proline by leucine at codon 59 (p. P 59 L). The mutation co-segregated with all patients and was absent in 100 normal Chinese controls. Conclusions: The study identified a missense mutation (c. 176 C>T) in GJA 3 gene associated with autosomal dominant congenital <b>pulverulent</b> cataract in a Chinese family.

40|$|Purpose: We {{isolated}} an autosomal semi-dominant cataract {{from our}} inbred SHR/OlaIpcv rat colony. Heterozygotes express <b>pulverulent</b> cataract with smaller eyes; homozygotes express marked microphthalmia with hypoplastic lens. We call this mutation Dca (for dominant cataract). In this study, {{we focus on}} the identification of the responsible gene. Methods: We performed linkage mapping using 93 F 2 (SHR-Dca x PD) hybrids and a panel of microsatellite markers. In a separate group of animals with a SHR genetic background, we examined the lenses histologically using Epon semithin sections and toluidine blue staining. We also assessed the weight of the eyes as an immediate measure for microphthalmia. Results: We mapped the Dca gene to chromosome 2, spanning 8. 6 Mbp between markers D 2 Rat 134 and D 2 Rat 186. By sequencing the most plausible candidate gene, Gja 8 (coding for connexin 50), we found a T to A transversion at codon 7, leading to a substitution of glutamine for leucin (L 7 Q). L 7 Q lies within the NH 2 -terminal cytosolic domain, presumably involved in voltage gating. Histology revealed disturbances in cell to cell contacts in the lens. Conclusions: L 7 Q is a novel mutation in connexin 50 (Gja 8), causing semi-dominant <b>pulverulent</b> cataracts. Dca rats can {{serve as a model for}} cataract development.

40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} the different morphologies of autosomal dominant cataract (ADC), assess the intra- and interfamilial variation in cataract morphology, and undertake a genetic linkage study to identify loci for genes causing ADC and detect the underlying mutation.  METHODS—Patients {{were recruited from}} the ocular genetic database at Moorfields Eye Hospital. All individuals underwent an eye examination with {{particular attention to the}} lens including anterior segment photography where possible. Blood samples were taken for DNA extraction and genetic linkage analysis was carried out using polymorphic microsatellite markers.  RESULTS— 292 individuals from 16  large pedigrees with ADC were examined, of whom 161  were found to be affected. The cataract phenotypes could all be described as one of the eight following morphologies—anterior polar, posterior polar, nuclear, lamellar, coralliform, blue dot (cerulean), cortical, and <b>pulverulent.</b> The phenotypes varied in severity but the morphology was consistent within each pedigree, except in those affected by the <b>pulverulent</b> cataract, which showed considerable intrafamilial variation. Positive linkage was obtained in five families; in two families linkage was demonstrated to new loci and in three families linkage was demonstrated to previously described loci. In one of the families the underlying mutation was isolated. Exclusion data were obtained on five families.  CONCLUSIONS—Although there is considerable clinical heterogeneity in ADC, the phenotype is usually consistent within families. There is extensive genetic heterogeneity and specific cataract phenotypes appear to be associated with mutations at more than one chromosome locus. In cases where the genetic mutation has been identified the molecular biology and clinical phenotype are closely associated. ...|$|E

40|$|The murine {{autosomal}} dominant cataract mutants created in mutagenesis experiments {{have proven to}} be a powerful resource for modelling the biological processes involved in cataractogenesis. We report a mutant which in the heterozygous state exhibits mild <b>pulverulent</b> cataract named ‘opaque flecks in lens', symbol Ofl. By molecular mapping, followed by a candidate gene approach, the mutant was shown to be allelic with a knockout of the bZIP transcription factor, Maf. Homozygotes for Ofl and for Maf null mutations are similar but a new effect, renal tubular nephritis, was found in Ofl homozygotes surviving beyond 4 weeks, which may contribute to early lethality. Sequencing identified the mutation as a G→A change, leading to the amino-acid substitution mutation R 291 Q in the basic region of the DNA-binding domain. Since mice heterozygous for knockouts of Maf show no cataracts, this suggests that the Ofl R 291 Q mutant protein has a dominant effect. We have demonstrated that this mutation results in a selective alteration in DNA binding affinities to target oligonucleotides containing variations in the core CRE and TRE elements. This implies that arginine 291 is important for core element binding and suggests that the mutant protein may exert a differential downstream effect amongst its binding targets. The cataracts seen in Ofl heterozygotes and human MAF mutations are similar to one another, implying that Ofl may be a model of human <b>pulverulent</b> cortical cataract. Furthermore, when bred onto a different genetic background Ofl heterozygotes also show anterior segment abnormalities. The Ofl mutant therefore provides a valuable model system for the study of Maf, and its interacting factors, in normal and abnormal lens and anterior segment developmen...|$|E
