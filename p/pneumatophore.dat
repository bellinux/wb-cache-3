50|$|Ovatoscutum {{was first}} {{described}} by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade in 1966, and this team tentatively interpreted it as a chondrophoran <b>pneumatophore.</b> This notion {{was based on}} morphologies apparently shared between Ovatoscutum and the Devonian Plectodiscus, leading to {{an interpretation of the}} organism as a velellid float (<b>pneumatophore),</b> which itself bears a passing resemblance to the modern chondrophoran <b>pneumatophore</b> Velella. Thus the hypothesis emerged that the Ovatoscutum was a pelagic hydrozoan chondrophoran. This hypothesis later became popular and was widely quoted, despite the absence of further research.|$|E
50|$|The Portuguese man o' war colony is {{composed}} of three types of medusoids (gonophores, siphosomal nectophores, and vestigial siphosomal nectophores) and four types of polypoids (free gastrozooids, gastrozooids with tentacles, gonozooids, and gonopalpons), grouped into cormidia beneath the <b>pneumatophore,</b> a sail shaped structure filled with gas. The <b>pneumatophore</b> should probably {{not be considered a}} polyp, as it develops from the planula, unlike the other polyps. This sail is bilaterally symmetrical, with the tentacles at one end. It is translucent, and is tinged blue, purple, pink, or mauve. It may be 9 to 30 cm long and may extend as much as 15 cm above the water. The Portuguese man o' war fills its gas bladder with up to 14% carbon monoxide. The remainder is nitrogen, oxygen, and argon—atmospheric gases that diffuse into the gas bladder. Carbon dioxide also occurs at trace levels. The sail is equipped with a siphon. In the event of a surface attack, the sail can be deflated, allowing the organism to briefly submerge.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was devised {{to test whether}} meiofauna that colonised mimic <b>pneumatophores</b> (artificial substrates) resembled the assemblage on adjacent live <b>pneumatophores</b> in three randomly chosen intertidal, estuarine sites. The experiment showed that the close proximity of particular biota on living <b>pneumatophores</b> did not reliably influence subsequent development of assemblages upon mimic <b>pneumatophores</b> within a scale of 10 m during a colonisation period of less than 20 weeks. There was some convergence of {{the composition of the}} colonising assemblage of meiofauna on mimic <b>pneumatophores</b> with the local assemblages in sites dominated by barnacles, or where the natural <b>pneumatophores</b> were free from macroscopic epibionts. However, tychopelagic meiofauna from algal epiphytes did not significantly colonise mimic <b>pneumatophores</b> during the 20 -week trial, probably due a lack of growing algae. During the conditioning phase suspended in water at a marine site 20 km from the mangroves, mimic <b>pneumatophores</b> acquired an assemblage of meiofauna different from the estuarine assemblage that colonised mimics following implantation in the estuarine mudflat. Enhanced colonisation rates of mimics in suspended bags at the conditioning site may be explained by the absence of benthic macroinvertebrates, and the lack of intertidal exposure. Biofilms aged 2, 7, and 11 weeks had no consistent, different effect on the subsequent colonisation of meiofauna. We conclude that divergence of phytal-based assemblages of meiofauna depends upon the amount of coverage, as well as the type, of fouling macro-epibionts on the <b>pneumatophores.</b> Meiofaunal assemblages on artificial substrates after 20 weeks colonisation displayed less intrinsic patchiness than mature phytal assemblages on natural <b>pneumatophores,</b> and so present a potentially useful way of improving the power of biomonitoring applications using meiofauna. <br /...|$|R

The shrimp juveniles measured 6 â€“ 15 mm in carapace length; fish measured 6. 5 â€“ 12. 5 cm in standard length; structure types were <b>pneumatophores</b> of the mangrove Sonneratia griffithii Kurz and dried coconut leaf bracts; structure densities were 0, 32 and 98 <b>pneumatophores</b> per tank; and sediment particle sizes were pebbles, sand-granules and siltâ€“sand. Predation on shrimp {{was significantly higher}} in controls or bare sand (48. 7 %) than among <b>pneumatophores</b> (29. 9 %), but not among leaf bracts (43. 5 %). Shrimp mortality was also significantly higher on bare sand (72. 9 %) compared to medium-density (54. 2 %), but not high-density (68. 8 %), <b>pneumatophores.</b> Fish predation on the burying shrimp M. ensis was affected by predator type but not by sediment size. The generally higher predation rates of snapper {{may be due to}} their habit of leaving unconsumed pieces of shrimp, whereas sea bass which devour whole prey require fewer shrimp to reach satiation. Moreover, the presence of structures did not affect sea bass behaviour of chasing prey among <b>pneumatophores</b> and under leaf bracts, but reduced predation by the relatively passive snapper. Predation rates among <b>pneumatophores</b> vs. control, and among medium-density <b>pneumatophores</b> vs. bare sand, were lower for P. monodon but not P. merguiensis. This {{may be related to the}} greater and more frequent use of (laboratory) shelters by juvenile tiger shrimp compared to white shrimp. The results demonstrate that the effective provision of shelter depends not only on structure type and density but on the behaviour of predator and prey as well. The use of mangrove structures (<b>pneumatophores)</b> by juvenile shrimp as refuge from predation is also documented for the first time...|$|R

40|$|The {{size and}} {{pace of change}} in meiofaunal assemblages suggest that meiofauna make {{excellent}} subjects for testing theories about how ecological communities change. A field experiment was performed in which the  abundance and composition of epibionts and meiofauna on natural,  transplanted and mimic <b>pneumatophores</b> were monitored over a 47 wk period. Meiofaunal density increased with growth of algal epibionts, both reaching maximum values after 24 wk, {{at the end of}} winter. At this time the assemblages from the 3 substrata were similar, although the combined abundances of meiofauna on transplants and mimics were only 28 % of the average on natural <b>pneumatophores.</b> Meiofaunal abundance on all substrata decreased rapidly during spring as algal cover declined due to desiccation. Twenty-three species of nematode were recorded from mimics compared with 8 and 7 from transplants and <b>pneumatophores,</b> respectively. A temporal sequence of feeding groups occurred in the order of epigrowth feeders, deposit feeders, and omnivore/predators, with the latter 2 adding to rather than replacing earlier trophic groups. Scavengers were found only on natural <b>pneumatophores.</b> The turnover rates of nematode species between all census times were similar, peaking at 63 %, but there was no trend in the turnover rates with time. We conclude that mimics are more suitable than transplanted <b>pneumatophores</b> for colonisation studies because of their greater persistence and more easily standardised surface area. Moreover, the composition of colonising assemblages on them closely resembled assemblages on natural <b>pneumatophores</b> at the time of peak meiofaunal abundance. <br /...|$|R

50|$|This colonial animal {{arises from}} a single fertilised egg. The protozooid that {{develops}} from this subsequently buds to form {{the other members of}} the colony which are thus genetically identical. The protozooid first thins and elongates, the middle section becoming the stem of the colony. The <b>pneumatophore</b> forms at the opposite end to the mouth. Next a growth zone on the thin stem forms and budding occurs with the formation of the nectophores. As the stem continues lengthening, further zooids develop above these. Another growth zone sees the development of the siphosome and the continuing elongation of the stem carries these zooids down with it. The division of labor among the zooids is an evolutionary advance in the constant struggle for existence in the deep sea. Such organisms as Marrus orthocanna blur the boundaries between the individual polyp and the whole colonial organism; each cannot exist without the other.|$|E
50|$|Like other siphonophores, Marrus orthocanna is {{a colony}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} specialised zooids linked together by a long stem. At the front is the <b>pneumatophore,</b> an orange-coloured, gas-filled float. Behind this is the nectosome, a region where {{there are a number of}} translucent nectophores with red, unlooped radial canals. These are bell-shaped medusae specialised for locomotion. When they contract, water is expelled which causes the colony to move. Their contractions are coordinated which enables the animal to swim forwards, sidewards or backwards. The remaining region is the siphosome. Most of the zooids here are polyps, specialised for collecting food. They do this for the whole colony, spreading their single long tentacles in the water to snare prey. Other zooids in this region undertake digestion and assimilation of food items. Reproductive medusae are found among the polyps in the siphosome and also various other specialised zooids. The various forms are all arranged in a repeating pattern.|$|E
40|$|The fungal {{communities}} of different soil compartments in mangrove ecosystem are poorly studied. We sequenced the {{internal transcribed spacer}} (ITS) regions to characterize the fungal communities in Avicennia marina root-associated soils (rhizosphere and <b>pneumatophore)</b> and bulk soil compartments.

However, bulk soil fungal diversity (Shannon diversity index) {{was significantly higher than}} both <b>pneumatophore</b> and rhizosphere soil compartments.

Pairwise sample analyses showed that bulk soil microbial community composition significantly different from rhizosphere and <b>pneumatophore</b> soil compartments.

40|$|Water {{flows through}} {{submerged}} and emergent vegetation control the transport and {{deposition of sediment}} in coastal wetlands. Many past studies into the hydrodynamics of vegetation fields have used idealized vegetation mimics, mostly rigid dowels of uniform height. In this study, a canopy of real mangrove pneumatophores was reconstructed in a flume to quantify flow and turbulence within and above this canopy. At a constant flow forcing, an increase in <b>pneumatophore</b> density, from 71 m⁻² to 268 m⁻², was found to cause a reduction of the within-canopy flow velocities, whereas the over-canopy flows increased. Within-canopy velocities reduced to 46 % and 27 % of the free-stream velocities for the lowest and highest <b>pneumatophore</b> densities, respectively, resulting in stronger vertical shear and hence greater turbulence production {{around the top of}} the denser <b>pneumatophore</b> canopies. The maximum Reynolds stress was observed at 1. 5 times the average <b>pneumatophore</b> height, in contrast to uniform-height canopies, in which the maximum occurs at approximately the height of the vegetation. The ratios of the within-canopy velocity to the free-stream velocity for the pneumatophores were found to be similar to previous observations with uniform-height vegetation mimics for the same vegetation densities. However, maxima of the scaled friction velocity were two times smaller over the real <b>pneumatophore</b> canopies than for idealized dowel canopies, due to the reduced velocity gradients over the variable-height pneumatophores compared to uniform-height dowels. These findings imply that results from previous studies with idealized and uniform vegetation mimics may have limited application when considering sediment transport and deposition in real vegetation, as the observed turbulence characteristics in nonuniform canopies deviate significantly from those in dowel canopies...|$|E

40|$|Mangroves {{are known}} to {{stabilise}} coastal sediments through their above-ground aerial root complex. The results {{presented in this paper}} suggest that the grey mangrove Avicennia marina has the ability to adapt its pneumatophores to micro-topographical irregularities in the otherwise regularly sloping intertidal zone. The difference in height above datum (and thus in hydrological regime) in this study was as little as 15 cm higher as opposed to that for the surrounding mangrove soil. Significantly higher <b>pneumatophore</b> densities and total <b>pneumatophore</b> lengths were observed in the centre of the landward depression, and significantly lower below ground <b>pneumatophore</b> length in the centre of the seaward depression. The mangrove’s adaptations to these localised topographic differences are important in view of changes in intertidal hydrology, the latter being linked to changes in topography.

40|$|Mangroves {{have been}} shown to protect shorelines against damage from the {{combined}} hydrodynamic forces of waves and tides, owing to the presence of roots (<b>pneumatophores)</b> and tree trunks that enhance vegetative drag. However, field measurements within these environments are limited.

Measurements were made in two different seasons along a transect that crosses from mudflats to mangrove forest. Flows are also explored using an idealised numerical model. Both the data and model capture the flow transitions from mudflat across the fringing region to the forest interior. We observe a rotation of the obliquely incident flows toward an orientation nearly perpendicular to the vegetated/unvegetated boundary. The momentum balances governing the large-scale flow are assessed and indicate the relative importance of friction, winds and depth-averaged pressure forces. In the forest, drag coefficients were 10 - 30 times greater than values usually observed for bottom friction, with particularly effective friction in the regions of dense <b>pneumatophores</b> at the fringe and when water depths were lower than the height of the <b>pneumatophores.</b> Pressure gradient balances suggest that the drag induced by bottom friction from <b>pneumatophores</b> was dominant relative to drag from the larger, but sparser, tree trunks...|$|R

40|$|Facilitation cascades are {{critical}} {{to the maintenance of}} biodiversity in a variety of habitats. Through a series of two experiments, we examined how the morphological traits and density of interacting foundation species influence the establishment and persistence of a facilitation cascade in temperate Australian mangrove forests. In this system, mangrove pneumatophores trap the free-living alga, Hormosira banksii, which, in turn, supports dense and diverse assemblages of epifaunal mollusks. The first experiment, which manipulated <b>pneumatophore</b> height and density, revealed that these two traits each had additive negative effects on the establishment, but additive positive effects on the persistence of the cascade. High densities of tall pneumatophores initially served as a physical barrier to algal colonization of <b>pneumatophore</b> plots, but over the longer term enhanced the retention of algae. The increased algal biomass, in turn, facilitating epifaunal colonization. The second experiment demonstrated that the retention of algae by pneumatophores was influenced more by algal thallus length than vesicle diameter, and this effect occurred independent of <b>pneumatophore</b> height. Our study has extended facilitation theory by showing that the morphological traits and density of basal and intermediary facilitators influence both the establishment and persistence of facilitation cascades. Hence, attempts to use foundation species as a tool for restoration will require an understanding not only of the interactions among these, but also of the key traits that modify interrelationships. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Co-occurring {{foundation}} {{species can}} determine biological community structure via facilitation cascades. We examined the density dependencies of facilitation cascades, including how {{the density of}} a basal foundation species influences the density of secondary foundation species, and how the density of secondary foundation species influences community structure. The system in which we assessed density dependencies was a temperate mangrove forest in which pneumatophores trap the fucoid alga Hormosira banksii and provide substrate for the oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. The alga and oyster in turn determine benthic community structure. In the field, algal biomass {{was positively correlated with}} <b>pneumatophore</b> density. Oysters, by contrast, were highly over-dispersed and correlated with the presence/ absence of pneumatophores. Epifaunal abundance and species richness were positively correlated with algal and oyster abundance, but their effects were independent. The positive effect of <b>pneumatophore</b> density on epifauna was primarily an indirect effect of trapping more algae. Pneumatophores did not directly influence invertebrate communities. Experiments revealed that, at very low <b>pneumatophore</b> densities, algal retention was insufficient to facilitate epifauna above that found on pneumatophores alone. At higher densities, however, increasing the density of pneumatophores increased algal retention, and the density and diversity of associated invertebrates. Shading by the mangrove canopy reduced algal biomass but did not modify the density-dependent nature of the cascade. Our results extend facilitation theory by showing that the density of both basal and secondary foundation species can be critical in triggering facilitation cascades. Our study also reveals that, where foundation species cooccur, multiple, independent cascades may arise from a single basal facilitator. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of density-dependent facilitation cascades in community assembly. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} value of temperate mangroves to fish, and the processes driving patterns of microhabitat use within this habitat, are unknown. There are 3 quickly identifiable microhabitats within temperate Australian mangroves: (1) forest (the area of mangroves with trees); (2) <b>pneumatophores</b> (the area directly seaward {{of the forest}} without trees but with <b>pneumatophores</b> [aerial roots]); and (3) channel (the area directly seaward of the <b>pneumatophores</b> without gross structural attributes such as trees or <b>pneumatophores).</b> Duplicate fyke and gill nets were both initially used to sample fish in the 3 microhabitats described above. Sampling took place across the seaward edge of mangroves on 10 sampling occasions (5 night and 5 day), in a large estuarine system in SE Australia. Fish assemblages (693 fish from 20 species and 15 families) varied significantly (p < 0. 05) between the forest and the channel, and between diel periods for each gear (net type), {{but there was little}} difference in the assemblage structure of fish between forest–pneumatophore or pneumatophore–channel microhabitats.

Highly quantitative pop nets provided a preliminary assessment of whether differential gear selectivity caused patterns between microhabitats, but less rich fish assemblages were again recorded in forests than in <b>pneumatophores.</b> The importance of predation in structuring fish assemblages across microhabitats was assessed by measuring survival of juvenile fish tethered in 3 predation treatments (predator exclusion, cage control, and uncaged). Survival rates were high across the predator treatments and did not vary among microhabitats.
