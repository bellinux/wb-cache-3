On 12 December it caught fire when a defective fuel gasket blew out; the repairs took a fortnight. Immediately before its maiden flight, a pair of experimental 23mm Shpitalny Sh-3 autocannon replaced the NS-23s. It first flew on 8 January 1947 with Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Ivanov, at the controls, although {{he was not the}} <b>primary</b> <b>test</b> pilot. The Yak-19 was grounded from 2 March to 18 May as it awaited a new engine. On 21 May, the afterburner was tested in flight for the first time. While the fighter was the first Soviet aircraft to be equipped with an afterburner, it was not the first one to use one in flight as the Aircraft 156 had done so over a month earlier. The second prototype first flew on 6 June and was almost identical with the first prototype.

40|$|SYNOPSIS <b>Primary</b> {{sensitivity}} <b>tests</b> {{were done}} on 90 specimens of infected urine, {{and the results}} were compared with those of secondary tests on pure cultures done by three diffusion methods. There was good correlation between the four methods. In a second study, the reliability of <b>primary</b> <b>tests</b> prepared in the clinical laboratory on specimens of pus was assessed, and the frequency with which a definitive result was obtained with different types of specimen was determined. Recom-mendations are made for the economic use of these tests. Direct (or 'primary') sensitivity tests, in which discs are applied to plates inoculated from the specimen, are widely used in Great Britain, but their reliability is often questioned by workers in other countries. The advantages claimed for these tests are, first, speed, as the result may be available on the following day; second, the identification of small numbers of resistant organisms in a predominantly sensitive population; and, third, their value as selective media in mixed cultures. Nevertheless, it has to be admitted that little attempt has been made to prove their validity. This paper describes two studies in which the reliability of <b>primary</b> sensitivity <b>tests</b> and their value in relation to different types of specimen are assessed. The first study concerns only specimens of urine. In this, the results of <b>primary</b> sensitivity <b>tests</b> were compared with those of tests on pure cultures done by the same method, by the Kirby-Bauer method, and by the method recommended by the Inter-national Collaborative Study (ICS). The second investigation was concerned with specimens other than urine. In this, <b>primary</b> sensitivity <b>tests</b> prepared in the clinical laboratory were collected daily. The results from these were compared with those of the same tests repeated on pure cultures. They were then related to the source of the specimen, and the frequency with which a definitive result was obtained was determined...|$|R
