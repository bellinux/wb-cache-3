The characterization of the samples was done with scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy as well as electric measurements. We performed our study on two groups of samples: first group of samples, evaporated at room temperature for thickness ranging from 1. 5 up to 97 nm; second group of samples, for two different thicknesses of 3 nmand 50 nmevaporated at different substrate temperatures, between 110 and 530 K. The gold films show a Volmer–Weber growth. The complete films are obtained from samples with a <b>nominal</b> <b>thickness</b> of 8 nm deposited. The average grain diameter is constant, with <b>nominal</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of 18. 5 nm, up to 8 nm and increases with the thickness for higher deposition.

30|$|SLM is {{a complex}} process {{with a number of}} {{potential}} variables that could affect the performance of SLM manufactured tungsten collimators. Production accuracy, as a measure against <b>nominal</b> disk <b>thickness,</b> is an indication of the potential variation that may be experienced in septal thickness when manufacturing collimators. In this work, a deviation of −[*] 40 to 300  μm was measured against the <b>nominal</b> <b>thickness.</b> These values are comparable to that reported by Deprez et al. who observed variations of −[*] 260 to 650  μm. Duprez et al. took measurements from a diverging collimator; the diverging nature of the septa from the printing plane could explain the slightly larger variation observed compared to our study. The impact of such deviation is dependent on the <b>nominal</b> <b>thickness,</b> and in this work the mean deviation was 20 % (range −[*] 8 % to 52 %). The surface of the material is not perfectly smooth, and the physical measurements of thickness are based on the extremities of the surface which may partially account for observed variations.
