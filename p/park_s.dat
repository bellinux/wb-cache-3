40|$|AbstractLet X be a {{reflexive}} Banach space. We {{introduce the}} notion of weakly almost nonexpansive sequences (xn) n⩾ 0 in X, and study their asymptotic behavior by showing that the nonempty weak ω-limit set of the sequence (xn/n) n⩾ 1 always lies on a convex subset of a sphere centered at the origin of radius d=limn→∞‖xn/n‖. Subsequently we apply our results to study the asymptotic properties of unbounded trajectories for the quasi-autonomous dissipative system dudt+Au∋f, where A is an accretive (possibly multivalued) operator in X×X, and f−f∞∈Lp((0,+∞);X) for some f∞∈X and 1 ⩽p<∞.

50|$|The most {{aggressive}} campaign to restore tropical hardwood hammocks is {{being conducted by}} Dade County Parks and Recreation Department, Natural Areas Management Division (NAM). This program has been very active since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and has completed {{a substantial amount of}} management work in hammocks in four parks on the Miami Rock Ridge: The Charles Deering Estate, R. Hardy Matheson Preserve, Castellow Hammock Park, and Matheson Hammock <b>Park</b> (<b>S.</b> Vardaman, Dade County Park and Recreation Department, Natural Areas Management, personal communication 1998). All four of these parks have management plans which include recommendations for the control of exotic plants (Dade County Park and Recreation Department et al. 1991a; Dade County Park and Recreation Department et al. 1991b; Dade County Park and Recreation Department 1993, Dade County Park and Recreation Department 1994). Initial work has also been completed in hammocks at several more sites (e.g., Fuchs Hammock, Meisner Hammock, and Kendall Indian Hammock). This work has resulted from a multiagency collaboration including the Dade County Parks and Recreation Department, Fairchild Tropical Garden, Ecohorizons, Inc., and The Nature Conservancy, and was initiated in 1993 with the ultimate goal of restoring nearly 162 ha of rockland hammock (Wells and Hazelton 1997). Monitoring of this program at three hammocks has been conducted by C. Horvitz of the University of Miami (e.g., Horvitz 1996), and ongoing technical assistance has been provided by the Institute for Regional Conservation. NAM has also provided technical assistance and training to the City of Miami for the restoration of tropical hardwood hammocks there (Vardaman 1998). This included two of the three Brickell Hammock fragments that remain: parts of Alice Wainwright Park, and Simpson Park Hammock.|$|E
