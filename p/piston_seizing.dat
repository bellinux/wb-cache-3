5000|$|The Air-tractor sledge, {{the first}} {{aeroplane}} {{to be brought}} to Antarctica (in 1912) was stationed at Cape Denison, although it never took to the air on the continent because it was damaged before being shipped there. The aircraft, a Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane (the first aircraft type to be built by Vickers) was used briefly as a [...] "propeller driven snow tractor" [...] and then abandoned, as the <b>pistons</b> <b>seized</b> up due to the cold.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Seized</b> <b>pistons,</b> due to poor cooling {{caused by}} {{chemical}} erosion from incorrect lubricants.|$|R
50|$|At 6.30 a.m. on 20 October 1934, {{they began}} a {{non-stop}} leg {{to the first}} compulsory staging point at Baghdad, the only crew who managed {{to do so without}} stopping to refuel. Arriving next at Karachi they set a new England-India record. Problems began when their landing gear failed to retract and, after returning to Karachi for repairs, they were again delayed by difficulties with navigating at night. Worse problems followed when they made an unscheduled refuelling stop at Jabalpur but found no aviation fuel. Running instead on unsuitable fuel provided by the local bus company, a <b>piston</b> <b>seized</b> and an oil line ruptured. They flew on to Allahabad but, needing completely new engines, were forced to retire.|$|R
50|$|Failed {{lubrication}} {{can cause}} the pistons or <b>piston</b> rings to <b>seize</b> to the cylinder walls. Seizing can occur during engine use, via overheating and lack of oil, or during storage via condensation and corrosion.|$|R
50|$|Production {{problems}} at the Siemens works, and poor quality lubricating oil, gave the Sh.III engines a life expectancy of only seven to ten hours before <b>pistons</b> began to <b>seize.</b> The license-built Rhemag versions of the Sh.III did not have such problems, so the Siemens-made engines were gradually withdrawn from service.|$|R
50|$|The piston {{might be}} a fairly loose fit in the cylinder. If it were a tight fit, it would expand as it got hot and might stick tight in the cylinder. If a <b>piston</b> sticks (<b>seizes)</b> it could cause serious damage to the engine. On the other hand, if {{there is too much}} {{clearance}} between the piston and cylinder walls, much of the pressure from the burning gasoline vapour will leak past the piston (a condition known as blow-by) and into the crankcase, and the push on the piston from combustion will be much less effective in delivering power.|$|R
50|$|A {{prototype}} S-11, N2164K, {{was involved}} in an accident on 19 January 1991. The aircraft suffered an engine failure caused by a <b>seized</b> <b>piston</b> at altitude. The landing was hard and resulted in a fire. The pilot received serious injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board assessed cause factors as engine failure followed by a high descent rate on landing. The aircraft is listed as destroyed.|$|R
50|$|An {{analogous}} condition {{exists in}} an automobile with a manual transmission going down hill or any situation where the driver takes his or her foot off the gas pedal, closing the throttle; the wheels want to drive the engine, possibly at a higher RPM. In a two-stroke engine {{this can be a}} catastrophic situation: as many two stroke engines depend on a fuel/oil mixture for lubrication, a shortage of fuel to the engine would result in a shortage of oil in the cylinders, and the <b>pistons</b> would <b>seize</b> after a very short time causing extensive engine damage. Saab used a freewheel system in their two-stroke models for this reason and maintained it in the Saab 96 V4 and early Saab 99 for better fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|This {{attrition}} of the Italian challengers, {{combined with}} a very rapid fuel stop, moved the Ecurie Ecosse car of Flockhart/Bueb into the lead {{at the start of}} the third hour - a lead they would not relinquish. In the fourth hour, Musso, having fought back up to second place, was hobbled by another <b>seized</b> <b>piston</b> destroying his engine out on the Mulsanne straight just before dusk. With the Severi/Lewis-Evans Ferrari held back with braking problems, this left the Gendebien/Trintignant car as the sole challenger from Maranello, who took over second place from their teammates.|$|R
50|$|Once glazing or carbon {{build up}} has occurred, {{it can only}} be cured by {{stripping}} down the engine and re-boring the cylinder bores, machining new honing marks and stripping, cleaning and de-coking combustion chambers, fuel injector nozzles and valves. If the problem is detected in its early stages, running an engine at maximum load to raise the internal pressures and temperatures allows the piston rings to scrape glaze off the bores and allows carbon build-up to be burnt off. However, if glazing has been allowed to progress to the stage where the <b>piston</b> rings have <b>seized</b> into their grooves, this will not have any effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} Staaken R.XIV had two engine nacelles, each housing a pair of 350hp Austro-Daimler V-12 engines in a push-pull configuration.The nacelles were large enough for some inflight maintenance. The Austro-Daimler engines were installed without reduction gears and were the most powerful available at the time, but soon proved to be unreliable. On 12 April 1918, during its second flight of the acceptance program, a connecting rod broke {{in one of the}} rear engines.The Austro-Daimlers were replaced by four 300 hp Basse und Selve BuS.IVa engines and it was ready for further flight testing by 10 May 1918. The unproven Basse und Selves were also problematic and had a tendency to <b>seize</b> <b>pistons,</b> so they were in turn removed in favor of the less powerful but reliable 245 hp high-compression Maybach Mb.IVa. In an attempt to maintain the performance of the Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI, a fifth Maybach engine was installed in the nose.|$|R
5000|$|The V Due was a 500cc V-twin {{two-stroke}} motorcycle first {{manufactured by}} Bimota in 1997. Technical specs included the first electronically controlled {{direct fuel injection}} on a two-stroke bike, cassette type gearbox and dry clutch. Its power-to-weight ratio surpassed almost all sports bikes of the day. The first production run of 150 bikes suffered from major problems including oil leaks, <b>seized</b> <b>pistons</b> and intermittent power delivery. Many new owners simply returned their bikes at this point. In 1999 Bimota managed to fix most of the initial faults and made 26 units, all however were not road legal. In 2001 Bimota gave up with its problematic electronic fuel injection and fitted carburetors, first producing the non-road legal [...] "Evoluzione Corsa" [...] model of which only 14 were produced and finally the road legal [...] "Evoluzione" [...] model of which 120 where produced and sold. Today, due to its rarity, most V Dues are in the hand of collectors.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the poor}} weather {{leading up to}} race day, it began cloudy and humidly muggy. By the 4 pm start, the crowd was around 250,000. The usually quick and nimble Moss was slowed trying to squeeze into his cramped Maserati coup√© so the first car to clear the startline was the Ferrari of Peter Collins, leaving a long trail of rubber, {{followed}} by the three Aston Martins. Unfortunately, the final appearance of Talbot was rather ignominious: its transmission broke as it left its start-box and it only went a handful of metres giving its driver, Bruce Halford the shortest debut on record.At {{the end of the}} first lap, Collins was in the lead (already on lap-record pace, from a standing start), followed by Brooks, Hawthorn, Gendebien and Salvadori fifth. But on the second lap Collins dropped back to tenth with engine trouble, pitting at the end of the next lap to retire with a <b>seized</b> <b>piston.</b> The Ferrari of Hawthorn had taken over the lead, hounded by the Maseratis of Moss, then Behra, at a blistering pace.|$|R
40|$|In an AC 1 W IDI Lister Petter diesel engine, {{ignition}} delay reduced exponentially {{with an increase}} in engine speed for hempseed oil (HSO), camelina seed oil (CSO) and rapeseed oil (RSO). The polyunsaturated fuels HSO produced {{ignition delay}}s which were 0. 6 to 12. 4 %, 18. 7 to 32. 1 % and 10. 8 to 26. 8 % longer than RSO, rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and mineral diesel (MD) fuel respectively whilst CSO produced ignition delays which were 0 to 9. 8 %, 18. 4 to 29. 1 % and 11. 8 to 24. 8 % longer than RSO, RME and MD fuel respectively. Ignition delays increased with a 5 o Crank Angle (CA) advance in fuel injection timing by 2. 7 to 19. 2 %, 0. 9 to 11. 1 % and 0. 12 to 17. 0 % for RSO, CSO and HSO respectively. A reduction in ignition delay was noted for RSO, CSO and HSO by 5 to 7. 1 %, 1. 4 to 9. 5 % and 7. 9 to 13. 5 % except above 3100 rpm at 5 oCA retarded fuel injection timing. Maximum power outputs of HSO (4. 12 kW), and CSO(4. 38 kW) were lower when compared with MD fuel (4. 43 kW) however maximum power outputs for RSO (4. 47 kW) and RME (4. 63 kW) were both higher when compared with MD fuel (4. 43 kW) at standard fuel injection timing. After 28 days HSO, CSO, RME and WCOME increased in acid value from 8. 1 to 178. 4 % and peroxide value varied from - 63. 64 % to 321. 85 %. Ignition delay, combustion chamber peak pressure signal and rate of pressure rise were unaffected by storage of the oils. Advancing fuel injection timing by 5 oCA in a 1. 5 L Tempest (BMC) engine had no significant effect on the power, torque and BMEP for RME, NOx and smoke emissions increased by 10. 7 to 41. 5 % and by 24. 5 to 74. 3 % respectively and CO reduced by 14. 4 to 21. 6 % at BMEP BMEP> 250 kPa. HSO and CSO gave 4. 9 % and 5. 6 % higher maximum power than RSO, 12. 6 % and 13. 3 % more than RME and WCOME and 17. 4 % and 18. 1 % more than MD fuel respectively in a 1. 8 L NA IDI Ford Courier. HSO used 2. 6 to 15. 9 % and 1. 8 to 11. 2 % more fuel than RME and WCOME respectively whilst CSO used 2. 1 to 16. 3 % and 2. 1 to 12 % more fuel than RME and WCOME respectively except above 3700 rpm. HSO and CSO used 9. 1 to 42. 6 % and 0 to 43. 1 % more fuel than MD fuel for all engine speeds. Mean NOx increased by 11. 4 to 40. 2 % for HSO and 15. 7 to 35. 1 % for CSO above 1800 rpm compared with RME. NOx was higher by 11. 9 to 34. 6 % for HSO and by 16. 2 to 29. 7 % higher for CSO for all engine speeds than WCOME. Both HSO and CSO increased NOx by 6. 9 to 55. 1 % and 5. 1 to 56. 9 % compared with MD fuel above 1800 rpm. RME and WCOME gave 2. 2 to 26. 7 % and 1. 8 to 25 % greater NOx respectively than MD fuel above 3750 rpm. After 492 kWh use, RME gave carbon deposits on cylinder head, valves, piston crown and fuel injector in a 2 kW DI diesel generator and the top <b>piston</b> ring was <b>seized.</b> Carbon build up on the inlet valve and port was between 1. 2 x 10 - 3 and 3. 8 x 10 - 3 mm/kWh. An exponential rise in lubricating oil consumption and fuel consumption after 288 kWh indicated the start of engine wear out. Neoprene and reinforced polyurethane are not suitable materials for RME fuel lines. The use of 100 % RME in a 1. 3 L TDI ESB fleet vehicle resulted in a reduction in the maximum power output (40. 4 kW) of 6. 9 % after 11023 km (nine months) to 37. 6 kW whilst maximum power output (53. 5 kW) reduced by 4. 4 % to 48. 75 kW with the use of 30 %RME/ 70 % MD fuel in a 2. 0 L TDI ESB fleet vehicle after 22459 km (nine months).
