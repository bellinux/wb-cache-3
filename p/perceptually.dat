25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called imperceptible if the original cover signal and the marked signal are <b>perceptually</b> indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|This (u,v) {{chromaticity}} space {{became the}} CIE 1960 color space, {{which is still}} {{used to calculate the}} CCT (even though MacAdam did not devise it with this purpose in mind). Using other chromaticity spaces, such as u'v, leads to non-standard results that may nevertheless be <b>perceptually</b> meaningful.|$|E
25|$|The 1976 {{formula is}} the first color-difference formula that related a {{measured}} to a known set of CIELAB coordinates. This formula has been succeeded by the 1994 and 2000 formulas because the CIELAB space {{turned out to be}} not as <b>perceptually</b> uniform as intended, especially in the saturated regions. This means that this formula rates these colors too highly as opposed to other colors.|$|E
25|$|The high {{dynamic range}} image is passed to a tone mapping operator, {{in this case a}} local operator, which {{transforms}} the image into a low dynamic range image suitable for viewing on a monitor. Relative to the church interior, the stained-glass window is displayed at a much lower brightness than a linear mapping between scene radiance and pixel intensity would produce. However, this inaccuracy is <b>perceptually</b> less important than the image detail, which can now be shown in both the window and the church interior simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{creative}} {{arts are}} often divided into more specific categories, typically along <b>perceptually</b> distinguishable {{categories such as}} media, genre, styles, and form. Art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., figurae), such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value. Form may also include visual design principles, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm.|$|E
25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called robust {{with respect to}} transformations if the embedded information may be detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, additive noise, and quantization. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A {{digital watermark}} is called imperceptible if the watermarked content is <b>perceptually</b> equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content. In general, {{it is easy to}} create either robust watermarks—or—imperceptible watermarks, but the creation of both robust—and—imperceptible watermarks has proven to be quite challenging. Robust imperceptible watermarks have been proposed as a tool for the protection of digital content, for example as an embedded no-copy-allowed flag in professional video content.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} that uncertainty in sensory domains results in an increased dependence of multisensory integration. Hence, it follows that cues from multiple modalities that are both temporally and spatially synchronous are viewed neurally and <b>perceptually</b> as emanating from the same source. The degree of synchrony that is required for this 'binding' to occur is currently being investigated {{in a variety of}} approaches. It should be noted here that the integrative function only occurs to a point beyond which the subject can differentiate them as two opposing stimuli. Concurrently, a significant intermediate conclusion can be drawn from the research thus far. Multisensory stimuli that are bound into a single percept, are also bound on the same receptive fields of multisensory neurons in the SC and cortex.|$|E
25|$|In {{a classic}} experiment, Richard M. Warren (1970) {{replaced}} one phoneme {{of a word}} with a cough-like sound. His subjects restored the missing speech sound <b>perceptually</b> without any difficulty and could not accurately identify which phoneme had been disturbed. This {{is known as the}} phonemic restoration effect. Another basic experiment compares recognition of naturally spoken words presented in a sentence (or at least a phrase) and the same words presented in isolation. Perception accuracy usually drops in the latter condition. Garnes and Bond (1976) also used carrier sentences when researching the influence of semantic knowledge on perception. They created series of words differing in one phoneme (bay/day/gay, for example). The quality of the first phoneme changed along a continuum. All these stimuli were put into different sentences each of which made sense with one of the words only. Listeners had a tendency to judge the ambiguous words (when the first segment was at the boundary between categories) according to the meaning of the whole sentence.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that there is a distinction, often confounded in acquisition research, between mapping a label to a specific instance or individual and mapping a label to an entire class of objects. This latter process is sometimes referred to as generalization or rule learning. Research has shown that if input is encoded in terms of <b>perceptually</b> salient dimensions rather than specific details and if patterns in the input indicate that a number of objects are named interchangeably in the same context, a language learner will be much more likely to generalize that name to every instance with the relevant features. This tendency is heavily dependent on the consistency of context clues and the degree to which word contexts overlap in the input. These differences are furthermore linked to the well-known patterns of under and overgeneralization in infant word learning. Research has also shown that the frequency in co-occurrence of referents is tracked as well, which helps create associations and dispel ambiguities in object-referent models.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform <b>perceptually</b> into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E
500|$|Einar Haugen {{expanded}} the diaphonic {{approach to the}} study of bilingualism, believing diaphones represented the process of interlingual identification wherein sounds from different languages are <b>perceptually</b> linked into a single category. [...] Because interlingual identifications may happen between unrelated varieties, it is possible to construct a diasystem for many different language contact situations, with the appropriateness of such a construction depending on its purpose and its simplicity depending on how isomorphic the phonology of the systems are. [...] For example, the Spanish of Los Ojos (a small village in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico) and the local variety of Southwestern English are fairly isomorphic with each other so a diaphonic approach for such a language contact situation would be relatively straightforward. [...] makes use of a diaphonic approach [...] in discussing the phonology of the pidgin English used by Japanese immigrants on Hawaiian plantations.|$|E
500|$|The {{mismatch}} negativity (MMN) is a rigorously documented ERP component {{frequently used}} in neurolinguistic experiments. [...] It is an electrophysiological response {{that occurs in}} the brain when a subject hears a [...] "deviant" [...] stimulus {{in a set of}} <b>perceptually</b> identical [...] "standards" [...] (as in the sequence s s s s s s s d d s s s s s s d s s s s s d). [...] Since the MMN is elicited only in response to a rare [...] "oddball" [...] stimulus in a set of other stimuli that are perceived to be the same, it has been used to test how speakers perceive sounds and organize stimuli categorically. For example, a landmark study by Colin Phillips and colleagues used the mismatch negativity as evidence that subjects, when presented with a series of speech sounds with acoustic parameters, perceived all the sounds as either /t/ or /d/ in spite of the acoustic variability, suggesting that the human brain has representations of abstract phonemesin other words, the subjects were [...] "hearing" [...] not the specific acoustic features, but only the abstract phonemes. [...] In addition, the mismatch negativity has been used to study syntactic processing and the recognition of word category.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there are}} small {{spectral}} differences between [...] and , {{it has not}} been established that they are <b>perceptually</b> significant.|$|E
2500|$|Tolerancing {{concerns}} the question [...] "What {{is a set}} of colors that are imperceptibly/acceptably close to a given reference?" [...] If the distance measure is <b>perceptually</b> uniform, then the answer is simply [...] "the set of points whose distance to the reference is less than the just-noticeable-difference (JND) threshold." [...] This requires a <b>perceptually</b> uniform metric in order for the threshold to be constant throughout the gamut (range of colors). Otherwise, the threshold will be a function of the reference color—cumbersome as a practical guide.|$|E
2500|$|Law of Symmetry—The law of {{symmetry}} {{states that}} the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is <b>perceptually</b> pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts. [...] Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind <b>perceptually</b> connects them to form a coherent shape. [...] Similarities between symmetrical objects {{increase the likelihood that}} objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets. [...] When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.|$|E
2500|$|The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) {{developed}} the XYZ model for describing {{the colors of}} light spectra in 1931, but its goal was to match human visual metamerism, rather than to be <b>perceptually</b> uniform, geometrically. In the 1960s and 70s, {{attempts were made to}} transform XYZ colors into a more relevant geometry, influenced by the Munsell system. These efforts culminated in the 1976 CIELUV and CIELAB models. The dimensions of these models— and , respectively—are cartesian, based on the opponent process theory of color, but both are also often described using polar coordinates— or [...] and also HCL, where L* is lightness, C* is chroma, and h* is hue angle. Officially, both CIELAB and CIELUV were created for their color difference metrics ∆E*ab and ∆E*uv, particularly for use defining color tolerances, but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models, including in computer graphics and computer vision. For example, gamut mapping in ICC color management is usually performed in CIELAB space, and Adobe Photoshop includes a CIELAB mode for editing images. CIELAB and CIELUV geometries are much more <b>perceptually</b> relevant than many others such as RGB, HSL, HSV, YUV/YIQ/YCbCr or XYZ, but are not <b>perceptually</b> perfect, and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions.|$|E
2500|$|If we take {{an image}} and extract the hue, saturation, and {{lightness}} or value components, and then compare these to {{the components of}} the same name as defined by color scientists, we can quickly see the difference, <b>perceptually.</b> For example, examine the following images of a fire breather (...) [...] The original is in the sRGB colorspace. [...] CIELAB L* is a CIE-defined achromatic lightness quantity (dependent solely on the <b>perceptually</b> achromatic luminance Y, but not the mixed-chromatic components X or Z, of the CIEXYZ colorspace from which the sRGB colorspace itself is derived), and it is plain that this appears similar in perceptual lightness to the original color image. Luma is roughly similar, but differs somewhat at high chroma, where it deviates most from depending solely on the true achromatic luminance (Y, or equivalently L*) and is influenced by the colorimetric chromaticity (x,y, or equivalently, a*,b* of CIELAB). [...] HSL L and HSV V, by contrast, diverge substantially from perceptual lightness.|$|E
2500|$|A more <b>perceptually</b> {{relevant}} {{alternative is}} to use luma, , as a lightness dimension (...) [...] Luma is the weighted average of gamma-corrected R, G, and B, based on their contribution to perceived lightness, long used as the monochromatic dimension in color television broadcast. For the Rec. 709 primaries used in sRGB, for the Rec. 601 NTSC primaries, for other primaries different coefficients should be used.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{the notion}} of {{consciousness}} as drafts {{is not unique to}} Dennett. According to Hankins, Dieter Teichert suggests that Paul Ricoeur's theories agree with Dennett's on the notion that [...] "the self is basically a narrative entity, and that any attempt to give it a free-floating independent status is misguided." [...] Others see Derrida's (1982) representationalism as consistent with {{the notion of}} a mind that has <b>perceptually</b> changing content without a definitive present instant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} gestalt was first {{introduced}} in philosophy and psychology in 1890 by Christian von Ehrenfels (a member of the School of Brentano). The idea of gestalt {{has its roots in}} theories by David Hume, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant, David Hartley, [...] and Ernst Mach. Max Wertheimer's unique contribution was to insist that the [...] "gestalt" [...] is <b>perceptually</b> primary, defining the parts it was composed from, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts, as von Ehrenfels's earlier Gestalt-Qualität had been.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{consists}} of three independent dimensions which can be represented cylindrically in three dimensions as an irregular color solid: hue, measured by degrees around horizontal circles; chroma, measured radially outward from the neutral (gray) vertical axis; and value, measured vertically from 0 (black) to 10 (white). [...] Munsell determined the spacing of colors along these dimensions by taking measurements of human visual responses. [...] In each dimension, Munsell colors are as close to <b>perceptually</b> uniform as he could make them, which makes the resulting shape quite irregular. [...] As Munsell explains: ...|$|E
2500|$|A false {{awakening}} is one {{in which}} the subject believes he/she has woken up, whether from a lucid or a non-lucid dream, but is in fact still asleep. [...] Sometimes the experience is so realistic <b>perceptually</b> (the sleeper seeming to wake {{in his or her own}} bedroom, for example) that insight is not achieved at once, or even until the dreamer really wakes up and realises that what has occurred was hallucinatory. [...] Such experiences seem particularly liable to occur to those who deliberately cultivate lucid dreams. [...] However, they may also occur spontaneously and be associated with the experience of sleep paralysis.|$|E
2500|$|For {{fluctuation}} rates {{comparable to}} the auditory filter bandwidth, the degree, rate, and shape of a complex signal's amplitude fluctuations are variables that are manipulated by musicians of various cultures to exploit the beating and roughness sensations, making amplitude fluctuation a significant expressive tool {{in the production of}} musical sound. Otherwise, when there is no pronounced beating or roughness, the degree, rate, and shape of a complex signal's amplitude fluctuations remain important, through their interaction with the signal's spectral components. This interaction is manifested <b>perceptually</b> in terms of pitch or timbre variations, linked to the introduction of combination tones ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Limerence is {{sometimes}} also interpreted as infatuation, {{or what is}} colloquially known as a [...] "crush". [...] However, in common speech, infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information, and is usually short-lived. [...] Tennov notes how limerence [...] "may dissolve soon after its initiation, as in an early teenage buzz-centered crush", but she {{is more concerned with}} the point when [...] "limerent bonds are characterized by 'entropy' crystallization as described by Stendhal in his 1821 treatise On Love, where a new love infatuation <b>perceptually</b> begins to transform ... attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention ... a 'limerent object'".|$|E
2500|$|Law of Similarity—The law of {{similarity}} states that elements within {{an assortment of}} objects are <b>perceptually</b> grouped together if they are similar to each other. [...] This similarity can occur {{in the form of}} shape, colour, shading or other qualities. [...] For example, the figure illustrating the law {{of similarity}} portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square. [...] In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark and 18 of the circles are shaded light. [...] We perceive the dark circles as grouped together, and the light circles as grouped together forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.|$|E
2500|$|Fusion or pattern matching: {{fundamentals}} may {{be perceived}} through pattern matching of the separately analyzed partials to a best-fit exact-harmonic template ( [...] , [...] ) or the best-fit subharmonic ( [...] , [...] ), or harmonics may be <b>perceptually</b> fused into one entity, with dissonances being those intervals less likely mistaken for unisons, the imperfect intervals, because of the multiple estimates, at perfect intervals, of fundamentals, for one harmonic tone ( [...] , [...] ). By these definitions, inharmonic partials of otherwise harmonic spectra are usually processed separately (Hartmann et al., 1990), unless frequency or amplitude modulated coherently with the harmonic partials [...] For some of these definitions, neural firing supplies the data for pattern matching; see directly below (e.g., [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Several earlier color order systems {{had placed}} colors into a {{three-dimensional}} color solid of {{one form or}} another, but Munsell {{was the first to}} separate hue, value, and chroma into <b>perceptually</b> uniform and independent dimensions, and {{he was the first to}} systematically illustrate the colors in three-dimensional space. [...] Munsell’s system, particularly the later renotations, is based on rigorous measurements of human subjects’ visual responses to color, putting it on a firm experimental scientific basis. [...] Because of this basis in human visual perception, Munsell’s system has outlasted its contemporary color models, and though it has been superseded for some uses by models such as CIELAB (L*a*b*) and CIECAM02, it is still in wide use today.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{none of the}} {{dimensions}} in these spaces match their perceptual analogs, the value of HSV and the saturation of HSL are particular offenders. In HSV, the blue primary [...] and white [...] are held {{to have the same}} value, even though <b>perceptually</b> the blue primary has somewhere around 10% of the luminance of white (the exact fraction depends on the particular RGB primaries in use). In HSL, a mix of 100% red, 100% green, 90% blue—that is, a very light yellow —is held to have the same saturation as the green primary [...] even though the former color has almost no chroma or saturation by the conventional psychometric definitions. Such perversities led Cynthia Brewer, expert in color scheme choices for maps and information displays, to tell the American Statistical Association: ...|$|E
2500|$|Wodiczko {{created the}} Personal Instrument in 1969, his first {{conceptual}} design work {{taken into the}} public sphere. Though he had a degree in industrial design and created popular electronics for a Polish manufacturer, his design philosophy was influenced by Russian constructivism epitomized by the poet/artist Vladimir Mayakovsky’s statement, “the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes.” ‘‘The Personal Instrument’’ consisted of a microphone, worn on the forehead, which retrieved sound while photo-receivers in gloves isolated and filtered the sound through {{the movement of the}} hand, which was then perceived discriminately by the artist, <b>perceptually</b> confined by the sound-proof headphones. By emphasizing selective listening, vital (under authoritarian restrictions) to a Polish citizen’s survival, Wodiczko intimated the prevalence of censored speech, registering “dissent of a system that fostered one-directional critical thinking – listening over speech.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} entirely on sound stages at L.A. Center Studios in downtown Los Angeles. The animal characters were created entirely in key frame computer animation, {{with the assistance}} of footage of real animal movement, the actors recording their lines, and performance capture for reference. The production team underwent a thorough process to realistically convey the animals' speaking, while still making them <b>perceptually</b> believable to the audience. Favreau researched earlier films featuring anthropomorphic animals—including Walt Disney's animated features, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Bambi, as well as modern films such as Babe—and adopted certain techniques from those films into The Jungle Book. Nearly 70 separate species of animals native to India are featured in the film, with several species being portrayed as [...] "150% larger" [...] than their actual counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|The use of red wax is {{also part}} of his repertoire, evocative of flesh, blood, and transfiguration. In 2007, he showed Svayambh (which {{translated}} from Sanskrit means [...] "self-generated"), a 1.5-metre block of red wax that moved on rails through the Nantes Musée des Beaux-Arts as part of the Biennale estuaire; this piece was shown again in a major show at the Haus Der Kunst in Munich and in 2009 at the Royal Academy in London. Some his work blurs the boundaries between architecture and art. In 2008, Kapoor created Memory in Berlin and New York for the Guggenheim Foundation, his first piece in Cor-Ten, which is formulated to produce a protective coating of rust. Weighing 24 tons and made up of 156 parts, it calls to mind Richard Serra’s huge, rusty steel works, which also invite viewers into <b>perceptually</b> confounding interiors.|$|E
2500|$|Law of Good Gestalt—The law of good gestalt {{explains}} that elements of objects {{tend to be}} <b>perceptually</b> grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form. [...] Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning. [...] This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good gestalt focuses {{on the idea of}} conciseness, which is what all of gestalt theory is based on. This law has also been called the law of Prägnanz. [...] Prägnanz is a German word that directly translates to mean [...] "pithiness" [...] and implies the ideas of salience, conciseness and orderliness.|$|E
2500|$|Law of Closure—The law {{of closure}} states that {{individuals}} perceive {{objects such as}} shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole {{when they are not}} complete. [...] Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle {{on the left side of}} the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image. [...] However, gaps are present in the shapes. [...] If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we <b>perceptually</b> combine the lines into whole shapes.|$|E
2500|$|Rand {{held that}} {{existence}} is the <b>perceptually</b> self-evident fact {{at the base}} of all other knowledge, i.e., that [...] "existence exists." [...] She further held that to be is to be something, that [...] "existence is identity." [...] That is, to be is to be [...] "an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes." [...] That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist. The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one's first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge. As Rand wrote, [...] "A leaf ... cannot be all red and green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time... A is A." [...] Objectivism rejects belief in anything alleged to transcend existence.|$|E
2500|$|Psychotic-like symptoms, such as {{hallucinations}} {{and unusual}} perceptual experience, involve gross alterations {{in the experience}} of reality. Normal perception is substantially constructive and what we perceive [...] is strongly influenced by our prior experiences and expectancies. [...] Healthy individuals prone to hallucinations, or scoring highly on psychometric measures of positive schizotypy, [...] tend to show a bias toward reporting stimuli that did not occur under <b>perceptually</b> ambiguous experimental conditions. [...] During visual detection of fast-moving words, undergraduate students scoring highly on positive schizotypy had significantly high rates of false perceptions of words (i.e. reported seeing words that {{were not included in the}} experimental trials). [...] Positive schizotypal symptoms in healthy adults seem to predict false perceptions in laboratory tasks and certain environmental parameters such as perceptual load and frequency of visual targets [...] are critical in the [...] generation of false perceptions. When detection of events becomes either effortless or cognitively demanding, generation of such biases can be prevented.|$|E
2500|$|More recently— in 2012— anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic {{diversity}} {{to suggest}} a date consistent with this. [...] "Phonemic diversity" [...] denotes the number of <b>perceptually</b> distinct units of sound— consonants, vowels and tones— in a language. The current worldwide pattern of phonemic diversity potentially contains the statistical signal of the expansion of modern Homo sapiens out of Africa, beginning around 60-70 thousand years ago. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly {{and can be used}} as a clock to calculate how long the oldest African languages would have to have been around in order to accumulate the number of phonemes they possess today. As human populations left Africa and expanded into the rest of the world, they underwent a series of bottlenecks— points at which only a very small population survived to colonise a new continent or region. Allegedly such population crash led to a corresponding reduction in genetic, phenotypic and phonemic diversity. African languages today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized. For example, Rotokas, a language of New Guinea, and Pirahã, spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes, while !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes.|$|E
