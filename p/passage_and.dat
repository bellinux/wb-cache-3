Heavy rain fell across a few islands and copious lightning was reported. No known damage or loss of life took place.|$|E

5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion <b>passage,</b> <b>and</b> several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick. Based on {{the properties of the}} dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{possible}} to estimate the chances of another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion <b>passage</b> <b>and</b> had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
