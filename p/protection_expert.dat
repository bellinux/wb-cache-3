Additionally, interviews were carried out with 40 of the experts, who were grouped into different categories to discover whether there were any striking differences of opinion between experts of different backgrounds. Their assessments revealed few statistically relevant differences, though some are worth noting: Chinese researchers, project managers and representatives of NGOs were more positive than international experts regarding the impact of the Rio+ 20 conference on climate change discourse in China. Also, the youngest experts with the least international experience evaluated the potential of green volunteer work highest. " (author's abstract...|$|R

Participants in this task were required to implement a privacy filter or a combination of filters to protect various personal information regions in video sequences as provided. The challenge was to achieve an adequate balance between the degree of privacy protection, intelligibility (how much useful information is retained post privacy filtering), and pleasantness (how minimal were the adverse effects of filtering on the appearance of the video frames). The submissions from the eight (8) teams who participated in this task were evaluated subjectively by surveillance <b>experts,</b> practitioners, data <b>protection</b> <b>experts</b> and by naïve viewers using a crowdsourcing approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|The flow of {{international}} travellers {{to and from}} malaria-endemic areas, especially Africa, has increased in recent years. Apart from the very high morbidity and mortality burden imposed on malaria-endemic areas, imported malaria is {{the main cause of}} fever possibly causing severe disease and death in travellers coming from tropical and subtropical areas, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of behavioural preventive measures (bed nets, repellents, etc.), adequate chemoprophylaxis and, in selected circumstances, stand-by emergency treatment may not be overemphasized. However, no prophylactic regimen may offer complete <b>protection.</b> <b>Expert</b> advice is needed to tailor prophylactic advice according to traveller (age, baseline clinical conditions, etc.) and travel (destination, season, etc.) characteristics in order to reduce malaria risk...|$|E
40|$|Misuse of {{declared}} {{nuclear facilities}} {{is one of}} the important proliferation threats. The robustness of a facility against these threats is characterized by a number of proliferation resistance (PR) measures. This paper evaluates and compares PR measures for several misuse scenarios using a Markov model approach to implement the pathway analysis methodology being developed by the PR&PP (Proliferation Resistance and Physical <b>Protection)</b> <b>Expert</b> Group. Different misue strategies can be adopted by a proliferator and each strategy is expected to have different impacts on the proliferator's success. Selected as the probabilistic measure to represent proliferation resistance, the probabilities of the proliferator's success of misusing a hypothetical ESFR (Example Sodium Fast Reactor) facility system are calculated using the Markov model based on the pathways constructed for individual misuse scenarios. Insights from a comparison of strategies that are likely to be adopted by the proliferator are discussed in this paper...|$|E
