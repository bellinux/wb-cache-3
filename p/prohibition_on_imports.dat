5000|$|Justice Woodbury also {{formed the}} basis for the {{interpretation}} of the Commerce Clause in the License Cases, in which he developed a case-by-case method for determining the extent of state regulatory power. His reasoning was the basis for the Cooley Doctrine, a later development by his successor, Justice Benjamin R. Curtis. The most important cases Woodbury wrote an opinion for were the License Cases. In these cases, the Court dealt with state liquor-censoring statutes. Lacking a clear precedent for how much power the states had under the Constitution to regulate commerce, the justices were not unified enough to write a majority opinion. Woodbury's opinion focused on the context on a case-by-case basis instead of deciding based on an abstract principle of commerce power. He stated, [...] "The subject of buying and selling within a state is one as exclusively belonging {{to the power of the}} state over its internal trade as that to regulate foreign commerce is with the general government under the broadest construction of that power." [...] He distinguishes between a prohibition to sell liquor on a certain day and a <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports,</b> which would reach into the federal government's jurisdiction of commerce. Woodbury studied the particulars of the case instead of examining only the source of power in the Commerce Clause. The Court later followed Woodbury's reasoning in Cooley v. Board of Wardens, where it held that the Court would decide on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether the subject of regulation was local in nature or required national legislation. Woodbury's opinion helped bring about this shift in thinking on the Court.|$|E
40|$|The {{motor vehicle}} {{industry}} in the Philippines is regulated and protected by the provisions of development programs for cars, commercial vehicles, and motorcycles. Each program virtually prohibits the import of completely built-up vehicles, specifies minimum local content requirements for vehicles assembled in the country from imported completely knocked-down kits, and requires that firms assembling kits export to earn foreign exchange {{to cover the cost}} of the kits. Similar protective regimes have existed in a number of countries, especially in Latin America. The author develops a model to illustrate the economic impact and welfare cost of import prohibitions, local content requirements, and export requirements. She applies that model to Philippine data. Her results indicate that the protective regime in the Philippines imposes substantial costs on consumers and encourages the allocation of resources to relatively high-cost activities. Eliminating all of the restrictions overnight may lead to adjustment problems, but gradual liberalization could limit these problems. The proportion of domestic content required, the percentage of compensatory exports required for kits, and the tariff rates on kits could be lowered in stages, according to a preannounced schedule, to allow gradual adjustment. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> of assembled vehicles could be replaced by a tariff and phased out gradually. To avoid proportionately more protection of the assembly industry, the tariff on finished autos could be phased out more quickly than the other tariffs, to avoid sending false signals to the domestic industry about the direction of adjustment. To avoid increasing the effective rate of protection on assembly operations during liberalization, elimination of the domestic content and compensatory export requirements should be accompanied by decreases in the tariff rates on assembled vehicles.

Third, numerical analysis indicates that a sufficiently high seizure rate that is larger than a critical value is required to enhance economic growth.

40|$|The {{water buffalo}} is an {{important}} domestic animal worldwide and the local Buffalypso variety was developed in Trinidad to have improved beef qualities. Brucellosis was diagnosed in Trinidad and Tobago during 1998 in both cattle and domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) populations. Brucellosis in the latter species is caused by infection with Brucella abortus, similar to bovine brucellosis. Control of brucellosis {{is of paramount importance}} to preservation of the genetic diversity of these animals in Trinidad, and this has been complicated by differences in the epidemiology of water buffalo and bovine brucellosis. Some diagnostic tests do not have comparable accuracy between the two species, and the RB 51 vaccine does not adequately protect against infection in water buffalo. The water buffalo in Trinidad may also be more resistant to infection than cattle. Development of effective vaccination protocols is key to control disease in Buffalypso in Trinidad, and <b>prohibitions</b> <b>on</b> <b>import</b> of virulent B. abortus strains for vaccine efficacy studies has impeded progress in this area.

[...] Hernandarias was elected unanimously by the caudillo in AsunciÃ³n as the governor of Rio de la Plata province, including Buenos Aires. Hernandarias {{would go on to}} serve three terms as governor: 1597-1599, 1602-1609, and 1615-1617. [...] As governor, he enacted a number of policies to stimulate the growth of what was at that time a small port town. These included the creation of the first primary schools, kilns for creating bricks and tiles to replace adobe as a construction material, and the rebuilding of a fortress to protect the city from pirates. Following the capture of two anchored ships by English privateers on March 18, 1607, he ordered the construction of a larger fort {{at the mouth of the}} Matanza River, in what is now the neighborhood of Vuelta de Rocha. He also enacted measures against smuggling caused by <b>prohibitions</b> <b>on</b> <b>import,</b> export and the African slave trade. During his term as governor of Buenos Aires, Hernandarias started several expeditions, including ones to Uruguay and Brazil to rein in the Portuguese bandeirantes, explore the Patagonia, survey the navigability of rivers and to find the mythical City of the Caesars.

50|$|Nesbitt was {{appointed}} Australian Trade Commissioner in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1934 and his primary {{task was to}} cultivate Australia and New Zealand trade. He managed the trade diversion issue and negotiated a number of sensitive issues of trade diplomacy. New Zealand had for many years imported fresh citrus and pineapples from Australia but, in 1932, it imposed an embargo. This was in part retaliation against the Australian <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> the <b>import</b> of New Zealand potatoes {{that had been in}} force for several years. In 1933, Sir Walter Massy Greene initiated a discussion on these matters and secured a partial lifting of the embargo. Nesbitt was responsible for continuing the negotiations, and for tackling issues such as New Zealand's duties being higher than the British preferential rate. There are only limited records of Nesbittâ€™s time in New Zealand, but a measure of his effectiveness is indicated by the substantial growth in Australia-New Zealand trade in the mid-1930s and the avoidance of major trade disputes. In 1937, Nesbitt left the service to become chairman of the Milk Board of New South Wales.|$|R
40|$|Australia is the world's {{second largest}} beef exporter, {{dominating}} the highest value beef markets of Japan and Korea. Australia's competitiveness is underpinned primarily by its freedom from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) â€”better known as 'Mad Cow' diseaseâ€”thanks to strict animal feeding and importation regulations adopted in 1966. Why then would the Australian beef industry appear {{to agree to}} soften <b>prohibitions</b> <b>on</b> beef <b>imports</b> from BSE-affected countries, which would {{have the effect of}} opening Australia to BSE and potentially destroying its BSE-free status, along with its prime Asian markets? Our analysis begins with commitments that appear to have been made under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. If our interpretation is correct, these commitments would compel Australia to accommodate US trade goals by recognising and adopting the weaker international standards on meat trade. To understand why the US would want Australia to abandon its stringent BSE safeguards, we consider wider US policy on BSE and beef exports, and its strategy for re-entering the valuable Japanese and Korean markets. To explain why the Australian beef industry might allow its interests to be sacrificed to serve US trade goals, we examine institutional and ownership features of the industry. Government pre-emption or 'capture', we suggest, explains industry subservience. The apparent willingness of the Australian government to sideline its country's economic interests in order to serve those of a foreign power raises the question of Australian exceptionalism. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{germplasm}} collections can be invaluable {{resources to}} plant breeders, provided they are well-characterized. After 140 years of acquisition and curation efforts {{by a wide}} and largely non-coordinated array of private and institutional actors, the current US collection of cold-hardy kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) is rife with misclassifications, misnomers, and mix-ups. To facilitate the systematic improvement and resource-efficient curation of these species of long-recognized horticultural potential, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data to deconvolute this historic collection. Evaluation {{of a total of}} 138 accessions (103 A. arguta, 28 A. kolomikta, and 7 A. polygama) with an interspecific set of 1, 040 high-quality SNPs resulted in clear resolution of the three species. Intraspecific analysis (2, 964 SNPs) within A. arguta revealed a significant level of redundancy (41. 7 %; only 60 unique genotypes out of 103 analyzed) and a sub-population structure reflecting likely geographic provenance, phenotypic classes, and hybrid pedigree. For A. kolomikta (3, 425 SNPs), the level of accession redundancy was even higher (53. 6 %; 13 unique genotypes out of 28 analyzed); but no sub-structure was detected. Numerous instances were discovered of distinct genotypes sharing a common name, different names assigned to the same genotype, mistaken species assignments, and incorrect gender records, all critical information for both breeders and curators. In terms of method, this study demonstrates the practical and cost-effective use of GBS data to characterize plant genetic resources, despite ploidy differences and the lack of reference genomes. With the recent <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> further <b>imports</b> of Actinidia plant material into the country and with the active eradication of historic vines looming, this analysis of the US cold-hardy kiwifruit germplasm collection provides a timely assessment of the genetic resource base of an emerging, high-value specialty crop...|$|R

Within this context, the League organized a large conference in Brussels in September - October 1920. The goal was to find a solution to monetary problems and facilitate the circulation of goods and funds.Following the conference the League established an Economic and Financial Organisation, including several Committees (Financial, Economic, Fiscal, Statistical).During the following years the League assisted many European countries: Austria, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria, etc.The Fiscal Committee discussed several general issues related to double taxation and tax evasion.The works of the Economic Committee comprised the treatment of foreign nationals and enterprises, abolition of the <b>prohibition</b> and restrictions <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> and exports, unification of customs nomenclature, bill of exchange, unification of statistical methods, trade policy, veterinary medicines, international industrial agreements, problems of coal, sugar problems, issue of smuggling in general and alcohol, in particular, and indirect protectionism.In October 1929 the Great Depression started in the USA and soon contaminated Europe.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the French <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> both <b>importing</b> printed cotton from India and printing it in France between 1686 and 1759, an interdiction significantly {{longer than any}} other European country, and challenges the portrayal of the ban as a sustained protectionist measure for the anciennes manufactures. Although it was undeniably instigated for this reason, the ban was prolonged due to conflicting government policies, vested interests and an overriding fear for Franceâ€™s reputation for high-quality products. The study shows that attacking a fledgling, technically incompetent industry conveniently concealed that the textiles tradesâ€™ loss of skilled workers and markets {{were the result of}} decades of a poor economic situation. The examination of primary sources has revealed how the government unwittingly handicapped the state-controlled French East India Company, whose main cargo was cotton, and the repeated granting of exemptions as appeasement negated the possibility of effective law enforcement and engendered perpetual confusion. Restricting the publicâ€™s use of the fabrics only excited demand, and the challenges of enforcing the ban and eradicating the banned merchandise are explored through a case study of Nantes. The correspondence of officials has revealed the extent to which provincial application of the law was discretionary, and evidence from prosecutions has shown that women of lower social status were particularly vulnerable. Significantly, this study has also uncovered that enforcement was indeed frequent and widespread, and that the severest sentences have been masked in prosecutions for other types of contraband. The complex processes involved in imitating Indian techniques, and the widely accepted method of transfer of technology from Asia are re-examined, confirming that French cotton prints were technically inferior throughout the period, and concurrent development to other European nations should not be assumed. The study has also revealed that a greater amount of the indiennes were used as furnishings than imagined, that different qualities circulated, and also that covert printing was mainly carried out on linen, which has been greatly overlooked. French printing continued to be inferior for decades, and the conclusions made on prohibition-era products based on later samples must be questioned...|$|R
