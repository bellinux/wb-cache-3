40|$|Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is {{a disease}} {{associated}} with an elevated risk of thrombosis. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of <b>pipobroman</b> (PB) in the long-term control of ET patients who had, at diagnosis, {{one or more of}} the following currently known risk factors for thrombosis or haemorrhage (high-risk patients) : age > 60 years, history of thrombosis or haemorrhage, platelets > 1000 x 10 (9) /l. From 1978 to 2000, with a median follow-up of 10 years, 118 previously untreated high-risk ET patients (median age 62 years, range 25 - 82), were treated with PB at the starting dose of 0. 8 - 1 mg/kg/d. All patients reached a platelet count < 600 x 10 (9) /l and 91 % achieved a platelet count < 400 x 10 (9) /l. During follow-up, 13 patients had thrombosis, with a 10 -year cumulative risk of 14 %. Acute myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis and solid tumours occurred in three, two and seven patients with a 10 -year cumulative risk of 3 %, 2 % and 7 % respectively. Actuarial survival at 20 years was 64 % and the standardized mortality ratio was 1. 1 (95 % CI: 0. 7 - 1. 7), not statistically different from the general population (P = 0. 54). Age was associated with a higher risk of death (P = 0. 00009) and thrombosis (P = 0. 003). The duration of PB treatment did not correlate with the occurrence of second malignancies. This study, with a median follow-up of 10 years, demonstrates that <b>pipobroman</b> is effective and well tolerated.

DESIGN AND METHODS: From June 1975 to December 1997, 163 untreated patients with PV (median age 57 years, range 30 - 82) were treated with PB in a single Institute for a median follow-up of 120 months.

40|$|The {{recent report}} by Najean and Rain for the French Polycythemia Study Group 1 {{comparing}} hydroxyurea with <b>pipobroman</b> {{in the treatment of}} polycythemia vera (PV) makes an important contribution to the debate about the treatment of this condition. We would like to make some observations about the presentation of their results. This particularly relates to their statements about the observed actuarial risk of leukemia. The investigators chose, both in the text and the summary, to state that for both drugs "the risk of leukemia is approximately 10 % at the 13 th year. " This statement may be misleading if it is compared to other studies without presenting confidence intervals for their observation and also appreciating that other studies often quote an overall percentage incidence of leukemia rather than actuarial risk. In their study approximately 27 % and 15 % {{of the total number of}} patients involved remained under observation at the 10 th and 13 th year, respectively. Thus, by the 13 th year the number of patients remaining was relatively small and the accuracy of the actuarial risk of leukemia at this timepoint is likely to be suspect. We suggest that since the number remaining at 10 years was considerably larger, the investigators should have focused in the text and in their abstract on the actuarial risk of leukemia at that time. From their data, this is approximately 5 % and 3 % for hydroxyurea and <b>pipobroman,</b> respectively. This compares with the actuarial risk of leukemia at 10 years in the PVSG- 01 study 2 of approximately 16 % and 18 % in the 32 P and chlorambucil limbs, respectively. Also in this study the estimates of risk of leukemia beyond 10 years are unstable because of the small number of patients still at risk...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{approach to}} a patient with polycythemia has been greatly simplified {{by the introduction of}} new genetic testing in addition to traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass and serum erythropoietin (Epo) level. Clonal erythrocytosis, which is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV), is almost always associated with a JAK 2 mutation (JAK 2 V 617 F or exon 12). Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with JAK 2 mutation analysis to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. The clinical course of PV is marked by a high incidence of thrombotic complications that represent the main cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Blood hyperviscosity as well as platelet and leukocyte quantitative, and qualitative abnormalities {{play a major role in}} the pathogenesis of thrombophilia. Prevention of vascular events and minimizing the risk of disease transition into acute leukaemia are the main targets of the whole PV treatment strategy. This can rely on the use of low-dose aspirin in most patients, while the choice of the optimal cytoreductive strategy is based on the individual vascular risk. Phlebotomy is still the preferred treatment in subjects at low risk, while hydroxyurea or <b>pipobroman</b> is usually administered to most elderly subjects or subjects with a previous vascular history. The use of pegylated interferon, imatinib, and JAK 2 inhibitors is currently being evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of an International Working Group, seven centers {{submitted}} diagnostic and follow-up information on 1545 patients with World Health Organization-defined polycythemia vera (PV). At diagnosis, median age was 61 years (51 % females); thrombocytosis and venous thrombosis were more frequent in women and arterial thrombosis and abnormal karyotype in men. Considering patients from the center with the most mature follow-up information (n 337 with 44 % of patients followed to death), median survival (14. 1 years) was significantly worse {{than that of the}} age- and sex-matched US population (Po 0. 001). In multivariable analysis, survival for the entire study cohort (n 1545) was adversely affected by older age, leukocytosis, venous thrombosis and abnormal karyotype; a prognostic model that included the first three parameters delineated risk groups with median survivals of 10. 9 – 27. 8 years (hazard ratio (HR), 10. 7; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 7. 7 – 15. 0). Pruritus was identified as a favorable risk factor for survival. Cumulative hazard of leukemic transformation, with death as a competing risk, was 2. 3 % at 10 years and 5. 5 % at 15 years; risk factors included older age, abnormal karyotype and leukocytes X 15 109 /l.

40|$|Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) {{is usually}} {{considered}} an indolent disease, {{but it may}} progress during its natural course into acute leukaemia (AL); however, an influence of myelosuppressive agents in the blastic transformation of ET cannot be excluded. We performed a retrospective study to assess the incidence of AL in ET patients treated with <b>pipobroman</b> (PB) as first-line therapy. One hundred and sixty-four patients with ET were managed with PB at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d until a stable platelet count below 400 x 10 (9) /l was achieved. Maintenance therapy was given at a planned dose ranging between 0. 2 and 1 mg/kg/d according to platelet count, in all cases, with a median daily dose of 25 mg (range 7 - 75 mg/d). The median treatment time was 100 months (range 25 - 243 months). The patients were evaluated for the occurrence of AL and/or secondary malignancies and survival end-points. AL was observed in nine patients (5. 5 %) after a median treatment time of 153 months (range 79 - 227 months). The overall survival (OS) and the event-free survival (EFS) at 120 months were 95 % and 97 %, whereas at 180 months, they were 84 % and 76 % respectively. In conclusion, this retrospective analysis shows a low incidence of AL in {{a large group of}} patients consecutively treated with PB as first-line chemotherapy.

40|$|Background In {{the pivotal}} RESPONSE study, ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor, was {{superior}} to best available therapy at controlling haematocrit and improving splenomegaly and symptoms in patients with polycythaemia vera with splenomegaly who were inadequately controlled with hydroxyurea. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in controlling disease in patients with polycythaemia vera without splenomegaly who need second-line therapy. Methods RESPONSE- 2 is a randomised, open-label, phase 3 b study assessing ruxolitinib versus best available therapy in patients with polycythaemia vera done in 48 hospitals or clinics across 12 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Eligible patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with polycythaemia vera, no palpable splenomegaly, and hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance were stratified by their hydroxyurea therapy status (resistance vs intolerance) and randomly assigned (1 : 1) by an interactive response technology provider using a validated system to receive either oral ruxolitinib 10 mg twice daily or investigator-selected best available therapy (hydroxyurea [at the maximum tolerated dose], interferon or pegylated interferon, <b>pipobroman,</b> anagrelide, approved immunomodulators, or no cytoreductive treatment). Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment assignment; however, the study sponsor was masked to treatment assignment until database lock. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving haematocrit control at week 28. Analyses were done according to an intention-to-treat principle, including data from all patients randomly assigned to treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 02038036) and is ongoing but not recruiting patients. Findings Between March 25, 2014, and Feb 11, 2015, of 173 patients assessed for eligibility, 74 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive ruxolitinib and 75 to receive best available therapy. At randomisation, best available therapy included hydroxyurea (37 [49 %] of 75 in the best available therapy group), interferon or pegylated interferon (ten [13 %] of 75), <b>pipobroman</b> (five [7 %] of 75), lenalidomide (one [1 %] of 75), no treatment (21 [28 %] of 75), and other (one [1 %] of 75). Haematocrit control was achieved in 46 (62 %) of 74 ruxolitinib-treated patients versus 14 (19 %) of 75 patients who received best available therapy (odds ratio 7 · 28 [95 % CI 3 · 43 – 15 · 45]; p< 0 · 0001). The most frequent haematological adverse events of any grade were anaemia (ten [14 %] of 74 in the ruxolitinib group vs two [3 %] of 75 in the best available therapy group) and thrombocytopenia (two [3 %] vs six [8 %]). No cases of grade 3 – 4 anaemia or thrombocytopenia occurred with ruxolitinib; one patient (1 %) reported grade 3 – 4 anaemia and three patients (4 %) reported grade 3 – 4 thrombocytopenia in the group receiving best available therapy. Frequent grade 3 – 4 non-haematological adverse events were hypertension (five [7 %] of 74 vs three [4 %] of 75) and pruritus (0 of 74 vs two [3 %] of 75). Serious adverse events occurring in more than 2 % of patients in either group, irrespective of cause, included thrombocytopenia (none in the ruxolitinib group vs two [3 %] of 75 in the best available therapy group) and angina pectoris (two [3 %] of 74 in the ruxolitinib group vs none in the best available therapy group). Two deaths occurred, both in the best available therapy group. Interpretation RESPONSE- 2 met its primary endpoint. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} ruxolitinib could be considered a standard of care for second-line therapy in this post-hydroxyurea patient population. Funding Novartis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pipobroman</b> (PB) is {{a neutral}} amide of {{piperazine}} with a chemical structure {{close to that}} of alkylating agents, although the exact mechanism of action of PB has not been demonstrated. PB has well documented clinical activity in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). Recent long-term follow-up studies on PV and ET patients receiving PB have facilitated {{the definition of the}} risk of late transformation into myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) or acute leukemia (AL). This report gives an overview of the treatment with PB in patients with PV and ET focusing on clinical activity, administration dose and schedule, toxicity, impact on short- and long-term complications. From our experience and from the data reported in the literature the high clinical activity of PB in both PVand ET becomes evident. This drug allows, within 3 months, to attain a response in more than 90 % of patients, without clinically relevant toxicities. The 10 -years risk of thrombosis of patients treated with PB is about 15 %, similar to that registered with hydroxyurea, the most widely used agent in PVand ET. The antiproliferative activity of PB on bone marrow megakaryocytes seems of particular value in lowering the occurrence of post-PV and post-ET MMM, whose risk (< 4 % at 10 years) is the lowest registered with available treatments. The 10 -year risk of acute leukemia with PB is 5 % in PVand 3 % in ET, which is only slightly higher than that expected as a natural evolution of the disease. In conclusion, the use of PB is a definite alternative to hydroxyurea in patients with PV and ET at high risk of thrombosis...|$|E
40|$|Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a clonal {{myeloproliferative}} disorder characterized by sustained increase in platelet number and tendency for thromboembolism. A somatic point mutation that causes a constitutive {{activation of the}} JAK 2 gene is found in one in two ET patients. ET {{is more common in}} women, its incidence being 0. 6 – 2. 5 / 100, 000 patient/year and the median age at diagnosis is 65 – 70 years. ET can affect all age groups, including children (0. 09 cases/year), and is often diagnosed in the third–fourth decade of life. Rare cases of familial ET have been reported. Miscarriages are 3 – 4 times more common among women with ET than in the general population, especially in patients carrying JAK 2 V 617 F. Microvascular disturbances are typical of ET, but a major thrombosis (2 / 3 arterial and 1 / 3 venous; 1, 2 – 3 % patient/ year) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Age over 60 years and/or previous thrombosis are validated risk factor for thrombosis. Hemorrhages occur in 0. 33 % patient/ year, mainly in those with a platelet count over 1, 500 9 109 /L. Progression to myelofibrosis and leukemia is more common in patients carrying the JAK 2 V 617 F mutation, and is estimated to occur in 0. 16 % and 0. 12 % patient/year, respectively. The ET-related mortality ratio with respect to the general population is 1 : 1, while for polycythemia vera it is 1. 6 : 1. Low-dose aspirin is useful for microvascular disturbances, and in the primary and secondary prevention of major thrombosis in high-risk patients, but it is not recommended in patients with a platelet count over 1, 500 9 109 /L. Hydroxyurea is used as first-line treatment in high-risk patients. Other drugs available are alpha-interferon, anagrelide, <b>pipobroman</b> and busulphan...|$|E
