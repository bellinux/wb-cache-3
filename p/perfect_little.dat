[...] He noted the symbolism inherent in making Flame Princess a fire elemental, writing that [...] "fire is the perfect element for a hormonal teenage princess, and FP can’t control her emotions, burning everything in her path as she reacts to Finn’s advances." [...] Sava also complimented the return of N.E.P.T.R., {{as well as his}} short rap, which Sava called [...] "a <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> musical interlude at the midway point of the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Witherspoon {{attended}} an open casting call for The Man in the Moon, intending to audition {{as a bit}} player; she was instead cast for the lead role of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old country girl {{who falls in love}} {{for the first time with}} her 17-year-old neighbor. According to The Guardian, her performance made an early impression. [...] On her performance, Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Her first kiss is one of the most <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> scenes I've ever seen in a movie." [...] For this role, Witherspoon was nominated for the Young Artist Award Best Young Actress. [...] Later that year, she made her television debut role in Wildflower with Patricia Arquette. In 1992, Witherspoon appeared in the TV movie Desperate Choices: To Save My Child, portraying a critically ill young girl.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the lead}} single [...] "Like a Surgeon" [...] and the parody [...] "Yoda" [...] {{were met with}} praise, many criticized the album's other parodies. Many critics were split {{on the amount of}} {{emphasis}} the original songs were given. Rolling Stone writer David Hinkley positively wrote that [...] "the pick of this album's original litter is 'One More Minute', which is a parody of a style (Fifties vocal group) rather than a specific song and is a superb tune besides – right down to the <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> gasp right before the final chorus". In contrast, Chadbourne was disappointed with the original material, stating that [...] "only someone who is missing important brain cells would suggest this artist's original songs are any good". The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1986, though it lost to Whoopi Goldberg's Whoopi: Original Broadway Recording.|$|E

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Holst tried to enlist but was rejected as unfit for military service. He felt frustrated that he could not contribute to the war effort. His wife became a volunteer ambulance driver; Vaughan Williams went on active service to France as did Holst's brother Emil; Holst's friends the composers George Butterworth and Cecil Coles were killed in battle. He continued to teach and compose; he worked on The Planets and prepared his chamber opera Savitri for performance. It was first given in December 1916 by students of the London School of Opera at the Wellington Hall in St John's Wood. It attracted no attention at the time from the main newspapers, though when professionally staged five years later it was greeted as [...] "a <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> masterpiece."

500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy said [...] " [...] 'What's My Name?' is {{essentially}} the long, luxuriant lovemaking session to 'Rude Boy's hard'n'fast rut... it manages to stay classy even when Drake makes a dodgy joke about the 'square root of 69' and Rihanna delivers a not-so-coy reference to oral sex." [...] Megan Vick from Billboard said [...] "As much as 'What's My Name' is a joint effort, Rihanna owns the song by delivering a more polished version of her pop persona." [...] According to Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone {{with the release of}} [...] "What's My Name?" [...] as second single from the album Rihanna created [...] "a <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> tropical storm". He continued: [...] " [...] Over dark, humid synths and swirling snare skitters, she's in full-on Caribbean-queen mode, dialing up her islander accent and rolling out a to-do list for any adult male seeking entrance into her chambers". However, he also criticized Drake's [...] "Square root of 69" [...] line, stating that Drake sounds like a nerdy guy from a fraternity while he raps it.|$|E

Milnes suggests that this shows [...] "a wise old conservative's warning about the excesses of the verismo school of Italian opera" [...] already on the rise by the 1890s. Among the solo numbers woven into the continuous score are Falstaff's [...] "honour" [...] monologue, which concludes the first scene, and his reminiscent [...] ("Quand'ero paggio") about himself as a young page.

500|$|Alcorn {{publicly}} revealed her {{attraction to}} males {{when she was}} sixteen, as she believed that identifying as a gay male at that point would be a stepping stone to coming out as transgender at a later date. According to a childhood friend, Alcorn received a positive reception from many at Kings High School, although her parents were appalled. In Alcorn's words, [...] "They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They {{wanted me to be}} their <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> straight Christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted." [...] They removed her from the school, and enrolled her as an eleventh grader at an online school, Ohio Virtual Academy. According to Alcorn, her parents cut her off from the outside world for five months as they denied her access to social media and many forms of communication. She described this as a significant contributing factor towards her suicide. At {{the end of the school}} year, they returned her phone to her and allowed her to regain contact with her friends, although by this time – according to Alcorn – her relationship with many of them had become strained and she continued to feel isolated.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt Back to the Future {{had similar}} themes to the films of Frank Capra, {{especially}} It's a Wonderful Life. Ebert commented [...] " [...] Steven Spielberg is emulating the great authentic past of Classical Hollywood cinema, {{who specialized in}} matching the right director (Robert Zemeckis) with the right project." [...] He gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times believed the film had a balanced storyline: [...] "It's a cinematic inventing of humor and whimsical tall tales {{for a long time}} to come." [...] Christopher Null, who first saw the film as a teenager, called it [...] "a quintessential 1980s flick that combines science fiction, action, comedy, and romance all into a <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> package that kids and adults will both devour." [...] Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader felt Gale and Zemeckis wrote a script that perfectly balanced science fiction, seriousness and humor. Variety praised the performances, arguing Fox and Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. BBC News lauded the intricacies of the [...] "outstandingly executed" [...] script, remarking that [...] "nobody says anything that doesn't become important to the plot later." [...] Back to the Future appeared on Gene Siskel's top ten film list of 1985.|$|E

500|$|Michael Tedder of Vulture wrote {{positively}} of {{the episode}} and awarded it {{four out of five}} stars. He called the final fight between Pam and Jim [...] "ugly and real" [...] and one in which [...] "the writers didn't flinch", in that it truly made him feel uncomfortable. Tedder complimented both Fischer and Krasinski, and wrote that Krasinski [...] "doesn't try to make Jim look charming in this fight, just terrified and exhausted." [...] He called Nellie's subplot [...] "the best use of this new version of Nellie", but wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was undeveloped. Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that, while the episode was [...] "up and down" [...] (he wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was [...] "flat", but that Erin and Pete's yielded several humorous lines) the final confrontation between Jim and Pam was [...] "a big dose of reality" [...] and that it was not [...] "a contrived fight". David Wilcox of The Citizen wrote that the fight between Pam and Jim was [...] "welcome" [...] because their relationship had grown stale ever since they had [...] "hooked up and started living their <b>perfect</b> <b>little</b> lives together." [...] Wilcox praised {{the way in which the}} fight was written, and wrote that he [...] "couldn't help smiling. Not because the fight wasn't wrenching to watch. But because it was."

Indie rock artist Ted Leo recorded an acoustic version of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] for a videotaped web session a few hours after watching the song's music video.
