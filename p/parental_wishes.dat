40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the differential predictive value of parents', teachers', and clinicians' reports of psychopathology for poor outcome in children referred to a child psychiatric outpatient clinic. Method: A referred sample (N = 96), aged 6 to 12 years at initial assessment, was followed up after a mean interval of 3. 2 years. Data on parent- and teacher-reported problem behavior (Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher's Report Form), and clinician-reported observations and self-reports during a semi-structured clinical interview (SCICA), were linked to outcome measures assessed with a parent questionnaire, including outpatient and inpatient treatment at Time 2, parent's wish for professional help for the child, school problems, and police/judicial contacts. Results: Information from all three informants (clinicians, parents, and teachers) predicted measures of poor outcome after three years. Clinicians' ratings on the SCICA predicted all five outcome measures. Independent of CBCL and TRF scores, SCICA scores predicted <b>parental</b> <b>wish</b> for help and inpatient treatment.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and safety of nonoperative treatment of acute nonperforated appendicitis with antibiotics in children. Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial was performed comparing nonoperative treatment with antibiotics versus surgery for acute appendicitis in children. Patients with imaging-confirmed acute nonperforated appendicitis who would normally have had emergency appendectomy were randomized either to treatment with antibiotics or to surgery. Follow-up was for 1 year. Results: Fifty patients were enrolled; 26 were randomized to surgery and 24 to nonoperative treatment with antibiotics. All children in the surgery group had histopathologically confirmed acute appendicitis, and there were no significant complications in this group. Two of 24 patients in the nonoperative treatment group had appendectomy within the time of primary antibiotic treatment and 1 patient after 9 months for recurrent acute appendicitis. Another 6 patients have had an appendectomy due to recurrent abdominal pain (n = 5) or <b>parental</b> <b>wish</b> (n = 1) during the follow-up period; none of these 6 patients had evidence of appendicitis on histopathological examination. Conclusions: Twenty-two of 24 patients (92 %) treated with antibiotics had initial resolution of symptoms. Of these 22, only 1 patient (5 %) had recurrence of acute appendicitis during follow-up. Overall, 62 % of patients have not had an appendectomy during the follow-up period. This pilot trial suggests that nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis in children is feasible and safe and that further investigation of nonoperative treatment is warranted...|$|R

In relation to this type of marriage, another trait that is considered ideal in Tausug marriage is to wed sons and daughters with first or second cousins, due to the absence of difficulty in negotiating and simplification of land inheritance discussions. [...] However, there is also another way of arranging a Tausug marriage, which is through the establishment of maglillah pa maas sing babai or by “surrendering to the lady’s parents”, wherein the lad proclaims his intention while at the house of the parents of the woman of his choice; he will not depart until he receives permission to marry. In other circumstances, the lad offers a sum of money to the parents of the lass; a refusal by the father and mother of the woman would mean paying a fine or doubling the price offered by the negotiating man.|$|E

40|$|Communication about {{diagnosis}} and medical treatment for children suffering from life-threatening illnesses is complex. It {{is a primary}} step in involving underage patients and families in care and lays the foundation for obtaining parental permission and patient assent for treatment. In practice child participation in care {{is often difficult to}} obtain due to patients' different and sometimes fluctuating preferences, but also parents' protective strategies. Physicians may be susceptible to <b>parental</b> <b>wishes</b> to limit information and feel uncomfortable discussing issues related to uncertainty of cure with patients. A qualitative study in Romanian paediatric oncology units was conducted to explore children's involvement from the perspectives of parents and oncologists. Interviews with participants discussed 18 patient cases. Data were transcribed and thematic analysis was used to interpret and mine patients' involvement during treatment. Different facets of patient participation were identified: restricting, widening and enhancing involvement. A fourth category, unintentional involvement, occurred for all patients due to children's observations during long-term hospitalisations and access to Internet. Uncertainty overarched parental attitudes regarding the extent to which children should be included. Physicians usually complied with <b>parental</b> <b>wishes</b> to limit involvement, but together with parents involved patients at least in a practical way. Adults' protective attitude may backfire, as adolescents' online searches often expose patients to worse-case scenarios.

The increasing number of such cases on the recent Supreme Court docket is itself a striking fact, most likely reflecting the Court 2 ̆ 7 s perception of widespread concern about family structure in the society.

DESIGN: Mail-delivered questionnaire. SETTING: Denmark. Survey sample [...] A {{random sample of}} 1080 persons aged from 18 to 45 years. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 68 %. There was strong consensus (more than 75 % agreement) that life-prolonging treatment should be provided for an infant born after 24 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress and, for an infant with myelomeningocele, when the parents were in favour of treatment. Further, there was almost uniform agreement that not all infants should be treated no matter how serious the condition. Major controversies concerned the severity of a condition needed to justify omission of life-prolonging treatment, the role of parental attitude and the options in non-treatment cases. Forty-six per cent thought {{it ought to be}} legal to kill the infant in at least some of these cases. CONCLUSION: Although the study revealed wide divergences of opinion with regard to questions about limits of treatment and about end-of-life decisions it also showed that there was general acceptance both that life-prolonging treatment ought to be provided even in relatively severe cases if this was in accordance with <b>parental</b> <b>wishes,</b> and that life should not be saved at all costs...|$|E
40|$|Career theory characterises {{early to}} middle {{childhood}} as {{the period when}} children physically and psychologically explore the outer world and organise this information into increasingly complex categories and associations. The late childhood and early adolescent period has been theoretically distinguished from the earlier periods within the career literature {{by the use of}} a dynamic form of exploration that involves a transaction between aspects of a person’s inner and outer world in the pursuit of career goals of varying degrees of specificity. However, the broader literature on human exploration suggests that exploration as a complex interplay between the inner and outer world occurs during the childhood period. Regardless of the timing of the process, the developmental course of diversive and specific career exploration is predicted to yield a set of career pathways that are consistent with a child’s emerging interests, needs, aspirations, and values {{on the one hand and}} his/her environmental opportunities and social pressures (e. g., <b>parental</b> <b>wishes</b> and expectations) on the other. Career exploration is, therefore, a critical aspect of child and adolescent exploration. This chapter will first explore the theoretical and empirical literature on career exploration in children and adolescents. Acknowledging the importance of the outer world, or the developmental context, in career exploration, the chapter will then investigate the major contexts for formal (or intentional) career exploration for children and adolescents, namely the family and the school, and critique the programs and interventions utilised to facilitate the career exploration process for children and adolescents...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{paediatric}} oncology, {{the risk}} of infertility due to treatment constitutes an important problem. For sexually mature male adolescents, sperm cryopreservation is an option, but discussing the topic is complex because of the sensitive nature and the limited time frame. In this article, we determined attitudes and preferred roles of physicians and parents towards discussing sperm banking with male adolescents. METHODS: Qualitative multi-centre study, using in-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 physicians and 15 parents of male adolescents undergoing cancer treatment. RESULTS: Although physicians and parents agreed that infertility would {{have a major impact}} on the future quality of life, they sometimes disagreed on whether the topic should be discussed with adolescents. Physicians always wanted a separate discussion with adolescents because of the sensitive nature and the experience that parents sometimes misjudged the stage of maturity of their son. Parents, however, wanted control over whether physicians discussed the topic with their child and what was said. Physicians did not accept this control and, when necessary, were willing to bypass the parents and discuss the topic with the adolescent even when parents refused consent. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians face the difficult task of balancing between their ideas of what is in the (future) interest of the adolescent and accommodating <b>parental</b> <b>wishes.</b> We argue that, because of the private character of sexuality and the potentially inadequate maturity assessment by parents, semen cryopreservation should be discussed separately with adolescent and parents.
