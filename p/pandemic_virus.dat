40|$|Influenza viruses {{resistant}} to antiviral drugs emerge frequently. Not surprisingly, the widespread treatment {{in many countries}} of patients infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) viruses with the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir {{has led to the}} emergence of pandemic strains {{resistant to}} these drugs. Sporadic cases of pandemic influenza have been associated with mutant viruses possessing a histidine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 274 (H 274 Y) in the NA, a mutation known to be responsible for oseltamivir resistance. Here, we characterized in vitro and in vivo properties of two pairs of oseltaimivir-sensitive and -resistant (possessing the NA H 274 Y substitution) 2009 H 1 N 1 <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses</b> isolated {{in different parts of the}} world. An in vitro NA inhibition assay confirmed that the NA H 274 Y substitution confers oseltamivir resistance to 2009 H 1 N 1 <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses.</b> In mouse lungs, we found no significant difference in replication between oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant viruses. In the lungs of mice treated with oseltamivir or even zanamivir, 2009 H 1 N 1 <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses</b> with the NA H 274 Y substitution replicated efficiently. Pathological analysis revealed that the pathogenicities of the oseltamivir-resistant viruses were comparable to those of their oseltamivir-sensitive counterparts in ferrets. Further, the oseltamivir-resistant viruses transmitted between ferrets as efficiently as their oseltamivir-sensitive counterparts. Collectively, these data indicate that oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H 1 N 1 <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses</b> with the NA H 274 Y substitution were comparable to their oseltamivir-sensitive counterparts in their pathogenicity and transmissibility in animal models. Our findings highlight the possibility that NA H 274 Y-possessing oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H 1 N 1 <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses</b> could supersede oseltamivir-sensitive viruses, as occurred with seasonal H 1 N 1 viruses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an {{important}} component of innate immunity because it promotes bacterial clearance and neutralization of human influenza A viruses. Since a majority of humans have no neutralizing antibody against the pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza (<b>pandemic</b> 2009) <b>virus,</b> innate immunity may be crucial and MBL susceptibility may therefore influence viral pathogenesis. Results We examined MBL susceptibility of influenza A viruses and observed that the <b>pandemic</b> 2009 <b>virus</b> was resistant to MBL, whereas all seasonal influenza A viruses tested were susceptible. The mortality of mice infected with a seasonal H 1 N 1 influenza virus was evidently enhanced on transient blockage of MBL activity by simultaneous inoculation of mannan, whereas mannan inoculation had no effect on mice infected with a <b>pandemic</b> 2009 <b>virus.</b> This indicates that MBL protects mice against infection with the seasonal virus but not against that with the <b>pandemic</b> 2009 <b>virus.</b> Conclusions These results indicate that the <b>pandemic</b> 2009 <b>virus</b> is not susceptible to MBL, {{an important}} component of innate immunity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{antigenic}} drift of circulating influenza viruses requires a continuous monitoring of their antigenic and genetic properties {{in order to}} detect any changes that may justify the selection of different vaccine candidates, as well as changes in antiviral recommendations. Since its emergence in 2009, A(H 1) pdm 09 viruses show a constant antigenic pattern. However, genetically, in the post <b>pandemic</b> seasons these <b>viruses</b> revealed an increasing diversity. From the 2009 pandemic {{until the end of}} the 2013 / 2014 season, the Portuguese NIC has detected 1214 influenza A(H 1) pdm 09 viruses in the scope of the Portuguese Influenza Surveillance Programme. 416 viruses were isolated and characterised antigenically by HI assays. The HA 1 genetic characterisation was performed for 135 viruses. All A(H 1) pdm 09 revealed no antigenic diversity, being antigenically similar to the vaccine strain A/California/ 7 / 2009. In the <b>pandemic</b> season <b>viruses</b> showed a very small genetic diversity belonginig to genetic group 1 (A/Hong Kong/ 2212 / 2010). In the 2010 / 2011 season, Portuguese <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses</b> showed some genetic diversity, being distributed by 3 genetic groups: 4 (A/Christchurch/ 16 / 2010), 5 (A/Astrakhan/ 1 / 2011) and 6 (A/St. Petersburg/ 27 / 2011). In the following 2011 / 2012 season, the only one A(H 1) pdm 09 virus detected, belonged to group 7 (A/St. Petersburg/ 100 / 2011). The <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses</b> circulating in 2012 / 2013 belonged to this group and to the group 6 (subgroup 6 C). Viruses detected in 2013 / 2014 clustered also into the group 6 (but into the subgroup 6 B). Since its emergence in 2009, the majority of <b>pandemic</b> H 1 <b>viruses,</b> was antigenically similar to the vaccine strain A/California/ 7 / 2009, however, in the studied period, the H 1 <b>pandemic</b> <b>viruses</b> revealed an increasing genetic diversity.
