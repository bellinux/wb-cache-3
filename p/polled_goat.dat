50|$|Many breeds {{of cattle}} and sheep are {{naturally}} hornless polled and therefore {{do not need}} to be dehorned or disbudded. Most other livestock species cannot easily be bred to lack horns naturally. In one case, the <b>poll</b> gene in <b>goats</b> was linked to hermaphrodism in a single study several decades ago, although fertile <b>polled</b> <b>goats</b> have been bred.|$|R
40|$|The polled {{mutation}} {{is characterized}} by a recessive, incompletely penetrant, hermaphroditic effect associated with the dominant genetic factor responsible for polledness in breeds of goat. The present study describes the external morphology, anatomy of the reproductive tract, histology, chromosomal constitution and Y chromosome screening of three intersex <b>polled</b> <b>goats.</b> The animals were tested for different Y-specific sequences, including SRY and ZFY. Using Southern blot and PCR amplification, no Y-derived sequences were detected in DNA from three 60,XX pseudohermaphrodite goats. This, therefore, excludes Y chromo-some translocation and XX/XY chimaerism and mosaicism. This recessive mutation leading to sex reversal might be used to map and ultimately clone the autosomal genes implicated in the sex-determining pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} for polled character as preferential in Damascus breed leads to spread homozygous individuals for the polled gene and polled intersexes and consequently further economic losses in this breed. It’s {{very important to}} study the genetic origin, the role of sirs and dams {{in the development of}} intersexuality linked with hornlessness, and evaluate some other effects in the excess of the intersexes in caprine herd. To perform this work data of 52 intersexes issues from mating 19 polled bucks with 12 horned and 37 <b>polled</b> <b>goats</b> in Humeimeh research station, belonging to General commission for agricultural scientific research, were collected and analyzed by mean of Chi-Square (SAS, 1998). The results showed the statistical effect of sires (P≤ 0. 007) and the unstististical effect (P≥ 0. 05) of dames on the development of polled intersexes in Damascus goat breed. The number of kids intersexes were repeated 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for 1, 2, 2 and 1, five and eight sire number respectively. Whereas the number of kids intersexes were repeated only 2 and 1 for 3 and 46 goat number respectively. The sex of the kids, kidding type and horned goat character have all highly significant effect (P≤ 0. 001) and this because intersex cases issues of single births and twin birth: twin to male, twin to female, and triple births: twin to male and female, and twin to tow males respectively were repeated 17, 18, 14, 2 and 1 respectively. Also, single births, twin births and triple births were repeated 17, 32 and 3 respectively. Cases of intersexuality issues from horned and <b>polled</b> <b>goats</b> were repeated 14 and 38 respectively. It was concluded the important role of hornlessness genetic and multiple births in the development of polled intersexes in Damascus goat breed...|$|R

5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally <b>polled</b> <b>goats</b> are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|R
5000|$|Most goats {{naturally}} {{have two}} horns, of various {{shapes and sizes}} depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are [...] "polled" [...] (meaning, genetically hornless) or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth. There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having {{as many as eight}} horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically <b>polled</b> <b>goats</b> results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.|$|R
50|$|The Somali goat is a goat breed from Somalia, Djibouti and {{northeast}} Kenya used {{primarily for the}} production of meat. The animals have short ears and hair, usually white but sometimes with spots or patches. Both males and females have horns, although females are often <b>polled.</b> The <b>goats</b> are drought tolerant and, when milked, can each yield one to three kilograms of milk daily, even when access to water is limited.|$|R
40|$|Few {{previous}} studies have explored caprine skulls using geometric morphometric (GM) methods, which enable the quantitative analysis and visualisation of shape changes in skeletal elements and provide an important compliment to traditional lineal analyses. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine whether GM techniques can provide insights into how the shape of the goat skull differs between horned and polled animals, focusing on the differences between the dorsal aspects of the neurocranium. Fourteen skulls (4 polled and 10 horned) skulls from adult goats belonging to different breeds were studied. From the obtained results, neither the size nor shape showed statistically significant differences between polled and horned skulls. As animal"s functional capabilities are influenced by the presence of horns (if horns must function as shock absorbers, protecting the brain from blows during intraspecific combat, it would seem that some differences in shape and/or size should be detected), it seems plausible to assume that landmarks located on the dorsal aspect of the neurocranium are not useful to detect those differences between horned and <b>polled</b> <b>goats...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of wholly <b>polled</b> strains in <b>goats</b> has been discouraged by a 1944 study that suggested {{a link between}} the polling gene and hermaphrodism. Unfortunately, little study on the subject has occurred since. Naturally polled water buffalo also have genital defects.|$|R
40|$|A {{cytogenetic}} {{mechanism for}} the association of polledness and intersexuality in dairy goats has been proposed {{in the light of}} the existing information on intersexes and sex determination. On the basis of the marked sexual dimorphism for horn in the more primitive members of Bovidae and the strong androgen dependence exhibited by the cephalic adornments in general, it is proposed that the determinant of horn in the ancestral species of Goats was located on the Y chromosome in close proximity to, or as part of the maledetermining genes. The presence of horn in females in the more recent species of Bovidae has been attributed to the translocation of a Y chromosome segment to an autosome. According to this hypothesis the development of the horn anlage and the specialization of the somatic blastema cells into Leydig cells of the testes are probably controlled by the same gene (or genes) which were translocated from the Y chromosome to an autosome during the course of evolution in the Caprinae subfamily. The hypotheses advanced by various investigators in the past for the occurrence of intersexuality in <b>polled</b> <b>goats</b> have been adequately discussed by I,nu-VERGNE in this symposium. In this report an attempt is made to postulate a cytogenetic {{mechanism for the}} association of polled trait and intersexuality i...|$|R

5000|$|Camel, {{sheep and}} goat herding are the main types of local pastoralism, {{particularly}} {{in the northern part}} of the country. Livestock include the Somali goat and Somali sheep. The Somali goat is used primarily for the production of meat. Both males and females have horns, although females are often <b>polled.</b> The <b>goats</b> are drought tolerant and, when milked, can each yield one to three kilograms of milk daily, even when access to water is limited. The Somali sheep is the direct forebear of the Blackhead Persian, the latter of which was bred in South Africa between the late 19th century to early 20th century and has been extensively used for crossbreeding in many tropical areas. [...] It belongs to the fat-tail type, and both of the breed's genders are polled. The animal is mainly reared for meat production, and is a major export of the Somalian economy, particularly to the Arabian peninsula.|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} Y chromosome {{carries the}} SRY gene, which determines testis formation. Here we review data on {{individuals who are}} XX but exhibit male characteristics: some have SRY; others do not. We have analyzed three families containing more than one such individual and show that these individuals lack SRY. Pedigree analysis leads to the hypothesis that they carry recessive mutations (in a gene termed Z) that allow expression of male characteristics. We propose that wild-type Z product is a negative regulator of male sex determination and is functional in wild-type females. In males, SRY product represses or otherwise negatively regulates Z and thereby allows male sex determination. This hypothesis can also explain other types of sex reversal in mammals, in particular, XY females containing SRY. Some of these individuals may have mutations at the Z locus rendering them insensitive to SRY. Recessive mutations (such as the <b>polled</b> mutation of <b>goats)</b> leading to sex reversal are known {{in a variety of}} animals and might be used to map and ultimately clone the human Z gene...|$|R
40|$|To clone the <b>goat</b> <b>Polled</b> Intersex Syndrome (PIS) gene(s), a {{chromosome}} walk was performed from six entry points at 1 q 43. This enabled 91 BACs to be {{recovered from a}} recently constructed goat BAC library. Six BAC contigs of goat chromosome 1 q 43 (ICC 1 –ICC 6) were thus constructed covering altogether 4. 5 Mb. A total of 37 microsatellite sequences were isolated from this 4. 5 -Mb region (16 in this study), of which 33 were genotyped and mapped. ICC 3 (1500 kb) was shown by genetic analysis to encompass the PIS locus in a ∼ 400 -kb interval without recombinants detected in the resource families (293 informative meioses). A strong linkage disequilibrium was detected among unrelated animals with the two central markers of the region, suggesting a probable location for PIS in ∼ 100 kb. High-resolution comparative mapping with human data shows that this DNA segment is the homolog of the human region associated with Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus inversus Syndrome (BPES) gene located in 3 q 23. This finding suggests that homologous gene(s) could {{be responsible for the}} pathologies observed in humans and goats...|$|R
40|$|The {{germinal}} {{and somatic}} {{elements of the}} gonad are initially independent of one another and under separate genetic control mechanisms. They subsequently acquire {{a high degree of}} functional interdependence so that a defect in one cell type may have marked repercussions on the other. The behavior of the germ cell is determined in part by its genotype, and in part by the phenotypic environment in which it finds itself. Two X chromosomes are normally essential for oocyte formation, but an XX oocyte cannot survive in a testis. A Y chromosome seems to be essential in the spermatogonium if normal spermatozoa are to be produced. The somatic cells of the testis can develop normally and function as an endocrine organ {{in the absence of any}} germ cells and also apparently in the absence of a Y chromosome. However, the development of the graafian follicle, the endocrine apparatus of the ovary, is dependent on the presence of normal oocytes. A number of specific genetic loci have recently been discovered which regulate sex determination and differentiation. These include the autosomal dominant Sxr in the mouse, the autosomal recessive <b>Polled</b> in the <b>goat,</b> and the X-linked Tfm and the Y-linked histocompatibility antigen in a wide variety of species. At the moment, all the evidence points to these genes as regulators of somatic rather than germinal sex differentiation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
