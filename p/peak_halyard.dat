60|$|Cayman rode to a buoy {{and when}} the jib was sheeted they brought the mooring aft and let her swing. The patron went to the long tiller and wore her round, and the slack {{mainsail}} lurched across. Then all went to the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> and Kit's spirits rose. The rattle of blocks was cheerful; he liked to see the straining figures rise and fall. The men's laboured breath and rhythmic movements gave him a bracing sense of effort.|$|E
5000|$|... {{haul the}} gaff into the {{vertical}} with the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> and make fast ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> lifts aft {{end of the}} gaff {{and bears}} the leech tension. Small craft attach the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> to the gaff with a wire span with eyes at both ends looped around the gaff and held in place with small wooden chocks, larger craft {{have more than one}} span. Peak halyards pull upwards, {{approaching}} the gaff at right angles.|$|E
60|$|I profited by my {{lesson learned}} through raising the shears and then {{climbing}} them {{to attach the}} guys. To {{the top of the}} foremast, which was just lifted conveniently from the deck, I attached the rigging, stays and throat and <b>peak</b> <b>halyards.</b> As usual, I had underrated the amount of work involved in this portion of the task, and two long days were necessary to complete it. And there was so much yet to be doneâ€”the sails, for instance, which practically had to be made over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{good hold}} of the lift, Mr. Drewett, and steady {{yourself}} with both hands; ease away the <b>peak</b> <b>halyards</b> to tauten that lift a little more, forward. Now, one of you stand by to ease off the guy handsomely, and the rest come aft to the main-sheet. Look out for yourself, Mr. Drewett; {{we are about to}} haul in the boom, when it will be a small matter to get you in, upon the taffrail. Stand by to luff handsomely, so as to keep the boom as steady as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All of a sudden, {{some two}} miles ahead, a point or two off the {{starboard}} bow, a great flame shot up. Every moment it grew and grew until {{we could see}} a large ship in flames, while another lay {{about a quarter of a}} mile distant. Three or four boats were pulling from the ship in flames towards the other, and as this was a bark we had no doubt that we had caught the Seamew at her villainous work. The pirate was lying between us and the burning merchantman, so that while her spars stood out clear and distinct against the glare of light we must have been invisible to her. The word was passed quickly forward for the men to go to quarters. Every gun was double-shotted and run out, and then, all being ready for the fight, the men stripped to their waists, cutlasses and boarding-pikes ready to hand, we waited with breathless anxiety. We were already within range of our bow-chasers, and as yet there was no sign that the pirate was conscious of our presence. The boats were now near him, and no doubt those on board were looking rather in their direction than to windward. Rapidly the Alert tore through the water, the sail trimmers were all ready to take in her light canvas at a moment's notice. The officers clustered on the quarter-deck, and the men stood by their guns with every eye strained at the pirate. Nearer and nearer we came, and our hopes rose higher and higher. We were within a mile now, when suddenly a great movement was seen on board the pirate. The breeze was steady, and the sea quiet, and loud words of command could be heard shouted as a swarm of men ran up the rattlins. It was clear we were seen. There was no further need of concealment, and the captain gave word for the bow-chasers to open. Quickly as the pirate got her canvas spread--and I do think that sharp as we had been on board the Alert, the Seamew was even quicker in getting under canvas--we were scarce a quarter of a mile from her when she got fairly under way. Up to this moment not a gun had spoken save the two bow-chasers, as the captain would not yaw her until the last moment Then round she came and poured a broadside into the Seamew. Orders had been given to fire high, and every man was on his mettle. The maintop-mast of the Seamew fell, snapped at the cap; the <b>peak</b> <b>halyards</b> of the mizzen were shot away, and a number of holes were drilled through her sails. A loud cheer broke from our men. Fast as the Seamew was she was sufficiently crippled now to prevent her getting away, and at last she was to show whether she could fight as well as run, and I must say for her she did.|$|R
50|$|The <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> {{is either}} bent to the gaff itself or {{to a wire}} gunter {{depending}} upon the mode of rigging.|$|E
5000|$|A gaff rigged sail has two; a throat halyard to {{lift the}} end of the gaff nearer the mast, and a <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> {{to lift the}} outer end.|$|E
50|$|In sailing, the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> (or peak for short) is a {{line that}} raises {{the end of a}} gaff further from the mast, as opposed to the throat halyard which raises the end nearer to the mast. Such rigging was normal in classic gaff-rigged schooners and in other ships with fore-and-aft rigging. It is absent in Bermuda rigged boats.|$|E
60|$|But {{before it}} was well uttered, the squall shouted aloud and fell, in a solid mass of wind and rain commingled, on the Farallone; and she stooped under the blow, and lay like a thing dead. From the mind of Herrick reason fled; he clung in the weather rigging, exulting; he was done with life, and he gloried in the release; he gloried in the wild noises {{of the wind and}} the choking onslaught of the rain; he gloried to die so, and now, amid this coil of the elements. And meanwhile, in the waist, up to his knees in water--so low the {{schooner}} lay--the captain was hacking at the fore-sheet with a pocket-knife. It was a question of seconds, for the Farallone drank deep of the encroaching seas. But the hand of the captain had the advance; the foresail boom tore apart the last strands of the sheet and crashed to lee-ward; the Farallone leaped up into the wind and righted; and the <b>peak</b> and throat <b>halyards,</b> which had long been let go, began to run at the same instant.|$|R
50|$|Throat - On a {{quadrilateral}} sail, {{the throat}} is the upper forward {{corner of the}} sail, at the bottom end of a gaff or other spar. Gaff-rigged sails, and certain similar rigs, employ two halyards to raise the sails: the throat halyard raises the forward, throat end of the gaff, while the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> raises the aft, peak end.|$|E
50|$|One halyard, the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard,</b> has a block, {{sometimes}} just a shackle, {{that allows the}} gunter (wire parallel to the gaff and fixed to it at two points on its upper (or leading) surface) to raise the gaff into the vertical position up against and parallel to the mast. The other, the throat halyard, is used to raise or lower the jaws of the gaff.|$|E
50|$|The Beetle 14 boat carries 163 sq ft. of sail, {{proportionate}} to the Beetle Cat's rig; however, {{two sets}} of reef points are standard, whereas the Beetle Cat has only one. A topping lift is standard, {{as well as more}} purchase on the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> and mainsheet. These changes, on top of a more depth of hull with less fullness forward, were intended to make the vessel easy to handle and fast. Two have been built to date.|$|E
5000|$|Corners - The {{names of}} corners of sails vary, {{depending}} on shape and symmetry. In a triangular sail, {{the corner where}} the luff and the leech connect is called the head. On a square sail, the top corners are head cringles, where there are grommets, called cringles. On a quadrilateral sail, the peak is the upper aft corner of the sail, at the top end of a gaff or other spar. The throat is the upper forward corner of the sail, at the bottom end of a gaff or other spar. Gaff-rigged sails, and certain similar rigs, employ two halyards to raise the sails: the throat halyard raises the forward, throat end of the gaff, while the <b>peak</b> <b>halyard</b> raises the aft, peak end.|$|E
