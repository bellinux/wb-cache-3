The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not.

5000|$|<b>Pre-tensioning</b> is {{a common}} {{prefabrication}} technique, where the resulting concrete element is manufactured remotely from the final structure location and transported to site once cured. It requires strong, stable end-anchorage points between which the tendons are stretched. These anchorages form the ends of a [...] "casting bed" [...] which may be many times {{the length of the}} concrete element being fabricated. This allows multiple elements to be constructed end-on-end in the one <b>pre-tensioning</b> operation, allowing significant productivity benefits and economies of scale to be realised for this method of construction.|$|E
50|$|The left bundle {{branch is}} short, {{splitting}} {{into the left}} anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle. The left posterior fascicle is relatively short and broad, with dual blood supply, making it particularly resistant to ischemic damage. The left posterior fascicle transmits impulses to the papillary muscles, leading to mitral valve closure. As the left posterior fascicle is shorter and broader than the right, impulses reach the papillary muscles just prior to depolarization, and therefore contraction, of the left ventricle myocardium. This allows <b>pre-tensioning</b> of the chordae tendinae, increasing the resistance to flow through the mitral valve during left ventricular contraction. This mechanism works {{in the same manner}} as <b>pre-tensioning</b> of car seatbelts.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wire <b>pre-tension</b> in the Ilizarov {{frame is}} {{considered}} to be important in order to reduce movements that can impair fracture healing. Wires will eventually lose part of their <b>pre-tension,</b> however. In order to gain more insight into the need for wire <b>pre-tension,</b> we investigated: (1) the amount of pre-ten-sion loss, (2) the relationship between <b>pre-tension</b> loss and bolt-tightening torque, (3) the cause of a possible loss of <b>pre-tension,</b> and (4) the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> on cyclic micromotions and total displacement of the bone segments. METHODS: 3 Ilizarov configurations, with various wire <b>pre-tensions</b> and bolt-tightening torques, were tested 3 times with an MTS machine. For each wire, slippage and tensions were measured {{for the duration of the}} whole experiment. RESULTS: A loss of wire <b>pre-tension</b> (up to 75 %) due to slippage was found. Higher bolt-tightening torques significantly reduced the amount of <b>pre-tension</b> loss. Furthermore, a higher wire <b>pre-tension</b> reduced the maximal axial displacement of the bone fragment. There was, however, least cyclic axial micromotion when no wire <b>pre-tension</b> was present [...] probably due to the lack of wire recoil. INTERPRETATION: Wires in an experimental Ilizarov external fixator lose <b>pre-tension</b> within a limited period of time, and probably also in the clinical setting. This does not seem to lead to increased cyclic axial micromotions of the bone fragements. However, the question remains as to how excessive axial displacement of the bone fragment and other loading configurations will affect the process of fracture healing in a patient...|$|R

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} studies on {{reversible}} adhesion mechanisms of geckos and insects, we investigate {{the effect of}} <b>pre-tension</b> on the orientation-dependent adhesion strength of an elastic tape adhering on a substrate. Our analysis shows that the <b>pre-tension</b> can significantly increase the peel-off force at small peeling angles while decreasing it at large peeling angles, leading to a strongly reversible adhesion. More interestingly, we find that there exists a critical value of <b>pre-tension</b> beyond which the peel-off force plunges to zero at a force-independent critical peeling angle. We further show {{that the level of}} <b>pre-tension</b> required for such force-independent detachment at a critical angle can be induced by simply dragging a spatula pad along a substrate at sufficiently low angles. These results provide a feasible explanation of relevant experimental observations on gecko adhesion and suggest possible strategies to design strongly reversible adhesives via <b>pre-tension...</b>|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{our earlier}} {{study on the}} effect of <b>pre-tension</b> in gecko adhesion, here we {{investigate}} whether and how <b>pre-tension</b> in cytoskeleton influences cell adhesion by developing a stochastic-elasticity model of a stress fiber attached on a rigid substrate via molecular bonds. By comparing the variations in adhesion lifetime and observing the sequences of bond breaking with and without <b>pre-tension</b> in the stress fiber under the same applied force, we demonstrate that the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> is to shift the interfacial failure mode from cracklike propagation toward uniform bond failure within the contact region, thereby greatly increasing the adhesion lifetime. Since stress fibers are the primary load-bearing components of cells, as well as the basic functional units of cytoskeleton that facilitate cell adhesion, this study suggests a feasible mechanism by which cell adhesion could be actively controlled via cytoskeletal contractility and proposes that <b>pre-tension</b> may be a general principle in biological adhesion...|$|R

Numerical results show that structural stiffness of this bridge (model) depends {{not only on the}} cable sag and cross sectional areas of the cables, but also on the <b>pre-tension</b> in the reverse profiled cables. The tension in the top supporting cables can be adjusted to a high level by the <b>pre-tension</b> in the reverse profiled bottom cables, with the total horizontal force in the bridge structure remaining reasonably constant.

50|$|For the {{investigation}} of the typical behaviour of an in-situ fabric, it is proposed a test protocol divided into: pre-stress, conditioning and a final radial test regime. The prestress was considered fundamental in order to reproduce the typical stress state of a membrane structure after the initial <b>pre-tensioning</b> is concluded, it is held for a certain amount of hours and generally set at 1.3% UTS for PVC/polyester fabric and 2.5% UTS for PTFE/glass fibre fabric.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} bond (or adhesion) {{achievable}} between the freshly set concrete {{and the surface}} of the tendons is critical to the <b>pre-tensioning</b> process, as it determines when the tendon anchorages can be safely released. Higher bond strength in early-age concrete allows more economical fabrication as it speeds production. To promote this, pre-tensioned tendons are usually composed of isolated single wires or strands, as this provides a greater surface area for bond action than bundled strand tendons.|$|E
5000|$|First {{used in the}} late-nineteenth century, {{prestressed}} concrete has developed beyond <b>pre-tensioning</b> to include post-tensioning, which occurs after the concrete is cast. Tensioning systems may be classed as either monostrand, where each tendon's strand or wire is stressed individually, or multi-strand, where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously. Tendons may be located either within the concrete volume (internal prestressing), or wholly outside of it (external prestressing). Whereas pre-tensioned concrete by definition uses tendons directly bonded to the concrete, post-tensioned concrete can use either bonded or unbonded tendons.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} projectile penetration of <b>pre-tensioned</b> woven fabric samples – Tawron ® CT 717 (plain weave) – is undertaken. Specimens are clamped at their {{top and bottom}} edges, and pre-stretched by forces of 200 N, 1000 N, 2000 N, 3000 N and 4000 N respectively. They are then oriented at various angles (0, 7. 5 °, 15 ° and 30 °) from the vertical (perpendicular to the horizontal axis of a gas gun), and subjected to impact by a 12 mm diameter steel sphere. A high-speed camera is utilized to observe the deformation and failure of the fabric, and to determine the residual projectile velocity. For normal incidence, the ballistic limit initially increases, then decreases with <b>pre-tension,</b> displaying a maximum resistance for a <b>pre-tension</b> of about 2000 N. With respect to the angle of incidence (obliquity of impact), for target inclinations of 7. 5 ° and 15 °, <b>pre-tension</b> has minimal influence on the ballistic limit, while for an inclination of 30 °, the effect of <b>pre-tension</b> on the ballistic limit {{is similar to that}} for normal impact...|$|R
40|$|In the fiber-reinforced {{composites}} industry {{together with}} the promotion of environmental friendly production, synthetic materials are attempted {{to be replaced by}} renewable, biodegradable and recyclable materials. The most important challenge is to improve strength and durability of these materials. Matrix that supports the fiber-reinforcement in composite generally is brittle and deformation causes fragmentation of the matrix. <b>Pre-tension</b> of reinforcement is a well-known method to increase tensile strength of woven material. The current study develops the idea to use <b>pre-tension</b> of woven fabric in order to improve quality and strength properties of the obtained composite. Natural (cotton fiber) and synthetic (glass fiber) woven fabrics were investigated. The pressure forming operation was carried out in order to study clamping imposed strain variation across the surface of woven fabric.

40|$|The {{results of}} fused {{multilayer}} systems <b>pre-tension</b> level upon biaxial loading {{are presented in}} this research work. The values of initial <b>pre-tension</b> of fused multilayer systems in longitudinal and transverse directions were: 0. 0  %, 0. 4  %, 0. 8  %, 1. 2  %, 1. 7  % and 2. 1  %. The results of the investigations have shown that deformational characteristics (F, N and H max, mm) in longitudinal and transverse directions differ {{with the increase of}} <b>pre-tension</b> level. Thus, seam allowances can be defined more accurately in more deformable direction at the stage of product development. Cotton fabric (100  %) of plain weave was used as base material for fused systems. Biaxial tension testing was performed with three types of interlinings: woven, nonwoven and knitted, which differed not only in surface density, but in the density of adhesive layer, which was 52 and 76 dots/cm 2, as well. The samples of fused systems were punched {{from the side of the}} main cotton fabric in order to maintain the same friction force between the punch and the specimen. Obtained results have shown that different number of force peaks, i. e. breakings is characteristic for different fused systems. For initial <b>pre-tension</b> from 0. 0  % to 2. 1  % the first breaking always appears in longitudinal direction irrespectfully to longitudinal or transverse <b>pre-tension</b> direction.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this work}} is to study driver and {{passenger}} kinematics in autonomous braking scenarios, with and without <b>pre-tensioned</b> seat belts, using a whole-body finite element (FE) human body model (HBM) with active muscles. Methods: Upper extremity musculature for elbow and shoulder flexion-extension feedback control was added to an HBM which was previously complemented with feedback controlled muscles for the trunk and neck. Controller gains were found using a radial basis function meta-model sampled by making 144 simulations of an 8 ms− 2 volunteer sled test. The HBM kinematics, interaction forces, and muscle activations were validated using a second volunteer dataset for the passenger and driver positions, with and without 170 N seat belt <b>pre-tension,</b> in 11 ms− 2 autonomous braking deceleration. The HBM was then used for a parameter study in which seat belt <b>pre-tension</b> force and timing were varied from 170 N to 570 N, and from 0. 25 s before to 0. 15 s after deceleration onset, in an 11 ms− 2 autonomous braking scenario. Results: The model validation showed that the forward displacements and interaction forces of the HBM correlated with those of corresponding volunteer tests. Muscle activations and head rotation angles were overestimated in the HBM when compared with volunteer data. With a standard seat belt in 11 ms− 2 autonomous braking interventions, the HBM exhibited peak forward head displacements of 153 mm and 232 mm for the driver and passenger positions. When 570 N seat belt <b>pre-tension</b> was applied 0. 15 s before deceleration onset, a reduction of peak head displacements to 60 mm and 75 mm was predicted. Conclusions: Driver and passenger responses to autonomous braking with standard and <b>pre-tensioned</b> restraints were successfully modelled in a whole-body FE HBM with feedback controlled active muscles. Variations of belt <b>pre-tension</b> force level and timing revealed that belt <b>pre-tension</b> 0. 15 s before deceleration onset had the largest effect in reducing forward head and torso movement caused by the autonomous brake intervention. The displacement of the head relative to the torso for the HBM is quite constant for all variations in timing and belt force; it is the reduced torso displacements that lead to reduced forward head displacements...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) sheet bonding {{method has}} been rapidly {{introduced}} for reinforcing and/or retrofitting {{of the existing}} Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures. Due to bonding normal FRP sheet onto the tension-side surface of the RC members, the effects due to bonding the FRP sheet can be expected after rebar yielding. However, cracking and rebar yielding loads cannot be much improved. Recently, {{in order to increase}} not only the ultimate load-carrying capacity of the RC members but also cracking and rebar yielding loads, <b>pre-tensioned</b> FRP sheet bonding method has been developed. In the previous studies, metal system was applied as anchoring devices of the sheet. Even though the premature failure at the ends of the sheet can be prevented by applying the metallic anchoring system, the installation of the system into RC members is not easy task because of its heavy weight. Also, stainless steel must be used to be anti-corrosive when FRP sheet is applied. Then, in order to easily apply the <b>pre-tensioned</b> FRP sheet bonding method for reinforcing RC members, the anchoring system should be simplified without any dropping of anchoring performance. From this point of view, here, a flexural reinforcing method using <b>pre-tensioned</b> AFRP sheet without metallic device was proposed. In this method, to distribute the concentrated anchoring stresses of <b>pre-tensioned</b> AFRP sheet, the base cross-directional non-pre-tensioned AFRP sheet was bonded to the concrete surface around the anchoring area. In addition, to decrease gradients of bonding stresses near the anchoring area, a strain relaxation polymer (with low young’s modulus) was used as a bonding material. The applicability of the method was discussed by conducting four-point loading test of the flexural reinforced RC beams with <b>pre-tensioned</b> AFRP sheet and comparing the experimental results with the numerical ones. The analytical portion of the research is employed to describe the flexural behavior of the all tested beams. A multi-section method was applied to analytically estimate the load-displacement relation and the axial strain distribution of AFRP sheet used for flexural reinforcing each RC beam. This research is divided into three studies as follows; (1) Strengthening Study of RC beams; this study examined the behavior of flexural <b>pre-tensioned</b> AFRP strengthening systems without anchoring device, hence investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a proposed anchoring method. The variables used in the experimental program included the <b>pre-tension</b> force ratio introduced to the AFRP sheet (0, 20, and 40 %) and the main reinforcement steel ratio (0. 79 and 1. 24 %). From this study, the results show that the proposed anchoring method is effective and feasible because the load-carrying capacity increased considerably. A good agreement between experimental and analytical methods was achieved up to ultimate state with somewhat a perfect bonding between the AFRP sheet and concrete surface. (2) Strengthening Study of pre-cracked RC beams; this study investigated the load-carrying behavior of pre-cracked RC beams strengthened with <b>pre-tensioned</b> sheet compared to non-pre-cracked ones. <b>Pre-tension</b> force ratio introduced to the AFRP sheet (0 and 40 %) and level of prior loading (Level 1 is up to main rebar yielding; Level 2 is up to average point between main rebar yielding and ultimate load) were taken as variables. From this study, it is observed that due to introducing <b>pre-tension</b> force into the sheet, flexural capacity and durability of the pre-cracked RC beams can be improved and the width of cracks can be decreased. This implies that a new anchoring method is effective and feasible. Numerical results can better match the experimental results for non-pre-cracked beams but not for pre-cracked beams subjected to high prior loading because the existing cracks and the stiffness of putty used for flattening the bonding surface were not considered in numerical analysis. (3) Repair Study of pre-cracked RC beams; this study examined the effectiveness of <b>pre-tensioned</b> AFRP systems to restore capacity of repaired pre-cracked RC beams reinforced with <b>pre-tensioned</b> sheet. <b>Pre-tension</b> force ratio introduced to the AFRP sheet (0 and 40 %), with/without existing cracks and with/without repairing the cracks by injection epoxy resin were taken as variables. From this study, it can be concluded that : 1) flexural load-carrying capacity of the pre-cracked RC beams can be significantly improved by bonding the <b>pre-tensioned</b> AFRP sheet onto the tension-side surface; 2) by repairing the existing cracks, the sheet rupture can be prevented because the opening of cracks and also large strains occurring in the sheet due to the opening can be rationally restrained; and 3) numerical results can better match the experimental results for non-pre-cracked beams but not for pre-cracked ones. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R
