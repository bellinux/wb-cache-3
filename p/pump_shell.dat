50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry <b>pumps,</b> <b>shell</b> liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{decreasing}} the channel size in heat exchangers increases its heat and mass transfer performance. Using such heat exchangers offers the opportunity {{to reduce the size}} and cost of industrial heat pumps, what should lead to better market acceptance. In the past, many experiments have been done for air/water mixtures (adiabatic) and refrigerants like CO 2, R 134 a and water (diabatic). A variety of models predicting heat transfer coefficients for these refrigerants are available in literature, but for certain systems they are not in agreement with each other. Currently data for ammonia/water mixtures, a fluid used in absorption and compression-resorption heat pumps is missing. A novel mini channel shell and tube heat exchanger with 116 tubes with an inner diameter of 0. 5 mm, an outer diameter of 1. 0 mm and a length of 0. 655 m has been developed to increase the heat transfer performance in industrial compression-resorption heat pumps working with ammonia-water as refrigerant. In the current research the tube side heat transfer performance is investigated using the ammonia-water mixture, while water is used in the shell side of the heat exchanger. The influence of mass flow rate, heat load and vapor quality on the heat transfer performance and pressure drop are investigated. The heat load was varied between 200 and 1800 W, with the refrigerant mass flux varied between 20 and 75 kg m- 2 s- 1 with the average vapor quality ranging between 0. 2 and 0. 6 kg kg 1 and operating pressures between 5 and 13 bar. Overall heat transfer coefficients, based on the outer diameter of the tubes, between 70 and 700 W m- 2 s- 1 have been obtained. The approach temperature at the absorber inlet, after calibrating the PT- 100 elements, ranged between 0. 3 and 4 K and the average temperature driving force is determined to be between 8 and 25 K. The measured pressure drop ranges between 0. 02 and 0. 2 bar. Trends show an increasing pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient with increasing mass flux and vapor quality.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in magnetic drive <b>pumps</b> with metallic <b>shells.</b> This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive sealless pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the back shroud influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped back shroud, pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing clearances and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|R
40|$|Innovation {{within the}} field of nanophotonics is {{fostering}} the progress in diverse technological fields, spanning light emitting, communication technologies, renewable energies, medical diagnostic and therapy. Among the different classes of nanomaterials that are contributing to such evolution, semiconductor nanocrystals, a. k. a Quantum Dots (QDs), are the most versatile ones. QDs are inorganic semiconductor nanostructures, whose outstanding light emitting performances make them promising competitors to more “conventional” bulk solid-state materials in many commercial applications. The interest on developing QD-based devices spread on a large scale with the development of colloidal synthesis methods. The colloidal approach expedites their processability and integration in light emitting devices with dimensions ranging from the macro- to the nano-scale. In particular, colloidal QDs are suitable active media for the fabrication of compact and flexible solid-state laser sources. Optical properties of QDs are ruled by the Quantum Confinement (QC) regime. The latter occurs when the size of the material is reduced to levels comparable with the exciton Bohr radius. QC is a size-effect and consequently leads to size-dependent absorption and emission properties. Thanks to QC, QDs exhibit well-defined electronic levels, which enable molecular-like optically allowed absorption transitions. At the same, high absorption cross-sections and stabilities typical of bulk semiconductor materials are preserved. In this thesis work an emerging class of colloidal QDs, namely CdSe-CdXZn 1 -XS core-shell QDs, is investigated. The attention is mainly focused on the optical gain, which represents one of the most inspected and promising applications for QDs. By investigating the Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) of different series of CdSe-CdXZn 1 -XS heterostructures, this work demonstrates that key properties such as the ASE activation threshold and photo-stability can be optimized by a careful design of the core-shell heterostructure. Guidelines for the synthesis of such best performing optical gain QDs are drawn by means of optical spectroscopy, which provides insights into the correlation between the excitation and relaxation dynamics with the shell thickness, composition and, ultimately, the structure. Basic parameters such as QD dimensions, size dispersion and photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) can be easily extracted from steady-state absorption and emission spectra. Steady-state absorption and phtoluminescence studies on CdSe-CdXZn 1 -XS QDs were employed as preliminary tools to prove that different shell materials induce distinct exciton confinement, size dispersion and QY. In a second step, Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technique has been employed, for the first time, as a local probe {{for the study of the}} core-shell interfaces. SERS permits the analysis of the nanocrystals with the same structural features and lattice dynamics present when the QDs are employed as emitters in photonic devices. Results of this study revealed that the composition of the CdXZn 1 -XS shell entails a significant structural difference at the core-shell interface. This structural difference modifies the electronic structure within the QDs, since it directly tailors the QC of the electrons and holes. The effect of the core-shell interface on optical properties has been unambiguously detected with the use of transient optical spectroscopy. In this thesis work, transient absorption (TA) and transient PL (tPL) techniques were employed to probe the exciton generation and recombination dynamics. The evolution of the exciton population was compared with kinetic models. Differently from steady-state techniques, transient techniques are sensitive to the nature and time-scales of the different radiative and non-radiative relaxation paths, whose control is crucial for guiding the heterostructure engineering process. The kinetic rates obtained revealed a clear dependence on the core-shell interface and the correlation with SERS results is discussed. The correlation between structure and dynamics was detected from the nanosecond (tPL analysis) down to the sub-nanosecond time scales (TA analysis). A secondary mission of this thesis was also to find a global interpretation of the dynamics of all signals present in TA spectra of the different CdSe-CdXZn 1 -XS QD series. <b>Pump</b> fluence, <b>shell</b> thickness and composition are the coordinates along which the global analysis has been developed. This step is of pivotal importance in order to identify the mechanisms involved in the optical gain process, whose temporal evolution for QDs systems spans from the picosecond to the few nanosecond time-scale. From the discussion of the results obtained from the different characterization techniques, it emerges that the most efficient way to boost the optical properties of CdSe QDs is the realization of a “graded” CdXZn 1 -XS shell, with Zn concentration (and confinement potential) gradually increasing along the radial direction. In a single entity, this solution should provide suitable confinement of the charge-carriers from the defective outer surface, prevent defect formation at the core-shell interface due the mismatch between the different materials and, eventually, limit the dot dimensions. Low QD dimensions increase the packing density and limits the scattering losses when QDs are included in a thin film and/or in a solid-state matrix. Such aspects have to be taken into serious consideration in order to increase the performances of a QD-based optical amplifier. Finally, the validity of the hypothesis formulated is experimentally verified by characterizing the bi-exciton radiative recombination, which represents the photo-physical origin of ASE and thus defines the optical gain performances of differently engineered nano-heterostructures. As predicted, best optical gain performances have been achieved from ASE experiments by using CdSe QDs covered with a graded CdS-Cd 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 S-ZnS shell. Therefore, the results obtained from the spectroscopic characterization provide a guideline for the engineering of new synthetic approaches, addressed to the preparation of highly stable core-shell QDs with minimal optical gain activation threshold. Moreover, the rationalization of the dynamics involved in exciton and multi-exciton generation and recombination in core-shell QDs expedites their application in all types of light emitting devices...|$|R
