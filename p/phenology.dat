5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} late in White's life, compiled from a mixture of his letters to other naturalists — Thomas Pennant and Daines Barrington; a 'Naturalist's Calendar' (in the second edition) comparing <b>phenology</b> observations made by White and William Markwick of the first appearances {{in the year of}} different animals and plants; and observations of natural history organized more or less systematically by species and group. A second volume, less often reprinted, covered the antiquities of Selborne. Some of the letters were never posted, and were written for the book.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to desynchronize the <b>phenologies</b> of interdependent species, with potentially catastrophic effects on mutualist populations. <b>Phenologies</b> can evolve, but the role of evolution in the response of mutualisms to climate change is poorly understood. We developed a model that explicitly considers both the evolution and the population dynamics of a plant–pollinator mutualism under climate change. How the populations evolve, and thus whether the populations and the mutualism persist, depends not only on the rate of climate change but also on the densities and <b>phenologies</b> of other species in the community. Abundant alternative mutualist partners with broad temporal distributions can make a mutualism more robust to climate change, while abundant alternative partners with narrow temporal distributions can make a mutualism less robust. How community composition and the rate of climate change affect the persistence of mutualisms is mediated by two-species Allee thresholds. Understanding these thresholds will help researchers to identify those mutualisms at highest risk owing to climate change...|$|R

One conceivable outcome of competition for {{a limited number of}} pollinators or seed dispersers is the evolution of minimally overlapping flowering or fruiting seasons. In the lower montane forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica, a study of 23 tree species (Lauraceae) that share avian seed dispersers and insect pollinators found little evi-dence for such phenological character displacement. The distribution of flowering <b>phenologies</b> appeared random but were indistinguishable from a uniform sequence; fruiting seasons were more aggregated and were significantly non-uniform. Nonethe-less, ecological coIJ 1 petition for seed dispersers apparently does occur because fruit removal rates decline when many species fruit concurrently.

25|$|Droughts are {{becoming}} more frequent and intense in arid and semiarid western North America as temperatures have been rising, advancing the timing and magnitude of spring snow melt ﬂoods and reducing river flow volume in summer.

These effects may be exacerbated by climate changes in river ﬂow, and the combined effects are likely to reduce the abundance of native trees in favor of non-native herbaceous and drought-tolerant competitors, reduce the habitat quality for many native animals, and slow litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Climate change effects on human water demand and irrigation may intensify these effects.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phenologies</b> of the vegetated land surface {{are being}} used {{increasingly}} for diagnosis and prognosis of climate change consequences. Current prospective and retrospective phenological models stand far apart in their approaches to the subject. We report on an exploratory attempt to implement a phenological model based on a new event driven concept which has both diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in the same modeling framework. This Event Driven Phenological Model (EDPM) is shown to simulate land surface <b>phenologies</b> and phenophase transition dates in agricultural landscapes based on assimilation of weather data and land surface observations from spaceborne sensors. The model enables growing season <b>phenologies</b> to develop in response to changing environmental conditions and disturbance events. It also {{has the ability to}} ingest remotely sensed data to adjust its output to improve representation of the modeled variable. We describe the model and report results of initial testing of the EDPM using Level 2 flux tower records from the Ameriflux sites at Mead, Nebraska, USA, and at Bondville, Illinois, USA. Simulating the dynamics of normalized difference vegetation index based on flux tower data, the predictions by the EDPM show good agreement (RMSE r 2 > 0. 8) for maize and soybean during several growing seasons at different locations.

40|$|ABSTRACT – (Relationships between crown {{architecture}} and available irradiance in two cerrado species with different leaf <b>phenologies).</b> Structural differences between cerrado species with different leaf <b>phenologies</b> {{are linked to}} crown architecture, leaf production, and biomass allocation to shoots and leaves. The present study characterized crown structures and the patterns of biomass allocation to leaves and shoots in two woody cerrado species with contrasting leaf <b>phenologies</b> and quantifi ed the irradiance reaching their leaves {{to determine the best}} period during the day for photosynthetic activity. The shoots and leaves of fi ve individuals of both Annona coriacea (deciduous) and Hymenaea stigonocarpa (evergreen) were collected along a 50 m transect in a cerrado fragment within the urban perimeter of Catalão – GO, to determine their patterns of biomass allocation in their crowns. The evergreen H. stigonocarpa had signifi cantly higher mean values of shoot inclination (SI), petiole length (PL), leaf area (LA), leaf display index (LDI), and individual leaf area per shoot (ILA), while the deciduous species A. coriacea had signifi cantly higher leaf numbers (LN). The more complex crown of H. stigonocarpa had shoots in more erect positions (orthotropic), with intense self-shading within shoots; A. coriacea, on the other hand, had slanting (plagiotropic) shoots in the crown, allowing similar irradiance levels to all leaf surfaces. The production of plagiotropic shoots by the deciduous species (A. coriacea) is a strategy that enables its use of incident sunlight {{early in the morning and}} preventing excessive water loss or excessive irradiance. Hymenaea stigonocarpa (an evergreen), by contrast, had orthotropic shoots and uses intense self-shading as a strategy to avoid excessive irradiance, especially at midday. Differences in crown architectures between evergreen an...|$|R

Since many insects exhibit a degree of endemism (occurring only in certain places), or have a well-defined <b>phenology</b> (active only at a certain season, or time of day), their presence in association with other evidence can demonstrate potential links to times and locations where other events may have occurred.

25|$|In {{regards to}} the biotic {{communities}} of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt {{in a variety of}} ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the risk of erosion. This loss of growing medium, nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to more stress tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in <b>phenology</b> which could put organisms out of sync with their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a loss of biodiversity and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.|$|E
