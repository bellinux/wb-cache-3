25|$|Another popular {{theory is}} Loop quantum gravity (LQG), a theory first {{proposed}} by Carlo Rovelli {{that describes the}} quantum properties of gravity. It is also a theory of quantum space and quantum time, because in general relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of gravity. LQG {{is an attempt to}} merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity. The main output of the theory is a <b>physical</b> <b>picture</b> of space where space is granular. The granularity is a direct consequence of the quantization. It has the same nature of the granularity of the photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism or the discrete levels of the energy of the atoms. But here it is space itself which is discrete.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{considerations}} for the electron {{proved to be}} much more successful. [...] In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the anomalous magnetic moment of a particle stems from the small contributions of quantum mechanical fluctuations to the magnetic moment of that particle. [...] The g-factor for a [...] "Dirac" [...] magnetic moment is predicted to be [...] for a negatively charged, spin 1/2 particle. [...] For particles such as the electron, this [...] "classical" [...] result differs from the observed value by a small fraction of a percent; the difference compared to the classical value is the anomalous magnetic moment. [...] The actual g-factor for the electron is measured to be [...] [...] QED results from the mediation of the electromagnetic force by photons. [...] The <b>physical</b> <b>picture</b> is that the effective magnetic moment of the electron results from the contributions of the [...] "bare" [...] electron, which is the Dirac particle, and the cloud of [...] "virtual," [...] short-lived electron–positron pairs and photons that surround this particle as a consequence of QED. [...] The small effects of these quantum mechanical fluctuations can be theoretically computed using Feynman diagrams with loops.|$|E

500|$|The Yukawa {{interaction}} for nucleons {{was discovered}} in the mid-1930s, and this nuclear force is mediated by pion mesons. [...] In parallel with the theory for the electron, the hypothesis was that higher-order loops involving nucleons and pions may generate the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons. [...] The <b>physical</b> <b>picture</b> was that the effective magnetic moment of the neutron arose from the combined contributions of the [...] "bare" [...] neutron, which is zero, and the cloud of [...] "virtual" [...] pions and photons that surround this particle {{as a consequence of}} the nuclear and electromagnetic forces. [...] The Feynman diagram at right is roughly the first order diagram, with the role of the virtual particles played by pions. [...] As noted by Abraham Pais, [...] "between late 1948 and the middle of 1949 at least six papers appeared reporting on second order calculations of nucleon moments." [...] These theories were also, as noted by Pais, [...] "a flop" [...] – they gave results that grossly disagreed with observation. [...] Nevertheless, serious efforts continued along these lines for the next couple of decades, to little success. [...] These theoretical approaches were incorrect because the nucleons are composite particles with their magnetic moments arising from their elementary components, quarks.|$|E

2500|$|In quantum mechanics, the {{procedure}} of constructing eigenstates of [...] total [...] angular momentum out of eigenstates of [...] separate angular momenta is called [...] angular momentum coupling.

2500|$|In this passage, Aristotle {{explained}} that concerning these koina (such as movement) {{we already have}} a sense, a [...] "common sense" [...] or sense of the common things (Greek: koinē aisthēsis), which does not work by accident (Greek: kata sumbebēkos). And there is no specific (idia) sense perception for movement and other koina, because then we would not perceive the koina at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. [...] explains that [...] "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident. Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have [...] "some one thing" [...] that can distinguish black from sweet. The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; Greek: sēmeion) of what the specialist senses have perceived. The common sense is therefore also where a type of consciousness originates, [...] "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives <b>physical</b> <b>picture</b> imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.|$|E
