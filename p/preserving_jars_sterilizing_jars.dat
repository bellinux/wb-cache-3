40|$|A slurry was {{prepared}} from six frozen pot pies diluted 1 : 5 with distilled water, two chicken, two turkey, and two beef pies of different brands. This slurry formed a reference sample and {{was placed in}} <b>sterilized</b> <b>jars,</b> frozen, and used as needed throughout the experiments. A second slurry {{was prepared}} {{in a similar manner}} from a frozen beef pot pie and a chicken pot pie, and was used as a control in only one experiment. The total count of microorganisms and the number of coliforms, Escherichia coli, salmonellae, and coagulase-positive staphylococci per gram were determined. Samples of slurry were inoculated in decimal dilutions with {{one or more of the}} following: Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli, and a strain of staphylococcus that causes food poisoning. The natural flora was found to exert an inhibitory effect upon the growth of the added microorganisms after incubation at 35 C for 18 hr. The inhibitory effect on growth was in part due to pH. The predominating organism isolated from the natural flora after incubation was a lactobacillus, which, when added in mixture with the test organisms in sterilized slurry, did not exert the profound inhibitory effect observed in the case of the natural flora. Some factors which may be concerned with the inhibition were investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{research}} on improving the equipment that ensures the absolute safety of mineral nutrients {{in the production of}} sterilized canned fish. The results of experimental study of hydrodynamic characteristics moving <b>sterilized</b> <b>jars</b> of canned fish of different sizes under the influence of circulating gas-liquid heat-carrying medium in the capacity have been presented. Some experimental setup with organized top-down and bottom-up flows in it modeling a sterilizer (autoclave) has been proposed for the research. The experiments have been performed in the superficial gas velocity ranging from 0. 03 m/s to 0. 15 m/s corresponding to stable operation of the apparatus. Cans drag coefficient in the flow of heat-carrying medium has been determined by two methods for two heat-carrying media – pure glycerol and water solutions in experiments on precipitation and air – cans when blowing in the wind tunnel. The significant difference in the rates of cans upstream and downstream is reliably established, and therefore it has been proposed to use for the cans' motion characterization the indicator averaged over the two specified rates and called cans circulation speed. An empirical equation describing the dependence of the cans circulation rate from the superficial gas velocity has been obtained. Based on the analysis of studies some empirical dependencies on calculation of the drag coefficients of various types of packaging in the range of Reynolds criterion values from 1 to 4 000 have been offered. The necessity of using the qualifying factor for calculating the real drag on the results of the experiment has been determined...|$|R

The fungi were cultured on vermiculite containing different amounts of tap water or malt extract solution. Mass loss of the bamboos after 32 weeks was low and did not show a remarkable influence of moisture content and nutrient addition.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to determine the}} effect of environmental conditions (biofortification with Mg) and technological processes (freezing, <b>preserving</b> in <b>jars</b> and drying) on the content of nitrates (III) in carrot. Besides this, the amount of human intake of nitrates (III) found in the carrot products analysed was assayed. The effect on environment resulting from the changes in carrot growing technology was not so unambiguous as for nitrates (V) since most NO 2 ¯ was contained in, for example, processed foods from non-biofortified Mg material. The consumption of products was not hazardous to the consumer since it did not exceed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) NO 2 ¯. Most nitrates (III) are consumed with dried carrot and least - with carrot <b>preserved</b> in <b>jars.</b> For this reason, one should run a thorough monitoring of the contents of nitrates (III), toxic to humans since new products based on dried carrot material, such as crisps, are launched in the consumer market...|$|R
