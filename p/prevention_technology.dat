40|$|The {{control of}} the HIV {{epidemic}} is a momentous challenge. Despite successes in some situations, HIV transmission has not been adequately reduced by the HIV prevention methods currently available. This is demonstrated by the continuing spread of the HIV epidemic, mainly through sexual transmission. The approaches to HIV prevention have broadly been defined as structural, behavioural and biomedical. The objectives of this thesis were to examine the personal and public health impact of selected biomedical HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>technologies</b> on HIV acquisition and HIV risk behaviour and to explore {{a number of the}} specific scientific and methodological challenges encountered in the field of development of HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>technologies.</b> The following research aimed to add to the available Australian data on biomedical HIV prevention, and to determine the potential for future trials of HIV biomedical prevention in Australia. A number of key findings from this thesis contribute to knowledge in the area of biomedical HIV prevention research. Firstly, the design of published safety studies of candidate vaginal microbicides was not sufficient to detect potential toxic effects of these products. A second important contribution was the demonstration that {{there was no evidence of}} behavioural disinhibition after non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (NPEP) use. Thirdly, NPEP had an important protective effect against HIV acquisition at an individual level but not at a population level. Fourth, groups with high HIV incidence could be readily identified in low HIV incidence settings. Finally, men with higher levels of HIV risk were more willing to participate in clinical trials of biomedical HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>technologies.</b> The research in this thesis underlines the complex nature of biomedical HIV prevention research and HIV prevention implementation, from the design of clinical trials of candidate biomedical HIV prevention products, to identifying suitable study populations who are willing to take part in such trials and finally to implementing the use of such <b>technologies.</b> HIV <b>prevention</b> remains a global public health priority and it is imperative that efforts to identify safe and effective biomedical HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>technologies</b> continue...|$|R

50|$|Mail filters {{can operate}} on inbound and {{outbound}} email traffic. Inbound email filtering involves scanning {{messages from the}} Internet addressed to users protected by the filtering system or for lawful interception. Outbound email filtering involves the reverse - scanning email messages from local users before any potentially harmful messages can be delivered to others on the Internet. One method of outbound email filtering that is commonly used by Internet service providers is transparent SMTP proxying, in which email traffic is intercepted and filtered via a transparent proxy within the network. Outbound filtering can also take place in an email server. Many corporations employ data leak <b>prevention</b> <b>technology</b> in their outbound mail servers to prevent the leakage of sensitive information via email.|$|E
50|$|With all new {{technologies}} comes trade offs {{and in the}} case of virtual security appliances the trade off is many times performance restrictions. In the past, companies such as Tipping Point delivered Intrusion <b>Prevention</b> <b>technology</b> in an appliance form factor and provided the highest levels of performance by leveraging application specific integration circuits ASIC and field programmable gate arrays FPGA that reside on dedicated hardware bus boards. Today, companies such as Reflex Security and Blue Lane that are virtualizing intrusion prevention, firewall and other application layer technologies. These goals are challenged with delivering optimal performance levels because in the virtualized world, applications running on operating systems compete for the same hardware computing resources. In the physical appliance world, those resources are dedicated and are less likely to suffer from blocking status waiting for resources.|$|E

Thereafter, Argyrol Anti-Infective became infrequently prescribed because Argyrol 10% Stabilized Solution was available over-the-counter in pharmaceutical distribution, while prescription permitted compounding pharmacists to provide designer solutions of mild silver protein.

5000|$|Traditionally, {{security}} appliances {{have been}} viewed as high performance products that may have had custom ASIC chips in it that allow for higher performance levels due to its dedicated hardware approach. Many vendors have started to call pre-built operating systems with dedicated applications on dedicated server hardware {{from the likes of}} IBM, Dell and offshore brands “appliances”. The appliance terminology although heavily used now has strayed from its original roots. An administrator would expect to see any underpinning Linux OS employ a monolithic kernel since the hardware platform is presumably static and vendor-controlled. However, the following examples are configured to use loadable kernel modules, reflecting the dynamic nature of the underlying hardware platforms used by product managers. [...] "Appliances" [...] have varying degrees of administrative openness. Enterasys Dragon version 7 IPS sensors (GE250 and GE500) are lightly hardened version of a Slackware Linux distribution, complete with administrative vulnerabilities, and shipping with anonymous root access the preferred method of administration of the underlying OS. Motorola AirDefense management consoles are shipped as an [...] "appliance" [...] without supported root access. Administrative setup tasks are performed via a textual menus running as an unprivileged user. Websense DSS sensor devices use CentOS 5.2 underneath and also allow root access at setup time. McAfee's older e-Policy Orchestator distributions use a RedHat 7 -based distribution, but modifications to typical OS configuration files are reset on reboot. Most of these devices primary configuration are via web interfaces. The implication that patches are not required for appliances is less accurate than the implication that vendors will be less apt to provide swift modular patches without complete reimaging of the devices. Companies such as NetScreen Technologies and TippingPoint defined security appliances by having dedicated hardware with custom ASIC chips in them to deliver high performing Firewall and Intrusion <b>Prevention</b> <b>technology</b> respectively. These companies defined there specific markets in the early 2000-2004 time frame.|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} the priority public health challenges {{with respect to the}} development of multipurpose <b>prevention</b> <b>technologies</b> in China. Design: review of published literature, databases of state and local disease control agencies and unpublished data relating to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Setting: China. Population: general and migrant populations. Methods: review of published data, government reports and databases of China Disease Control agencies, and our unpublished studies. Main outcome measures: reported STI incidence, particularly HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and genital herpes, and the migrant population with respect to disease transmission. Results: we found that the reported STI incidence increases along with that of HIV and showed significant geographic overlap with HIV. Economic migrant workers may facilitate the spread of STIs, including HIV. Conclusions: to more effectively contain the HIV epidemic, it is imperative to develop preventive measures to simultaneously target HIV and other STIs. We recommend that the development of multipurpose <b>prevention</b> <b>technologies</b> in China should target HIV and STIs. <br/...|$|R
