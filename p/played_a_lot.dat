5|$|On {{return to}} his parent club, Mousinho <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more {{frequently}} during the 2006–07 season, a total of 39 times, and was subsequently rewarded with an extended contract which was due to run until June 2009. The following campaign, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win against Barnet – tapping in the rebound from Kevin O'Connor's missed penalty, and also scored Brentford's first against Dagenham & Redbridge shortly after. However, he only played a total of 24 times in all competitions, 15 times less than during the club's previous campaign. At {{the end of the}} 2007–08 season, Mousinho was transfer–listed by manager Andy Scott because he did not feature in the club's future plans and, as a result, his first–team chances would be limited.|$|E
5|$|The next year, 1888, {{he scored}} {{successive}} half-centuries for Somerset {{early in the}} season against Warwickshire and Staffordshire before making his debut for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Facing Oxford University, Hewett made zero and eight for the London club. The same summer, Hewett was selected to play for an England XI against the touring Australians, and in a ten wicket win for the tourists, he scored 12 and 1. Between 1884 and 1888 Hewett had limited success at the first-class level, establishing a reputation as a useful, if erratic, hard-hitting middle-order batsman. He <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of club cricket, being a regular for Harrow Wanderers, and scoring 201 not out for Senior Common Room against Christ Church in 1888.|$|E
5|$|The third son of Arthur Percival Howell Kippax and {{his wife}} Sophie Estelle (née Craigie), Alan Kippax {{was born in the}} inner-city Sydney suburb of Paddington. He {{attended}} both Bondi and Cleveland Street Public schools. At 14, Kippax joined Waverley (now Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club) and was a regular in the first-grade team within three years. At this stage, first-class cricket was suspended because of World War I, but when competition resumed in the 191819 season he made his debut for New South Wales (NSW). However, the state possessed a lot of batting talent, which was supplemented by the return to Australia of the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team that played in England after the armistice. Therefore, Kippax’s opportunities were restricted for a number of seasons. He also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of baseball with the Waverley Baseball Club (usually at third base) and represented Australia against touring teams from American universities.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{criticism}} {{of its original}} Ten Year Plan, the ICC created an ICC Future Tours Programme (or FTP for short). In {{the same way as}} for the Ten Year Plan, this is a schedule of international cricket tours which structure the programme of cricket for ICC full members, with an objective of each team playing each other at least once at home and once away over a period of 10 years. If the cricket boards of two individual countries reach an agreement, they can play more than two series. If a team doesn’t want to travel to a particular country for a bilateral series due to security reasons, then, by the mutual agreement of the respective boards, that series can be shifted to a neutral venue such as United Arab Emirates or any other country where the facilities are good. Recently, the Pakistan Cricket Team has <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of their home bilateral series on Emirates soil.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} at the Navy, Hillyard <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{different}} sports, but concentrated on cricket, and even was captain of the cricket team for two years. Afterwards, {{he made his first}} appearance for Middlesex against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1886. Although initially quite successful, he soon thereafter realized he had great difficulties to compete on a first-class level. Consequently, from 1887 to 1890 he virtually retired, blaming {{his time at}} the Navy which allegedly had prevented him from practising more. However, in 1891, he took cricket up again and played some first class matches for the MCC as well as the Gentlemen Players. Later that year, he participated in a trip of English cricketers to North America led by Lord Hawke in winter 1891/92. There, Hillyard played both first-class matches at Philadelphia. In 1894, Lord Hawke arranged another trip to North America, and Hillyard was again member of the party. At Philadelphia, he played {{in front of an audience}} of 10,000.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the time, metal bass players play basslines which {{consist of}} <b>a</b> single note <b>played</b> at <b>a</b> time; that is, without playing {{multiple}} notes {{at the same}} time to form chords, the way a rhythm guitarist would on an electric guitar. There are, however, a few metal bassists who play chords. Robert Trujillo of Metallica is known for playing [...] "massive chords" [...] and [...] "chord-based harmonics" [...] on the bass. Lemmy of Motörhead often played power chords in his bass lines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:No, I <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of notes, but I also <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of chords. And I <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of open strings. I just don't <b>play</b> like <b>a</b> bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time.

Walker also came on as a late substitute in three more games in September 2010, including in Watford's 3–1 victory against his former employers, Middlesbrough.

500|$|For the Astral Weeks sessions, {{apparently}} {{they did not}} employ any lead sheets, or at least none were distributed to the musicians. [...] "What stood out in my mind {{was the fact that}} he allowed us to stretch out," [...] recalls Berliner. [...] "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt." [...] Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. [...] "I <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context," [...] says Berliner.|$|E
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. We wanted to do a show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I felt like we didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things. I think we <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E
500|$|After {{struggling}} to {{feature in the}} team {{at the start of}} 2008–09, Pugh joined fellow League Two club Luton Town on a one-month loan on 12 September 2008. His debut came in a 3–1 home win over Aldershot Town a day later, after which manager Mick Harford said [...] "He is an out and out winger, and he put in some good crosses. But he hasn't <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of football this season and he maybe faded a bit". He returned to Shrewsbury after playing in four matches for Luton. He was loaned out to League One team Hereford United on 26 March 2009, and made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home loss to Huddersfield Town. Pugh scored his first goal for Hereford with an equaliser against Hartlepool United on 4 April 2009, to make the score 2–2, although Hereford eventually lost 4–2. He finished the loan spell with nine appearances and one goal, as Hereford were relegated after finishing bottom of League Two. He was released by Shrewsbury after having the remaining year of his contract cancelled on 26 June 2009.|$|E

500|$|Annemarie Roelofs {{recalled}} that {{critics of the}} Feminist Improvising Group were always either very positive, or very negative; {{there was never any}} middle-ground. Nicols and Roelofs said they received little support from male improvisers, who criticised their technical ability and referred to them as women, not musicians. FIG's message that [...] "anyone can do it" [...] antagonised many who value [...] "technical virtuosity" [...] and [...] "improvisational competence". Nicols said they also complained about FIG's [...] "irreverent approach to technique and tradition", while Smith suggested that they may have felt threatened by the [...] "spectacle of so many unsupervised and unpredictable women on the stage". Irène Schweizer {{recalled that}} FIG were invited to perform at the Total Music Meeting in Berlin in November 1979 because she had played at the festival before (in all-men groups). But after seeing FIG perform, the organiser asked Schweizer [...] "how come you brought such a group, they can't play, and they are not good enough." [...] Nicols said that avant-garde musician Alexander von Schlippenbach also complained about FIG being there, saying that [...] "we couldn't play our instruments" [...] and that he could have found [...] "loads of men that would have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better".|$|E

Encores began with a rendition of Stephen Foster's 1850s classic [...] "Hard Times Come Again No More" [...] – which provided {{one of the few}} featured spots for King and Mizelle, who otherwise <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of tambourine – and later included both of Springsteen's reunion-era encore epics of American struggle, survival and hope, [...] "Land of Hope and Dreams" [...] and [...] "American Land". [...] Van Zandt said that the emergence of the recession theme was in part why the concerts did not showcase the Working on a Dream album. [...] One regular moment of optimism, however, was the playing of [...] "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" [...] from The Rising, with Springsteen holding a microphone down to one or more young children {{in the front of the}} pit area to sing along to the chorus on.|$|E
