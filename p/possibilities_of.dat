5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E

This included developing {{a new version of}} the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.|$|E

The final Social Link the protagonist attains is the Universe Arcana, a card from the Thoth tarot that replaces World Arcana, symbolizing the full awareness of the protagonist's place in the world.|$|E
5|$|Director Hifumi Kono was not {{interested}} in developing a sequel to the original Clock Tower at first, but was swayed after seeing the technical <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> the next generation consoles. Kono had difficulty in choosing the platform to develop on, but eventually settled for the new PlayStation despite its uncertain future. Clock Tower {{was one of the first}} games developed by Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine. The team felt challenged to create high-quality graphics after being impressed by the visuals of Resident Evil (1996), which was announced during development.|$|E

Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios.

Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E

He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.|$|E
5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing Digging for Fire more {{difficult}} than for his previous films, since there were many different <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee.

As a child he had discussed the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, {{he did not}} see space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. In 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at Cornell University {{with the help of an}} Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{in which the}} most powerful executive position is that of prime minister.

Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties.

50|$|Under the 1828 constitution, the President {{served for}} four years, without the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> {{immediate}} reelection {{for one more}} term. In 1833, the presidential period was changed to five years, with a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> immediate reelection for one more term, limited to two consecutive terms. Then by a constitutional reform in 1878, possibility for reelection became disallowed. Under the 1925 constitution, the President served for a six-year term, without the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> immediate reelection only. In the original text of the 1980 constitution, the President served for an eight-year term without the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> immediate reelection. Some transitory disposals, fixed during {{the government of the}} general Augusto Pinochet, allowed the exceptional <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> his reelection in the 1988 plebiscite. Then, in the transition to democracy the 1989 referendum established a first transitional four-year presidential term (1990-1994), followed by common eight-year terms, without the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> immediate reelection. However, in March 4, 1994 (a week before Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle took office) the presidential period was reduced to a six-year term, without an immediate reelection.|$|R

In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E

She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name, and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar, following her recovery, the court's officers considered various <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> foul play, including mutiny by Mary Celestes crew, piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out insurance or salvage fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> deadly disease, mass {{infection}} and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
