50|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the meninges, the dura mater, is {{closely associated with the}} arachnoid mater which in turn is loosely connected to the innermost layer, the pia mater. The meninges divide the spinal canal into the epidural space and the subarachnoid space. The pia mater is closely attached to the spinal cord. A subdural space is generally only present due to trauma and/or pathological situations. The subarachnoid space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and contains the vessels that supply the spinal cord, namely the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> and the paired <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries,</b> accompanied by corresponding spinal veins. The anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> form anastomoses known as the vasocorona of the spinal cord and these supply nutrients to the canal.

50|$|Vascular {{myelopathy}} (vascular {{disease of}} the spinal cord) refers to an abnormality of the spinal cord in regard to its blood supply. The blood supply is complicated and supplied by two major vessel groups: the <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> and the anterior spinal arteries—of which the Artery of Adamkiewicz is the largest. Both the <b>posterior</b> and anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> run {{the entire length of}} the spinal cord and receive anastomotic (conjoined) vessels in many places. The anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> has a less efficient supply of blood and is therefore more susceptible to vascular disease. Whilst atherosclerosis of <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> is rare, necrosis (death of tissue) in the anterior artery can be caused by disease in vessels originating from the segmental arteries such as atheroma (arterial wall swelling) or aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta).|$|R
50|$|The {{spinal cord}} is {{supplied}} with blood by three arteries that run along its length {{starting in the}} brain, and many arteries that approach it through {{the sides of the}} spinal column. The three longitudinal arteries are the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery,</b> and the right and left <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries.</b> These travel in the subarachnoid space and send branches into the spinal cord. They form anastamoses (connections) via the anterior and posterior segmental medullary arteries, which enter the spinal cord at various points along its length. The actual blood flow caudally through these arteries, derived from the posterior cerebral circulation, is inadequate to maintain the spinal cord beyond the cervical segments.|$|R
50|$|The {{foramen magnum}} (great hole) {{is a large}} oval opening (foramen) in the {{occipital}} bone of the skull in humans and various other animals. It {{is one of the}} several oval or circular openings (foramina) in the base of the skull. The spinal cord, an extension of the medulla, passes through the foramen magnum as it exits the cranial cavity. Apart from the transmission of the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the foramen magnum transmits the vertebral arteries, the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries,</b> the tectorial membranes and alar ligaments. It also transmits the spinal component of the accessory nerve into the skull.|$|R
50|$|Disruption {{of blood}} supply to this {{particular}} artery in the medulla {{would result in a}} number of sensory deficits. If occlusion occurs above the level of sensory decussation, it would affect the propioception, vibration, and two-point discrimination of the contralateral side of the body. When occurs above the level of sensory decussation, however, it would cause the effect on the ipsilateral side instead. Particularly at the upper cervical spinal cord where the <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> supplies some parts of the ventral column, lesion might extend to the anterolateral system and triggers the loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral side of the body.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The perimedullary {{arteriovenous}} fistulas {{are located}} on the pial surface and are usually supplied by <b>spinal</b> medullary <b>arteries,</b> that is, either by the anterior or <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries,</b> with no intervening nidus between the feeder arteries and the venous drainage. The clinical findings are, more commonly, caused by progressive radiculomedullary ischemic processes secondary to steal vascular mechanism. As the vascular supply to the spinal cord and to the arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) is not shared with one another, the vascular steal phenomenon cannot be implicated in this case`s physiopathology. Most probably, the mass effect caused by the giant venous dilatation was the pathophysiological mechanism involved in this lesion Case report The authors describe {{the case of a}} 6 -year-old girl with an intradural ventral arteriovenous fistula, with a giant venous dilatation, fed directly by L 2 and L 3 radiculomedullary arteries at the conus medullaris.

Interposing the arterial and venous vessels was a giant venous aneurysmal dilatation located ventral to the conus medullaris and extending from L 3 to T 6. The patient was successfully treated by a surgical approach through a laminotomy from L 3 to T 11.

After surgical resection of the aneurysm the patient had a complete neurological recovery. In comparison to anterior spinal artery aneurysms whose pathogenesis is diverse, posterior spinal aneurysms are most often secondary to a dissection and represent false or spurious aneurysms.

40|$|The {{vascular}} {{supply to}} the human spinal cord has been studied {{in a series of}} observations made in the cadaver during routine necropsies performed at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. In addition to conventional anatomical dissection of the larger vessels concerned, injections with either indian ink or radio-opaque material were made into the spinal vessels. The examination of the larger spinal vessels was aided by X-rays or by rendering the spinal cord transparent with oil of wintergreen. The origin of the spinal vessels was studied and a division suggested between a aubolavian-vertebral {{supply to the}} cephalic part of the spinal cord and a direct aortic supply to the more caudal part of the spinal oord. From the evidence of both anatomical and pathological observations, the point of transition between the subolavian-vertebral supply to the direct aortic supply was considered to be in the region of the T 1 spinal-cord segment. The anterior radicular tributary arteries to the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> were studied in a series of 40 injected spinal cords. The number of tributaries ranged from 3 to 9 with a mean of 5. 6. More tributaries joined the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> from the left (127) than the right (97) side. The largest anterior tributary (the artery of Adamkiewicz) was always found accompanying one of the nerve roots from T 7 to L 3. It was three times commoner on the left than on the right side and in 12 out of the 40 specimens was accompanying the left T 10 spinal nerve root. The anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> was confirmed as the most important single vessel and was always found to run longitudinally for the whole length of the <b>spinal</b> cord. The <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> were much smaller and were more irregular vessels than the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery.</b> A good anastomosis between the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> was always demonstrable around the conus medullaris and was often seen in the cervical region. This was seen in the arterial infections which, when made into the anterior arterial system, flowed easily into the <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The sulcal arteries arose from the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> and passed backwards in the anterior median sulcus. They entered the grey commissure and by turning either left or right supplied the grey matter and central white matter of one side. These vessels and their branches formed the centrifugal arterial system. The centripetal arterial system, of lesser importance, was formed by radial arteries proceeding inwardly as branches from the coronal arterial plexus surrounding the spinal cord. The spinal veins, with some differences, were arranged on the same general plan as the <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The differences were that the spinal veins were more numerous and that the anastomoses between large veins were more common. The veins were most prominent on the posterior aspect of the spinal cord and the largest single vessel was usually a single median posterior vein. The pathological observations were made on cases selected for the information they provided on disorders of the human spinal vascular supply. These cases showed that obstruction or disturbance of the spinal cord vessels could occur at different points of the pathway of arterial supply and venous drainage. Aorta. Aortic atherosclerosis and aortic thrombosis were shown to cause a syndrome of chronic ischaemia of the spinal cord. Aortic trauma with mural haematoma caused acute infarction of the spinal cord, a similar sequel to that more commonly seen following spontaneous medial dissection of the aortic wall. Vertebral arteries. Two cases illustrated spinal cord infarction and ischaemia caused by obstruction to both vertebral arteries. This unusual syndrome arose from trauma to the cervical spine causing a tear through one intervertebral disc. The resultant angulation at the point of the intervertebral disc tear kinked and obstructed both vertebral arteries. Interpostal arteries. Surgical damage to an intercostal artery giving rise to an important radicular tributary to the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> was shown to cause extensive infarction of the spinal cord in the territory of the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery.</b> These paired intercostal and lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> supply the <b>spinal</b> cord below the T 1 spinal-cord segment. The majority of these <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> may be obstructed with impunity but when, as in this case, the occluded artery is an intercostal artery giving rise to a major radicular tributary, serious infarction of the spinal cord will be caused. Radicular tributaries. Obstruction to these vessels in the intervertebral foramina was shown to be caused acutely by herpes soster and more gradually in cases of malignant tumour Infiltration. The sequel to this obstruction of the radicular tributaries was a state of haemorrhagic infarction affecting most of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord and extending through several spinal-cord segments. Anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery.</b> Three cases of infarction of the spinal cord due to obstruction of the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> by thrombus were described. In two of these cases the cervical part of the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> was obstructed whilst in the third case the spinal cord below T 11 segmental level was affected. In one case there was a relationship between the site of the thrombosis in the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> and the position of cervical spondylotic protrusions which were adjacent to the thrombosed artery. Ho cause for the arterial lesion was found in the other two cases. The longitudinal extent of the infarction in the two cervical cases was similar and its caudal extent was at the T 1 segmental level. Below this level the spinal cord was supplied by a radicular tributary to the upper thoracic region and the blood flow was unaffected by the thrombus in the anterior <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> above. In its cross-sectional area the infarction always involved the anterior horns and the grey commissure but not the most posterior part of the posterior horns. The white matter of those parts of the anterior and lateral white columns adjacent to the grey matter was also infarcted. The region of infarction was often asymmetrical and might differ markedly at slightly different levels. The asymmetry was considered to be an effect of the various suloal arteries which entered to supply either the left or {{the right side of the}} spinal cord. Small spinal vessels. Three cases were selected to describe the effects of disease affecting the small spinal vessels. In one of these cases meningo-vascular syphilis had caused chronic atrophy of the spinal cord affecting both grey and white matter. The spinal vessels showed connective tissue thickening due to former syphilitic arteritis. Another case studied was a case of tuberculous meningitis causing, by arteritis, a severe haemorrhagic infarction of the spinal cord. In this case the subarachnoid space was distended with tuberculous exudate which had caused an endarteritis affecting all the <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> surrounding the <b>spinal</b> cord. The third case considered in this group was a case of sarcoidosis affecting the spinal cord. Sarcoid granulomata were present around small spinal vessels in the leptomeninges and entering the spinal cord along perivascular spaces. In contrast to the effects of syphilis and tuberculosis, the vessels in contact with the sarcoid granulomata were not obstructed and there was no gross infarction evident in the spinal cord. Veins. Five cases of a chronic necrotising spinal cord disorder associated with grossly abnormal spinal vessels were described. The necropsies showed a complicated abnormality of the spinal vessels with large abnormal veins in the caudal and posterior regions of the spinal cord. The anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> were normal apart from slight enlargement but the spinal veins were enormously enlarged and their walls were thickened suggesting an increased venous pressure. The intramedullary vessels were abnormal in having markedly thickened walls and the position of the vessels so affected suggested that formerly they had been capillaries or small veins. The explanation of the vascular abnormality was thought to be the presence of an arterio-venous fistula causing the passage of arterial blood directly into the spinal veins without the intervention of the normal capillary bed. The small intramedullary veins and the capillaries would then be affected by a retrograde blood flow at a high pressure. These findings at necropsy were complementary to the radiological studies made during life on similar patients by Djindjian and hie colleagues, who have similarly concluded that these cases are explained by the presence of a spinal arterio-venous fistula. </p...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the natural}} history of rup-tured {{isolated}} aneurysms of the <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> (PSA).

From these data, we con-clude that treatment strategies for ruptured PSA aneurysms may vary.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spinal artery {{ischemia}} {{is a rare}} but serious {{complication of}} embolization for treatment of hemoptysis. When the spinal artery is visualized at angiography, embolization should not be performed. However, {{it has been reported}} that spinal artery feeders are not visible on angiography in patients with developing spinal infarction. CASE REPORT: A 70 -year-old man with a history of pulmonary aspergillosis had hemoptysis and underwent contrast-enhanced CT, revealing a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (PAP) in the left upper lobe. Systemic angiography from the fifth left intercostal artery showed the PAP at the distal site, but the access route to the PAP was very tortuous and long. Although the spinal branch could not be observed with that angiography, CT during angiography was performed, and it visualized the <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> obviously. Thus, the artery distal and proximal to the PAP was then successfully coil-embolized from the pulmonary artery.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolization of {{a spinal}} cord {{arteriovenous}} malformation (SCAVM) {{is still considered}} risky. We evaluated the efficacy and reliability of pharmacologic provocative testing with neurophysiologic monitoring in the embolization of SCAVMs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed results of 60 provocative tests during 84 angiographic procedures (in 52 patients) with intended endovascular embolization. Tests included 47 sodium amytal and 56 lidocaine injections. All procedures were performed with general anesthesia and monitoring of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and transcranial motor evoked potentials (MEPs). For provocative testing, 50 mg of amytal and 40 mg of lidocaine were consec-utively injected through a microcatheter placed at the position of intended embolization. If SEPs and MEPs did not change, embolization was performed with N-butyl-cyanoacrylate (NBCA). If SEPs or MEPs changed, NBCA embolization was not performed from that catheter position. RESULTS: One false-negative result occurred, {{with an increase in}} spasticity after emboliza-tion. Nineteen positive results occurred: four after amytal injection and 15 after lidocaine injections.

On examination his blood pressure was 200 / 140 mm Hg supine {{and he had a}} grade IV hypertensive retinopathy. That evening he was given enalapril 25 mg and atenolol 100 mg. The following morning he complained of incontinence and severe weakness of his legs. On examination his blood pressure was 100 / 60 mmHg supine; there were no signs of an abdominal aneurysm and peripheral pulses were equal. He had absent abdominal reflexes and a spastic paraparesis with upgoing plantars. Pain sensation over the legs was impaired but temperature sensation was normal to routine tests. A brain CT scan was normal. The acute paraplegia in this patient was probably due to infarction of the thoracic cord in the watershed zone between the anterior, circumflex and <b>posterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries</b> following the rapid decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. There was no evi-dence to suggest a dissection of the aorta. We are not aware of any previous cases of paraplegia occurring in this setting although it has been reported following the hypo-tension of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. 1 The cerebral complications of rapid reduction in mean arterial blood pressure using intravenous therapy in malignant hypertension have been well documented. 2 This case suggests that the spinal cord, like the brain, is unable to autoregulate blood flow during rapid and extensive reductions of blood pressure in severe hypertension, and is a further reminder of the dangers of hypotensive treatment, even using oral agents...|$|R
