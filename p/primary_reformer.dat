This research aimed to study the effect of Rhodium Catalyst for cracking heavy hydrocarbons into methane in the pre-reformer to increase the conversion of methane to syngas in Pusri II and to know the impact of additional pre-reformer at Pusri II against the feed gas composition, thermal efficiency and fuel consumption in <b>primary</b> <b>reformer.</b> The {{results showed that the}} use of rhodium as a catalyst in the reaction of the pre-reformer can crack heavy hydrocarbons like ethane, propane and butane to methane in a row at 71. 9 %, 88. 2 % and 88. 2 % and methane reformation reaction with steam to produce hydrogen gas amd carbon monoxide at 24. 9 %. Installation of pre-reformer feed gas can alter the composition of the <b>primary</b> <b>reformer</b> and the methane conversion increased to 42. 94 % from 24. 73 % at a temperature of 973 K.

40|$|The {{technical}} and economic feasibility of producing hydrogen from biomass {{by means of}} indirectly heated gasification and steam reforming was studied. A detailed process model was developed in ASPEN Plus{trademark} to perform material and energy balances. The results of this simulation were used to size and cost major pieces of equipment from which {{the determination of the}} necessary selling price of hydrogen was made. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the process to study hydrogen price as a function of biomass feedstock cost and hydrogen production efficiency. The gasification system used for this study was the Battelle Columbus Laboratory (BCL) indirectly heated gasifier. The heat necessary for the endothermic gasification reactions is supplied by circulating sand from a char combustor to the gasification vessel. Hydrogen production was accomplished by steam reforming the product synthesis gas (syngas) in a process based on that used for natural gas reforming. Three process configurations were studied. Scheme 1 is the full reforming process, with a <b>primary</b> <b>reformer</b> similar to a process furnace, followed by a high temperature shift reactor and a low temperature shift reactor. Scheme 2 uses only the <b>primary</b> <b>reformer,</b> and Scheme 3 uses the <b>primary</b> <b>reformer</b> and the high temperature shift reactor. A pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system is used in all three schemes to produce a hydrogen product pure enough to be used in fuel cells. Steam is produced through detailed heat integration and is intended to be sold as a by-product...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen Europeans {{decided to}} reform their {{retirement}} {{systems in the}} 1990 s, they took the American model of retirement financing as their major point of reference. The defining feature of the American system is that financing is shared between a public federal regime, and a private complement {{in the form of}} a pension fund. Instituting this feature in continental Europe was the <b>primary</b> objective of <b>reformers</b> during the decade of stock market euphoria that marked the 1990 s. Curiously, the effectiveness of this model has not been questioned following the market crash of 2001 or 2007, despite a series of social and economic blows suffered in the United States. What is more, the model continues to relentlessly insinuate itself into the institutional make up of continental European countries. How can we understand this persistent belief in the virtues of the pension funds...|$|R
50|$|The Ulema held {{a long-standing}} {{monopoly}} over the traditional educational institutions the mektebs, and the madrasas. So, {{by the time}} Education reform came {{to the forefront of}} the Ottoman goal to advance their society, they focused on making alternative schools known as ibtidai, or <b>primary</b> schools. Educational <b>reformers</b> founded these new primary schools as an attempt to provide their own influence on higher learning within the Empire, which they believed to be a superior learning experience, than those of the mektebs and madrases. They provided supplementary equipment, books and financing as part of their efforts. The introduction of these new schools provided prospective students with a choice between secular curriculum and a religious one. However, both systems proved to be inefficient, and both fell short of the standard that they were trying to achieve. Although there were many issues with education reform in the 19th century, the Ottomans did achieve in implementing a three-tiered school system that replaced the unorganized system of old. With the influence of the reformers, the government introduced a new plan in 1845, which include reformed Qur'anic mektebs, an intermediate level known as the rusdiye, and a university, known as dar ul-funun. The plan did not come to fruition right away, but throughout the 19th century, education in the Empire went through a great change. Although this was seen as a success, Ottomans were still well behind other reformers such as the Japanese. There proved to be many difficulties in the process. Many of the schools fell short of what was expected of them, leaving another stain on the reputation of the Ilmiye and the Ulama.|$|R

The consequences due to toxic release and blast overpressure were modeled for various worst case scenarios of the critical units.

40|$|The present article {{describes}} {{the failure of a}} <b>primary</b> <b>reformer</b> tube in an ammonia plant. The failure took place at the stub end of the reformer tube where a SS 321 flange was joined to a HK 40 catalyst tube by welding. Detailed metallurgical examinations indicated that the failure was due to stress corrosion cracking. Both longitudinal and transverse cracks were observed at the region of fracture. The cracks originated at the interface of the weld and HAZ at the inner surface and progressed to the outside of the tube in the transverse (thickness) direction. Microstructural study revealed chromium carbides precipitation at the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones on either sides of the weld. The results clearly indicated that the steel had undergone sensitisation which subsequently led to failure of the reformer tube by stress corrosion cracking. xA 9; 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, the {{industrial}} secondary reformer reactor has been modeled and simulated at steady-state operation conditions. It aims to modify a complete mathematical {{model of the}} secondary reformer design. The secondary reformer {{is a part of}} a subprocess in a higher scale unit of ammonia synthesis. It is located after the <b>primary</b> <b>reformer</b> in the ammonia plant where it is used in the synthesis of ammonia. The reactions in the secondary reformer reactor are assumed to be carried inside two reactors in series. The first reactor, upper section, is the combustion zone, while the second reactor, bottom section, is the catalyst zone with nickel catalyst based on the alumina. In order to create a reactor design model for the secondary reformer in {{the industrial}} ammonia plant, combustion and catalyst zones have been studied. The temperature and compositions of gas in the combustion zone are predicted using the atomic molar balance and adiabatic flame temperature model. In the catalyst zone, the temperature and composition profiles along the axial distance are predicted using a one-dimensional heterogeneous catalytic reaction model with the assumption that the reactions are first order in methane partial pressure.|$|E

40|$|In this article, hybrid steam {{reforming}} (HSR) of desulphurized methane, together with crude glycerol, in existing commercial steam reformers to produce synthesis gas is proposed. The proposed concept {{consists of a}} gasifier to produce vapors, gases, and char from crude glycerol, which is coupled with a pre-reformer to further convert the vapors into gases using a {{steam reforming}} catalyst. These gases are mixed with methane and subsequently reformed to synthesis gas (CO + H 2) in a <b>primary</b> <b>reformer,</b> using a steam reforming catalyst. In the present work, gasification, steam, and hybrid reforming of glycerol are reported. The total product distribution (gas, vapor, and char) of pure and crude glycerol gasification was quantified at different reaction temperatures at very high heating rates (atomization, 106 Â°C/min). With pure and neutralized crude glycerol, no char formation was observed. However, with crude glycerol and pure glycerol doped with KOH, {{a significant amount of}} char on carbon basis (10 %) is produced. The results obtained here show that KOH present in glycerol was responsible for polymerizing higher molecular components formed during thermal degradation. Steam reforming of pure and neutralized crude glycerol was studied at different process conditions in the presence of commercial reforming catalysts. Pure glycerol was easier (in terms of catalyst activity) to reform when compared to neutralized crude glycerol at high temperature (800 Â°C). The results from the steam reforming of neutralized crude glycerol show that the loss of catalyst activity was due to the presence of organic impurities such as FAMEs, diglycerides, and triglycerides. The proposed HSR concept was demonstrated using 28 wt % pure glycerol and 72 wt % methane (on C 1 basis) in a two-stage fixed bed reformer at 800 Â°C using commercial steam reforming catalys...|$|E
