The increasing requirements of low timing <b>jitter,</b> low <b>phase</b> noise, high speed and wide range {{make the design of}} a PLL extremely difficult. The first part of this thesis gives a methodology for analyzing and predicting the timing jitter/phase noise of a PLL system. Theoretical models are derived in the different hierarchy levels in a PLL system. The theoretical models correlate the <b>phase</b> noise/timing <b>jitter</b> with the design parameters. The design implications for low <b>phase</b> noise/timing <b>jitter</b> are derived after each model. The second part of this thesis describes the circuit designs and the test results of the three fully integrated multi-GHz PLLs fabricated using deep sub-micron digital CMOS technologies. These include a 1. 25 GHz PLL designed in a NEC 0. 24 um, 2. 5 V CMOS technology, a 2 GHz to 3. 3 GHz rate-agile PLL and a 600 MHz to 3. 3 GHz PLL designed in TSMC 0. 18 um, 1. 8 V CMOS technologies.

Jitter was modeled {{to be present in}} the system as timing jitter in the receivers ’ clock, and as <b>phase</b> <b>jitter</b> in the receivers ’ local oscillators. The system performance was evaluated in terms of probability of detection versus signal to noise ratio (SNR). Three types of MIMO radar processing schemes are investigated: a non-coherent MIMO, a decentralized radar network (DRN), and a re-phased netted radar (RPNR) processing. It was found that the presence of time jitter degraded the detection performance of the RPNR; however, it did not impose significant effects on the non-coherent MIMO and DRN processing schemes. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the <b>phase</b> <b>jitter</b> at the MIMO radar receivers directly influenced the SNR yielding the same probability of detection, regardless the type of processing scheme chosen. Limiting the <b>phase</b> <b>jitter</b> terms to below 0. 1 radian suppresses the performance degradation.

40|$|Rapid {{fluctuations}} in the amplitude and phase of a transionospheric radio signal caused by small scale plasma density irregularities in the ionosphere are known as scintillation. Scintillation can seriously impair a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) receiver tracking performance, thus affecting the required levels of availability, accuracy and integrity, and consequently the reliability of modern day GNSS based applications. This paper presents an analysis of correlation between scintillation levels and tracking performance of a GNSS receiver for GPS L 1 C/A, L 2 C and GLONASS L 1, L 2 signals. The analyses make use of data recorded over Presidente Prudente (22. 1 S, 51. 4 W, dip latitude 12. 3 S) in Brazil, a location close to the Equatorial Ionisation Anomaly (EIA) crest in Latin America.

40|$|Abstract: While {{helping to}} {{understand}} <b>phase</b> noise and <b>jitter</b> of high-performance oscillators, this paper also examines {{the impact of}} oscillator phase noise on system performance, underscoring the importance of using ultralow phase noise oscillators in systems. To an electrical engineer, {{in an ideal world}} there would be no noise. But what is noise? What is electrical noise? Or more to the point of this paper: What is phase noise? As engineers, we know intuitively that low noise in a system is better than high noise. However, we must quantify this noise in commonly accepted units. We will also examine the difference in phase noise performance of commodity vs. low-cost, high-performance crystal oscillators. Understanding the cost performance trade-offs between oscillators is important to a system design. Many times we see two competitive systems separated widely in performance, but not in price. The oscillator phase noise characteristics will dominate the entire system performance and spending a few more dollars on the oscillator can boost a system’s performance. However, an engineer can easily over-specify the oscillator, and hence the key is to understand exactly how the oscillator <b>phase</b> noise (or <b>jitter)</b> limits the system performance. To help with this understanding, a tutorial on <b>phase</b> noise and <b>jitter</b> is in order.
