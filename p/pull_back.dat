5|$|Meanwhile, between March 13 and 15, the VPA 6th Regiment {{launched}} several {{attacks on}} Chuc Meo, La Son, Hill 300 and Hill 511 located west of Huế, forcing {{elements of the}} ARVN 1st Infantry Division to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> towards Dong Tranh and Binh Dien.|$|E
5|$|Firing {{began at}} 15:29 when Prudente {{unleashed}} a close range broadside at Centurion, followed immediately by {{fire from the}} ships of both sides. Centurion was damaged in the opening exchanges and by 16:00 had most of her sails and rigging torn. At this Renaud ordered his squadron to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> to leeward out of range, each firing on Centurion as they passed.|$|E
5|$|Gonen, {{starting}} to realise {{the gravity of}} Adan's position, ordered Sharon at 14:45 to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and return to his initial positions. The Erez Armored Brigade arrived to offer assistance to Keren, but poor coordination between the commanders led {{to the failure of}} further attempts to capture Hamutal Hill. By {{the end of the day}} Adan's division alone had lost around 100 tanks.|$|E
40|$|To solve {{real-world}} {{problems by}} Genetic Algorithms (GAs), GAs {{that have a}} strong searching capability are needed. In this paper, Distributed Probabilistic Model-Building Genetic Algorithm (DPMBGA) is applied to solve the problems. The DPMBGA is an extended algorithm of Probabilistic Model-Building GA (PMBGA) and {{it also has a}} strong searching capability. In realworld problems, constraints often exist. As such, mechanisms that can treat the constraints should be added to the GAs. Two mechanisms for treating constraints are the penalty method and <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. The DPMBGA with the penalty method and <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method is applied to truss structural optimization problems. Through a simulation, the searching capability and efficiency of the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method and penalty method are discussed. From the discussion, it is concluded that the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method can derive the solutions even if the problem is difficult. Compared to the penalty method, the number of the individuals that violate the constraints is smaller in the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. ...|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, Allen led two rifle {{companies}} (Bravo and Delta) of the 2nd Battalion out from their temporary night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast, which was covered by thick jungle canopy. After marching for about , the battalion found a fortified Viet Cong bunker, so Allen ordered his men to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and directed airstrikes against Viet Cong positions. When the bombing runs were over, Allen’s men entered the camp and a firefight broke out with Viet Cong snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas. Again, Allen ordered his men to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and form a perimeter to protect their wounded soldiers, as artillery strikes were called in against Viet Cong bunker positions. The 2nd Battalion re-entered the camp, and they discovered the bodies of 17 dead Viet Cong soldiers. Allen's men then moved through {{the western end of}} the camp, and another fire-fight broke out with an estimated 60 Viet Cong soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{continued}} {{to control the}} city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> further.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi forces.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May, a halt {{order was}} {{issued by the}} German High Command, with Adolf Hitler's approval. Preventing the {{evacuation}} was left to the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), until this order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave trapped Allied forces time to construct defensive works and <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> large numbers of troops to fight the Battle of Dunkirk. From 28 to 31 May, in the Siege of Lille, the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German divisions, including three armoured divisions.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, General Walter M. Robertson, {{commander}} of the battle-hardened 2nd Infantry Division, was ordered to attack and seize the Roer River dams. In case he had to <b>pull</b> <b>back,</b> he chose Elsenborn Ridge as his defensive line. General Walter E. Lauer, commanding the 99th Infantry Division, was charged with building up the defenses around Elsenborn Ridge. Lauer knew his front was extremely long and very thinly manned; he gave instructions to his division's soldiers to dig in and build cover for their foxholes.|$|E
5|$|The Australians were {{crossing}} a creek {{that was in}} front of a steep hill. The Japanese commander waited until the Australians were almost at his position before opening fire with machine guns and mortars. The troops who had crossed the creek found hand grenades were being rolled down the hill at them; those behind it were pinned down by heavy and accurate fire. Arnold decided to <b>pull</b> <b>back.</b> That night, he formed a defensive position, and beat off a small Japanese attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{next morning}} the three {{companies}} of 4-503 were chosen to set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Because of intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleaguered battalion. On the afternoon of 21 November both battalions moved out to take the crest. During fierce, close-quarters fighting, some of the paratroopers {{made it into the}} PAVN trench line but were ordered to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> as darkness fell.|$|E
5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> to rally points, 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E
5|$|Before the UNPROFOR fully deployed, the HV {{clashed with}} an armed {{force of the}} RSK {{in the village of}} Nos Kalik, located in a pink zone near Šibenik, and {{captured}} the village at 4:45p.m. on 2 March 1992. The JNA formed a battlegroup to counterattack the next day. The JNA battlegroup, augmented by elements of the 9th Military Police Battalion, deployed at 5:50a.m. and clashed with the HV force in Nos Kalik. However, the JNA counterattack failed. The HV captured 21 RSK troops in Nos Kalik, intent on exchanging the prisoners for Croats held under arrest in Knin. Following negotiations, the HV agreed to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> on 11 April, but later declined to do so, claiming deteriorating security at the battlefield in general prevented the withdrawal. Several Serb-owned houses in Nos Kalik were torched after the HV captured the village.|$|E

5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, {{about a half a}} mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side of}} Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 February, Blücher, {{commanding}} a Prussian Corps and elements of two Russian Corps, resumed his attack against Marmont. The latter continued to fall back until he was reinforced. Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with strong combined-arms forces, which allowed the French to launch a determined counterattack and drive back the leading elements of the Army of Silesia. Blücher {{realized that he was}} facing the Emperor in person and decided to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and avoid another battle against Napoleon. In practice, Blücher's attempt to disengage proved extremely difficult to execute, as the Coalition force was by now in an advanced position, had virtually no cavalry present to cover its retreat and was facing an enemy who was ready to commit its numerous cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Rouget's {{division}} and Paris' brigade apparently began to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> after Darmagnac's retreat. Seeing a gap open between Rouget and Taupin, Wellington ordered the 52nd Foot to advance from the Roman Camp and {{drive a wedge}} into the French defensive line. The unit's commander John Colborne led his men across some marshy ground and then up the slope toward the Luc knoll, followed by Wellington and his staff. They won a foothold {{at the top of}} the ridge on Taupin's left flank. With both its flanks turned, Taupin's division hurriedly retreated to the northeast, the last French unit to be dislodged. The mauled division never rallied, though it managed to save all but two of its cannons. At some position to the rear, Rouget's {{division and}} Paris' brigade joined together and fought a hard battle against the pursuing Allies.|$|E

5|$|Starting from September 28, {{elements}} of the 1st Infantry Division were air-lifted into positions around Long Nguyen, but again only few contacts were made with the Viet Cong. However, on October 16, the 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 28th Infantry Regiment found a major Viet Cong bunker system located south of their night defensive position near the Ong Thanh Stream, and a short fire fight broke out. To avoid fighting a long battle, {{the commander of the}} 2nd Battalion decided to <b>pull</b> <b>back,</b> and made preparations for a frontal assault on the next day. On the morning of October 17, two rifle companies of the 2nd Battalion returned to the bunker system they had found the previous day, but they were defeated by the Viet Cong 271st Regiment which had set up an ambush in anticipation of the American attack.|$|E
5|$|The 162nd Division, {{concentrated}} {{south of}} Tasa, {{had been standing}} by to cross the canal since dawn on October 16. The division advanced towards the canal, but movement was hampered by the massive traffic jams on the roads leading to the canal. When Adan realized that Akavish was closed, he ordered a tank battalion to make a turning maneuver through the desert to reach Deversoir. When it arrived, Sharon contacted Adan, explaining Reshef's difficult situation, and requested that the battalion be placed under his command. Adan accepted, and Sharon in turn authorized Reshef's request to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and regroup, replacing his brigade with the tank battalion.|$|E
