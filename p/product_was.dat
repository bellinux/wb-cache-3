The <b>product</b> <b>was</b> formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the <b>product</b> <b>was</b> then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E

5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new <b>product</b> <b>was</b> designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The <b>product</b> <b>was</b> tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E

5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe.
