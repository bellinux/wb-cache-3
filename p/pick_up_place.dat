50|$|A {{significant}} role of Daisy Bates during the Civil Rights Movement was the advocating and mentoring of the Little Rock Nine. Daisy Bates' house became a National Historic Landmark {{because of her}} role during the desegregation of schools. Her house served as a haven for The Little Rock Nine. The planning of how desegregation would be carried out and the goals to implement were {{an important part of}} her role during the movement and specifically, the house was a way to help achieve advocacy for civil rights. Her house also was an official drop off and <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>place</b> for the Little Rock Nine before and after school, every day. Because her house was an official meeting place, it became a center for violence and was often damaged by segregation supporters.|$|E
50|$|If play {{goes to a}} standstill, {{the player}} picks out an exiled card and looks {{to see if it}} can be placed on the foundations. If it doesn't, then a process called weaving is used: The unplayable exiled card is placed under the pile {{corresponding}} to its rank. The top card of that pile is then <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> and <b>placed</b> under the pile corresponding to its rank. This continues until a playable card is uncovered with the last card <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>placed</b> under the appropriate pile. Play resumes as normal.|$|R

50|$|Tomkinson's race {{strategy}} {{was to have the}} two bikes circulating at different cadences, where whichever of the two was leading would employ a strategy of pressuring their nearest competitor, with the other bike circulating as a reserve without taking risks, hoping to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>places</b> if competitors succumbed to mechanical failure. Although this race-tactic worked at first, unfortunately the lead bike crashed-out in flames when ridden by Phil Gurner, partnered by Clive Brown. The second-string bike ridden by Nigel Rollason and Roger Bowler circulated steadily, achieving 686 laps in the 24-hours, finishing fourth overall (including and against machines in the 'prototype' class) and winning the 500 cc Production (road-machine) class.|$|R

5|$|Various {{courtship}} behaviours {{have been}} observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> and <b>place</b> the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.|$|R
