Recent research has revealed compelling evidence for influences from below as well. The sources of influence are meteorological changes in the troposphere like lighting and rainfall, or even earthquakes deep inside the solid Earth. As an empirical model the IRI includes these influences from above and below. The IRI model is based on <b>ionospheric</b> data obtained <b>by</b> <b>ionospheric</b> sounders, incoherent <b>scatter</b> radars, satellite and rocket measurements, and GPS TEC measurements.

A statistical analysis of backscatter data spanning 20 years from 1996 to 2015 in the total field {{of view of the}} two HF radars was carried out {{in order to determine the}} solar cycle, the annual and the diurnal variations of backscatter (<b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> and ground scatter) in both Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars over a longer time period. Increase in <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> during solar maximum previously anticipated by Milan et al., (1997 b) and higher occurrence of ground <b>scatter</b> than <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> were observed in the analysis. The study in this thesis also includes investigation on the propagation mode responsible for the occurrence of ionospheric and ground backscatter. Similar to the data used in the first analysis, 20 years of data from three selected beams were employed. In this study, it was found that occurrence of ionospheric backscatter is prominent at far ranges at local day during solar cycle 23 than solar cycle 24.

In addition, a study to identify the parameter or parameters that can be used for adequate prediction and forecast of occurrence of ionospheric backscatter for both short and long term durations was carried out.
