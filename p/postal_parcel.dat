40|$|Some {{providers}} of <b>postal</b> or <b>parcel</b> services promise {{high levels of}} service to their customers, e. g., next day delivery, resulting in tight lead times. To meet these high service levels, complex logistics networks need to be planned and operated. Such networks are typically divided into transportation of letters or parcels from customer locations to a local sorting terminal (collection), inter-terminal transportation, and transportation from a terminal to customer locations (delivery). Within postal logistics networks the interaction of processing at and transportation between different kinds of facilities plays a vital role. Normally, collection and initial sorting, as well as inter-terminal transportation and final sorting need to be finished before certain cut-off times. Thus, guaranteeing the subsequent transportation to start on time. The talk presents various optimization problems within {{the part of a}} postal logistics network where collection takes place. Then, two of those problems are presented in more detail. First, the allocation of pickup locations to sorting terminals and, second, the optimization of collection tours. Both problems not only consider service time windows at customer locations and at terminals but also complex sorting capacities at the sorting terminals. For both problems appropriate mathematical models and solution methods will be discussed. Also generic and practical applications are presented...|$|R

40|$|Hub-and-spoke {{networks}} are widely {{studied in the}} area of location theory. They arise in several contexts, including passenger airlines, <b>postal</b> and <b>parcel</b> delivery, and computer and telecommunication networks. Hub location problems usually involve three simultaneous decisions to be made: the optimal number of hub nodes, their locations and the allocation of the non-hub nodes to the hubs. In the uncapacitated single allocation hub location problem (USAHLP) hub nodes have no capacity constraints and non-hub nodes must be assigned to only one hub. In this paper, we propose three variants of a simple and efficient multi-start tabu search heuristic as well as a two-stage integrated tabu search heuristic to solve this problem. With multi-start heuristics, several different initial solutions are constructed and then improved by tabu search, while in the two-stage integrated heuristic tabu search is applied to improve both the locational and allocational part of the problem. Computational experiments using typical benchmark problems (Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and Australian Post (AP) data sets) as well as new and modified instances show that our approaches consistently return the optimal or best-known results in very short CPU times, thus allowing the possibility of efficiently solving larger instances of the USAHLP than those found in the literature. We also report the integer optimal solutions for all 80 CAB data set instances and the 12 AP instances up to 100 nodes, {{as well as for the}} corresponding new generated AP instances with reduced fixed costs.
