5|$|In 2008 FIDE {{added the}} variant Chess960 to the {{appendix}} of the Laws of Chess. Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main <b>pieces,</b> <b>with</b> {{the conditions that}} the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.|$|E
5|$|No complete, {{unambiguous}} {{description of}} the rules of a tafl game exists, but the king's objective was to escape to (variously) the board's periphery or corners, while the greater force's objective was to capture him. Although the size of the board and the number of pieces varied, all games involved a distinctive 2:1ratio of <b>pieces,</b> <b>with</b> the lesser side having a king-piece that started in the centre.|$|E
5|$|S. Samyro, {{a partial}} anagram of Samy Rosenstock, {{was used by}} Tzara from his debut and {{throughout}} the early 1910s. A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature Tristan Ruia, and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> the name Tristan.|$|E

Large cast <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> 10 van inscription on the reverse, medium cast <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> no reverse inscription, and small struck piece. All were issued in 1933.|$|R
5|$|Subsequently, in the {{recording}} studio, Sargent was most in demand to record English music, choral works and concertos. He recorded prolifically and worked with many orchestras, but made the most recordings (several dozen major <b>pieces)</b> <b>with</b> the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC), the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), the New Symphony Orchestra of London, the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO).|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the squares}} of the {{chessboard}} should be approximately 1.25 to 1.3 times {{the diameter of the}} base of the king, or 50 to 65mm. Squares of approximately 57mm (inches) normally are well-suited for <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> the kings in the preferred size range. The darker squares are usually brown or green and the lighter squares are off-white or buff.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. labiata minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> blotting paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's. Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper containing females' draglines, while females do not response to fresh blotting paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. fimbriata from Queensland showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E

5|$|On January 29, 1971, the Mint {{announced}} the {{prices for the}} 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced proof <b>pieces,</b> <b>with</b> orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early. Mint sets of the circulating coinage for 1971 {{did not include the}} Eisenhower dollar.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 2012 Square Enix {{published}} a fourth Nier album, titled Piano Collections Nier Gestalt & Replicant. Each of the 11 tracks {{on the album}} is a piano arrangement of a Nier piece. The tracks were arranged and played by several different artists, namely Keigo Hoashi, Kumi Tanioka, Masato Kouda, Ryuichi Takada, and Yuri Misumi. Each arranger performed their own <b>pieces,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of Kouda, whose arrangement was played by Tanioka. The album has a duration of 45:42, and has the catalog number SQEX-10303.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season {{would inevitably}} {{be a new}} era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence {{and the loss of}} 6th-man Lorin Dixon left {{significant}} holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E

5|$|The {{music to}} The Sorcerer's Apprentice was {{recorded}} on January 9, 1938 at Culver Studios, California with Leopold Stokowski conducting {{a group of}} session musicians. The recording of Rhapsody in Blue used in the film is an edited version of Ferde Grofé's orchestration of the piece performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra with conductor Bruce Broughton. The shortened version was made by cutting 125 bars of piano solo in three different places. A recording of James Levine conducting both <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> the Philharmonia appears on the film's soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The third error {{enumerated}} by Peter the Venerable {{was that}} the Petrobrusians “command the sacred crosses to be broken in pieces and burned, because that form or instrument by which Christ was so dreadfully tortured, so cruelly slain, is not worthy of any adoration, or veneration or supplication, but for the avenging of his torments and death it should be treated with unseemly dishonor, cut in <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> swords, burnt in fire.” This {{was seen as an}} iconoclastic heresy and as acts of sacrilege by the medieval Church, as well as by Catholics to this day.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. Knowing that the dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|Cannon sounds have {{sometimes}} {{been used in}} classical <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> a military theme. One {{of the best known}} examples of such a piece is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The overture is to be performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels high enough that musicians are required to wear ear protection. The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the Battle of Borodino, a critical battle in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, whose defeat the piece celebrates. When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor. However, the overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until Mercury Records and conductor Antal Doráti's 1958 recording of the Minnesota Orchestra. Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the 1812 on the American Independence Day, a tradition started by Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops in 1974.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, who had heard Randles play, requested that she performed with them. Before the age of two, she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> an apple and slice of cake {{on either side of}} the piano, receiving both when she finished for playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert during the spring of 1803, under the direction of the Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E
5|$|Link and the King {{return to}} Hyrule to {{discover}} that Ganon has captured Tetra. Link follows them to Ganon's tower, defeating Ganon's minions before Ganon overcomes him. Ganon joins Link's and Tetra's Triforce <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> his own Triforce of Power, forming the complete Triforce, which will grant his wish to rule the world. Before he can act, the King of Hyrule appears and makes his own wish that the Goddesses wash Ganon and Hyrule away, and grant Link and Tetra hope for their own future. Link and Tetra battle Ganon with the Master Sword and magical arrows as water pours around them; with the final blow, the Master Sword turns Ganon to stone. Link and Tetra rise to the surface as the King and Hyrule are submerged. They are reunited with their friends; a post-credits scene shows the heroes sailing off {{to find a new}} land.|$|E

5|$|On June 18, 860, at sunset, a {{fleet of}} about 200 Rus' vessels sailed into the Bosporus and started pillaging the suburbs of Constantinople (Old East Slavic: Tsarigrad, Old Norse: Miklagarðr). The attackers were setting homes on fire and {{drowning}} and stabbing the residents. Unable {{to do anything to}} repel the invaders, Patriarch Photius urged his flock to implore the Theotokos to save the city. Having devastated the suburbs, the Rus' passed into the Sea of Marmora and fell upon the Isles of the Princes, where the former Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople was in exile at the time. The Rus' plundered the dwellings and the monasteries, slaughtering the captives. They took twenty-two of the patriarch's servants aboard ship and cut them into <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> axes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{finishing}} {{moves in}} the various Mortal Kombat games include Animalities (introduced in Mortal Kombat 3) turning a victor into an animal to violently finish off the opponent; Brutality (introduced in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) which is bashing an opponent into <b>pieces</b> <b>with</b> a long combo of hits; and Stage Fatalities/Death Traps (introduced in the original Mortal Kombat Pit Stage where the victor can uppercut their opponent off of the platform into a bed of spikes below, and later made more difficult in Mortal Kombat II by requiring specific and different button sequences to be pressed) utilizing parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move (such as a pool of acid). Mortal Kombat: Deception added the Hara-Kiri, a self-Fatality allowing the losers {{to engage in a}} suicide-based finishing move (enabling a possible race between both players to see if the winning player can finish off the losing player before the losing character can kill himself or herself first).|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken <b>pieces,</b> <b>with</b> one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
