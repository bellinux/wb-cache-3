5|$|The <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> right <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and parietal lobe.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial {{dysfunction}} {{is increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} key component in compromised neuroendocrine stress response and, among other etiological causes, it may also involve action of glucocorticoid hormones. In the current study we followed glucocorticoid receptor and identified its mitochondrial phosphoisophorms in hippocampus and <b>prefrontal</b> brain <b>cortex</b> of Wistar male rats subjected to acute, chronic and combined neuroendocrine stresses. In both brain structures chronic social isolation caused marked increase in mitochondrial glucocorticoid receptor that was preferentially phosphorylated at serine 232 compared to serine 246 or serine 171. This increase corresponded with the decreased expression of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase subunits 1 and 3 in hippocampus, and with their increased expression in <b>prefrontal</b> brain <b>cortex.</b> <b>Prefrontal</b> brain <b>cortex</b> appeared {{to be more sensitive}} to chronic stress, since it exibited higher levels of mitochondrial Bax and cytoplasmic Bcl 2 compared to hippocampus. Chronic stress also altered the response of both brain structures to subsequent acute stress according to the studied parameters. Therefore, prolonged social isolation may cause susceptibility to mitochondria triggered proapototic signalling, which at least in part may be mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor dependent mechanism...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most studies {{concerning}} imaging of pain processing {{have used}} thermal, chemical, or electrical nociceptive stimulation. The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine the cortical representation of mechanical pain. For this, using functional MR (fMR) imaging at 1. 5 T, we compared activation patterns during painful and nonpainful tonic mechanical stimulation in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Eleven right-handed subjects ranging in age from 21 to 46 years underwent gradient-echo echo-planar fMR imaging while quantified tonic pressure was applied to the first metacarpophalangeal joint. Imaging parameters were 3000 / 60 (TR/TE) with a 5 -mm section thickness in a 7. 30 -minute sequence with 2 3 90 seconds of painful stimulation interleaved with 3 3 90 seconds of nonpainful stimulation. Functional images were processed using dedi-cated IDL software. RESULTS: Mechanical tonic nociceptive pressure was associated with activation of the pri-mary somatosensory cortex contralateral to the hand stimulated and variable, often bilateral activation of the secondary somatosensory, temporal, anterior and posterior cingulate, insular, and <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortexes.</b> Thalamic activation was inconsistent and always contralateral t...|$|R

Accordingly, we conducted a study to investigate the relation between EI and performance in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (a neuropsychological test, used to evaluate some of the frontal lobe functions). Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 250 volunteers from BS and BA students of universities of Tehran were recruited using available sampling method. Bar-on EI, general health questionnaire (GHQ- 28) and Raven's Progressive Matrices were completed by the participants. They were categorized into two groups; each group contained 40 students with high and low EI, whose performance in WCST were evaluated thereafter individually. Data was analyzed by MANOVA. Results: Our results showed that the high EI group had a better performance in WCST than the low EI group.

5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas.

It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks.

On postmortem <b>prefrontal</b> and temporal <b>cortex</b> of diabetic patients and controls, immunohistochemical stainings were carried out using specific antibodies against three proteins (PAL-E, IgG and albumin), which are considered as markers for the vascular permeability status of the BBB. Rare or no PAL-E staining was found in the capillaries of the <b>prefrontal</b> and temporal <b>cortex</b> parenchyma, in both DM and control materials.

To elucidate the molecular phenotype of HD on a genome-wide scale, we compared mRNA profiles from 44 human HD brains with those from 36 unaffected controls using microarray analysis. Four brain regions were analyzed: caudate nucleus, cerebellum, <b>prefrontal</b> association <b>cortex</b> [Brodmann's area 9 (BA 9) ] and motor cortex [Brodmann's area 4 (BA 4) ]. The greatest number and magnitude of differentially expressed mRNAs were detected in the caudate nucleus, followed by motor cortex, then cerebellum. Thus, the molecular phenotype of HD generally parallels established neuropathology. Surprisingly, no mRNA changes were detected in <b>prefrontal</b> association <b>cortex,</b> thereby revealing subtleties of pathology not previously disclosed by histological methods. To establish that the observed changes were not simply the result of cell loss, we examined mRNA levels in laser-capture microdissected neurons from Grade 1 HD caudate compared to control. These analyses confirmed changes in expression seen in tissue homogenates; we thus conclude that mRNA changes are not attributable to cell loss alone.

5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia.

5000|$|Neurological {{research}} by Allan Schore and others using EEG-fMRI neuroimaging suggests that {{though it may}} first be manifest following a turbulent flight, fear of flying is {{not the result of}} a sensitizing event. The underlying problem is inadequate development of ability to regulate emotion when facing uncertainty, except through feeling in control or able to escape. According to Schore, the ability to adequately regulate emotion fails to develop when relationship with caregivers is not characterized by attunement and empathy. [...] "Because these mothers are unable to regulate their own distress, they cannot regulate their infant's distress." [...] Chronic stress and emotional dysregulation during {{the first two years of}} life inhibits development of the right <b>prefrontal</b> orbito <b>cortex,</b> and hinders the integration of the emotional control system.

Two forms of learning occur simultaneously. In discrimination learning, goal-directed actions are selected through recognition of external stimuli through the connections between the frontal cortex and the striatum, and is mediated by dopaminergic signals through a reinforcement learning mechanism. With practice, skill learning shifts from discrimination learning to Hebbian learning, which directly associates stimuli to responses by strengthening {{the connection between the}} <b>prefrontal</b> and pre-motor <b>cortex.</b> The model shows that FP training, in which all task components are equally weighted during training, leads to less flexible discrimination learning than VP training.

In vivo assay, UGT 2 B 7 was significantly repressed in the livers of acute or chronic morphine tolerance mice pretreated with LCA (10, 50 and 100 mg/kg, p. o.). To investigate {{the connections between}} LCA function performance and changes of UGT 2 B 7 enzymatic activity in mice livers, two morphine metabolites, morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G) and morphine- 6 -glucuronide (M 6 G) were quantified by solid phase extraction (SPE) -HPLC-MS/MS. The result indicated no matter in acute or chronic morphine tolerance, the concentrations of M 3 G and M 6 G were all decreased, the later one fell even more. Besides that, 50 mg/kg of LCA administration can prevent auto-phosphorylation of CaMKIIα at Thr 286 in acute or chronic morphine tolerance mice <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortexes</b> (mPFCs) due to synthesis increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
