40|$|Demands for {{including}} more {{functions such as}} haptic guiding in power steering systems in road vehicles have increased with requirements on new active safety and comfort systems. Active safety systems, which have been proven {{to have a positive}} effect on overall vehicle safety, refer to systems that give the driver assistance in more and less critical situations to avoid accidents. Active safety features are going to play an increasingly important roll in future safety strategies; therefore, it is essential that sub systems in road vehicles, such as power steering systems, are adjusted to meet new demands. The traditional Hydraulic Power Assisted Steering, HPAS, system, cannot meet these new demands, due to the control unit's pure hydro-mechanical solution. The Active Pinion concept presented in this thesis is a novel concept for controlling the steering wheel torque in future active safety and comfort applications. The concept, which can be seen as a modular add-on added to a traditional HPAS system, introduces an additional degree of freedom to the control unit. Different control modes used to meet the demands of new functionality applications are presented and tested in a hardware-in-the-loop test rig. This thesis also covers various aspects of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> in road vehicles. Power steering is viewed as a dynamic system and is investigated with linear and non-linear modeling techniques. The valve design in terms of area gradient is essential for the function of the HPAS system; therefore, a method involving optimization has been developed to determine the valve characteristic. The method uses static measurements as a base for calculation and optimization; the results are used in both linear and the non-linear models. With the help of the linear model, relevant transfer functions and the underlying control structure of the power steering system have been derived and analyzed. The non-linear model has been used in concept validation of the Active Pinion. Apart from concept validation and controller design of the active pinion, the models have been roven effective to explain dynamic phenomena related to HPAS systems, such as the chattering phenomena and hydraulic lag. The printed version and the electronic version differ in that the electronic version contains two built in video films (see page 78 and page 89) ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{conventional}} automotive engine ancillaries have migrated from being mechanically powered to electrically powered {{in order to}} meet market demand. To adopt this trend in heavy trucks requires a higher power electrical system in order to cope with the higher loads placed upon it. Until the advent of the hybrid electric heavy truck (HET) this power infrastructure has not been available. HET's require a higher voltage system in order to reduce losses and provide adequate power and voltage levels for the traction motor. This study investigates {{for the first time the}} benefit of electrifying a hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> in an HET.

This paper discusses the implementation of GA-PID algorithm to realise the potential of energy reduction as compared to conventional PID method.

Comfort and performance parameters such as ride, handling, tactile transfer functions and overall noise levels are directly affected by its performance. The modeling of a HPAS system using the bond graph technique makes possible the combination of hydraulic and mechanical components. This allows physical and design variables such as fluid compressibility and hoses diameters to be evaluated simultaneously. HPAS should be used as a design and tuning tool to develop different system configurations before prototype test build, representing an improvement in terms of product development time and cost for both component and vehicle level...|$|R
40|$|Electric <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (EPAS) <b>system</b> is {{a current}} state of the art {{technology}} for providing the steering torque support. The interaction of the <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> with the driver is principally governed by the EPAS control method. This paper proposes a control concept for designing the steering feel with a model based approach. The reference steering feel is defined in virtual dynamics for tracking. The layout of the reference model and the control architecture is discussed at first and then the decoupling of EPAS motor dynamics using a feedback control is shown. An example of how a change in steering feel reference (as desired by the driver) creates a change in steering feedback is further exhibited. The ultimate goal is to provide the driver with a tunable steering feel. For this, the verification is performed in simulation environment...|$|R

40|$|The vehicle {{brands of}} today {{need to develop}} high quality {{products}} {{in a short period}} of time to satisfy the consumer needs and to stand out in the competition. To be able to do this simulation tools have been used more and more in the development process. This would enable quick evaluation of different concepts and setups without the need of building physical prototypes (though physical prototypes are still common to validate development in different stages). The goal of this thesis is to contribute to this trend by developing and evaluating a process of optimizing the control parameters of an EPAS (electronic <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> <b>steering)</b> <b>system</b> by solely using computer aided engineering (CAE) tools. This tuning is done to improve the steering feel for the driver. The process could then be used to improve the initial tuning of such a system or in a later stage completely parameterize it. In this project, a complete process from setting up the simulation environment to developing the optimization process of the parameters was developed. A vehicle model was simulated using the real time simulation software IPG CarMaker, parameterized by multi-body simulation results and tyre measurements. The <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> itself was modelled by the supplier in Simulink so that the entire vehicle could be co-simulated using both CarMaker and Simulink. To evaluate the performance of the <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> objective metrics were used, each of which had a target range. The optimization process itself utilizes the optimization tool Tomlab, which is a powerful Matlab toolbox. Tomlab uses a complex strategy of evaluating the response of a system when the relationship between the inputs (in this case the EPAS control parameters) and the outputs (in this case the objective metrics) is unknown. A cost function using the difference between the target metric value and the actual metric value was set up and the weighing factors for each of the tested metrics were determined by their sensitivity to the optimized parameter. The developed process was tested on three specific metrics for two specific parameters of the controller. These metrics were the friction feel, the torque build-up and the torque deadband, all three of which relates to the torque feedback of the steering wheel. All three metric values had room for improvement but after going through the developed process they could be adapted to be closer to the optimal target. These results need to be validated, but as a proof of concept the work described in this thesis shows that it is possible to parameterize a vehicle subsystem by only using CAE tools...|$|R
40|$|A {{sample of}} fifty male and fifty female drivers {{took part in}} an:. {{experiment}} designed to evaluate a multi-characteristic <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system.</b> Subjects drove a car fitted with the system for two one-hour periods on public roads and on two test-track sessions during which a number of driving performance variables including driving time and steering activity were recorded. Drivers completed a specially developed questionnaire after each road drive. A subsidiary task, which involved the visual monitoring of an illuminated display and verbal responses, was administered during the test-track sessions. Factor analysis and discriminant analysis were used to analyse data from the questionnaire, road drives and test- track sessions. Data were first factor analysed and the factors subsequently used as variables in the discriminant analyses. It was possible to discriminate {{between male and female}} drivers, and between groups of drivers allocated to the different power steering characteristics {{on the basis of the}} discriminant functions derived. Thus, reales were found to be more sensitive to the force feedback characteristics of the standard power steering than females, finding it difficult to judge the amount of effort required to steer the car and tending to 'over steer' under some circumstances. Males drove faster than the females on the Motorway with the standard power steering, however, more slowly than females in urban driving, and drove faster and more accurately than females on the test-track. On the basis of the differences observed between drivers allocated to the different power steering characteristics, criteria were developed which allowed the specification of that characteristic which could be considerec 'optimal' for ordinary drivers of both sexes. This character- istic, termed "Speed Proportional Feel", provides the driver with full power assistance at low speeds, but increasingly inhibits the operation of the power assistance as vehicle speeds rise, giving more steering 'feel' at high speeds. The test-track data were further analysed by means of the analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. The results of the analysis of variance indicated that the presence of the subsidiary task had affected drivers' performance on the test-track. Analysis of covariance was used to provide a statistical control for the effects of the subsidiary task on drivers' primary task performance and a significant learning effect was observed. No significant differences were found in the number of subsidiary task responses made by drivers allocated to different steering characteristics. A recommendation was made for further research into the observed differences between males' and females' driving speeds which, it was suggested, may be related to the types of accident in which males and females are typically involved. Further research into the level of artificial 'feel' favoured by male and female-drivers was also recommended on the basis of the finding that females appeared to respond more favour- ably to a lower level of 'feel' than males...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{definitive}} version is available from: incedl. orgIntroduction: To achieve {{low levels of}} noise and vibration {{in the interior of}} a vehicle, the noise levels from major sources such as the engine and transmission have been greatly reduced in recent years. Unfortunately, this has meant that the noise from ancillary components has become relatively more prominent. One such component is the <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (PAS) <b>system,</b> the noise from which is a problem on nearly all vehicles. This paper reports an investigation into the moaning noise produced when the steering wheel is turned at idle, commonly known as PAS moan. The major factors involved in PAS moan are: the transmission of structure-borne and air-borne noise through the vehicle; the transmission of pressure ripples in the hydraulic circuit of the PAS system; and the generation of flow ripples at the PAS pump. In section 3 the results of a study into the reduction of PAS moan is reported. Section 3. 1 outlines the experimental set-up and measurement technique. Section 3. 2 reports on the effect on vehicle interior noise of the installation of the of the PAS system. Section 3. 3 reports on the influence of tuning hoses in the PAS hydraulic circuit and section 3. 4 gives an assessment of the reduction in interior noise due to a modification of the power steering pump. The findings outlined in this paper are part of more detailed study into power steering noise reported in reference [1]...|$|R

50|$|Most new {{vehicles}} now have power steering, {{owing to the}} trends toward front wheel drive, greater vehicle mass, and wider tires, which all increase the required steering effort.

50|$|The main {{mechanical}} differentiator {{between the}} new Ka and its Fiat sibling is that the Ford has better shock absorption than the Fiat 500. Fitting a rear anti-roll bar enabled 30 percent softer springs and accordingly retuned dampers to improve ride performance over uneven road surfaces. Some of these improvements were subsequently adopted on Fiat 500 Abarth and Fiat 500C models. Changes were also made to the 500's steering geometry for the Ka, although as the new Ka uses an electrically <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> it lacks the communication of its predecessor's hydraulically <b>assisted</b> <b>steering.</b> However, the electric <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> does make the steering much lighter and more energy efficient than its predecessor.|$|R

5000|$|Criticism of the {{handling}} of early examples in the UK led to the fitting as standard of radial-ply tyres on the larger-engined version {{in place of the}} more conventional (in the UK at that time) cross-ply tyres with which all versions were shod at the 1966 launch, and the retro-fitting of radial-ply tyres to early examples addressed the tendency of the rear wheels to slide uncontrollably in wet weather, justifying in the process Ford's investment in a new and relatively sophisticated rear suspension arrangement for the Mark IVs. [...] Even after that a contemporary nevertheless opined that the ride involved a certain amount of 'float', and reported that the nose-heavy handling called for a 'strong driver', a problem which the more expensive Zodiac and Executive versions mitigated through the fitting as a standard feature of <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering.</b> Cost constraints precluded adding <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> for the Zephyr, but during its production run the steering ratio was lowered which reduced the strength needed to change direction by increasing the number of turns between locks from 5.5 to an even higher 6.4. [...] Another production modification for the 4-cylinder Zephyr involved redesigning the valve gear in order to eliminate the need on the early Mk IVs for frequent tappet adjustments.|$|R
