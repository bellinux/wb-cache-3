5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by <b>pack</b> <b>horse</b> to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The first road {{along the}} {{corridor}} of MD 30 was a wagon road cut along an existing Indian trail in 1736 and 1737 to connect the Conewago Settlement, which later became Hanover, with Baltimore Town, which served as a much closer port for farmers and merchants in York County and Adams County, Pennsylvania, than Philadelphia. This road {{became known as the}} Conewago Road, <b>Pack</b> <b>Horse</b> Road, or the Wheelbarrow Road, the last due to the namesake implements being used to haul stones to widen the road by order of Maryland in 1793. The highway became a toll road with the 1805 incorporation of the Baltimore and Reisterstown Turnpike Company, which operated between the two towns and split into Westminster and Hanover branches in Reisterstown. The latter branch became known as the Hanover Turnpike or the Baltimore and Hanover Turnpike and had ceased to collect tolls by 1899.|$|E

5|$|The Dole Gudbrandsdal, Dølahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway. The Dole Trotter is {{alternately}} {{considered a}} subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{and a separate}} breed; it is also considered {{a part of the}} Coldblood trotter type. The Dole Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse, known for its pulling power and agility, while the Dole Trotter is a smaller, faster horse used for harness racing; the two types are commonly interbred. Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the studbook, which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type. The Dole is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley, and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse. Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred, Arabian and other blood added in, especially during the creation of the Dole Trotter in the 19th century. The first studbook was created in 1941, and the current breed association formed in 1947. Although originally used mainly as a <b>pack</b> <b>horse,</b> today the heavier Dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes. The Dole Gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pack</b> <b>Horse</b> Centre is {{a covered}} pedestrianised {{shopping}} area constructed over a cobblestone street, <b>Pack</b> <b>Horse</b> Yard, renamed <b>Pack</b> <b>Horse</b> Walk. Pack horses carried merchandise over pack-horse routes across the Pennines before turnpike {{roads and railways}} improved transportation. The pedestrian link passes from Kirkgate, across King Street and along Victoria Lane, by the Shambles, to the Piazza and the distinctive market hall at Queensgate, which was built to replace the old Shambles Market Hall in the early 1970s. Next to the Piazza is the Victorian town hall and the 1930s public library.|$|E

Marching slowly north into the Six Nations territory in central western New York, the campaign had only one major battle, the Battle of Newtown, fought on August 29. It was a complete victory for the Continental Army. Later a 25-man detachment of the Continental Army was ambushed, and all but five captured and killed at the Boyd and Parker ambush. On September 1 Captain John Combs died of an illness.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} year {{saw more}} intensive collecting by Walcott. He {{and his two}} sons systematically investigated every stratum of rock to locate {{the source of the}} block they had found the previous summer. They eventually identified the productive layers, including the Phyllopod bed, in what would become the Walcott Quarry. They began to excavate this outcrop, sending blocks by <b>pack</b> <b>horse</b> to Walcott's wife, who split the shale and prepared fossils for transportation downhill to Field, and onwards by rail to Washington. While reporting his finds in the following year, Walcott first coined the term 'Burgess Shale', proposing it to form a facies within the Stephen Formation. These reports covered many now-familiar animal genera, although few of Walcott's proposed classifications would stand the test of time; they were also Walcott's final publications on Burgess Shale animals.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{original}} British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s {{to the extent that}} almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a turnpike trust. New engineered roads were built by John Metcalf, Thomas Telford and most notably John McAdam, with the first 'macadamised' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816. The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of <b>pack</b> <b>horse.</b> Stage coaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on carriers carts.|$|E
500|$|The river {{runs through}} the Cheshire salt-producing area, but was not deep enough to allow boats to reach the salt mines. It was tidal for around [...] to Pickering's wharf, and salt from the mines was carried by <b>pack</b> <b>horse</b> to the wharf, where it was loaded into barges. These used the ebbing tide to carry them back down the river. By the early 17th century, coal was being transported into the area {{so that it could}} be used to {{evaporate}} the brine, and as the industry expanded, there were calls to improve the river to simplify this trade. There was opposition to the initial schemes, however, from landowners who feared flooding and from carriers who feared a loss of trade, which resulted in Bills laid before Parliament in 1711, 1715, 1718 and 1720 being defeated.|$|E
500|$|Staff Sergeant Reckless (c. 1948 – May 13, 1968), a {{decorated}} war horse who held official {{rank in the}} United States military, was a mare of Mongolian horse breeding. [...] Out of a race horse dam, she was purchased in October 1952 for $250 from a Korean stableboy at the Seoul racetrack who needed money to buy an artificial leg for his sister. [...] Reckless was bought {{by members of the}} United States Marine Corps and trained to be a <b>pack</b> <b>horse</b> for the Recoilless Rifle Platoon, Anti-Tank Company, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. She quickly became part of the unit and was allowed to roam freely through camp, entering the Marines' tents, where she would sleep on cold nights, and was known for her willingness to eat nearly anything, including scrambled eggs, beer, Coca-Cola and, once, about $30 worth of poker chips.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the fall}} and winter of 1902, word of the gold strike and the new {{settlement}} spread throughout Alaska and the Yukon. Printer George M. Hill, who had been working in Dawson City, packed up his small press and traveled to Fairbanks in early 1903. On September 19, 1903, he printed the first newspaper in the new settlement: Volume I, Issue I of the Weekly Fairbanks News. Little is known about Hill's operation, but he likely used either a Washington Hand Press or an [...] "Army" [...] press — both were small machines designed for transport on a single <b>pack</b> <b>horse</b> or pack mule.

500|$|A {{variety of}} work horses were used {{throughout}} the Middle Ages. [...] The <b>pack</b> <b>horse</b> (or [...] "sumpter horse") carried equipment and belongings. Common riding horses, often called [...] "hackneys", [...] {{could be used as}} [...] pack horses. Cart horses pulled wagons for trading and freight haulage, on farms, or as part of a military campaign. These draught horses were smaller than their modern counterparts; pictorial and archaeological evidence suggests that they were stout but short, approximately , and capable of drawing a load of [...] per horse. Four-wheeled wagons and two-wheeled carts were more common in towns, such as London and, depending on type of vehicle and weight of the load, were usually pulled by teams of two, three, or four horses harnessed in tandem. Starting in the 12th century, in England the use of oxen to pull carts was gradually superseded by the use of horses, a process that extended through the 13th century. This change came because horse-drawn transport moved goods quicker and over greater distances than ox-drawn methods of transport.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{ancestors of}} the Breton were a population of horses that lived in the Breton mountains, possibly descended from steppe horses ridden by Celts. During the Crusades, these mountain horses were crossed with oriental horses to create a type known as the Bidet Breton. In the Middle Ages, the ancestral Breton horse was sought by military leaders, partly because of its comfortable gait, which {{was said to be}} partway between a brisk trot and an amble. [...] Due to its gaits {{and the fact that it}} only stood about [...] high, it was nicknamed the Bidet d'Allure or Bidet Breton. [...] Horses of other bloodlines brought back to Europe during the Crusades had a strong influence on the Breton, and two types subsequently developed. [...] The Sommier was the common, heavier type, used mainly as a <b>pack</b> <b>horse</b> and for farm and draft work. From the Sommier, the Roussin was developed, was used mainly in wars and on long journeys. The Roussins natural ambling gait made it popular as a lighter riding horse.|$|E
