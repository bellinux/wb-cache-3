50|$|A classic form of sheetforming is deep drawing, {{which is}} done by drawing a sheet {{by means of a}} <b>punch</b> <b>tool</b> {{pressing}} on the inner region of the sheet, whereas the side material held by a blankholder can be drawn toward the center. It has been observed that materials with outstanding deep drawability behave anisotropically (see: anisotropy). Plastic deformation in the surface is much more pronounced than in the thickness. The lankford coefficient (r) is a specific material property indicating the ratio between width deformation and thickness deformation in the uniaxial tensile test. Materials with very good deep drawability have an r value of 2 or below. The positive aspect of formability with respect to the forming limit curve (forming limit diagram) is seen in the deformation paths of the material that are concentrated in the extreme left of the diagram, where the forming limits become very large.|$|E

The {{complexity of}} the process results from high nonlinear boundary conditions, {{as well as from}} contact profile and frictional effects. The SPIF analysis is mathematically complex.

Although flight membrane injuries are commonly observed in wild-caught bats, {{in most cases the}} damage heals completely. Previous studies examining wound healing in the flight membranes of bats have not taken into consideration energy constraints that could influence healing times. Wound healing results in increased energy demands, therefore we hypothesized that wound healing times would be slower during periods of energy conservation and/or energy output. In this study we used an 8  mm diameter circular <b>punch</b> <b>tool</b> to biopsy the wing membranes of healthy adult female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) from a captive research colony to test the hypothesis that healing times will vary with seasonal temperature changes between the summer and winter seasons, and with reproductive condition between lactating and non-reproductive females.

Surprisingly, no difference in healing time was observed between lactating and non-reproductive females. The wings of most bats fully healed, although some individuals showed wound expansion demonstrating that impaired healing is occasionally observed in otherwise healthy subjects...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} challenge faced {{when using}} blanking/piercing to machine sheet metal is {{the handling of}} the shearing force required for high strength and thick stock. Increased shearing forces lead to the requirement of higher performance expected from the pressing machine and result in increased wear on the <b>punch</b> <b>tool</b> and die. Clearance, employed to increase precision and quality in blanking/piercing operations, affects the shearing force as well. One of the techniques used to reduce the force required is the employment of a punch shear angle. In this study, the effects of punch shear angle and clearance on the forces required for blanking/piercing were examined on a grade of steel broadly used in the manufacturing industry, DC 01. Experiments were carried out using five different punch shear angles, namely 0 °, 2 °, 4 °, 8 °, and 16 °. Six matrices with varying clearance rates (0. 4 %t, 0. 5 %t, 0. 6 %t, 0. 7 %t, 0. 8 %t, and 0. 9 %t) were used in this study, and these clearances were altered by modular matrices on the die. This study shows that shearing forces can be reduced by 80 % when 16 ° punch angle is used. The results of the experiments were transferred to a fuzzy logic model to obtain extrapolated results for intermediate values which had not been obtained from the experiments. The results obtained from the experiments and the output from the fuzzy logic model were compared and found to be highly similar. These results have showed that the model developed using fuzzy logic can be used to determine different shear angles and clearance values...|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} supports {{the claim that}} a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is involved in most cases of human hypertension, and therefore a more thorough understanding of the central regulation of the SNS may help elucidate novel therapeutic options. The PVN is a key region in SNS regulation of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Stimulation of the parvocellular PVN neurons {{has been shown to}} enhance sympathetic outflow and thereby increase BP. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a modulator of neuronal activity is upregulated in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in response to several hypertensive stimuli such as stress and hyperosmolarity, and previous studies from our lab demonstrated that both acute injections or chronic overexpression of BDNF in the PVN elevate SNS activity and BP. However, the BDNF-mediated hypertensive mechanisms are not completely understood. PVN neurons are under tonic inhibition from NTS catecholaminergic projections under baseline condition as indicated by significant BP increase after selective lesioning of NTS NE-ergic neurons. In addition, BDNF has been shown to alter NE-ergic signaling in multiple brain regions raising the possibility that BDNF may increase SNS activity and BP by interfering with NE-ergic inhibition of PVN sympathoregulatory neurons. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that BDNF increases SNS activity and BP in part by disabling inhibitory actions of NTS catecholaminergic projections to the PVN by altering the expression of adrenergic receptors and NET in the PVN. First, blood pressure was recorded using radiotelemetry in male Sprague-Dawley rats following bilateral microinjections of adeno-associated viral vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) or myc-tagged BDNF in the PVN and microinjections of phosphate saline buffer (PBS) or Anti-Dopaine Beta Hydroxylase (DBH) -conjugated saporin (DSAP), a catecholaminergic neuron-specific neurotoxin, into the NTS. Blood pressure was monitored both during resting conditions and during acute stress tests. A second group of rats received bilateral microinjections of adeno-associated viral vectors expressing GFP or myc-tagged BDNF in the PVN, and were sacrificed after 5 weeks. PVN and NTS samples were then selectively isolated using a brain <b>punch</b> <b>tool,</b> and expression of TH, DBH, 1 a, 1 b, 2 a, 1, 2 receptors, and norepinephrine transporter (NET) was analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. Our results show that BDNF overexpression in the PVN leads to increased expression of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes in the NTS. In addition, both BDNF overexpression in the PVN, and DSAP lesioning in the NTS increased MAP compared to control rats. However, combined treatment with BDNF and DSAP failed to have any additional hypertensive effects suggesting that BDNF treatment may abolish the inhibitory effect of NTS catecholaminergic projections. Lesioning the NTS catecholaminergic neurons didn’t appear to {{have a significant effect on}} mean arterial pressure response to the stress tests, although DSAP treatment appeared to decrease the initial heart rate response to acute stress, and this effect was most pronounced in GFP rats. These results indicate that BDNF overexpression in the PVN desensitizes sympathoregulatory neurons to inhibitory NTS catecholaminergic projections during baseline conditions...|$|E
