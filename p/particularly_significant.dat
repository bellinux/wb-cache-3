5|$|The {{street was}} not <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> until 1820, when Decimus Burton {{constructed}} Hyde Park Corner at the lane's southern edge, coinciding with Benjamin Dean Wyatt's reconstruction of Londonderry House and Apsley House.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the period}} Scotland had adopted many of the major tenets of the European Renaissance in art, {{architecture}} and literature and produced a developed educational system. This period has been seen one in which a clear national identity emerged in Scotland, as well as significant distinctions between different regions of the country which would be <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> in the period of the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were <b>particularly</b> <b>significant,</b> bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|Early in his term, Breathitt won favor {{from both}} Whigs and Democrats by {{opposing}} South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, {{the state legislature}} passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This action was <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> because John C. Calhoun's justification for nullification was largely based on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.|$|E
5|$|Northampton's is a {{comparatively}} elaborate war memorial, {{especially for a}} town rather than a city. It consists of a Stone of Remembrance flanked by tall twin obelisks, each adorned {{with a pair of}} painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a Stone of Remembrance, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> among his works.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle East, British {{counter-intelligence}} {{was directed}} at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy {{in the face of}} Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> effort {{was directed at}} intercepting the Kabul Mission. The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan, and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who may have been tempted by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led it between March and October 1916.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined for a century thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|Many {{painters}} {{of the early}} part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, such as the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland, and were to varying degree influenced by forms of Neoclassicism. The influence of Italy was <b>particularly</b> <b>significant,</b> with over fifty Scottish artists and architects known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80.|$|E

50|$|The Matenadaran's main {{objectives}} are {{first and foremost}} the 1) preservation, restoration, and reproduction of the manuscripts; 2) their procurement; 3) the organization and cataloging of Armenian manuscripts; and 4) the distribution and publication of <b>particularly</b> historically <b>significant</b> Armenian manuscripts in languages asides from Armenian. In 1941, it began publishing its official periodical, Banber Matenadarani (The Matenadaran Herald) which are accompanied with Russian and French abstracts.|$|R
5|$|Scotland in {{this era}} {{produced}} {{some of the most}} significant British artists and architects.

5|$|Trace fossils consist {{mainly of}} tracks and burrows, but also include coprolites (fossil feces) and marks left by feeding. Trace fossils are <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> because they {{represent}} a data source that {{is not limited to}} animals with easily fossilised hard parts, and they reflect organisms' behaviours. Also many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them. Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible, traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals (comparable to earthworms).|$|E
5|$|With the typhoon {{approaching}} landfall {{in an area}} {{still recovering}} from previous storms, relief agencies already servicing the region were forced to allocate additional resources to prepare for Nanmadol. Evacuation efforts assisted in moving almost 100,000people into shelters. Effects from Nanmadol were most severe in Cagayan Valley, where 14people were killed. Power outages were widespread across several islands. Overall, damage from the typhoon in the Philippines totaled ₱2.23billion (US$39.3million). Heavy rainfall, peaking at , was documented in Taiwan. Agricultural damage in Taiwan alone reached NT$670million (US$20.8million). Similar effects were felt in Japan, where the remnants of Nanmadol produced record-breaking rainfall and wind. Damage was <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> in Aichi Prefecture, totaling JP¥69.8 million (US$680,000). Overall, Nanmadol resulted in 77fatalities and US$60.8million in damage across three countries.|$|E

5|$|Leif's {{successful}} expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to {{also make}} the journey. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, who the Norse later referred to as skrælingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> by contemporaries, or that it {{was assumed to be}} public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} bird species {{found in the}} Mendips, the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), which has gradually recolonised the area since the 1980s, is <b>particularly</b> <b>significant.</b> It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and {{on the faces of}} active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance due to colonisation by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata), which can be found at Black Down and Crook Peak. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. The woodlands at Stock Hill are a breeding site for nightjars (Caprimulgus europaeus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus). The Waldegrave Pool, part of Priddy Mineries, is an important site for dragonflies, including downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) and four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata). Waldegrave Pool is the only Mendip breeding site for downy emerald dragonflies. In 2007 the first confirmed sighting of a red kite (Milvus milvus) on the Mendips was made at Charterhouse.|$|E
5|$|<b>Particularly</b> <b>significant</b> to {{the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, {{high-velocity}} bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
50|$|Tourism is <b>significant,</b> <b>particularly</b> for the {{hot springs}} at Baden and Schinznach-Bad, the ancient castles, the landscape, and the many old museums in the canton. Hillwalking is another tourist {{attraction}} but is of only limited significance.|$|R
40|$|Extreme value {{theory is}} {{examined}} {{to explain the}} cause of the bias and spread in performance of communications systems characterized by low bit rates and high data reliability requirements, for cases in which underlying noise is Gaussian or perturbed Gaussian. Experimental verification is presented and procedures that minimize these effects are suggested. Even under these conditions, however, extreme value theory test results are not <b>particularly</b> more <b>significant</b> than bit error rate tests...|$|R
50|$|The southeastern United States is {{particularly}} prone to violent, long track tornadoes. Much {{of the housing}} in this region is less robust compared to other areas in the United States, and many people live in mobile homes. As a result, tornado-related casualties in the southern United States are <b>particularly</b> higher. <b>Significant</b> tornadoes occur less frequently than in the traditionally recognized tornado alley, however, very severe and expansive outbreaks occur every few years.|$|R
5|$|The {{commissioning}} of memorials occurred {{through a}} wide range of national and local institutions, reflecting local political traditions; funding was similarly disparate, with most countries relying heavily on local charitable contributions to cover the costs of construction. War cemeteries and memorials to <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> battles, however, were typically centrally controlled and funded by the state. The war encouraged the creation of new forms of memorial. Lists of memorial names, reflecting the huge scale of the losses, were a common feature, while Tombs of the Unknown Soldier containing a selected, unidentified body, and empty cenotaph monuments commemorated the numerous unidentifiable corpses and those servicemen whose bodies were never found. Ceremonies were often held at the memorials, including those on Armistice Day, Anzac Day and the Fêtes de la Victoire, while pilgrimages to the sites of the conflict and the memorials there were common in the inter-war years.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{the first}} {{prolonged}} conflict in Britain to involve the use of artillery and gunpowder. Sieges became a prominent {{part of the war}} with over 300 occurring during the period. Worcester was once again a strategically important region in the war, and walled towns and cities like Worcester that could be defended against passing armies were <b>particularly</b> <b>significant</b> from a military perspective. By the 1640s the design of military fortifications had progressed significantly on the continent, owing largely to the Thirty Years War; while older medieval stone walls still had military utility, they typically needed reinforcement with more modern earthworks to be truly effective. These new ideas were applied to city defences in England. In some cases a circuit of forts was built around a city; in other cases, an entirely new city wall comprising modern bastions would be built. At Worcester, the unimproved walls were considered to be indefensible {{at the start of the}} war in 1642, and the chosen solution was to directly reinforce the existing medieval wall with new earthworks.|$|E
25|$|This {{temperature}} jump is <b>particularly</b> <b>significant,</b> {{since it}} allows liquid nitrogen as a refrigerant, replacing liquid helium.|$|E
50|$|The {{main reason}} for a power system {{connection}} between the two islands is due to New Zealand's geography and demographics. The South Island has a large number of rivers suitable for hydroelectricity generation, however 75% of New Zealand's population lives in the North Island. HVDC was chosen for the inter-island connection because it is a more practical and economical solution for long distance transmission, <b>particularly</b> where <b>significant</b> lengths of cable are required.|$|R
25|$|Parental {{education}} about Panayiotopoulos syndrome {{is the cornerstone}} of correct management. The traumatizing, sometimes long-lasting effect on parents is <b>significant</b> <b>particularly</b> because autonomic seizures may last for many hours compounded by physicians’ uncertainty regarding diagnosis, management, and prognosis.|$|R
30|$|We {{examined}} behavior over {{a relatively}} short time (e.g., up to a day after promotion). Over longer times, additional factors could become <b>significant,</b> <b>particularly</b> a decrease in the interestingness as news stories submitted to Digg become ‘old news’ [21].|$|R
