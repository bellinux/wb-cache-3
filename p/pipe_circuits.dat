40|$|The {{performance}} of an inexpensive floor heating system is studied {{by means of}} a numerical simulation tool. The study deals with an energy efficient detached single-family house. A building with such low space heating demand (25 - 30 kWh/m 2 /year) yields a low floor surface temperature and this in turn means that the so-called self-regulating effect is significant. Initially, the design of the <b>pipe</b> <b>circuits</b> is studied. Especially the allocation of heat between different rooms are studied; the purpose is to find a design where the set-up of required fluid supply temperatures are as uniform as possible among the <b>pipe</b> <b>circuits.</b> Detailed simulations of the heating season is conducted for two simulation cases, one with a constant supply temperature, derived from the initial simulations; and a second case with a variable supply temperature. The results yield an apparent effect of self-regulation; the heat flux from the embedded floor heating pipes increases when the indoor air temperature declines and can be totally blocked when high indoor temperatures arise. Furthermore, excess heat is transferred from over-tempered zones towards the manifold assembly in the hydronic system. The occurrence of heat extraction trough floor heating pipes in certain zones has a levelling effect of the indoor temperature distribution...|$|E

The optimal satellite payload architecture for these services depends on the needs and constraints of the Network Service Provider (NSP) and the limitations of technology. TRW has developed a methodology that enables satellite-based NSPs to understand the business implications of a variety of payload and network architectures. TRW also conducted a study to quantify the differences between competing architectures in terms of throughput and financial performance. For many network operators, moving from a familiar “Bent Pipe ” to the new generation of processing payload architectures raises concerns as to which architecture will maximize return on investment.

Design/methodology/approach: Analytical approach {{has been applied to}} get an understanding of a heat exchange process. It is required to optimize the control process algorithm. Findings: The initial control algorithm has been improved regarding numerous tests under different operating conditions. The final version of the control program allows to maintain the temperature according to the on-off strategy minimizing the temperature oscillations and potential overshoots. Research limitations/implications: It should be considered a new control strategy based on PID controller. Practical implications: The major component of the tester is the heat exchanger.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} water-based concrete embedded floor {{heating systems}} are studied. The utilisation of low quality heat sources is facilitated by low temperature heating. Theoretical models which describe the transient thermal floor heating operation constitute {{the basis for}} the analysis. The combination of building, floor heating element, heat gains and control system is described by a set of theoretical models. In particular, a numerical floor heating element model is develop and verified by comparison with results from heat transfer software and published experimental results. A model based predictive control method is applied in order to find an optimised supply fluid temperature. The aim is to keep the upcoming operative temperature within a comfort interval {{and at the same time}} constrain the supply heat flux within practical limits. A discrete transient response factor method is utilised by a numerical optimisation algorithm that iteratively finds an optimised solution. The response factor method describes the relation between a piecewise constant supply heat flux and the succeeding shift in indoor temperature. The stability of the system has been studied; the initial delay time caused by the time needed for a heat front to conduct from the depth of the embedded circuit towards the interior sets a limit for the applied period time in the discrete response method. The predictive optimisation method has been applied in a realistic case where the operative temperature is successfully kept within the comfort interval. The self-regulation ability due to a thermal perturbance in the case of feed-forward controlled supply temperature is studied separately. Such system counteracts any non-periodic thermal perturbance by shifting the supplied heat flux in the opposite direction. The outcome is a more even indoor temperature and enhanced utilisation of heat gains. Transient response functions which quantify the involved thermal processes are derived by the developed model. It has been shown that the transient shift in supplied heat flux is given by two coupled processes. The first process is related to the propagation of heat towards the position of the embedded circuit due to the perturbance. The second process is related to the heat exchange along the embedded circuit due to the excitation of the supply temperature. The demand of an unchanged supply temperature connects the two processes (i. e. from the feed-forward supply temperature control). The self-regulation utilisation factor is defined as the ratio between the accumulated shift in supply heat flux and the energy content of a finite thermal perturbance. Buildings with small heat losses in combination with a high equivalent thermal conductance from the supply of the <b>pipe</b> <b>circuit</b> towards the interior yields a high self-regulation utilisation factor. Hence, self-regulation is an integrated phenomenon which depends on both the design of the floor heating element and the building...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{inspection}} of piping in {{nuclear power plants}} is mainly performed in contact with ultrasonic wedge transducers. Some areas of <b>circuit</b> <b>pipes</b> have variable geometries (variable radius of curvature, irregular surface conditions) which may limit the efficiency and even the accessibility for wedge transducers.

However, for exiting ASHP units, it is hardly possible to install water collecting trays between circuits.

The SP 1 b system thus provides pre-cooling. It consists of ClimateWell TDC with nominal capacity of 10 kW together with a dry cooler for recooling and heat exchangers in the cooling and driving circuits. The cooling system is only operated from 06 : 00 to 17 : 00 during working days, and the cooling season is generally from mid May to mid September. The nominal operating conditions of the main chiller are 12 / 15 °C. The main aims of this simulation study were to: reduce the electricity consumption, and if possible to improve the thermal COP and capacity at the same time; and to study how the system would perform with different boundary conditions such as climate and load. The calibration of the system model was made in three stages: estimation of parameters based on manufacturer data and dimensions of the system; calibration of each <b>circuit</b> (<b>pipes</b> and heat exchangers) separately using steady state point; and finally calibration of the complete model in terms of thermal and electrical energy as well as running times, for a five day time series of data with one minute average data values.

40|$|Aging sewer {{infrastructure}} is posing {{greater and greater}} risk {{to the health and}} well-being of City residents. Issues can range from pipe blockages in sewer laterals to Sanitary Sewer Overflows. This thesis develops a risk analysis method that can be used by municipalities to maintain and rehabilitate sewer assets. Risk combines the effect of Likelihood of Failure (LOF) and Consequence of Failure (COF) to perform a complete two-dimensional analysis that allows for relative comparison between different pipes in the system. The LOF rating has been equated to pipe integrity while the COF rating was related to the environmental, economic, and social consequences to pipe failure. In order to estimate <b>pipe</b> integrity Closed <b>Circuit</b> Television (CCTV) scores from the City of Santa Barbara were used in combination with spatial and physical properties associated with each pipe. The CCTV scores were simply integer values between 0 and 5 based on the National Association of Sewer Services Company’s (NASSCO) Pipeline Assessment Certification Program (PACP) results. The quantitative parameters included pipe material and age, distance from restaurants, distance from any above ground water source, pipe depth below the ground surface, pipe length, and vehicular traffic volumes. The sensitivity analysis compared the given structural integrity scores with the predicted scores based on the weighted scoring method. It isolated four out of six of the parameters tested that affected the structural integrity of sewer pipes: material and age (45 %), pipe depth (20 %), Vehicular Traffic (10 %), and distance from an above-ground water source (25 %). A program was created in the C programming language that iteratively determined the percentage for each factor. These percentage factors are used to obtain the predicted structural integrity score for all the pipes. Like the LOF rating, the COF rating consisted of scores between 0 and 5. The COF rating used pipe diameter, distance from commercial zones, distance from critical infrastructure, and vehicular traffic volume as parameters for quantifying the environmental, economic, and social consequences. These factors were determined from review of past literature and given approximately equal weighting when determining the COF rating values. The environmental factor, pipe diameter, was given a percentage factor of 30 %; the economic factor, distance to commercial zones, was given a percentage factor of 30 %; and the social concerns, distance to critical infrastructure and vehicular traffic volume, were given percentage factors of 20 % each. Finally, the risk for each pipe was determined in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by combining the predicted structural integrity score or LOF rating and COF rating value for each pipe. This generated color-coded maps that showed distinct pipes that had the most critical predicted structural integrity scores, highest consequence, and the pipes with the most risk. This process could be used by any City to create a maintenance and rehabilitation schedule and plan for future CCTV inspections...|$|R
