40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} appendiceal computed tomography (CT) availability on negative appendectomy and appendiceal perforation rates. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Appendiceal CT is 98 % accurate. However, its impact on negative appendectomy and appendiceal perforation rates has not been reported. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 493 consecutive patients who underwent appendectomy between 1992 and 1995, 209 consecutive patients who underwent appendectomy in 1997 (59 % of whom had appendiceal CT), and 206 patients who underwent appendiceal CT in 1997 without subsequent appendectomy. RESULTS: Before appendiceal CT, 98 / 493 patients (20 %) taken to surgery had a normal appendix. After CT availability, 15 / 209 patients (7 %) taken to surgery had a normal appendix; 7 patients did not have CT, 5 patients had surgery despite a negative CT, and 3 patients had a false-positive CT. Negative appendectomy rates were lowered overall (20 % to 7 %), in men (11 % to 5 %), in women (35 % to 11 %), in boys (10 % to 5 %), and in girls (18 % to 12 %). Appendiceal perforation rates dropped from 22 % to 14 % after CT availability. CT excluded appendicitis in 206 patients in 1997 who avoided appendectomy and identified alternative diagnoses in 105 of these patients (51 %). CONCLUSION: The availability of appendiceal CT coincided with {{a drop in the}} negative appendectomy rate from 20 % to 7 % in all patients, and to only 3 % in patients with a <b>positive</b> CT. <b>Perforation</b> rates decreased from 22 % to 14 %. Appendiceal CT can be advocated in nearly all female and many male patients...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: The goal of {{endodontics}} is to {{seal the}} root canal system from the orifice to apical constriction completely and tridimensionally. Hence perforations during root canal therapy, because of caries or resorptions must be sealed and obturated with ideal materials. The {{aim of this study}} was to histologically compare two kinds of mineral trioxide aggregate Root MTA and Pro Root MTA for furcal perforation repair in developed teeth in dog. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, thirty teeth consisting of second, third and fourth mandibular premolars of five German shepherd dogs were selected. Twenty-four teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups (6 teeth each). One pair of Root MTA and Pro Root MTA groups studied in one month and the other in three months intervals. Positive and negative control groups was each contained three teeth. In <b>positive</b> control group, <b>perforations</b> were not treated and negative control group contained intact teeth. In experimental groups perforations repaired after one week exposure to oral cavity with Root MTA or Pro Root MTA. After time intervals animals were subjected to vital perfusion and 6 &# 61549;m histologic sections were prepared. Inflammation and hard tissue formation were ranked by Cox criteria. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney and Chi-Square statistical tests with P 0. 05). Conclusion: Mineral Trioxide Aggregate is an adequate material for furcal perforation repair in dog’s teeth. Root MTA could be a good substitute for Pro Root MTA considering the lower cost and similar characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objectives: From 1992 to 2001, 1005 {{patients}} (pts) {{entered the}} randomized EORTC trial 22911 comparing immediate external beam irradiation(RT) versus wait-and-see (WS) for pts with positive surgical margins or pT 3 after radical prostatectomy (RP) (Lancet 2005). We report the 10 -year follow-up results. Materials & Methods: Eligible pts were ≤ 75 years with WHO PS 0 - 1; cT 1 - 3 N 0 M 0 (UICC 1983) prostate cancer {{who had undergone}} RP with pN 0 and ≥ 1 pathological risk factors of: capsular <b>perforation,</b> <b>positive</b> surgical margins, and/or invasion of the seminal vesicles. RT (60 Gy in 6 wks to the surgical bed) started within 4 months of RP. The primary trial endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival (time from randomization to twice confirmed PSA increase over nadir or first clinical failure or death). Results at 5 years were presented after an interim analysis (P 0. 1) were impacted. The results were similar when the analysis was restricted to patients with postoperative PSA≤ 0. 2 ng/ml. In the WS group, 56. 4 % of relapsing patients received salvage irradiation and 22. 9 % androgen deprivation therapy, 3. 4 % other treatments and the remainder no active treatment thus far. Salvage treatment was initiated upon PSA relapse in most relapsing patients. The cumulative rate of grade 3 toxicity at 10 years was 5. 3 % after RT and 2. 5 % after WS (P= 0. 052). Subgroup analyses suggest a significant interaction between patient age (≤ 70 vs. > 70 years) and benefit from immediate RT(interaction P< 0. 05 for biochemical progression-free survival, clinical progressionfree survival and overall survival). Conclusions: At 10 years, conventional post-operative RT improves biochemical progression-free survival and local control without significantly impacting distant metastases or overall survival. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Local failure after prostatectomy {{can arise}} in {{patients}} with cancer extending beyond the capsule. We did a randomised controlled trial to compare radical prostatectomy followed by immediate external irradiation with prostatectomy alone for patients with positive surgical margin or pT 3 prostate cancer. After undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy, 503 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} a wait-and-see policy, and 502 to immediate postoperative radiotherapy (60 Gy conventional irradiation delivered over 6 weeks). Eligible patients had pN 0 M 0 tumours and one or more pathological risk factors: capsule <b>perforation,</b> <b>positive</b> surgical margins, invasion of seminal vesicles. Our revised primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. The median age was 65 years (IQR 61 - 69). After a median follow-up of 5 years, biochemical progression-free survival was significantly improved in the irradiated group (74. 0 %, 98 % CI 68. 7 - 79. 3 vs 52. 6 %, 46. 6 - 58. 5; p < 0. 0001). Clinical progression-free survival was also significantly improved (p= 0. 0009). The cumulative rate of locoregional failure was significantly lower in the irradiated group (p < 0. 0001). Grade 2 or 3 late effects were significantly more frequent in the postoperative irradiation group (p= 0. 0005), but severe toxic toxicity (grade 3 or higher) were rare, with a 5 -year rate of 2. 6 % in the wait-and-see group and 4. 2 % in the postoperative irradiation group (p= 0. 0726). Immediate external irradiation after radical prostatectomy improves biochemical progression-free survival and local control {{in patients with}} positive surgical margins or pT 3 prostate cancer who are at high risk of progression. Further follow-up is needed to assess the effect on overall surviva...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{know whether}} {{laboratory}} or clinical parameters can predict disease progression, need for laparotomy in patients managed with peritoneal drain and mortality in surgical neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis patients. Materials and Methods: The study was retrospectively {{carried out on}} 27 neonates {{over a period of}} one and a half year. All neonates who had surgical neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis in the form of bowel <b>perforation,</b> <b>positive</b> paracentesis, abdominal wall erythema and abdominal lump were included. Patients with Bell&#x 2032;s stage I and those developing enterocolitis after surgery were excluded. The patients were evaluated with parameters, namely, clinical, laboratory and radiological. These included age and stage at presentation, primary symptom/sign at presentation with laboratory parameters of blood counts, pH, base deficit, platelet counts, electrolytes and random blood sugar levels. A comparison was done between survivors and nonsurvivors, patients with primary peritoneal drainage versus those requiring laparotomy after drain, Bell&#x 2032; stage II versus III patients and operated versus nonoperated patients. Statistical significance was observed in the above mentioned comparisons. Results: There were 22 male and 5 females patients with mean birth weight of 1. 85 kg. Age at presentation ranged from 2 to 19 days, mean 9. 25 days. Mortality was 37 &#x 0025; (10 / 27). Majority of the stage II patients presented with feed intolerance and abdominal distension. The neonates with severe disease had abdominal distension with wall erythema. Sixty percent of the patients had shock at the time of admission. In the comparison of peritoneal drain only and patients with peritoneal drain followed by laparotomy patients, it was observed that neonates who were acidotic and had higher base deficit had more chances of requirement of laparotomy. They also had progressive fall in platelets counts. There was no difference in the birth weight, gestational age, total counts, serum electrolytes, blood sugar and other measured parameters; thus, these carry negligible predictive value to judge deteriorating neonate. In the remaining of the comparison, patients not presenting with shock were more likely to survive. Conclusion: In the present study, neonate with persistently low pH, higher base deficit and presentation with shock predicted need for laparotomy in drain managed patients as well as chances of survival...|$|R
