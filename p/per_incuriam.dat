5000|$|<b>Per</b> <b>incuriam,</b> {{literally}} {{translated as}} [...] "through lack of care", {{refers to a}} judgment of a court which has been decided without reference to a statutory provision or earlier judgment {{which would have been}} relevant. The significance of a judgment having been decided <b>per</b> <b>incuriam</b> {{is that it does not}} then have to be followed as precedent by a lower court. Ordinarily, in the common law, the rationes of a judgment must be followed thereafter by lower courts hearing similar cases. A lower court is free, however, to depart from an earlier judgment of a superior court where that earlier judgment was decided <b>per</b> <b>incuriam.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{academic}} {{critics have}} suggested that Polemis 1921 3 KB 560 was decided <b>per</b> <b>incuriam</b> as it did not rely upon the earlier decision in Hadley v Baxendale.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the court}} is not bound to follow a {{decision}} of its own if the decision was given <b>per</b> <b>incuriam,</b> e.g., where a statute or a rule having statutory effect which would have affected the decision was not {{brought to the attention}} of the earlier court.|$|E
50|$|In R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal {{ex parte}} Shaw 1951 1 All ER 268, a {{division}}al {{court of the}} King's Bench division declined to follow a Court of Appeal decision {{on the ground that}} the decision had been reached <b>per</b> <b>incuriam</b> as a relevant House of Lords decision had not been cited to the Court of Appeal.|$|E
5000|$|The Court of Appeal in Morelle Ltd v Wakeling 1955 2 QB 379 {{stated that}} {{as a general rule}} the only cases in which {{decisions}} should be held to have been given <b>per</b> <b>incuriam</b> are those of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned: so that in such cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found, on that account, to be demonstrably wrong.|$|E
50|$|The 1998 Act {{inserted}} the {{right under the}} Employment Rights Act 1996 section 203(5) which allows parties to a dismissal case to agree in writing that the dispute be referred to arbitration. This can result from a settlement negotiation of an ACAS conciliation officer. ACAS will supply, though not appoint, an arbitrator. If a dispute goes to arbitration, the advantage can be perceived to be finality, in that the arbitration decision is binding and not capable of appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal or otherwise. Only if the arbitration decision manifests serious irregularity (<b>per</b> <b>incuriam)</b> or acts beyond its jurisdiction or power (ultra vires) is there a right to challenge the decision under the Arbitration Act 1996.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the mens rea for making, however {{was thought to be}} thrown into confusion by the decision in Harrison v R 2007 EWCA Crim 2976 where it was suggested that if the actions of the defendant were very likely to make an image that would constitute the mens rea. Smith and Jayson however were not overtly overruled and Harrison is regarded as made <b>per</b> <b>incuriam</b> or at least a badly worded setting out of the rule found in Woollin. In Harrison there was clear and admitted evidence that a directed (and [...] "unusual") search for and visit to a site had been made which would fall under the Woollin rule - {{it could be argued that}} it was a virtual certainty that images would be made (in the cache). Harrison knew that pop-ups which contained indecent images of children would be produced and carried on regardless.|$|E
40|$|In Leung Ka Lau v Hospital Authority {{the plaintiffs}} were doctors who claimed {{compensation}} for, inter alia, enforced overtime extracted without pay from {{them by their}} employer, the defendants. The Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal dismissed their overtime claims on purely the terms of their contracts of employment. This paper argues that the decisions of all three courts on the overtime claims were made <b>per</b> <b>incuriam</b> because their attention was not drawn to the applicable statutory provisions which would have invalidated the contractual provisions on which the courts rested their decisions. The paper sketches the socio-economic and ethical basis of overtime work and pay before proceeding to analyse the common law (contractual) basis of the judgments, traces the history as well as undertakes construction of the statutory provisions which, if taken into account, {{would have seen the}} plaintiffs succeeding...|$|E
