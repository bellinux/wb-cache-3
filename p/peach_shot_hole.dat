50|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>hole</b> {{disease is}} a major concern of the stone fruit industry. It is {{estimated}} that 80% of the California almond crop may be infested with <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease, resulting in a potential yield loss of 50-75%. In the 1930s, it was found that applications of Bordeaux mixture reduces <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease on <b>peaches</b> from 80% to 9%.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease (also called Coryneum blight) is {{a serious}} fungal disease that creates BB-sized holes in leaves, rough areas on fruit, and {{concentric}} lesions on branches. The pathogen that causes <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease is Wilsonomyces carpophilus.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the next}} several weeks, non-Bt cornfields should be scouted for European corn borers. If populations do exceed the {{economic}} threshold, treatment is warranted to prevent substantial yield loss. Scouting should start in the tallest cornfields because adults (moths) are often attracted to these fields in larger numbers. Look for <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> in the leaves after corn reaches 17 to 21 inches in extended leaf height. When <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> or larvae {{are found in the}} taller corn, scout fields with smaller corn. There is very little reason to scout a field for larvae if no <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> are detected in the leaves...|$|R

50|$|The first clade proposed, E. fornicatus {{sensu stricto}} (commonly called the tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer), is {{original}} from southern Southeast Asia and was introduced into Hawaii and Florida. A second clade, the Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer, {{is believed to}} have originated in the Pacific islands and has since been introduced into San Diego county, California. The third clade is thought to originate from a more northern range in Southeast Asia and to have since been introduced into Los Angeles, California and Israel. This last clade has been given the common name Polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer in reference to the very broad host range. It has been severely affecting avocado trees in association with several Fusarium species. Multiple populations of the E. fornicatus complex have been introduced throughout the world, causing different damage in each region where they have been recently introduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{polyphagous}} <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer and Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer, {{two members}} of the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), are invasive ambrosia beetles that harbor distinct species of Fusarium fungal symbionts. Together with the damage caused by gallery construction, these two phytopathogenic Fusarium species are responsible for the emerging tree disease Fusarium dieback, which affects over 50 common tree species in Southern California. Host trees suffer branch dieback as the xylem is blocked by invading beetles and fungi, forcing the costly removal of dead and dying trees in urban areas. The beetles are also threatening natural riparian habitats, and avocado is susceptible to Fusarium dieback as well, resulting in damage to the avocado industries in California and Israel. Currently there are no adequate control mechanisms for <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borers. This paper summarizes efforts to find a suitable lure to monitor <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer invasions and dispersal. Field trials were conducted in two counties in Southern California over a span of two years. We find that the chemical quercivorol is highly attractive to these beetles, and perform subsequent field experiments attempting to optimize this lure. We also explore other methods of increasing trap catch and effects of other potential attractants, as well as the deterrents verbenone and piperitone...|$|R
5000|$|The present {{structure}} was designed on the [...] "L" [...] plan, {{with a round}} tower at the north-east angle. The main building rose to five stories and the tower to six stories in height. The main building measured 55 by 32 ft. The hall, on the first floor, measured 44 by 20 feet. The main entrance was in the north wall of the wing of the castle. There are <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> used to guard the main door {{and there are also}} <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> under the staircases and in the walls of the tower.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>hole</b> affects almonds by disrupting {{both the}} leaves and {{the fruit of the}} plant. It can result in {{premature}} nut ripening and plant defoliation. In some occasions, especially when rain persists in the springtime, complete defoliation and tree weakening can occur. Estimates have shown that approximately 80% of California's almond acres are infected with this fungus. A four-year research project by the Almond Board of California determined that production losses from <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> could range from 50 to 75%. Captan in one to three applications has been used as the primary fungicide to combat this disease. It has been shown to reduce lesions per fruit by 96%.|$|R

50|$|The {{rectangular}} {{tower and}} measures about 27 ft by 22 ft, with walls of about 4 ft thick. The external {{walls of the}} castle survive intact, although the tower is roofless. The inside of the tower is entirely ruined, but {{the remains of a}} vaulted basement, used as a kitchen, and a spiral turnpike staircase can still be seen. At the top of the stair is a gabled cap house. An unusual feature at Knock are the defensive <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> for pistols, of which three are located under each of the numerous windows. The <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> are all angled to the ground, with the centre one pointing forward and the two outer holes pointing slightly askew.|$|R

25|$|The tee <b>shots</b> on <b>Holes</b> 1, 3, 8, 15 and 17 are blind, {{and there}} are several blind {{approach}} <b>shots</b> on <b>Holes</b> 2, 6 and 14. The second and third <b>shots</b> at <b>Hole</b> 9 are blind, depending on length. There also are several holes that are semi-blind; the surface of the green cannot be seen when playing approach <b>shots</b> on <b>Holes</b> 5, 10, 18, and on 15 (for the long hitter). These blind shots are only blind once. Still, they do make Wykagyl difficult to play for a golfer who has never seen it before. Wykagyl is unique in its mix of par threes, par fours and par fives. Most 18-hole courses have four par threes, four par fives and ten par fours, but Wykagyl has five par fives, five par threes and eight par fours.|$|R

The explosion occurred when Paley fired his tenth shot 6 yards {{to the right of}} the centre of No.8’s gate, five minutes after his ninth shot. A large accumulation of firedamp in explosive proportions had accumulated in the workings at the moment the shot was fired. The resulting explosion was slightly exacerbated by coal dust, which increased the flame of the explosion.|$|R

500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{eruption}} of a pernicious insect known as the <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer (Euwallacea fornicatus). This pest is {{a major threat to}} the agricultural stability in Southern California. A plant pathogenic fungus is vectored by the borer. The fungus, Fusarium sp., clogs the tree's vascular system, causing dieback in the outer branches. Avocados (Persea americana), one of California's premium crops, are threatened by the <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer and associated fungus. The tree itself is not likely to survive the infestation. Other known hosts of the insect include Castor Bean (Ricinus communis), American Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), California Sycamore (Plantanus racemosa), and Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia); all of which are part of the campus flora and therefore, possible hosts. Our campus serves as a "living laboratory" for pests and disease issues that affect agriculture in Southern California. Being a major agricultural university, Cal Poly Pomona has several plots of trees prone to attack from the <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer and its affiliated fungus. In order to discover the range and severity of potential infected plants, a campus survey needed to be conducted. Using the iPad application, ArcGIS by Esri, and the information from a compiled database of Cal Poly flora, I was able to specifically inspect trees of a known host range. I subsequently surveyed the Cal Poly campus in search of symptoms of the fungus and beetle on proven hosts. The results reveled two main areas where the host population is over 50 % infected...|$|R

40|$|Three cryptic {{species in}} the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex were reared in {{laboratory}} colonies and investigated {{for the presence of}} pheromones. Collections of volatiles from combinations of diet, fungus, beetles, and galleries from polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer (Euwallacea sp. # 1) revealed the presence of 2 -heneicosanone and 2 -tricosanone only in the presence of beetles, regardless of sex. Subsequent examination of volatiles from the other two species, tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer (Euwallacea sp. # 2) and Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> borer (Euwallacea sp. # 5), revealed these two ketones were present in all three species but in different ratios. In dual choice olfactometer behavioral bioassays, mature mated females were strongly attracted to a synthetic binary blend of ketones matching their own natural ratios. However, females in each species were repelled by ketone blends in ratios corresponding to the other two species. Males of each species responded similarly to females when presented with ratios matching their own or the other two species. The presence of these compounds in the three beetle species, in ratios unique to each species, and their strong species-specific attraction and repellency, suggests they are pheromones. The ecological function of these pheromones is discussed. In addition to the pheromones, the previously known attractant (1 S, 4 R) -p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol (also known as quercivorol) was discovered {{in the presence of the}} fungal symbionts, but not in association with the beetles. Quercivorol was tested in a dual-choice olfactometer and was strongly attractive to all three species. This evidence suggests quercivorol functions as a kairomone for members of the E. fornicatus species complex, likely produced by the symbiotic fungi...|$|R
