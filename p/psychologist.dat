Although school <b>psychologists</b> reported that they were generally satisfied with the nature of activities that make up their role, <b>psychologists</b> in the Government school sector appeared to be less satisfied when compared to <b>psychologists</b> working in Catholic and Independent schools.

40|$|To {{compare the}} work {{practices}} and training needs of {{rural and urban}} <b>psychologists,</b> 774 surveys were sent to <b>psychologists</b> throughout Australia. The <b>psychologists</b> were selected from the Australian Psychological Society (APS) Directory of <b>Psychologists,</b> 1992 - 1993. A total of 86 rural <b>psychologists</b> and 282 urban <b>psychologists</b> responded to the survey. The survey comprised of four sections with questions asking respondents their demographic and employment background, past and current training activities, work experience, and relations with community. Results showed {{that the decision to}} practice and remain in a rural area was influenced by psychologists’ childhood experience and professional training in a rural setting, A substantial proportion of rural <b>psychologists</b> (28 %) had been working in rural practice for five years or less. These rural <b>psychologists</b> were identified as a group that had a demographic and training profile more similar to urban <b>psychologists</b> than their rural colleagues. The employment conditions and training background of rural and urban <b>psychologists</b> were similar, though rural <b>psychologists</b> {{were more likely to be}} working in private practice and have undertaken their studies in a rural setting. Rural and urban <b>psychologists</b> rated their undergraduate and postgraduate training in psychology as only somewhat adequate. Training in rural health and community issues received the lowest ratings from both groups of <b>psychologists.</b> The work practices of rural and urban <b>psychologists</b> were also similar. There were some differences in the demographic profile of the client groups seen by the two groups. Rural <b>psychologists</b> reported the type of relations with their communities that are conducive to rural practice. The main evidence of this was that rural <b>psychologists</b> were collaborating with the natural helpers of their communities, and expressed willingness to formally train natural helpers to assist in the provision of psychological services. There were several conclusions drawn from this study. The first conclusion was that rural <b>psychologists</b> with urban demographic and training backgrounds are a group that is likely to migrate from rural practice to urban practice, Secondly, training needs to be specialised for rural practice if there is to be an improvement in the number of <b>psychologists</b> practicing in rural settings. Thirdly, rural <b>psychologists</b> were conducting the type of relations with their communities that are important to the requirements of rural practice...|$|R

Also the literature about the importance of job satisfaction, in particular the relationship between school <b>psychologists</b> and job satisfaction was analyzed. The results of past research suggest that a primary activity for school <b>psychologists</b> is psychoeducational assessment, with this role accounting for approximately 50 - 55 % of their time. However, according to the research school <b>psychologists</b> would prefer to spend less time in psychoeducational assessment activities. According to previous research, school <b>psychologists</b> in Wisconsin spend significantly more time in psychoeducational assessment activities (73. 6 %). The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate whether or not school <b>psychologists</b> in Wisconsin continue to spend a significant percentage of time in psychoeducational assessment and if this impacts their level of job satisfaction. i ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R

The study examined the extent to which school <b>psychologists</b> in Wisconsin and Arizona felt competent in providing services to students from diverse backgrounds, what areas of growth were needed to provide better services to diverse students, and if school <b>psychologists</b> in Wisconsin and Arizona were participating in continued training related to multicultural servIces. 111 Surveys were sent to school <b>psychologists</b> in Arizona and Wisconsin who held membership with the Arizona Association of School <b>Psychologists</b> (AASP) and the Wisconsin School <b>Psychologists</b> Association (WSP A). A total of 108 surveys were used for data analysis. The majority of school <b>psychologists</b> in the study were Caucasian, female, and practicing school <b>psychologists.</b> Participants from Arizona had higher mean scores on the questions than subjects from Wisconsin, indicating school <b>psychologists</b> from Arizona self-perceived themselves to be more competent than participants in Wisconsin.

40|$|OBJECTIVE As {{the first}} {{professional}} contact for most Australians {{with mental health}} concerns, general practitioners (GPs) are often considered the “gateway” to accessing <b>psychologists.</b> Understanding GPs’ views of <b>psychologists</b> is therefore of great importance to the profession. GPs serve a particularly important role in mental health in rural and remote areas {{given the lack of}} other services; however there has been limited research investigating the relationship between <b>psychologists</b> and GPs in rural areas. This study aimed to investigate rural GPs’ perceptions of rural <b>psychologists.</b> METHOD Semi-structured qualitative telephone and in-person interviews were conducted with 13 GPs working in rural and remote South Australia. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS Three main themes were identified: <b>Psychologists</b> are useful/helpful; working with <b>psychologists</b> can be challenging; and <b>psychologists</b> are not well understood. Rural GPs held mostly positive views about <b>psychologists</b> and their value in providing professional support and reducing GP workloads. However, GPs’ understanding of psychologists’ training and expertise varied considerably, with most reporting gaps in their knowledge. Challenges included limited access to <b>psychologists</b> and communication barriers. Communication was considered to be enhanced by co-locating psychology services within the GP practice, which was also considered to be a valuable educational opportunity for GPs. CONCLUSION While rural GPs held largely positive views of <b>psychologists,</b> they may require further support in understanding what <b>psychologists</b> can offer and promoting psychology to their patients. Results may assist in improving communication between rural <b>psychologists</b> and GPs and inform strategies to improve rural GPs’ understanding of psychologists’ skills and training.
