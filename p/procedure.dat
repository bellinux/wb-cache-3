40|$|Procedural sedation, {{also known}} as {{conscious}} sedation is used for minimally invasive <b>procedures</b> performed outside the operating room where pain or surgical stimulation is not great enough to require general anesthesia.

30|$|Operative laparoscopic <b>procedures</b> {{including}} laparoscopic oophorectomy, laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, laparoscopic salpingectomy, and adhesiolysis were evaluated. These <b>procedures</b> {{were chosen}} {{because they are}} the most common laparoscopic <b>procedures</b> performed at Prince Hamzah Hospital.

5|$|In {{extreme cases}} of {{intractable}} CSF leak, a surgical lumbar drain has been used.

5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the <b>procedure,</b> which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the <b>procedure.</b> The <b>procedure</b> is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|A <b>procedure</b> {{for dealing}} with omitted {{decompression}} stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual.

Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression <b>procedure</b> as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the <b>procedure</b> and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the <b>procedure</b> with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the <b>procedure.</b> Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the <b>procedure.</b> Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the <b>procedure</b> in such situations.|$|E

40|$|We define {{abstract}} proof <b>procedures</b> {{for performing}} credulous and sceptical non-monotonic reasoning, {{with respect to}} the argumentation-theoretic formulation of non-monotonic reasoning proposed in [1]. Appropriate instances of the proposed proof <b>procedures</b> provide concrete proof <b>procedures</b> for concrete formalisms for non-monotonic reasoning, for example logic programming with negation as failure and default logic. We propose (credulous and sceptical) proof <b>procedures</b> under different argumentation-theoretic semantics, namely the conventional stable model semantics and the more liberal partial stable model or preferred extension semantics. We study the relationships between proof <b>procedures</b> for different semantics, and argue that, in many meaningful cases, the (simpler) proof <b>procedures</b> for reasoning under the preferred extension semantics can be used as sound and complete <b>procedures</b> for reasoning under the stable model semantics. In many meaningful cases still, proof <b>procedures</b> for credulous reasoning under the preferred extension semantics can be used as (much simpler) sound and complete <b>procedures</b> for sceptical reasoning under the preferred extension semantics.
