25|$|While many {{renewable}} energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{has said that}} {{renewable energy}} {{has the ability to}} lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. As most of renewables provide electricity, renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further electrification, which has several benefits: Electricity can be converted to heat (where necessary generating higher temperatures than fossil fuels), can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and is clean at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption.</b> In addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements, because most renewables don't have a steam cycle with high losses (fossil power plants usually have losses of 40 to 65%).|$|E
2500|$|Simultaneous {{production}} and consumption. High contact services (e.g. health care) must {{be produced in}} the presence of the customer, since they are consumed as produced. As a result, services cannot be produced in one location and transported to another, like goods. Service operations are therefore highly dispersed geographically close to the customers. Furthermore, simultaneous {{production and}} consumption allows the possibility of self-service involving the customer at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> (e.g. gas stations). Only low-contact services produced in the [...] "backroom" [...] (e.g., check clearing) can be provided away from the customer.|$|E

25|$|With {{progress}} in Amami's archaeological investigation, Takanashi Osamu dropped his earlier kamuiyaki-for-Turbo-shell hypothesis. He noted kamuiyakis skewed distribution: the major <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> {{were limited to}} Kikai Island and Tokunoshima of the Amami Islands. The number of kamuiyaki pieces found in Okinawa, Miyako and Yaeyama was small {{and that was the}} reason why local earthenwares imitating kamuiyaki were produced there. Takanashi hypothesized that the primary purpose of kamuiyaki production in Tokunoshima had been to supply a demand for commodities at the Gusuku Site Complex of Kikai Island, an supposed outpost of the State of Japan.|$|R

40|$|With energy {{shortages}} and {{global climate change}} leading our concerns these days, the power <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> datacenters has become a key issue. Obviously, a substantial reduction in energy consumption {{can be made by}} powering down servers when they are not in use. This paper aims at designing, implementing and evaluating a Green Scheduling Algorithm integrating a neural network predictor for optimizing server power consumption in Cloud computing. We employ the predictor to predict future load demand based on historical demand. According to the prediction, the algorithm turns off unused servers and restarts them to minimize the number of running servers, thus minimizing the energy use at the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> to benefit all other levels. For evaluation, we perform simulations with two load traces. The results show that the PP 20 mode can save up to 46. 3 % <b>of</b> power <b>consumption</b> with a drop rate of 0. 03 % on one load trace, and a drop rate of 0. 12 % with a power reduction rate of 46. 7 % on the other...|$|R
