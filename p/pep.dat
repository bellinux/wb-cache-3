40|$|The {{digital era}} has {{accomplished}} {{new kinds of}} learning spaces, where learners engage in different kinds of learning activities. Thus different learners are gaining various learning experiences from heterogeneous learning spaces. A key challenge is how to systematically collect those heterogeneous learning activities into well-organized education portfolios. In existing Education Portfolio Systems (EPS) including LinkedIn, Mahara, and Open-Badges does not support importing learning activities from learning spaces. In these systems, it does not allow users to authenticate through OpenID, and also users cannot create multiple portfolio views. Thus to address these problems we propose our system named Portable Education Portfolios (<b>PEPs)</b> which imports certified users experiences from different learning spaces. This thesis utilizes a Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) for <b>PEPs</b> development, which intends to solve the key challenge. The proposed approach i. e. DSRM is modified to fit this research context. As a result, alike existing EPS, an innovative IT artifact called <b>PEPs</b> tool is created. <b>PEPs</b> collect certified experiences of users from different learning spaces and also create their portfolio. On the other hand, as an additional feature to existing EPS, the <b>PEPs</b> tool supports Life-Long Learning Process and Continuing Professional Development. To address the research objectives <b>PEPs</b> system is experimented with three different learning spaces including TUT-Mantis, Moodle and OpenSE. These learning spaces follow informal, formal and non-formal learning patterns respectively. <b>PEPs</b> successfully collected various user experiences and created a single portable portfolio for the users. Hence, we conclude that the <b>PEPs</b> system is a complete tool to solve all the key issues raised in this research...|$|R

5|$|The {{compound}} polyozellin—a chemical {{which can}} be isolated and purified from P.multiplex—inhibits prolyl endopeptidase (<b>PEP),</b> an enzyme that has a role in processing proteins (specifically, amyloid precursor protein) in Alzheimer's disease. Chemicals that inhibit <b>PEP</b> have attracted research interest due to their potential therapeutic effects. Further analyses of extracts from P.multiplex revealed similar dibenzofuranyl derivatives of polyozellin, each with different chemical properties, including kynapcin-12, kynapcin-13 and -28, and -24. A total synthesis of kynapcin-24 was achieved in 2009.|$|E

30|$|In fact, {{decreasing}} the <b>PEPs</b> is not {{beneficial to the}} orthogonality of the channel matrix, and the proposed LLR-based algorithm which aims to decrease the <b>PEPs</b> in (18) will not help to enhance the BER performance of the LR-aided ZF LD. However, for the VBLAST detector, {{we find that the}} <b>PEPs</b> directly affect the error probability of the first detected symbol in the VBLAST detector. Note that the error probability of the first detected symbol in the VBLAST detector is a key factor affecting the error propagation of the VBLAST detector, which is important to the BER performance of the VBLAST detector. Decreasing the <b>PEPs</b> will help to reduce the error propagation, and the BER performance of the VBLAST detector will be enhanced.|$|R
40|$|High-level {{transcription}} of eps, an operon encoding biosynthesis of an exopolysaccharide virulence {{factor of}} the phytopathogen Ralstonia (Pseudomonas) solanacearum, requires {{the products of}} at least seven regulatory genes (phcA, phcB, xpsR, vsrA-vsrD, and vsrB-vsrC), which are organized in three converging signal transduction cascades. Because xpsR and the vsrB-vsrC two-component system are the most downstream cascade components required for activation of eps, we explored how these components control transcription from the eps promoter (<b>Peps).</b> Deletion and PCR mutagenesis identified an upstream region of <b>Peps</b> (nucleotides − 82 to − 62) that is critical for transcription activation by VsrB-VsrC and XpsR and also is required for negative control of <b>Peps</b> by the putative eps regulator EpsR. Using PCR mutagenesis we generated the vsrC 1 allele that encodes a response regulator that constitutively activates <b>Peps</b> {{in the absence of}} its cognate sensor, VsrB. However, activation of <b>Peps</b> by vsrC 1 still required xpsR. Unexpectedly, the amino acid substitution conferring the constitutive phenotype on VsrC 1 is 12 residues from its C terminus, outside the known functional domains of response regulators. Finally, a modified DNase I footprinting method was used to demonstrate specific binding of both VsrC 1 and VsrC to the − 72 to − 62 upstream region of <b>Peps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{evaluations}} of oncological medicines in the German early benefit assessment (EBA) procedure have demonstrated inconsistent acceptance of endpoints by regulatory {{authorities and the}} Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). Accepted standard endpoints for regulatory purposes are frequently not considered as patient-relevant in the German EBA system. In this study the acceptance of clinically acknowledged primary endpoints (<b>PEPs)</b> from regulatory trials in EBAs conducted by the G-BA was evaluated across three therapeutic areas. Methods Medicines for oncological, metabolic and infectious diseases with EBAs finalised before 25 January 2016 were evaluated. Respective manufacturer’s dossiers, regulatory assessments, G-BA appraisals and oral hearing minutes were reviewed, and <b>PEPs</b> were examined {{to determine whether they}} were considered relevant to patients by the G-BA. Furthermore, the acceptance of symptomatic vs asymptomatic <b>PEPs</b> was also analysed. Results A total of 65 EBAs were evaluated. Mortality <b>PEPs</b> were widely accepted as patient-relevant but were only used in a minority of EBAs and exclusively in oncological diseases. Morbidity <b>PEPs</b> constituted around 72  % of assessed <b>PEPs,</b> but were excluded from the EBA in over half of the corresponding assessments as they were not considered patient-relevant. Symptomatic endpoints were largely deemed patient-relevant, whereas acceptance of asymptomatic endpoints varied between therapeutic areas. Conclusions This evaluation identified inconsistencies in patient relevance of morbidity-related <b>PEPs</b> as well as in acceptance of asymptomatic endpoints by the G-BA in all three disease areas examined. Better harmonisation between the regulatory authorities and the G-BA is still required after 5  years of AMNOG health technology assessment in Germany...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: The {{mouse model}} of bleomycin-induced lung injury offers an {{approach}} to study idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive interstitial lung disease with poor prognosis. Progenitor cell-based treatment strategies might combine antiinflammatory effects and the capacity for tissue repair. OBJECTIVES: To expand progenitor cells with reparative and regenerative capacities and to evaluate their protective effects on pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. METHODS: Prominin- 1 /CD 133 (+) epithelial progenitor cells (<b>PEPs)</b> were expanded from adult mouse lungs after digestion and culture of distal airways. Lung fibrosis was induced in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice by instillation of bleomycin. Two hours later, animals were transplanted with <b>PEPs.</b> Inflammation and fibrosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid differentials, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: <b>PEPs</b> expanded from mouse lungs were of bone marrow origin, coexpressed stem and hematopoietic cell markers, and differentiated in vitro into alveolar type II surfactant protein-C(+) epithelial cells. In bleomycin-challenged mice, intratracheally injected <b>PEPs</b> engrafted into the lungs and differentiated into type II pneumocytes. Furthermore, <b>PEPs</b> suppressed proinflammatory and profibrotic gene expression, prevented the recruitment of inflammatory cells, and protected bleomycin-challenged mice from pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, the protective effect depended on upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase in <b>PEPs</b> and nitric oxide-mediated suppression of alveolar macrophage proliferation. Accordingly, <b>PEPs</b> from iNOS(-/-) but not iNOS(+/+) mice failed to protect from bleomycin-induced lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: The combined antiinflammatory and regenerative capacity of bone marrow-derived pulmonary epithelial progenitors offers a promising approach for development of cell-based therapeutic strategies against pulmonary fibrosis...|$|R
