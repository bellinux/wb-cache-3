5|$|As {{a result}} of the Second Dutch War, Charles {{dismissed}} Lord Clarendon, whom he used as a scapegoat for the war. Clarendon fled to France when impeached for high treason (which carried the <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death). Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical acronym as the Cabal—Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and Lauderdale. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods. In the second period, an early {{tripping}} penalty against Ottawa's Mike Fisher put the Flyers on the power play, during which Kim Johnsson extended Philadelphia's lead to 4–1. Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> the game, for high-sticking.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|Criminal {{trials for}} the accused {{commenced}} in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Three {{of the four}} arrested at the Melasti Bungalows, Nguyen, Chen and Norman, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately. All defendants faced a maximum <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death by firing squad if found guilty. The trials were often delayed due to the defendants complaining of illness, headaches and nausea. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said the Australian government would oppose any death sentences imposed.|$|E

The final part of her Olympic event, show jumping, took place on August 12. She was the only athlete out of the 57 still in the event to be eliminated in this stage. Albert did not progress to the final jumping round, which occurred later that day.|$|E

Section 107 allowed the secretary to issue regulations to put into force the Coinage Act of 1965, while section 108 contained definitions and similar technical matters.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia enjoys immunity—the {{president}} {{may not be}} arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if {{the president has been}} caught in the act of committing a criminal offense, which carries a <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Zurich council {{decided that}} no {{compromise}} was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate {{that no one}} shall rebaptise another under the <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death. Although Zwingli, technically, {{had nothing to do}} with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zurich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the Limmat. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zurich.|$|E

The director general makes decisions of indictment in cases with a maximum <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> twenty-one years and certain other serious crimes. There are twelve subordinate agencies, ten regional and two supporting Kripos and Økokrim, respectively. The regional public prosecution offices take decisions regarding cases not covered by the director general or the police prosecutors.|$|E
5|$|Various {{cases for}} rape, {{physical}} abuse and murder were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, {{were allowed to}} level civil and criminal charges against men. While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, and the <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death by beheading. Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} power-related {{incident}} than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services {{on both the}} North South and East West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into {{the cause of the}} disruption. The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> S$5.4 million on SMRT.|$|E
