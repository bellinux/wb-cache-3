5|$|By the 1950s, {{passengers}} considered Euston {{to be in}} squalor {{and covered}} in soot, leading to a full redecoration and restoration in 1953. Ticket machines were modernised.

5|$|Outside of cricket, Barnes {{followed}} his mother into <b>property</b> <b>development</b> (see above) and {{at various times}} entered into partnerships with Keith Miller and Norman Von Nida. His suspicious nature, which grew as time passed, saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations. While Barnes was not a millionaire, he was a successful and organised businessman.|$|E

5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. One of the reasons for Mayfair's subsequent boom in <b>property</b> <b>development</b> was to keep out lower class activities.|$|E
5|$|The Great Southern Group {{dismantled}} much of {{what remained}} of the company. Frederick W. Paine was detached from the LNC, along with the specialist division overseeing the exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow <b>property</b> <b>development</b> on formerly consecrated sites. All that remained of the LNC was Brookwood Cemetery itself, by this time moribund and becoming heavily overgrown. Considered virtually worthless, Great Southern sold the LNC to property speculators Maximillian Investments in July 1973 for £400,000.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, {{with the}} area around Woking by this time heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} was an extremely valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a hostile takeover bid {{with the aim of}} using the cemetery's land for <b>property</b> <b>development.</b> The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Club captain Noel Spencer was {{released}} by the Mariners, then signed {{to participate in the}} Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and São Paulo of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side to draw from the roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a <b>property</b> <b>development</b> joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use its share of income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the British Railways Board, London Transport Executive, Greater London Council and the Department of the Environment {{produced}} a report examining the modernisation of London transport. It recommended high priority given to reconstructing Liverpool Street and Broad Street stations and recommended financing this through <b>property</b> <b>development</b> on the site. Liverpool Street {{had a number}} of design and access issues, many of which derived from the 1890 extension which had effectively created two stations on one site, with two concourses linked by walkways, multiple booking halls, and inefficient traffic flows within the station. Additionally the rail infrastructure presented limitations; only seven of the platforms could accommodate 12-carriage trains, and the track exit layout was a bottleneck. In 1975 British Railways announced plans to demolish and redevelop both stations. The proposed demolition met considerable public opposition and prompted a campaign led by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, leading to a public inquiry from November 1976 to February 1977.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a <b>property</b> <b>development</b> company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Stabæk {{announced}} they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship {{agreement with the}} telecommunications company Telenor, where the latter would pay up to NOK115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena, in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes. In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian <b>Property</b> <b>Development</b> to KLP Eiendom. The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud. The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds. The bus stops closest to the venue are closed, {{and a large number}} of police officers have to direct the traffic. These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company, and contrasts to matches at the nearly twice as large Ullevaal, where no such measures are necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} master plan granted outline planning permission for a 250-bed hotel {{of five to}} six storeys in height. However, <b>property</b> <b>development</b> and investment company The Beetham Organization Ltd, which has in recent years built several high-profile hotels, offices and other buildings in prominent city-centre locations in Britain, bought Block J in November 2004 and submitted a revised planning application (BH2005/00136/FP) early in 2005. This sought approval for a mixed-use development comprising one 42-storey building with 146 residential units (C3-category) and a hotel with ancillary facilities including a restaurant, cafés, conference facilities and a health and fitness centre; one six-storey building with retail units (A1- and A3-category) and a further 25 residential units; and a pedestrianised public square. The application was rejected on 20 separate counts, including the negative visual impact on surrounding listed buildings such as the railway station and St Bartholomew's Church; the reduction in quality of surrounding public spaces; the lack of provision of outdoor recreation space; {{negative effect on the}} surrounding microclimate, and loss of sunlight to nearby buildings; and the failure to consider fully the impact on transport. The reasons for the rejection were supported by various people and groups within the city, such as The Regency Society, which is involved with planning and conservation matters in Brighton and Hove.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{research}} into the concept of brand trust amongst numerous industries but it has not been researched in relation to the real estate industry and in particular industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments.</b> The elements and influences on brand trust are numerous and disparate dependant on the industry within which the concept is researched. However, the literature did identify certain common elements and influences amongst the industries researched. The existing literature on commercial and industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments</b> identifies there are many aspects of a property that tenants take into consideration when leasing including location of a building or site, rent incentives, lease terms, operating expenses and management of the property. There are also many intangible influences on the decision making process that are not as easily identifiable but can primarily be recognised from the relationship between landlords and their tenants in terms of trust, balance of power and overall satisfaction. The existing literature identifies that the tangible aspects of the relationship are considered more significant than the relationship in commercial leasing. There is a clear gap in the research between the concept of brand trust and its value in landlord/tenant relationships in industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments.</b> This dissertation proposes to answer the following questions: What are the elements of brand trust in landlord/tenant relationships in industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments?</b> What are the influences on brand trust in landlord/tenant relationships in industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments?</b> What is the influence of brand trust in comparison to other aspects of commercial leasing on tenant retentions in industrial developments? This dissertation primarily reviews the existing literature on the concept of brand trust as well as the literature on landlord/tenant relationships in industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments</b> and the influences on tenant retentions. An exploratory research method is utilized to collect data. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 6 respondents who were tenants of medium-large sized industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments</b> with multiple tenants and managed directly by the landlord. This study identifies that the predominant elements of brand trust in landlord/tenant relationships in industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments</b> include accessibility, benevolence, communication, competence, conflict resolution techniques, cooperation, coordination, credibility, equality, flexibility and professionalism. The primary influences on brand trust are the level of landlord power, the level of tenant power, the economic environment, the tenant mix in a development, the power balance in the landlord/tenant relationship, word of mouth and experience. Subsequently this dissertation identifies that the influences on tenant retentions in industrial <b>property</b> <b>developments</b> include switching costs, alternative attractiveness, the tangible aspects of the relationship including lease, location and building, the economic environment, the power balance in the relationship, brand loyalty and brand trust. The elements and influences on brand trust that are identified in this dissertation are generally consistent with the existing literature. However, although the dissertation identifies that brand trust is influential on tenant retentions, it is of less importance than the tangible aspects of the relationships including the location, building and lease. This only partially supports the existing literature on the influence of brand trust on commitment. In conclusion, the implications for management are that, provided landlords are able to meet tenant’s needs in relation to the tangible aspects of the development, then they should focus on the level of brand trust in the relationship to gain an advantage over other landlords in retaining their tenants...|$|R
