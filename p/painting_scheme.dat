2500|$|The {{markings}} of Roy Focker's VF-1S Valkyrie (which {{was itself}} {{inspired by the}} F-14 Tomcat) in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross is obviously inspired by the squadron insignia of VF-84, and his [...] "Skull Squadron" [...] is considered the equivalent of VF-84; in the Americanized version, Robotech, the squadron was also considered to be elite. In the movie [...] this is even more apparent, as the skull-and-crossbones insignia is worn by all Valkyries in Skull Squadron. This <b>painting</b> <b>scheme</b> has continued to be reproduced in both the prequel series [...] "Macross Zero" [...] (2002), on Focker's VF-0S experimental Valkyrie, and more recently [...] "Macross Frontier" [...] (2008), where the pilot Ozma Lee, as the senior leader of Skull Squadron, has the markings on his VF-25S.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} mass transit agencies, UTA does not sell naming rights for its {{stations}}, {{nor does it}} allow stations to be named after commercial businesses. [...] Furthermore, commercial advertising on TRAX platforms is prohibited, {{in order for the}} passengers to be able to notice the safety information. One exception to this rule occurred during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Since, for security reasons, the Arena and Temple Square stations were closed, UTA allowed Coca-Cola to use the area of the unused Arena Station as part of its pin-trading center. The advertising restriction does not apply to the sides of the TRAX train cars or to UTA's buses. Not only does UTA have advertising signs on the sides and rear of many of its buses, it also has many buses where the <b>painting</b> <b>scheme</b> of the full rear or even the entire bus is an advertisement (bus wrap).|$|E
2500|$|The Crown Court has {{a tunnel}} vault on red granite columns and the Civil Court a coved ceiling on grey granite columns. The south {{entrance}} is approached through the portico, {{is low and}} has Ionic columns. Below this is a larger vaulted space which was adapted {{to form a new}} entrance in 2003–05. The north entrance hall has Doric columns on its landing and a Doric ambulatory around the apse. A copy of part of the Parthenon frieze runs round its walls. In the entrance is a statue of Henry Booth by Theed the Younger. The Small Concert Room is almost circular and is lavishly decorated. In the past it was known as the Golden Concert Room and it was regularly host to Charles Dickens, who held many of his readings there. [...] A balcony supported by caryatids runs round the room. At the back of the platform are attached columns, decorated with arabesques, supporting a frieze with griffins and between the columns are mirrors. [...] The concert room was refurbished between 2000 and 2007. This included making alterations to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act, restoring the historical <b>painting</b> <b>scheme</b> and restoring the chandelier, which consists of 2,824crystal pieces.

50|$|Regular {{painting}} of such bridges is an intimidating task; hence, a <b>painting</b> <b>scheme</b> has been developed, having life over 15 years, compared to approx. 5 to 7 {{years of life}} {{in most of the}} Indian railway bridges.|$|E

50|$|DM&E {{originally}} purchased used first-generation locomotives from {{a variety}} of railroads; in the early years it was more common to see a locomotive with a Milwaukee Road or Chicago and North Western Railway <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> than a DM&E <b>paint</b> <b>scheme.</b> Over the years, the locomotives were repainted, {{and many of them are}} now in DM&E's <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> (which is closely mirrored by that of sister Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad) of blue with a yellow stripe along its length.|$|R

5000|$|The Kennedy {{alterations}} {{were both}} praised and criticized. Patrick Phillips-Schrock, writing in 2013, {{noted that the}} room's [...] "furniture, fireplace and fixtures serve the space well" [...] and praised the lowering of the upper sill of the window to more correctly match the cornice line of the room. But he harshly disapproved of the room's <b>painting</b> <b>scheme</b> (calling it a [...] "Yellow Fever Epidemic"), and called the insertion of a register in the frame above the room's northeast door [...] "in incredibly poor taste".|$|E
5000|$|The Anji Khad {{bridge was}} {{initially}} proposed {{to be an}} arch bridge. It {{was designed as a}} long steel arches span bridge. Its main arch span was 265 m and the deck height is 189 m. The 8.5 km bridge lies southeast of the Chenab Bridge, near Reasi, along which the alignment of the new railway line crosses the deep gorges of Anji Khad. Quality aspects, construction standards, indigenous materials and the <b>painting</b> <b>scheme</b> were proposed to be similar to the Chenab Bridge. Later, a committee headed by a former railway board chairman has recommended that the location is not suitable for an arch bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Since taking {{ownership}} of the building, the Historic Chapels Trust has carried out repairs and modernisation, including the reinstatement of the historic <b>painting</b> <b>scheme</b> in the interior and, in 2007, the painting of the exterior.
