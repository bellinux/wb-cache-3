25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to the parotid gland. Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia. Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy. Doses above 30Gy to the thyroid are associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism. Subjective, <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> of quality of life also correlate with radiation dose received.|$|E

40|$|PurposeTo analyse the {{relationship}} between <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and clinical outcome measures in 42 individual Swedish cataract surgery settings. MethodsThe study material consisted of follow-up data on cataract extractions collected by the Swedish National Cataract Register in 2008 - 2011. <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> was measured using the Catquest- 9 SF questionnaire. A total of 9707 pairs of questionnaires completed before and after a cataract extraction were analysed together with clinical data. The analyses were performed for each clinic. ResultsFor almost all clinics, a factor related to a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> after surgery was a good preoperative self-assessed visual function. For some clinics, up to 50 % of the patients stated {{that they were very}} satisfied with their vision before surgery. For single clinics, different factors such as large anisometropia (3 D), capsule complications, biometry prediction error (3 D) and ocular comorbidity were related to a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome.</b> In situations where the clinical outcome was good and the <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> was poor, problems with near-vision activities after surgery was the main factor noted. ConclusionsAnalysing factors related to a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> for each clinic showed large variation. Weak indication for surgery, refractive problems after surgery, surgical complications and a poor chance of visual recovery due to ocular comorbidity were among the reasons for a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome.</b> Post-operative care in terms of establishing a good near vision seemed to be another problem for some clinics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> {{measures}} are tools that allow clinicians and researchers to gauge patients' {{level of satisfaction}} {{and quality of life}} after a medical intervention. The use of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and the clinically relevant score differentials over time as they relate to outcomes (minimum clinically important differences) has been proposed as a way to understand success and failure rates in orthopaedics. We conducted a systematic appraisal of literature in peer-reviewed journals and registry reports to measure the use that registries and other large data repositories make of minimum clinically important differences and to understand methodological approaches for such uses. Of the nineteen registry reports and 1052 articles examined, we found that only one report and two studies mentioned the use of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and minimum clinically important differences in the context of revision rates of total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty. We conclude that although the infrastructure and efforts to routinely collect <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures at registry levels do exist, there is limited use of minimum clinically important differences to understand and potentially predict clinical outcomes. We suggest advancing the global infrastructure such as the International Consortium of Orthopaedic Registries to address how research related to <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures can help individual registries collaborate in the development of tools and allow aggregation of data...|$|R

40|$|Muscle {{strengthening}} exercises {{have been}} shown to improve pain and function in adults with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis, but individual response rates can vary greatly. Predicting individuals who respond {{and those who do not}} is important in developing a more efficient and effective model of care for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use pre-intervention gait kinematics and <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures to predict post-intervention response to a 6 -week hip strengthening exercise intervention in patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA. Thirty-nine patients with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis completed a 6 -week hip-strengthening program and were subgrouped as Non-Responders, Low-Responders, or High-Responders following the intervention based on their change in Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Predictors of responder subgroups were retrospectively determined from baseline <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and kinematic gait parameters in a discriminant analysis of principal components. A 3 - 4 year follow-up on 16 of the patients with knee OA was also done to examine long-term changes in these parameters. A unique combination of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and kinematic factors was able to successfully subgroup patients with knee osteoarthritis with a cross-validated classification accuracy of 85. 4 %. Lower patient-reported function in daily living (ADL) scores and hip frontal plane kinematics during the loading response were most important in classifying High-Responders from other sub-groups, while a combination of hip, knee, ankle kinematics were used to classify Non-Responders from Low-Responders. <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and objective biomechanical gait data can be an effective method of predicting individual treatment success to an exercise intervention. Measuring gait kinematics, along with <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures in a clinical setting can be useful in helping make evidence-based decisions regarding optimal treatment for patients with knee OA...|$|R
