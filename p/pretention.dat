He was {{accepted}} by the Javanese gentry and by VOC officials in Tegal, but could not establish his authority elsewhere in Java. The governor of Cirebon, a vassal of Mataram since 1660 refused to pay homage. His brother Pangeran Puger occupied the capital after the rebels left, and made a rival claim to the kingdom. Aware of his difficult position, the new king sailed to Jepara to meet with the VOC commander Speelman and renewed the Mataram-VOC alliance. In exchange for VOC assistance, he was obliged to promise a large sum of money and geopolitical concessions. The Trunajaya rebellion would continue until 1680 and Puger's <b>pretention</b> to the throne until 1681. Unable to take Plered from his brother, in 1680 Amangkurat II built a new capital in the district of Pajang, and called it Kartasura.|$|E

60|$|But what if History were to admit, for once, {{that all}} the Names and Theorems yet known to her fall short? That this grand Product of Nature was even grand, and new, in that it came not to range itself under old {{recorded}} Laws-of-Nature at all; but to disclose new ones? In that case, History renouncing the <b>pretention</b> to name it at present, will look honestly at it, and name what she can of it! Any approximation to the right Name has value: were the right name itself once here, the Thing is known thenceforth; the Thing is then ours, and can be dealt with.|$|E
6000|$|Peter Bell. There {{have been}} lately advertised two Books both Peter Bell by name; what stuff the one {{was made of}} might {{be seen by the}} motto--"I am the real Simon Pure." [...] This false Florimel has hurried from the press and obtruded herself into public notice, while for aught we know the real one may be still {{wandering}} about the woods and mountains. Let us hope she may soon appear and make good her right to the magic girdle. The Pamphleteering Archimage, we can perceive, has rather a splenetic love than a downright hatred to real Florimels--if indeed they had been so christened--or had even a <b>pretention</b> to play at bob cherry with Barbara Lewthwaite: but he has a fixed aversion to those three rhyming Graces Alice Fell, Susan Gale and Betty Foy; and now at length especially to Peter Bell--fit Apollo. It may be seen from one or two Passages in this little skit, that the writer of it has felt the finer parts of Mr. Wordsworth, and perhaps expatiated with his more remote and sublimer muse. This as far as it relates to Peter Bell is unlucky. The more he may love the sad embroidery of the Excursion, the more he will hate the coarse Samplers of Betty Foy and Alice Fell; and as they come from the same hand, the better will he be able to imitate that which can be imitated, to wit Peter Bell--as far as can be imagined from the obstinate Name. We repeat, it is very unlucky--this real Simon Pure is in parts the very Man--there is a pernicious likeness in the scenery, a 'pestilent humour' in the rhymes, and an inveterate cadence in some of the Stanzas, that must be lamented. If we are one part amused with this we are three parts sorry that an appreciator of Wordsworth should show so much temper at this really provoking name of Peter Bell--![99] ...|$|E
