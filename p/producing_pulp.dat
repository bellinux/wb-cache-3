40|$|The kraft {{process is}} the {{predominant}} method for <b>producing</b> <b>pulp</b> in Scandinavia. However, the material efficiency in modern kraft pulp mills for pulp production is only 40 − 55 % and the final product consists mainly of cellulose. A novel process called “LignoBoost ” has been introduced recently for extracting lignin from alkaline black liquor. The separated lignin can either be utilized as solid fuel or raw material of other value-added products such as carbon fibre or phenols, which is one step towards a combined pulp and biorefinery process. The LignoBoost process consists of four major steps: precipitation, filtration, re-dispersing and final washing. Whilst filtration and washing have already been investigated extensively, more knowledge needs to be gained of the precipitation step. In this work, lignin precipitation was performed by the acidification of black liquor at various process conditions, namely pH, temperature and ion strength, and the influences exerted by these parameters on the equilibrium of lignin precipitation were investigated.

30|$|The {{supply of}} wood chips from sawmills to {{pulp and paper}} mills in Sweden {{contributes}} with approximately 25  % or 11  million m 3 solid under bark of the overall wood use in the industry [1]. The entire quantity of sawmill chips to the pulp and paper mills in the Nordic countries consists of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The sawmill chips are normally purchased according to dry weight. The traditional way to determine the dry weight of wood chips is to weigh a sample of chips, dry them in an oven, and weigh them again after they have reached a constant weight. In this manner, the moisture content (MC) can be calculated to determine the dry weight for the entire load of wood chips (gravimetric method). This procedure is very tedious because {{it is necessary to}} wait for at least 24  h until the wood chips reach a constant weight. However, this procedure is common practice today at all Swedish pulpmills. The relatively long-time span it takes for the samples to dry makes it harder to optimize the flow of wood chips that arrive at the mill. For example, sorting loads of chips with similar MC into different stacks is not possible today, even though that would be of interest for the pulpmill since the MC is an important process parameter when <b>producing</b> <b>pulp</b> [2 – 5].|$|E
40|$|Now a day, the {{dependency}} of mankind on polythene {{has grown to}} larger extent because of its wide applications in storing food without allowing the moisture inside the packing and also as carry bags. But polythene is a non-biodegradable material which when buried in the soil doesn’t decompose. Because of this reason the soil looses it’s fertility due to the toxic chemicals it release {{by the action of}} temperature and also killing the micro organisms that are essential in the soil. In view of this, several attempts were made in recent years to develop paper that can show the oil proof as that of polythene. This project involves not the production of paper but the basic raw material for paper production that is pulp from banana plant (abundantly available on earth). Later this pulp can be blended with pulp obtained from bamboo which is less abundant, to obtain oil proof paper. The reason behind the selection of banana as raw material is, in banana plantations, after the fruits are harvested, the trunks or stems will be wasted.

40|$|Mechanical pulping processes, {{including}} {{thermomechanical pulp}} (TMP), groundwood (SGW andPGW), and chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) processes, {{each have a}} very high wood-to-pulp yield. <b>Producing</b> <b>pulp</b> by means of these processes is a prerequisite for paper (such as printing paper and paperboard) grades requiring high printability and stiffness. However, mechanical pulping processes consume a great amount of electricity, which may account for up to 40 % of the total pulp production cost. In mechanical pulping mills, wood (biomass) residues are commonly utilized for electricity production through an associated combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This techno-economic evaluation deals with the possibility of utilizing a biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plant in place of the CHP plant. Implementing BIGCC in a mechanical pulp production line might greatly improve the overall energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially when more biomass from forest (such as branches and tree tops) is available. When the fibre material that negatively affects pulp properties is utilized as a bioenergy resource, the overall efficiency will be further improved. A TMP+BIGCC mathematical model is developed with ASPEN Plus. By means of modeling, three cases are studied: 1) adding more forest biomass logging residues in the gasifier, 2) adding the reject fibres in the gasifier, and 3) decreasing the TMP-specific electricity consumption (SEC) by up to 50 %. For a TMP+BIGCC mill, the energy supply and consumption are analyzed in comparison with a TMP+CHP mill. The production profits are evaluated.

40|$|Wood {{utilization}} for {{pulp and}} paper and biorefinery applications requires some kind of mechanical and/or physical–chemical pretreatment. Among the chemical treatments the alkaline ones are the most used worldwide, although acid and solvent treatments have also being used. This paper deals with eucalypt wood deconstruction with alkaline processes including soda-AQ, soda-AQ-O 2, soda-O 2, and kraft. The kraft process is largely used by the pulp industry and is evaluated here only {{to serve as a}} reference. The behavior of the four eucalypt clones selected in chapter 2 were investigated when submitted to the aforementioned processes regarding their screened yield, chemical demands and pulp quality at different kappa number levels (15, 35, 50, and 70). The two most promising processes (kraft and soda-AQ) were chosen for producing pulps (kappa 15 and 20) which were studied in depth (content of carbohydrates, uronic acid, hexenuronic acid, polysaccharide molecular weight, residual lignin structure, etc.), as well as their respective black liquors (heating value, solid content, elemental analysis, and lignin structure). The main findings of this work were: (1) the wood of the four different hybrid eucalypt clones behave similarly in the various alkaline deconstruction treatments; (2) the soda-AQ and Kraft were considered the most suitable processes for <b>producing</b> <b>pulp</b> on the basis of yield, chemical demands and pulp fiber integrity; (3) the soda-AQ process can potentially replace the kraft for a high degree of wood delignification (kappa number 15); (4) the alkaline processes using oxygen (soda-AQ-O 2 and soda-O 2) are more suitable for wood deconstruction aimed at biofuels; and (5) the soda-AQ process resulted black liquor of more suitable burning characteristics than the kraft.
