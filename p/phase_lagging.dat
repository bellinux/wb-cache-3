40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} fine-scale flow and sand {{transport}} processes above onshore migrating ripples below skewed surface gravity waves in the shoaling zone. A set of acoustic instruments was deployed in the shoaling region of the large-scale wave channel at Canal d'Investigacío i Experimatacío Marítima, Universitat Poltiècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, {{in order to provide}} high-resolution velocity and sediment concentration profiles with an acoustic concentration and velocity profiler (ACVP). Measurements are analyzed relative to the positions of the measured nonmoving sand bed and the interface separating the suspension from the near-bed load layer. This interface is detected here by the application of a novel acoustic bed echo detection method. Furthermore, the use of the dual-frequency inversion proposed in the work of Hurther et al. (2011) allows for the calculation of the sediment concentration profile across both the suspension and near-bed load layers. The sand bed was covered by quasi-two-dimensional suborbital ripples migrating onshore. As proposed by O'Donoghue et al. (2006), the occurrence of quasi-two-dimensional ripples is attributed to the fine-size sand of D 50 = 250 μm {{used in the present study}} under full-scale forcing conditions. In order to determine the effect of shoaled wave skewness on the ripple vortex entrainment and sediment transport, the instantaneous and mean measurements of the flow, sediment concentration, and sediment flux along the ripple profile are discussed in terms of (1) the occurrence of ripple vortex entrainment on either side of the ripple crest; (2) the wave velocity <b>phase</b> <b>lagging</b> driven by the ripple vortex entrainment process and the turbulent bed friction effects in the wave boundary layer; (3) <b>phase</b> <b>lagging</b> between velocity and maximum concentration and sediment flux events; (4) the structure of bed friction and ripple-driven turbulence across the suspension and the near-bed load layers; and (5) the streaming components. The results on these aspects strongly support that the wave velocity skewness effect under shoaling waves is fairly similar to the one obtained in skewed oscillatory water tunnel flows. Furthermore, it is found that the onshore-oriented net bed load sediment transport is at the origin of the onshore ripple migration.

This new turbulence model agrees better than the Wilcox original model with both a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a pure oscillatory flow over a smooth bottom in the intermittently turbulent regime and with experimental data from Jensen et al. [1989], who attained the fully turbulent regime for pure oscillatory flows. The new turbulence model is also found to agree better than the original one with experimental data of an oscillatory flow with current over a rough bottom by Dohmen-Janssen [1999]. In particular, the proposed model reproduces the secondary humps in the Reynolds stresses during the decelerating part of the wave cycle and the vertical <b>phase</b> <b>lagging</b> of the Reynolds stresses, two shortcomings of all previous modeling attempts.

40|$|The {{state of}} the art in wind power {{technology}} is offshore VSC-HVDC-connected (Voltage Source Converter-High Voltage Direct Current) offshore wind farm of Full Converter Wind Turbines (FCWT). This latest generation of wind power plants provide great opportunities with regard to efficiency and flexibility, but poses new challenges with regard to power system stability, as the asynchronous operation inertially decouples the generators from the residual power system. By utilising the flexibility of VSC-control, the goal is to improve the dynamic behaviour by coupling the system frequency and generator speed, and hence provide frequency support. The frequency support control strategies are initially designed by contextualising the wind power plants in classic power system stability theory. By the knowledge of lacking primary control in wind farms, it was predicted that an inertia response would compromise system damping as the turbines demand power when returning to nominal speed, whereas classic power plants provide power. The effectiveness of the design was evaluated by the results gathered from two experimental methods, simulation and laboratory. The simulation model was constructed in MatLab SimuLink and is a mathematical power flow model. Since the time scope of inertia response is in seconds, the microsecond switching of the converters is not modelled. The laboratory model was constructed by a 17 kW grid and a 55 kW wind farm equivalent connected by 60 and 20 kW VSC-converters. All converters are FPGA-controlled enabled by the graphical programming environment LabView and CAN-bus messages. The system load is pure resistive and the perturbation of the system is changing this resistance. The auxiliary control structure was designed with simplicity as the key feature. By frequency measurements, the deviation from nominal was scaled and mirrored on to the HVDC-voltage. This was denoted Scaled Deviation Mirroring, SDM. The same technique was used to couple the HVDC-voltage to the offshore frequency, and then couple the offshore frequency to the wind turbine speed. If neglecting any regulation delay, this would allow the wind turbine to swing in phase with the grid frequency. This novice control reduced the frequency drop by 35. 3 % and the overshoot by 12. 5 %, but the oscillations sustained twice as long. Using the prediction of compromised damping, a secondary controller was designed with the intention to damp the oscillations. Since the wind turbines lacks primary regulation (governors), regulation of the residual grid must ensure damping for an added inertial mass. A key characteristic of the full converter wind turbine has already been pointed out - asynchronous frequency - and this is utilised in the Wind Turbine Stabiliser control (WTS-control). Completely decoupled frequency allows the inertia response to be phase shifted without restriction, and it can be optimised to reduce frequency drop and improve damping. The results showed that a wind turbine frequency response <b>phase</b> <b>lagging</b> 15 - 20 ^∘ significantly improved damping, but on the expense of frequency reduction. The addition of WTS-control improved the frequency drop by 29. 4 %, the overshoot by 62. 5 %, while sustaining the oscillations for 25 % longer compared to the reference. The fact that a lagged response improves the system performance pave way for two conclusions. Firstly, the regulation {{does not need to be}} stressed for optimal performance, as the response is nevertheless lagged on purpose. Component ratings can then be easier met, as high currents are avoided. Secondly, the lag is a proof of the greatest weakness of the wind turbines, no primary regulation. The auxiliary control must then be regarded as a method for improving system interaction, rather than local contribution. The lagging wind turbine inertia response facilitates an effective primary regulation of residual grid by providing inertia reserves at the right time, but also demanding accelerating power at the right time...|$|E

One potential method for recovering cognitive brain dynamics in the presence of gait-related artifact is the Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index. Methods We tested the ability of Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index to recover event-related potentials during locomotion. Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index is a functional connectivity measure that quantified how consistently 90 ° (or 270 °) phase ‘lagging’ one EEG signal was compared to another. 248 -channel EEG was recorded as eight subjects performed a visual oddball discrimination and response task during standing and walking (0. 8 or 1. 2 [*]m/s) on a treadmill. Results Applying Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index across channels we were able to recover a p 300 -like cognitive response during walking. This response was similar to the classic amplitude-based p 300 we also recovered during standing. We also showed that the Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index detects more complex and variable activity patterns than traditional voltage-amplitude measures. This variability makes it challenging to compare brain activity over time and across subjects. In contrast, a statistical metric of the index’s variability, calculated over a moving time window, provided a more generalized measure of behavior. Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index Stability returned a peak change of 1. 8 %[*]+[*]− 0. 5 % from baseline for the walking case and 3. 9 %[*]+[*]− 1. 3 % for the standing case. Conclusions These findings suggest that both Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index and Weighted <b>Phase</b> <b>Lag</b> Index Stability have potential for the on-line analysis of cognitive dynamics within EEG during human movement. The latter may be more useful from extracting general principles of neural behavior across subjects and conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sheet flow {{corresponds}} to the high velocity regime when small bed ripples are washed out and sand is transported in a thin layer close to the bed. Therefore, it is often assumed that sand transport in oscillatory sheet flow behaves quasi-steady: time-dependent transport rates {{are assumed to be}} instantaneously related to the near-bed orbital velocity. However, new experimental results show that even in sheet flow, <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> between sediment concentration and near-bed velocity can become so large that they lead to a reduction of the net (wave-averaged) transport rate. A <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> parameter is defined, which shows that <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> become important for fine sand, high velocities and short wave periods. A semi-unsteady model is developed that includes the effects of <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> on the net transport rate. New experiments were carried out in a large oscillating water tunnel with three different sands (D 50 = 0. 13, 0. 21 and 0. 32 mm) for a range of prototype, combined wave–current flow conditions. Measured net transport rates were compared with predictions of a quasi-steady model and the new semi-unsteady model. This comparison indicates that net transport rates are reduced if <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> become important: the quasi-steady model overestimates the net transport rates and the semi-unsteady model gives better agreement with the data. Time-dependent measurements of velocities and concentrations show that the reduced net transport rates can indeed be explained by <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> effects, because for tests with smaller net transport rates than predicted by the quasi-steady model, considerable <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> between velocities and concentrations were observed, even inside the sheet flow layer.

40|$|Helicopter dynamic {{response}} {{is one of}} the most important criterions of the helicopter design. For an accurate prediction and calculation of the vibratory responses of the helicopter structure in different flight conditions, an exact modelling is essential. The accuracy of the results returns back to the accuracies of the model and calculation procedures. The multibody dynamic simulation tool allows using modular models to build a complete detailed system. This could be used to model a complex helicopter. SIMPACK (SImulation of Multibody systems PACKage) as a multibody simulation tool has shown considerable ability to model and analyse linear and non-linear systems during different DLR-projects, however use of this tool for modelling the helicopter dynamics is something which is currently being investigated [1], [2]. This tool was originally developed by DLR (German Aerospace Center) and is now further developed and commercially distributed by SIMPACK AG. In this work the multibody simulation of the ground resonance effect is investigated. For this purpose, the interface of SIMPACK with a FEM code for modelling the elastic rotor blades is considered. This interface creates a Standatrd Input Data, SID, based on blade geometry and eigenvalue analysis. The SID-file is then used for the calculation of elastic deformation. SIMPACK provides also an interface with MATLAB, which allows performing a part of postprocessing within this program. Fig. 1 shows the general view of the ground resonance analysis using multibody dynamics simulation. Helicopter ground resonance is a self exited dynamic instability, which may occur when helicopter is in contact with the ground. Elastic deformation and out of <b>phase</b> <b>lagging</b> motion of the rotor blades during rotor rotation lead to the oscillation of the rotor centre of gravity around the rotor rotation axis. Due to the interaction between rotor and fuselage, this oscillation excites the flexible fuselage and the rotor support and may cause a violent damage of the helicopter structure. This phenomenon is known as ground resonance. Modelling this phenomenon needs consideration of the following points: Linearisation, Geometric stiffening effect, Time-periodic system, Multiblade coordinates transformation. The work described within this paper is generally divided into three main parts. The first part is related to the “linearization and geometric stiffening effect”, which is a preliminary step for the dynamic stability analysis of a rotating system. Here, the simulation results are compared with analytical results. Creating the Fan-Diagram of an isolated rotor and comparison of the results with those produced with CAMRAD II belongs also to this part. The second part deals with the helicopter ground resonance analysis. Modelling the ground resonance starts with a simplified model (rigid blades with mechanically equivalent elastic lagging deformation and fuselage with two translational degrees of freedom) and is continued with more complex models comprising elastic blades and fuselage. Data used in this part belongs to DLR scaled (1 : 2. 5) BO 105 research rotor model (configuration K 20) [3] and CAMRAD II model of full scale BO 105 with modified skid gear provided by Eurocopter Germany. One of the features of the ground resonance model is its time-periodic characteristic, which leads to the invalidity of the direct usage of the classical eigenvalue method for the dynamic stability analysis. To perform the ground resonance analysis, the model is first linearized about the equilibrium state. Then the linear system matrix of the model is extracted and transformed from the rotating coordinates to the non-rotating multiblade coordinates. This coordinate transformation changes the system from a time-periodic to a time-invariant one. Finally, a classical eigenvalue analysis of the transformed system matrix results in the frequencies and damping of the system. To evaluate the simulation procedures, the SIMPACK results are compared with results produced with CAMRAD II model. To validate the model and calculation procedures in addition to a comparison with the CAMRAD II-results an analytical validation of the dynamic response of the system is also performed. The third part of the work deals with the parametric studies of the ground resonance effect and analysing the results and tendencies of the changes of the dynamic response...|$|E
40|$|A new {{embedded}} pair {{of explicit}} modified Runge-Kutta (RK) methods for the numerical {{integration of the}} radial Schrödinger equation is presented. The two RK methods in the pair have algebraic orders five and four, respectively. The two methods of the embedded pair are derived by nullifying the <b>phase</b> <b>lag,</b> the first derivative of the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> of the fifth-order method, and the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> of the fourth-order method. Nu merical experiments show the efficiency and robustness of our new methods compared with some well-known integrators in the literature...|$|R
30|$|The two {{sensitivity}} indexes {{magnitude of}} different parameters {{is related to}} the magnitude of the amplitude attenuation and <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> directly under one working condition. In other words, when the magnitude of the amplitude attenuation and the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> is large or small, the magnitude of S 1 and S 2 is large or small.|$|R
40|$|The {{time lag}} between {{anomalies}} in precipitation and vegetation activity plays {{a critical role}} in early drought detection as agricultural droughts are caused by precipitation shortages. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore a new approach to estimate the time lag between a forcing (precipitation) and a response (NDVI) signal in the frequency domain by applying cross-spectral analysis. We prepared anomaly time series of image data on TRMM 3 B 42 precipitation (accumulated over antecedent durations of 10, 60, and 150 days) and NDVI, reconstructed and interpolated MOD 13 A 2 and MYD 13 A 2 to daily interval using a Fourier series method to model time series affected by gaps and outliers (iHANTS) for a dry and a wet year in a drought-prone area in the northeast region of China. Then, the cross-spectral analysis was applied pixel-wise and only the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> of the annual component of the forcing and response signal was extracted. The 10 -day antecedent precipitation was retained as the best representation of forcing. The estimated <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> was interpreted using maps of land cover and of available soil water-holding capacity and applied to investigate the difference in phenology responses between a wet and dry year. In both the wet and dry year, we measured consistent <b>phase</b> <b>lags</b> across land cover types. In the wet year with above-average precipitation, the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> was rather similar for all land cover types, i. e., 7. 6 days for closed to open grassland and 14. 5 days for open needle-leaved deciduous or evergreen forest. In the dry year, the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> increased by 7. 0 days on average, but with specific response signals for the different land cover types. Interpreting the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> against the soil water-holding capacity, we observed a slightly higher <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> in the dry year for soils with a higher water-holding capacity. The accuracy of the estimated <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and presented reliable estimates for the annual component. </p...|$|R

The rotor control system is mechanically shifted up to 90 degrees to compensate for <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> and provide helicopter response that matches movement of the cyclic stick.|$|R
40|$|Observations of a <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> {{between the}} {{intensity}} variations of high-energy {{galactic cosmic rays}} and the quiet-time oxygen flux in the energy region 7. 6 - 24 MeV/nucleon during the time period 1974 - 1975 are reported. <b>Phase</b> <b>lag</b> or hysteresis effects have been observed during the 11 -year solar cycle for low-energy galactic cosmic rays and several authors have shown that this hysteresis effect {{is a function of}} the velocity and rigidity (and therefore of the ionic charge) of the particles. Assuming a similar rigidity dependence of the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> during the transient intensity decrease of both galactic cosmic rays and the anomalous oxygen component in the time period 1974 - 1975, and comparing the <b>phase</b> <b>lag</b> as observed for protons and helium during the same period with the oxygen measurements, an upper limit of approximately 4 is derived for the ionic charge of the anomalous oxygen component...|$|R
