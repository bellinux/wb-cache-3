Christ is floating above the scene kneeling on a cloud, holding a banner in his left hand, while the angel who lifted the tombstone is standing in <b>profile</b> <b>turning</b> his head victoriously towards the viewer. The soldiers who were assigned to guard the tomb are scattered around. The artist's use of strong and clear colours, combined with the softened muted tones of the nuances, creates an overall balance between the variations of shadow and light typical of the Baroque.|$|E

Through {{the use of the}} alternate use of light and shade; the chiaroscuro technique is used by the artist to highlight the line of the nose, cheekbones and the neck. All this, however, is softened by the muted tones of the nuances he used when depicting the color of the body. The strong shadows and the sculptural treatment of the head make this one of the most distinguishable representations on the Veil of Veronica. According to legend, Christ stumbled on his way to Golgotha carrying the cross. Veronica took off her own veil, and wiped his face with it. Christ's features were miraculously imprinted on the veil.|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical {{machining}} with an oscillating electrode and {{pulsed current}} (PECM) is an innovative manufacturing {{process for the}} production of tools and machine elements with highest precision requirements. Currently structure sizes < 1 mm and a flatness of < 5 µm are achievable with PECM.

During the conducted investigations, a combination of the pulsed electrochemical machining process with a turning device is explored.

30|$|Extra-virgin {{olive oil}} (EVO) is an {{important}} element in the Mediterranean diet and a major agricultural crop for Southern European countries in terms of both farm income and cultivated area (De Graaff and Eppink 1999; Owen et al. 2000; Pupo D’Andrea, 2007; Marchini et al. 2010). Moreover, given the increased popularity of the Mediterranean diet among consumers in the US, Canada, Australia and large parts of Asia, EVO consumption has grown almost worldwide (Santosa and Guinard 2011; International Olive Oil Council 2012). Contextually, olive-oil production has switched from low yields and low-input cultivation to a capital-intensive farming system involving innovations in both agricultural practices and processing techniques. This has led to a considerable improvement in EVO nutritional characteristics accompanied by a profound change in sensory <b>profile,</b> <b>turning</b> a traditional food, with well known organoleptic features, into a brand new kind of dressing.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the predictive modeling of surface microstructure alterations in terms of grain refinement due to mechanical deformation and thermally driven phase transformation during the machining process. To model grain refinement, a dislocation density-based numerical framework is developed to simulate the chip formation, cutting temperature and grain size during orthogonal cutting of Al 6061 T 6 and OFHC Cu; to model phase change, a truly coupled metallo-thermo-mechanical scheme is proposed to considerate mechanical deformation, thermal history, and phase transformation kinetics in orthogonal cutting of AISI 1045 steel under various conditions. The developed metallo-thermo-mechanical coupled analysis is then applied to the three-dimensional (3 D) hard turning process for bearing steels to investigate the surface microstructure alteration, particularly the white layer formation mechanisms incorporating both the thermally driven phase transformation and mechanical grain refinement due to severe plastic deformation. ^ To carry on the microstructural evolution simulation and improve computational efficiency, a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model is developed to simulate steady-state chip formation in two-dimensional (2 D) orthogonal cutting by using the commercial software Abaqus. 3 D hard turning simulations are undertaken via AdvantEdge FEM software incorporating the material user subroutine for various hard turning conditions. A novel, arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) based finite element scheme is developed in ABAQUS to simulate the micro-milling cycles, and a strain gradient constitutive material model is incorporated to model the size effect in micro-milling. Through a quantitative assessment using the experimental data, the model simulations demonstrate the essential characteristics of the deformation field and microstructural evolution mechanism during cutting. ^ Microstructure and surface integrity is further studied experimentally and numerically for difficult-to-machine materials during laser-assisted machining. One-step laser-assisted machining process is proposed for hardened AISI 4130 steel to replace the hard turning and grinding operations. A heat transfer model is developed to predict the temperature field inside the workpiece of complex geometry undergoing laser-assisted <b>profile</b> <b>turning.</b> Microstructure of 4130 steel workpiece is simulated using the 3 D nose turning option in AdvantEdge FEM by considering both phase transformation kinetics and grain refinement. The surface integrity analysis is experimentally studied by changing heating and operating conditions, viz., average material removal temperature, cutting speed and feed. ...|$|E

50|$|Few {{commercial}} {{feature recognition}} systems are also available. Though feature recognition {{technology can be}} applied for various applications, commercial software have effectively adopted feature recognition technology for recreating the feature tree from imported models so that even the imported models can be edited {{as if it were}} a native solid model. Major 3D CAD modelers have Feature Recognition to convert imported 3-D models into native feature based models. CAM software and design for manufacturing software are also built using this feature recognition technology. Few CAD/CAM software have used commercially available third-party feature recognition library, which recognizes various features from 3-D B-Rep models. Separate libraries are available for Design, Manufacturing and Sheet metal applications. Design feature recognition library can identify features such as holes of various types, split holes, hole-chains, fillets, chamfers, cut extrudes, boss extrudes, drafted extrudes, revolved cuts, revolved bosses, ribs, drafts, lofts and sweeps are identified. Manufacturing feature recognition library provides recognition of manufacturing features such as simple holes, tapered holes, counter-bore holes, counter-sunk holes, counter-drilled holes, hole-chains, hole patterns such as linear, rectangular and circular patterns, fillets, chamfers, blind pockets, through pockets, drafted pockets, filleted and chamfered pockets, simple slots, drafted slots, filleted and chamfered slots, islands in pockets and slots, machinable volumes, machinable slabs, multiple intersecting features, axi-symmetric features such as external <b>turned</b> <b>profiles,</b> internal <b>turned</b> <b>profiles,</b> <b>turned</b> grooves such as vee and dovetail grooves, and mill-turn features such as slots and pocket in <b>turned</b> <b>profiles.</b> Sheet metal feature recognition library extracts features from a sheet metal perspective.

The pressure profile p in the L-mode may be fitted by quasi-linear function: p 0 - 1 dp/dρ ~ const = k = 1. 3 +/- 0. 1. To describe the pressure self-consistency we use the variation procedure, previously used for tokamaks. We consider the variation problem to minimize the energy functional W under the constraint that the total plasma current J is a constant. As a result, we obtained the equations for canonical equilibrium and corresponding pressure profiles in L- and H-modes with low, moderate and high magnetic shear. Maximal slopes of these profiles are close to maximal slopes of experimental pressure profiles observed in TJ-II. 1...|$|R
