50|$|JDP2 {{shows the}} gene {{amplification}} of {{head and neck}} squamous-cell carcinoma.

50|$|Trilateral {{retinoblastoma}} (TRb) is {{a malignant}} midline primitive neuroectodermal tumor occurring {{in patients with}} inherited uni- or bilateral retinoblastoma. In most cases trilateral retinoblastoma presents itself as pineoblastoma (pineal TRb). In about a fourth of the cases the tumor develops in another intracranial region, most commonly supra- or parasellar (non-pineal TRb), but there are reported cases with non-pineal TRb in the 3rd ventricle. In most cases pineal TRb is diagnosed {{before the age of}} 5, but after the diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Non-pineal TRb, however, is often diagnosed simultaneous with retinoblastoma. <b>Prognosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with trilateral retinoblastoma is dismal, only a few patients have survived more than 5 years after diagnosis; all survivors were diagnosed with small tumors in a subclinical stage.

40|$|Conclusion: Extensive bone erosion {{correlated}} with a worse <b>prognosis</b> <b>of</b> the {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) {{of the temporal bone}} but extensive soft tissue involvement did not correlate with prognosis in this study. Resectability of the tumor seems to be major prognostic factor of temporal bone SCC. Objective: Prognostic factors for SCC of the temporal bone were evaluated regarding initial clinical symptoms and radiographic imaging. Patients and methods: Clinical symptoms <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> with primary SCC of the external auditory canal (EAC) or middle ear (ME) were reviewed based on medical records. Correlation of clinical symptoms and cancer severity staging using the modified Pittsburgh classification was analyzed, along with disease-specific survival (DSS). Results: Sixteen patients with primary SCC of the EAC (n= 13) or ME (n= 3) were included in the study population. DSS was not influenced by whether a hearing disturbance or otalgia was noted at the first medical examination. Extended bone involvement identified with imaging studies significantly {{correlated with}} worse prognosis (p< 0. 05). <b>Prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> without extensive bone erosion were good, and extensive (â‰¥ 0. 5 cm) soft tissue involvement did not correlate with prognosis in this study. <b>Prognoses</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with insufficient bone resection or no surgery were significantly poor (p< 0. 01) ...|$|R
