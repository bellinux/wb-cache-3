5|$|Credit Suisse {{has been}} {{recognized}} as the world's best private bank by Euromoneys Global Private Banking Survey and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors. In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland. As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting. The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues. Credit Suisse {{has been recognized}} by the Asset Triple A Awards. In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> by Institutional Investor.|$|E

25|$|Prime brokers are broker-dealers {{which offer}} custody and other {{services}} to hedge funds. Prime brokerage has generally been considered as more risky than traditional custody, primarily because hedge funds have been viewed as more risky than institutional investors. Moreover, in the US a hedge fund may execute trades through any number of broker-dealers. But in the settlement process, those trades become the trades of the <b>prime</b> <b>broker,</b> as though the hedge fund had executed the trades only through that broker. The risk of the hedge fund's inability to settle those trades becomes that of the <b>prime</b> <b>broker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Through the 1980s and 1990s, prime {{brokerage}} was largely an equities-based product, although various <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> did supplement their core equities capabilities with basic bond clearing and custody. In addition, <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> supplemented their operational function by providing portfolio reporting; initially by messenger, then by fax and today over the web. Over the years, <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> have expanded their product and service offerings {{to include some}} or all of the full range of fixed income and derivative products, as well as foreign exchange and futures products.|$|R

40|$|Hedge fund {{defaults}} {{can cause}} large, disorderly liquidations in financial markets. I model {{the dynamics of}} such liquidations as a continuous-time trading game, in which balance-sheet constrained <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> unwind illiquid collateral positions. I show that: (i) the equilibrium price of the collateral asset overshoots during liquidation when the <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> are sufficiently balance-sheet constrained; (ii) spreading a collateral position across multiple <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> alleviates balance sheet constraints, but can cause inefficient ‘racing to the market’, potentially reducing expected liquidation proceeds; (iii) <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> should take into account a hedge fund’s creditor structure and their own balance sheet constraints when setting margins to manage counterparty risk; (iv) the model pins down the block price and expected profit at which a ‘deep pocket’ buyer can purchase the entire collateral position...|$|R
25|$|In December 2010, {{all but two}} of the <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> {{defendants}} {{settled out}} of court with Overstock for $4.4million. That same month, the company filed a motion seeking to amend its lawsuit against the remaining defendants—Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch—to include claims of RICO violations. The enhanced claims were based on evidence gained through discovery in the case.|$|E
25|$|Prime brokers clear trades, {{and provide}} {{leverage}} and short-term financing. They are usually divisions of large investment banks. The <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> {{acts as a}} counterparty to derivative contracts, and lends securities for particular investment strategies, such as long/short equities and convertible bond arbitrage. It can provide custodial services for the fund's assets, and execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager.|$|E
2500|$|Were investors able {{either to}} buy short naked (without {{borrowing}} money to pay), or sell short naked (without borrowing securities to deliver), such practices could easily lead to market manipulation of stock prices: since buyers or sellers {{would not have}} the restraint of providing cash or securities, they could conceivably have unlimited buys or sells, which would drive prices up or down. Naked short buying is not a problem because custodians and prime brokers have their own finances from which to lend money to their clients in order to settle the trades. Naked short selling can be a problem. It occurs when a <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> is unable to borrow the stock simply because there is none available for that purpose. Hedge funds are expected to find sources of stock which can be borrowed before executing short sell orders. If they fail to do so, and their <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> cannot borrow for them, then the settlement of such trades cannot take place on the settlement date. Whether such a [...] "fail" [...] is due to poor co-ordination among the various parties (hedge fund, lending entity and <b>prime</b> <b>broker)</b> or to a naked short sale is impossible to determine. In the US the SEC effectively ended such instances by making the cost of a failed short sell too expensive for the hedge fund to risk. If on the morning the short sell is scheduled to settle the <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> cannot deliver the securities to the executing broker, then the latter is obligated to buy-in the shares (in effect, making the delivery). The buy-in occurs at the then prevailing market price. This may be much higher than the price at which the hedge fund first sold the securities, resulting in a potentially substantial loss to the hedge fund.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "prime" [...] in {{the term}} {{originally}} {{referred to a}} hedge fund having one broker-dealer for its custody and borrowing purposes. With the events of 2008, most large hedge funds have diversified their holdings among several <b>prime</b> <b>brokers</b> {{in an effort to}} limit their risks of a <b>prime</b> <b>broker's</b> failure, such as with Lehman Brothers Europe in 2008.|$|R

2500|$|Where {{shares have}} been shorted {{and the company}} that issues the shares {{distributes}} a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the holder of record and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a margin account with a <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> and {{is unlikely to be}} aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend. [...] The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be short the dividend.|$|E
2500|$|Securities market {{participants}} in the United States include corporations and governments issuing securities, persons and corporations buying and selling a security, the broker-dealers and exchanges which facilitate such trading, banks which safe keep assets, and regulators who monitor the markets' activities. [...] Investors buy and sell through broker-dealers and have their assets retained by either their executing broker-dealer, [...] a custodian bank or a <b>prime</b> <b>broker.</b> These transactions {{take place in the}} environment of equity and equity options exchanges, regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or derivative exchanges, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). For transactions involving stocks and bonds, transfer agents assure that the ownership in each transaction is properly assigned to and held on behalf of each investor.|$|E
2500|$|Short selling {{is a form}} of {{speculation}} that allows a trader to take a [...] "negative position" [...] in a stock of a company. [...] Such a trader first [...] "borrows" [...] shares of that stock from their owner (the lender), typically via a bank or a <b>prime</b> <b>broker</b> under the condition that he will return it on demand. Next, the trader sells the borrowed shares and delivers them to the buyer who becomes their new owner. [...] The buyer is typically unaware that the shares have been sold short: his transaction with the trader proceeds just as if the trader owned rather than borrowed the shares. Some time later, the trader closes his short position by purchasing the same number of shares in the market and returning them to the lender.|$|E

50|$|Prime {{brokerage}} is {{the generic}} {{name for a}} bundled package of services offered by investment banks and securities firms to hedge funds which need the ability to borrow securities and cash {{in order to be}} able to invest on a netted basis and achieve an absolute return.
