40|$|Nutrient {{dynamics}} of two sub-types of peat swamp forest, mixed swamp forest and low <b>pole</b> <b>forest,</b> {{in the upper}} catchment of the Sebangau River in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia were studied. Three permanent study plots, 50 x 50 m, were established in each forest sub-type to facilitate collection of throughfall, stemflow, litterfall, decomposition, above ground and below ground biomass, peat and water samples. Graphical presentation, Wilm's method, and analysis of variance were carried out for both sub-types of forest in order to analyse data to detect any significant differences. Rainfall is slightly acid (pH 5. 96 + 0. 35) with a predominance of NH 4 -N, Ca and K. Throughfall and stemflow are enriched in most elements analysed compared to rainfall and the pH values are lower. Throughfall pH is 4. 76 ± 0. 33 in mixed swamp forest and 4. 37 ± 0. 33 in low <b>pole</b> <b>forest.</b> Stemflow pH is 4. 03 ± 0. 19 in mixed swamp forest and 3. 57 ± 0. 11 in low <b>pole</b> <b>forest.</b> Greater litter production was obtained in mixed swamp forest (8, 411 kg ha- 1 yr- 1) than in low <b>pole</b> <b>forest</b> (6, 534 kg ha- 1 yr- 1). Dry weight of the different fractions of litterfall (leaves, branches, reproductive parts and other debris) for MSF and LPF were 6216, 1246, 460 and 489 kg ha- 1 and 4864, 1251, 169 and 251 kg ha- 1, respectively. Decomposition rates (k) in the MSF and LPF are 0. 396 yr- 1 and 0. 285 yr- 1 respectively. Above ground biomass in MSF and LPF are 313, 899 and 252, 547 kg ha- 1 respectively, while below ground (root biomass) is 26, 533 and 14, 382 kg ha respectively. Nitrogen is the predominant nutrient in peat soil at 50 cm depth in both MSF and LPF, while manganese is the lowest. Calcium is the element in greatest amount in water run off in MSF and LPF at 8, 15 and 7. 15 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 respectively, while manganese was the lowest at 0. 01 and 0. 02 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively. Nutrient inputs were higher than nutrient losses during the 1 -year study period with the greatest nutrient gain for calcium while manganese was the lowest in both sub-types of forest. Moreover, {{the results of this}} study highlight that nutrient concentrations in peat soils are low and the substrates are acidic. These factors are likely to be strongly limiting to agricultural development, including plantations of estate crops and trees. Under such conditions the maintenance of intact forest for natural ecosystem services (e. g. carbon storage, watershed, biodiversity maintenance, timber production in certain time period) is likely to be a far wiser land use from a long-term perspective.

40|$|Abstract The {{peatland}} pole {{forests of}} the Pastaza-Marañón Foreland Basin (PMFB), Peru, are the most carbon-dense ecosystems known in Amazonia once below ground carbon stores are taken into account. Here we present the first multiproxy palaeoenvironmental record including pollen data from one of these peatlands, San Jorge in northern Peru, supported by an age model based on radiocarbon and 210 Pb dating. The pollen data indicate that vegetation changes during the early phases of peat initiation resulted from autogenic succession in combination with fluvial influence. The overall pattern of vegetation change is not straightforward: the record does not reflect a process of unidirectional, progressive terrestrialization, but includes a reversal in the succession and vegetation transitions, which omit predicted successional phases. This complexity {{is similar to that}} seen in the only other existing pollen record from a PMFB peatland, at Quistococha, but contrasts with peat records from Panama and Southeast Asia where successional patterning appears more predictable. Our dating results provide the first evidence from a PMFB peatland that peat accumulation may have been discontinuous, with evidence for reduced rates of peat accumulation, or a possible hiatus, around 1300 – 400 cal yr BP. An ecological shift from open lake to palm swamp occurs at this time, possibly driven by climatic change. The pollen data indicate that the present <b>pole</b> <b>forest</b> vegetation at San Jorge began to assemble c. 200 – 150 cal yr BP. Given this young age, {{it is likely that the}} <b>pole</b> <b>forest</b> at this site remains in a state of transition...|$|E

40|$|Western Amazonia {{is known}} to harbour some of Earth's most diverse forests, but {{previous}} floristic analyses have excluded peatland forests which are extensive in northern Peru and {{are among the most}} environmentally extreme ecosystems in the lowland tropics. Understanding patterns of tree species diversity in these ecosystems is important both for quantifying beta-diversity in this region, and for understanding determinants of diversity more generally in tropical forests. Here we explore patterns of tree diversity and composition in two peatland forest types – palm swamps and peatland <b>pole</b> <b>forests</b> – using 26 forest plots distributed over a large area of northern Peru. We place our results in a regional context by making comparisons with three other major forest types: terra firme forests (29 plots), white-sand forests (23 plots) and seasonally-flooded forests (11 plots). Peatland forests had extremely low (within-plot) alpha-diversity compared with the other forest types that were sampled. In particular, peatland <b>pole</b> <b>forests</b> had the lowest levels of tree diversity yet recorded in Amazonia (20 species per 500 stems, Fisher's alpha 4. 57). However, peatland <b>pole</b> <b>forests</b> and palm swamps were compositionally different from each other as well as from other forest types in the region. Few species appeared to be peatland endemics. Instead, peatland forests were largely characterised by a distinctive combination of generalist species and species previously thought to be specialists of other habitats, especially white-sand forests. We suggest that the transient nature and extreme environmental conditions of Amazonian peatland ecosystems have shaped their current patterns of tree composition and diversity. Despite their low alpha-diversity, the unique combination of species found in tree communities in Amazonian peatlands augment regional beta-diversity. This contribution, alongside their extremely high carbon storage capacity and lack of protection at national level, strengthens their status as a conservation priority...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} the density and {{population}} size of Bornean orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus) {{was carried out in}} 1995 and 1996 in an area of peat swamp forest in the Sungai (River) Sebangau catchment, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Densities were calculated for four forest sub-types by counts of orang-utan sleeping platforms (nests) along line transects. Densities were found to be highest in the tall interior and mixed swamp forest sub-types. Low <b>pole</b> <b>forest</b> supported the lowest density. Habitat disturbance caused by log-ging was shown to affect orang-utan density within mixed swamp forest. The orang-utan population for a larger peat covered landscape unit (9200 km 2), including the Sebangau catchment, was estimated to be between 5671 (955) and 8951 (1509) indi-viduals, based upon the area of each forest type, the level of disturbance in each area and corrected to prevent overestimates. This study identifies the presence of a very large, self-sustaining orang-utan population in this region and emphasises the urgent requirement for greater protection of Kalimantan’s peat swamp forests in the light of recent and rapid habitat degradation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present {{experiences}} of a transferability study on single tree delineation by regionspecific segmentation of air-borne laser scanning (ALS) data with varying point density. Encouraged by promising results of preceding studies on high-density ALS data (Tiede et al., 2006, Tiede & Hoffmann, 2006) we assessed the transferability to an area, in which (1) lower density ALS data is available obtained {{by a different}} flight campaign; (2) the generation of a normalised crown model (nCM) is quite influenced by rough terrain; and (3) optical data (FCIR aerial photographs) differs from ALS data in terms of resolution and time of acquisition. Region-specific segmentation means utilising a-priori knowledge of the respective scale domain of the envisaged target features, while finally representing the scene content in a spatially contiguous one-levelrepresentation (OLR). In total 2, 344 single trees taller than 5 m were detected, for almost all of which a tree crown was delineated, even in dense <b>pole</b> <b>forest.</b> That means an average overestimation of 23 % as compared to visual interpretation, mainly due to shady conditions of the aerial photographs.

40|$|Generation {{of virtual}} poles, {{based on the}} {{statistical}} distribution of selected visual and physical properties, and the estimation of their mechanical properties are of great help for predicting {{the quality of the}} roundwood that a forest stand can provide. With this objective in mind, an algorithm, SIMPOLE (SIMulator of POLEs), was developed. This algorithm allows the generation of pole’s geometry, as well as the mechanical properties of clear wood and the distribution of knots along its length. This generation is made through statistical distributions. The generated poles are simulated, either according to standard EN 14251 or according to EN 14229, for testing with simple supported beam conditions or with cantilever beam conditions, respectively. The algorithm outputs are: the bending strength, the modulus of elasticity, the location, and cause of failure. The algorithm was calibrated with a sample of 56 maritime pine utility poles and validated with another sample of 57 small diameter maritime pine poles. The results for the validation sample show: for bending strength, a mean error of 16. 9 %, and for modulus of elasticity, a mean error of 17. 2 %. Based on these results, the algorithm shows potential to estimate mechanical characteristics of small diameter <b>poles</b> from a <b>forest...</b>|$|R

The results show that the location of failure in 41 out of 50 pole tested as simple cantilever occur near pole tip, where the pole diameter were between 1. 11 to 1. 40 times pole diameter where the load is applied. In the remaining 9 poles, the maximum fiber stress occur around the ground line. The results also show that wood density had no significant effect on pole strength. This is in contrast with that commonly obtained in a laboratory test, in which strength is generally related to wood density. Using pole circumference data obtained in the field, an attempt was made to establish equation which describes pole height - circumference relationship for some selected species. Two forms of equations were tried, namely: Y = AXB and Y = A + BX. The exponential form turned out to be of a better fit.

The {{aim of this}} paper was to study the carbon cycle over different age classes of two managed forests in the Italian Alps through direct measurements and modelling. For this purpose, ecosystem carbon dynamics of a beech forest (Fagus sylvatica L.) and of a spruce forest (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were investigated using a chronosequence approach. In both forests, five forest development stages were identified (thicket, <b>pole</b> wood, young <b>forest,</b> mature forest and the regeneration phase) with an age spanning from 42 to 163 years for the beech forest and from 35 to 161 years for the spruce forest. Measured total ecosystem carbon stock increased up to 80 - 100 years, with a mean of 232 MgC ha - 1 in the beech forest and of 299 MgC ha - 1 in the spruce forest. Calculated net ecosystem production (NEP) was found to decrease linearly with age and had an average value of 2. 2 and 4. 4 MgC ha - 1 year - 1 for beech and spruce forest, respectively. Model simulations reported an increase in NEP till 50 - 60 years followed by a decrease thereafter. The model also predicted a negative NEP for a short period (8 - 11 years) after the seed cut. Aboveground biomass was the main driver of carbon accumulation while soil carbon was not significantly influenced by both age and management system. Moreover, measured data and model showed that the applied shelterwood system allowed for a rapid recovery of the ecosystem after the disturbance (i. e. seed cut), bringing back forest to act as C sink in few years. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

Ground nests suffered ca. 2. 5 times higher losses than nests on poles. In Pinega, predation did not differ between the two nest types. The difference between the two areas was probably due to different predator guilds:mammalian generalist predators, such as theRed Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Badger (Meles meles), were common in Varaldskogen but scarce or absent in Pinega.

40|$|Several {{species of}} Araucaria and Agathis (Araucariaceae) occur as canopy emergents in rain {{forests of the}} western pacific region, often {{representing}} major components of total stand biomass. New data from permanent forest plots (and other published work) for three species (Araucaria hunsteinii from New Guinea, A. laubenfelsii from New Caledonia, and Agathis australis from New Zealand) are {{used to test the}} validity of the temporal stand replacement model proposed by Ogden (1985) and Ogden and Stewart (1995) to explain the structural and compositional properties of New Zealand rain forests containing the conifer Agathis australis.

Forest stands representing putative stages in the model were examined for changes through time in species recruitment, growth and survivorship, and stand richness, density and basal area. Support for the model was found on the basis of: 1. Evidence for a phase of massive conifer recruitment following landscape-scale disturbances (e. g. by fire at the Huapai site, New Zealand for Agathis australis); 2. Increasing species richness of angiosperm trees in the <b>pole</b> stage of <b>forest</b> stand development (i. e. as the initial cohort of conifers reach tree size; > 10 cm DBH); 3. A high turnover rate for angiosperms (> 100 yr) in the pole stage, but similar turnover rates for both components (50 - 100 yr) as forests enter the mature to senescent phase for the initial conifer cohort; 4. Very low rates of recruitment for conifers within mature stands, and projected forest compositions which show increasing dominance by angiosperm tree species; 5. A low probability of conifer recruitment in large canopy gaps created by conifer tree falls during the initial cohort senescent phase, which could produce a second generation low density stand in the absence of landscape scale disturbance; 6. Evidence that each of the three species examined required open canopy conditions (canopy openness > 10 %) for successful recruitment. The evidence presented here supports the temporal stand replacement model, but more long-term supporting data are needed, especially for the phase immediately following landscape level disturbance...|$|R
