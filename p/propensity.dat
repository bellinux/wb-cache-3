40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{learning}} procedures when counterfactuals (payoffs of not chosen actions) are not observed. The decision maker reasons in two steps: First, she updates her <b>propensities</b> for choosing each action after every payoff experience, where <b>propensities</b> {{can be interpreted}} as preferences. Then, she transforms these <b>propensities</b> into choice probabilities. We introduce a set of axioms on how <b>propensities</b> are updated and on how these <b>propensities</b> are translated into choices and study the decision marker's behavior when such axioms are in place. Our characterization includes the linear reinforcement learning rule from Roth and Erev (1995) ...|$|R

5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic <b>propensity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Biological {{networks}} are often modeled by random graphs. A better modeling vehicle is a multigraph where {{each pair of}} nodes is connected by a Poisson number of edges. In the current model, {{the mean number of}} edges equals the product of two <b>propensities,</b> one for each node. In this context it is possible to construct a simple and effective algorithm for rapid maximum likelihood estimation of all <b>propensities.</b> Given estimated <b>propensities,</b> it is then possible to test statistically for functionally connected nodes that show an excess of observed edges over expected edges. The model extends readily to directed multigraphs. Here, <b>propensities</b> are replaced by outgoing and incoming <b>propensities...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} trade <b>propensities</b> and foreign ownership shares in Indonesian manufacturing in 1992 and 1994. Foreign plants had relatively high trade <b>propensities,</b> and plants with high foreign ownership shares had the highest export <b>propensities.</b> Differences in import <b>propensities</b> among foreign ownership groups were relatively small. It might be argued that trade <b>propensities</b> determine foreign ownership shares in Indonesia, which historically waives foreign ownership restrictions for firms that export much of their output. However, this paper argues that causation runs from foreign ownership shares to trade <b>propensities,</b> because multinational firms have strong incentives to restrict access by uncontrolled affiliates to their international marketing networks, and because the relationship persists even when the effects of policy distortions are accounted for. Correspondingly, ownership restrictions that discriminate among foreign ownership groups are likely to reduce the exports of foreign multinational affiliates, but to have a much weaker effect on imports. ...|$|R
40|$|Using unique {{real estate}} data {{that allows for}} accurately-measured capital gains, we examine whether sell <b>propensities</b> and selling prices depend on an owner 2 ̆ 7 s capital gain. We find that sell <b>propensities</b> are higher and selling prices are lower for {{properties}} with a capital gain, with the sell <b>propensities</b> experiencing a discontinuity at a zero capital gain. Consistent with realization utility (Barberis and Xiong, 2012), larger capital gains are associated with higher sell <b>propensities</b> and lower selling prices. Overall, our evidence provides empirical support for realization utility, while alternative explanations such as financing constraints and informed trading cannot explain our findings...|$|R

5|$|Ripken's power, {{which led}} to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th place in career doubles, had consequences. His <b>propensity</b> to drive the ball often led to his grounders getting to fielders quickly for {{tailor-made}} double-play balls. In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who had grounded into the most double plays in his career. Ripken is third on the fielding side for double plays by a shortstop (1565, behind Omar Vizquel's 1734 and Ozzie Smith's 1590).|$|E
40|$|Trifluoroethanol (TFE) {{is often}} used to {{increase}} the helicity of peptides to make them usable as models of helices in proteins. We have measured helix <b>propensities</b> for all 20 amino acids in water and two concentrations of trifluoroethanol, 15 and 40 % (v/v) using, as a model system, a peptide derived from the sequence of the alpha-helix of ribonuclease T 1. There are three main conclusions from our studies. (1) TFE alters electrostatic interactions in the ribonuclease T 1 helical peptide such that the dependence of the helical content on pH is lost in 40 % TFE. (2) Helix <b>propensities</b> measured in 15 % TFE correlate well with <b>propensities</b> measured in water, however, the correlation with <b>propensities</b> measured in 40 % TFE is significantly worse. (3) <b>Propensities</b> measured in alanine-based peptides and the ribonuclease T 1 peptide in TFE show very poor agreement, revealing that TFE greatly increases the effect of sequence context...|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} of a polypeptide chain to form alpha-helical or beta-strand secondary structure depends upon local and nonlocal effects. Local effects reflect the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> of the amino acid residues for particular secondary structures, while nonlocal effects reflect the {{positioning of the}} individual residues {{in the context of}} the entire amino acid sequence. In particular, the periodicity of polar and nonpolar residues specifies whether a given sequence is consistent with amphiphilic alpha-helices or beta-strands. The importance of intrinsic <b>propensities</b> was compared to that of polar/nonpolar periodicity by a direct competition. Synthetic peptides were designed using residues with intrinsic <b>propensities</b> that favored one or the other type of secondary structure. The polar/nonpolar periodicities of the peptides were designed either to be consistent with the secondary structure favored by the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> of the component residues or in other cases to oppose these intrinsic <b>propensities.</b> Characterization of the synthetic peptides demonstrated that in all cases the observed secondary structure correlates with the periodicity of the peptide sequence [...] even when this secondary structure differs from that predicted from the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> of the component amino acids. The observed secondary structures are concentration dependent, indicating that oligomerization of the amphiphilic peptides is responsible for the observed secondary structures. Thus, for self-assembling oligomeric peptides, the polar/nonpolar periodicity can overwhelm the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> of the amino acid residues and serves as the major determinant of peptide secondary structure...|$|R

5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and <b>propensity</b> to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The <b>propensity</b> of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E

Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis.

5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual <b>propensity</b> to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
40|$|The helix {{propagation}} and N-cap <b>propensities</b> of {{the amino}} acids have been measured in alanine-based peptides in 40 volume percent trifluoroethanol (40 % TFE) {{to determine if}} this helix-stabilizing solvent uniformly affects all amino acids. The <b>propensities</b> in 40 % TFE are compared with revised values of the helix parameters of alanine-based peptides in water. Revision of the <b>propensities</b> in water {{is the result of}} redefining the capping statistical weights and evaluating the helix nucleation constant with N-capping explicitly included in the helix-coil model. The propagation <b>propensities</b> of all amino acids increase in 40 % TFE relative to water, but the increases are highly variable. In water, all beta-branched and beta-substituted amino acids are helix breakers. In 40 % TFE, the propagation <b>propensities</b> of the nonpolar amino acids increase greatly, leaving charged and neutral polar, beta-substituted amino acids as helix breakers. Glycine and proline are strong helix breakers in both solvents. Free energy differences for helix propagation (delta delta G) between alanine and other nonpolar amino acids are twice as large in water as predicted from side-chain conformational entropies, but delta delta G values in 40 % TFE are close to those predicted from side-chain entropies. This dependence of delta delta G on the solvent points to a specific role of water in determining the relative helix <b>propensities</b> of the nonpolar amino acids. The N-cap <b>propensities</b> converge toward a common value in 40 % TFE, suggesting that differential solvation by water contributes to the diversity of N-cap values shown by the amino acids...|$|R
