40|$|In 2008, we sampled {{migrating}} juvenile Pacific salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags using {{a surface}} <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> {{in the upper}} Columbia River estuary (rkm 61 - 83). The cod-end of the trawl was replaced with a cylindrical PIT-tag detection antenna with an 86 -cm-diameter fish-passage opening and two detection coils connected in series. The <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> was 105 m long with a 91. 5 -m opening between the wings and a sample depth of 4. 9 m. Also during 2008, we finalized {{the development of a}} prototype 'matrix' antenna, which was larger than previous antennas by a considerable magnitude. The matrix antenna consisted of 6 coils: a 3 -coil front component and a 3 -coil rear component, which were separated by 1. 5 -m of net mesh. The fish-passage opening was 2. 5 m wide by 3. 0 m tall and was attached to a standard-size <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> net. Intermittent sampling with a single crew began on 7 March and targeted yearling Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss. Daily sampling using two crews began on 30 April and continued through 14 June; during this period we detected 2. 7 % of all juvenile salmonids previously detected at Bonneville Dam [...] a measure of sample efficiency. Sampling with a single crew continued through 20 August and targeted subyearling Chinook salmon. We detected 7, 397 yearling Chinook salmon, 2, 735 subyearling Chinook salmon, 291 coho salmon O. kisutch, 5, 950 steelhead, and 122 sockeye salmon O. nerka in the upper estuary. We deployed the matrix antenna system and the older, cylindrical antenna system (86 -cm-diameter fish-passage opening) simultaneously in mid-May 2008 to test matrix detection efficiency. The cylindrical antenna system had been used successfully in 2007 and early 2008. Because distribution of migrating salmonids in the estuary changes rapidly, we felt that a tandem sampling effort between the two systems {{was the only way to}} truly evaluate comparative detection efficiency. We deployed both systems within 1 km of each other during a period of high fish densities on 13, 14, and 15 May. Detections of the matrix system surpassed those of the cylindrical system by 53 % in 14 h of simultaneous sampling (total detections 716 and 339, respectively). We believe that the higher detection rate observed with the matrix system was due to fewer smolts escaping the trawl entrance and to more smolts readily passing through the larger fish-passage opening. After tandem sampling, we continued exclusive use of the matrix system for the remainder of the 2008 juvenile migration season. Mean survival rates from Lower Granite to Bonneville Dam for yearling Chinook salmon and steelhead were 42 % (SE = 3. 7 %) and 46 % (SE = 1. 5 %), respectively.

40|$|The European Commission has {{acknowledged}} {{the value of}} fleet-based management approaches since the 2001 Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In the 2009 Green Paper, this was again recognized as a key area of interest for future development of the CFP, in particular setting the technical basis for the recent Data Collection Framework (DCF), which specifies the standard for national fishery sampling programs within a pan-European context. These policy changes require deeper and up to date knowledge about European fleets and fisheries, thus encouraging Member States to undertake scientific projects {{in order to obtain}} appropriate fleet segmentations classifying their fishing activities within a hierarchical structure. The work presented in this book is the first comprehensive analysis of the Spanish fleets operating in Atlantic European waters, taking into account both European and national management requirements. This has been possible due to the availability of official logbooks, which provide the broadest perspective on the activity of Spanish fleets in the study area. The only exception to this is small scale fisheries, pursued mainly by vessels of less than 10 m of length and, therefore, not subject to the requirement of keeping logbooks. In order to match better European and Spanish fleet classifications, a new level (“Management Unit”) is proposed here, which is placed between “modalidad”, used in the Spanish regulations, and “métier”, as is defined by the recent DCF. Spanish national waters comprise four fishing grounds, two of which are in the European Atlantic. Nine Management Units have been identified in the Northern Spanish fishing ground: bottom otter trawl (OTB 10), bottom <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> (PTB 10), purse seine (PSN 10), set long line (LLS 10), set gillnet targeting hake (GNS 11), set gillnet targeting anglerfish (GNS 12), trolling (LTL 11) and bait-boats (LHP 11) targeting albacore, and hand line targeting mackerel (LHP 12). Two Management Units have been identified in Southern Spanish waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 20) and purse seine (PSN 20). In European waters outside Spain, six Management Units have been identified in non-Iberian waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 50), bottom <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> (PTB 50), set long line (LLS 50) and set gillnet (GNS 50) by vessels of more than 100 GRT, and set long line (LLS 60) and set gillnet (GNS 60) by vessels of less than 100 GRT. Finally, one Management Unit using bottom otter trawl has been found to operate in Portuguese waters (OTB 70). Unluckily, the analyses made on the logbooks of the Spanish fleet using drifting long line could not be used to categorize this fleet due to the geographical limitations of the logbooks available. After detailed analyses and categorization of the Management Units, the results obtained were used in an exercise to test the usefulness and feasibility of using logbook information to answer some DCF requirements. This revealed that logbooks are an essential tool to deal with bioeconomic challenges posed by the new CFP. Versión del edito...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of inshore single boat otter trawling from Newlyn, Looe, Plymouth and Salcombe and pair boat demersal trawling from Looc and Plymouth on the benthic environment off the SW peninsula of the UK between 1998 and 2000. Fish and shellfish species (54 and 11 species respectively) were measured at sea and the non-fish material (124 species) was analysed later. Overall 79. 8 % {{of the sample was}} landed fish and shellfish, 15. 8 % was discarded fishes and 4. 4 % was invertebrates and other material (by weight). Related information about the substrate and tide were generated from British Geological Survey data and a computer simulation of the maximum mean tidal strength. In agreement with the different abiotic regime, the dominant fishes were different in Newlyn and the other ports. According only to port, the Looe and Plymouth samples were not significantly different, either as full samples or for their fish and non-fish components. The Salcombe samples were not significantly different to those from Looc or Plymouth for the non-fish part of the sample. Including the type of trawling meant that the greatest similarity was for the non-fish part of the sample although the relative amounts of the components varied. The pair trawling samples contained more landed, less discarded and less non-fish material than their single boat equivalents. <b>Pair</b> <b>trawl</b> samples also contained fewer examples of large invertebrate species. Several within and between-species relationships were explored to assess the wider interpretation of the fish community data. This examined size of Raja spp., several predator-prey relationships and the utility of Marlhasterias glacialis as an indicator of fishing disturbance. Disturbance as measured by Abundance Biomass Comparison was similar whether according to the non-fish or full sample, and suggested that the whole region was relatively undisturbed (with Newlyn apparently the most impacted area). Analysis of the relative contribution of selected groups to taxonomic diversity showed the derived conservation priorities for 'orders' of fishes were Elasmobranches > Pleuronectiformes > Gadiformes. In general, the fact of 'losing' orders of fishes was more important for single rather than <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> samples, which suggests that single boat samples were collected from structurally more complex areas supporting a wider taxonomic diversity. The analysis of groups for conservation priority was also carried into the invertebrates with echinoderms being highly influential for Newlyn. Taxonomic diversity (A+ and A) was also proposed as an addition to the definition of 'Good Environmental Status' according to the proposed EU Marine Strategy Directive. When examining the abiotic and biotic data sets, the fish species bore the closest similarity to the abiotic data suggesting that much of the study area was dominated by similar invertebrate species that tended to be scavengers and in most analyses the positive influence of the voluntary Inshore Potting Agreement management regime was evident. In a novel analysis, there was broad agreement between the data and literature sources for the location of the fishes in relation to the substrates and for eight of the most commonly occurring species it was possible to be more precise in their substrate preferences than suggested from the literature. The landed fish part of the sample was shown to be a statistically good approximation of the landed part of the haul (for which the commercial data was known) in > 95 % of the hauls. Finally, data on the commercial landings for each port show that the boats sampled in this study were representative of these ports. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

We concluded that low water transparency over-ruled the light sensitivity of European smelt, and caused European smelt to stay higher in the water column...|$|R
40|$|Various plastic {{strips and}} sheets (termed ‘simple {{anterior}} fish excluders’−SAFEs) were po-sitioned across the openings of penaeid trawls in attempts at reducing the unwanted by-catches of small teleosts. Initially, three SAFEs (a single wire without, and with {{small and large}} plastic panels) were compared against a control (no SAFE) on <b>paired</b> beam <b>trawls.</b> All SAFEs maintained targetedMetapenaeus macleayi catches, while the largest plastic SAFE significantly reduced total bycatch by 51 % and the numbers of Pomatomus saltatrix,Mugil cephalus and Herklotsichthys castelnaui by up to 58 %. A redesigned SAFE (‘continuous plastic’) was subsequently tested (against a control) on <b>paired</b> otter <b>trawls,</b> significantly re-ducing total bycatch by 28 % and P. saltatrix and H. castelnaui by up to 42 %. The continu-ous-plastic SAFE also significantly reducedM. macleayi catches by ~ 7 %, but this was explained by ~ 5 % less wing-end spread, and could be simply negated through otter-board refinement. Further work is required to refine the tested SAFEs, and to quantify species-specific escape mechanisms. Nevertheless, the SAFE concept might represent an effective approach for improving penaeid-trawl selectivity...|$|R
