5|$|Coke {{used his}} role in Parliament as a leading {{opposition}} MP to attack patents, a system he had already criticised as a judge. Historically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents {{as a form of}} economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law concerning patents. To boost England's economy, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering letters of protection that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as a passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. This process continued for three centuries, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch because of the potential for raising revenue; a <b>patentee</b> was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest {{as a result of the}} patent was normally directed at the <b>patentee,</b> not the monarch.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} Norwegian 19 th century <b>patentees.</b> A {{special focus}} is on the affiliation or relationship of the <b>patentees</b> to the manufacturing industries, business and the wider economy. A main question is whether the inventors were what might be called ‘amateurs’ working independently, or ‘professionals’ working closer to firms or institutions. A main finding is that even the individual <b>patentees,</b> that comprised the majority of all <b>patentees,</b> had strong associations with industry, and the distinction between ‘professionals’ and ‘amateurs’ is not all that useful...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the determination of damages for patent infringement in China. Based on empirical data, Chinese judicial precedence and judicial interpretations, this article depicts how the size of damages for patent infringement is determined through three methods (the <b>patentee’s</b> actual loss, the infringer’s profits and reasonable royalties) and statutory damages in China. In particular, it makes a comparison between Chinese and German approaches. The comparison finds that Chinese courts have insisted on unrealistic standards of proof {{on the part of}} <b>patentees</b> for entitlement to the three methods. Therefore, this has relegated the <b>patentees</b> to statutory damages that are not designed to compensate their losses in most patent infringement trials. This article suggests easing the burdens of proof for the <b>patentees</b> under the three methods while strictly observing the restriction on recourse to statutory damages...|$|R
25|$|Earlier, in Brulotte v. Thys Co. , the Supreme Court {{held that}} it was patent misuse if, without more, a <b>patentee</b> charged {{royalties}} that extended beyond the statutory term of the patent. In National Lockwasher Co. v. George K. Garrett Co., the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a <b>patentee</b> misused its patent by requiring licensees to agree not to deal in the technology of the patentee’s competitors. Thus, in these cases, among many others, the Supreme Court and other federal courts had found misuse in cases not involving price fixing or tie-ins, and had not required any rule-of-reason or relevant-market analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for granting patents, requirements {{placed on the}} <b>patentee,</b> {{and the extent of}} the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a <b>patentee</b> in most countries is the right to prevent others, or at least to try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without permission.|$|E
25|$|Patent {{infringement}} {{occurs when}} a third party, without authorization from the <b>patentee,</b> makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the US.|$|E
50|$|Rich now meddled with benefit performances: the {{agreements}} {{of the actors}} were only verbal, and were disregarded by the <b>patentees,</b> who refused any actor a benefit until {{he or she had}} signed a paper signifying voluntary acceptance of the condition of paying one-third to the <b>patentees.</b> The actors applied to the Lord Chamberlain for redress, and the <b>patentees</b> were directed to satisfy their claims. The <b>patentees</b> demurred, and the theatre was reduced to silence (6 June 1709), no performances being allowed. Rich then published an advertisement, claiming Wilks, Betterton, Estcourt, Cibber, John Mills, and Mrs. Oldfield had received nearly £2000. Rich, with other <b>patentees,</b> in a petition to the queen, stated their grievances against the lord chamberlain, who refused them any redress. A second petition was sent by a few of the silenced actors, members of Drury Lane. Wilks, Thomas Dogget, Cibber, and Mrs. Oldfield did not join in the petition; they had formed an agreement to join Swiney at the Haymarket, where they opened with Othello on 15 September 1709.|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} issues that the Court did not address in Quanta. One such omission is the Court’s failure to say anything about the other possible formats that this transaction might have used—such as a sale by a manufacturing licensee with a limitation on its grant, or (alternatively) a sale by the <b>patentee</b> or its licensee with explicit restrictions imposed on the buyer's freedom to dispose of the product. The Court did not explain whether or in what circumstances these other formats would be legally effective.|$|E

This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public. The list of public oral proceedings in opposition before the EPO is available on its web site.

25|$|LM Ericsson {{bought the}} rights to the Centralograph from Gábor Kornél Tolnai and {{accordingly}} they acquired the patent rights from him. The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the <b>patentee,</b> and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or their assignee for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, and may be a product or a process. Patents are a form of intellectual property. Intellectual property (IP) is a legal concept for creations of the mind for which exclusive rights are recognized.|$|E
25|$|Another legal {{difficulty}} connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion {{in some of}} them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a prescription to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the patentees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were {{to use the same}} article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the <b>patentee</b> for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the British Pharmaceutical Codex.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the second line began almost immediately after {{the opening of the}} first. A formal ceremony took place on 23 September 1878 when Miss Bella Winby, the daughter of the <b>patentee</b> of the track system proceeded to raise the first stone with a miniature pick prepared specially for the occasion. The spot selected for this ceremony was in the centre of the road a small distance above St. John's Church, Carrington and exactly opposite the plot of land purchased by the company for the depot and stables. Work moved quickly and on 3 April the works were inspected by the Board of Trade and authorised for opening on Saturday 5 April 1879. The route was via Long Row, Market Street, Parliament Street, Milton Street and Mansfield Road, with a branch along Forest Road. The Carrington route was not connected to the southern route, and it had its own depot and stables between St John’s Church and Watcombe Road. This site was subsequently redeveloped into The Carrington Lido open-air swimming pool (1937–1988), then into a children's playground and, later still, redeveloped into a residential retirement development.|$|E

A <b>patentee</b> was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest as a result of the patent was normally directed at the <b>patentee,</b> not the monarch. Over time, this became more and more problematic: instead of temporary monopolies on specific, imported industries, long-term monopolies came about over common commodities, including salt and starch. These [...] "odious monopolies" [...] led to a showdown between the Crown and Parliament, in which it was agreed, on 28 November 1601, to turn the power to administer patents over to the common law courts; at the same time, Elizabeth revoked a number of the more restrictive and damaging monopolies. One of the monopolies capable of being addressed at the common law was that over playing cards, which was granted to Edward ...|$|E
500|$|From a {{sanitary}} perspective, the pail {{system of}} waste removal was imperfect. [...] Excreta and other general waste were often left above ground for hours, sometimes even {{days at a}} time. [...] In his report on the Goux system used in Salford, the epidemiologist John Netten Radcliffe commented: [...] "In every instance where a pail had been in use over two or three days, the capacity of absorption of the liquid dejections, claimed by the <b>patentee</b> for the absorbent material, had been exceeded; and whenever a pail had been {{four or five days}} a week in use, it was filled to the extent of two thirds or more of its cavity, with liquid dejections, in which the solid excrement was floating." ...|$|E
500|$|Killigrew's {{investment}} in the new playhouse put the two companies on a level as far as technical resources were concerned, but the offerings at the Theatre Royal nevertheless continued {{to be dominated by}} actor-driven [...] "talk" [...] drama, contrasting with William Davenant's baroque spectacles and operas at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Internal power structures were the main reason for this difference: while Davenant skilfully commanded a docile young troupe, Killigrew's authority over his veteran actors was far from absolute. Experienced actors Michael Mohun (who Pepys called [...] "the best actor in the world") and Charles Hart held out for shares and good contracts in the King's Company. Such a division of power between the <b>patentee,</b> Killigrew, and his chief actors led to frequent conflicts that hampered the Theatre Royal as a business venture. Nevertheless, it was mostly at the struggling Theatre Royal, rather than at the efficiently run Lincoln's Inn Fields, that the plays were acted that are classics today. This applies especially to the new form Restoration comedy, dominated in the 1660s by William Wycherley and the Theatre Royal's house dramatist John Dryden. Actors such as Hart and Charles II's mistress Nell Gwyn developed and refined the famous scenes of repartee, banter and flirtation in Dryden's and Wycherley's comedies. With the appearance of actresses {{for the first time at}} Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields in the 1660s, British playwrights wrote parts for outspoken female characters, daring love scenes and provocative breeches roles. In any case, the competition between the King's Company and the Duke's was good for the rebirth and development of English drama.|$|E
