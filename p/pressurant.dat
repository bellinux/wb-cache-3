25|$|ATK {{produces}} Graphite Epoxy Motors (GEM) {{and largest}} composite fairings for the Delta II rocket as a subcontractor for the United Launch Alliance. As of June 2014, ATK has produced 987 solid rocket boosters for Delta II missions. These strap-on boosters, known as GEM-40s, add 434,000 pounds to the Delta II's maximum thrust. The GEM-40s {{can be used}} in groups of three, four, and nine depending on the weight of the payload. The composite structures supplied by ATK increase performance by reducing weight. In addition to composite booster cases for the GEM-40s, ATK produces a 10-foot wide composite payload fairing that covers and protects satellites during launch. ATK also produces the titanium diaphragm propellant tanks and <b>pressurant</b> tank for each Delta II vehicle.|$|E

The cause, currently under investigation, was originally {{believed to be a}} lack of nitrogen <b>pressurant</b> in the fuel tanks: this has now been proven not to be the case. The team is continuing to work the thruster issue before the craft reaches a point where the remaining fuel will not be sufficient to meaningfully alter its course.

40|$|The DLR Bremen {{with the}} Kryo Lab as testing {{facility}} provides {{the service of}} both static and dynamic cryogenic tests with the cryogenic test demonstrator (CTD). These tests {{are part of the}} FLPP 3 program and should be made with liquid nitrogen (LN 2) as testing fluid and both gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) and gaseous helium (GHE) as <b>pressurants.</b> Whereas the former test campaign within WP 31320 [RD 2] estimated the damping and frequency characteristic of the cryogenic liquid the actual test report within WP 31330 deals with static tests of the cryogenic liquid. The aim of these tests is to analyze the filling, draining and stratification behavior of liquid nitrogen with respect to different thermodynamic boundary conditions inside the CTD. Except the initial boiling test all other test cases were performed with a thermally chilled tank. Additionally during all types of tests pressure levels, flow rates of liquid and vapor, wall- and fluid temperatures, liquid fill levels are recorded as well as videos of the CTD (all tests) and the draining line (draining test cases) ...|$|R
40|$|To support {{development}} of a zero-gravity pressure control capability for liquid hydrogen (LH 2), a series of thermodynamic venting system (TVS) tests was conducted in 1996 and 1998 using the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB). These tests were performed with ambient heat leaks = 20 and 50 W for tank fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 %. TVS performance testing revealed that the spray bar was highly effective in providing tank pressure control within a 7 -kPa band (131 - 138 Wa), and complete destratification of the liquid and the ullage was achieved with all test conditions. Seven of the MHTB tests were correlated with the TVS performance analytical model. The tests were selected to encompass the range of tank fill levels, ambient heat leaks, operational modes, and ullage <b>pressurants.</b> The TVS model predicted ullage pressure and temperature and bulk liquid saturation pressure and temperature obtained from the TVS model were compared with the test data. During extended self-pressurization periods, following tank lockup, the model predicted faster pressure rise rates than were measured. However, once the system entered the cyclic mixing/venting operational mode, the modeled and measured data were quite similar...|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} {{systems for}} the long-term storage of cryogens in low gravity space environments, one must consider the effects of thermal stratification on excessive tank pressure that will occur due to environmental heat leakage. During low gravity operations, a Thermodynamic Venting System (TVS) concept is expected to maintain tank pressure without propellant resettling. The TVS consists of a recirculation pump, Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion valve, and a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger combined with a longitudinal spray bar. Using {{a small amount of}} liquid extracted by the pump and passing it though the J-T valve, then through the heat exchanger, the bulk liquid and ullage are cooled, resulting in lower tank pressure. A series of TVS tests were conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using liquid nitrogen as a liquid oxygen simulant. The tests were performed at fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 % with gaseous nitrogen and helium <b>pressurants,</b> and with a tank pressure control band of 7 kPa. A transient one-dimensional model of the TVS is used to analyze the data. The code is comprised of four models for the heat exchanger, the spray manifold and injector tubes, the recirculation pump, and the tank. The TVS model predicted ullage pressure and temperature and bulk liquid saturation pressure and temperature are compared with data. Details of predictions and comparisons with test data regarding pressure rise and collapse rates will be presented in the final paper...|$|R

50|$|On the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz missions, some {{additional}} dry weight was saved {{by removing the}} otherwise empty fuel and oxidizer storage tanks (leaving the partially filled sump tanks), along {{with one of the}} two helium <b>pressurant</b> tanks.This permitted the addition of some extra RCS propellant to allow for use as a backup for the deorbit burn in case of possible SPS failure.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} {{problems}} encountered on the flight. The Service Module engine only worked properly for 80 seconds, {{interrupted by the}} presence of helium <b>pressurant</b> gas in the combustion chamber. Helium was used to pressurize the fuel tanks but should not have been in the combustion chamber. This was caused by a break in an oxidizer line that allowed helium to mix with the oxidizer.|$|E
50|$|Pressure-fed cycle: The {{propellants}} {{are forced}} in from pressurised (relatively heavy) tanks. The heavy tanks {{mean that a}} relatively low pressure is optimal, limiting engine power, but all the fuel is burned, allowing high efficiency.

The fuel and oxidizer tanks were pressurised by a single liquid helium tank containing 1.35 lb. [...] Back flow was prevented {{by a series of}} check valves, and back flow and ullage requirements were resolved by containing the fuel and oxidizer in Teflon bladders which separated the propellants from the helium <b>pressurant.</b>|$|E
50|$|A Pyrotechnic valve is a {{one time}} use {{propulsion}} component {{often used to}} control propellant or <b>pressurant</b> systems on spacecraft. The device is activated by an electric signal, to fire a small explosive charge which in turn shears away a small flange that initially blocked the flow path of the attached tubing. Another version of a pyrotechnic valve remains in an open position until activated. The pressure from the pyrotechnic charge then forces the flange into a weakened part of the attached tube to block the flow path of the tubing.|$|E
