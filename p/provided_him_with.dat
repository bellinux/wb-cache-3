5|$|Contrary to {{previous}} reports that France {{was against the}} invasion, France gave its approval and helped to air-lift the AU troops to the island. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stressed on April 8 that France had not supported Bacar or <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> any protection, {{and that it had}} fully supported African Union intervention.|$|E
5|$|It {{came to the}} Queen's {{attention}} that Frenchman Jean Laborde, who had been shipwrecked off Madagascar in 1832, was knowledgeable {{in the production of}} cannons, muskets and gunpowder. Ranavalona <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the labor and materials to establish factories that met the material needs of her army, thereby ending the kingdom's dependence on Europe for modern weaponry.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} Coffin {{came to realize}} that many of the goods he sold in his {{business}} were produced with slave labor. Through his travels Coffin learned of organizations in Philadelphia and New York City that only sold goods produced with free (non-slave) labor. He began to purchase stock from these organizations and marketed free-labor goods to his fellow abolitionists, though the products <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> little profit.|$|E

5|$|While visiting Ford's Theatre {{around noon}} {{to pick up}} his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> an {{especially}} good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familial to its staff.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{experience}} in the militia, service with the 22nd Massachusetts, and chairmanship of the Military Affairs Committee <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> more practical military knowledge and training than any other Senator. He made use of this experience throughout the war to frame, explain, defend and advocate for legislation on military matters, including enlistment of soldiers and sailors, and organizing and supplying the rapidly expanding Union Army and Union Navy.|$|E
5|$|After the Elhuyar {{brothers}} isolated metallic tungsten in 1783, Chabaneau {{collaborated with}} them in researching platinum. This did not last long, though, as the brothers had been appointed Directors General of Mining, and soon left Spain for South America. King Charles III created a public chair of mineralogy, physics and chemistry for Chabaneau in Madrid and <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a laboratory for his research. The Count d'Aranda secured the government's entire supply of platinum for Chabaneau's laboratory.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of the Foederati, Thomas was based at Amorion, {{the capital of the}} Anatolic Theme. Although junior to the theme's strategos (military governor), his proclamation received widespread support throughout Asia Minor. Within a short time, all the Asian themes supported Thomas, except for the Opsician Theme under the patrician Katakylas, a nephew of Michael II, and the Armeniac Theme, under its strategos, Olbianos. The Thracesian Theme wavered between the two rivals, but finally threw its support behind Thomas. More than two-thirds of the empire's Asian army eventually aligned with Thomas, while the defection of the provincial tax officials <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> much-needed revenue.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, {{the son of}} a musician, Walton was a chorister {{and then}} an {{undergraduate}} at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In {{the late}} Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, {{and only one}} in eight qualified barristers {{was able to make}} a living from the law. While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a relatively substantial income {{on the basis of his}} costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E
5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as they could find the Sun God. She also <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the magical ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} {{from the back of}} the grid due to a number of {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} two years, Khan worked in Mamoola village near Aligarh as a {{labourer}} and locksmith, an experience that <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> firsthand knowledge of the problems and issues of rural communities. In 1947, he took up a teaching position at the Jamia Millia, Delhi, where he worked for three years. In 1950, Khan migrated to Pakistan to teach at Islamia College, Karachi. In the same year, he was invited by the Government of Pakistan to take charge as Principal of Comilla Victoria College in East Pakistan, a position he held until 1958. During this time (1950–58) he also served as President of the East Pakistan Non-Government Teachers' Association.|$|E
5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> librettos.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{his arrival in}} California in March 1868, naturalist John Muir {{set out for the}} Yosemite area, where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher, Pat Delaney. Muir's employment <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the opportunity to study the area's plants, rocks, and animals; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing his observations helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific interest in it. Muir {{was one of the first}} to suggest that Yosemite Valley's major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers, contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur.|$|E

5|$|Johnson helped {{organize}} a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, {{along with his}} friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln. Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to disenfranchise free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|Richard, Edward II's second son, took {{possession}} of Lydford Castle in 1239 as the Earl of Cornwall. Richard took a close {{interest in developing}} the town of Lydford, creating an additional market and introducing a new fair in the 1260s. Around this time, the main tower at Lydford Castle was demolished and rebuilt, probably by Richard, possibly following a serious fire in the building. Richard was a wealthy politician and rebuilding the castle in this way would have <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> an important status symbol in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Indo-Parthian Kingdom, {{located in}} modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan made an {{alliance}} with the Parthian Empire in the 1st century BC. Bivar claims that these two states considered each other political equals. After the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited the court of Vardanes I of Parthia (r. c.40–47AD) in 42AD, Vardanes <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the protection of a caravan as he traveled to Indo-Parthia. When Apollonius reached Indo-Parthia's capital Taxila, his caravan leader read Vardanes' official letter, perhaps written in Parthian, to an Indian official who treated Apollonius with great hospitality.|$|E
