5|$|The {{solar wind}} is quite {{different}} from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the <b>planetary</b> wind is composed of light gases that escape <b>planetary</b> atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the <b>planetary</b> wind can radically change the composition of <b>planetary</b> atmospheres.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{expect that}} the {{discovery}} of Planet Nine would aid in understanding the processes behind {{the formation of the}} Solar System and other <b>planetary</b> systems, as well as how unusual the Solar System is, with a lack of planets with masses between that of Earth and that of Neptune, compared to other <b>planetary</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} <b>planetary</b> system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a <b>planetary</b> system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a <b>planetary</b> surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Corvus {{contains}} no Messier objects. It has several galaxies and a <b>planetary</b> nebula observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a <b>planetary</b> nebula, NGC 4361. The nebula itself resembles a small elliptical galaxy and has a magnitude of 10.3, but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature.|$|E
5|$|However, {{they are}} not thought to be {{favorable}} locations {{for the survival of}} <b>planetary</b> systems. <b>Planetary</b> orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the perturbations of passing stars. A planet orbiting at 1 astronomical unit around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster such as 47 Tucanae would only survive on the order of 108 years. There is a <b>planetary</b> system orbiting a pulsar (PSR B1620−26) that belongs to the globular cluster M4, but these planets likely formed after the event that created the pulsar.|$|E
5|$|In 2286, an {{enormous}} cylindrical probe moves through space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling {{the power of}} ships it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates <b>planetary</b> storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. Starfleet Command sends out a <b>planetary</b> distress call and warns starships not to approach Earth.|$|E

5|$|Nicknamed the spare-tyre nebula, IC 5148 is a <b>planetary</b> nebula located around 1 degree west of Lambda Gruis. Around 3000 light-years distant, it is {{expanding}} at 50 kilometres a second, {{one of the}} fastest rates of expansion of all <b>planetary</b> nebulae.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August the Division of <b>Planetary</b> Sciences of the American Astronomical Society {{endorsed}} the draft proposal.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a planet}} reaches {{sufficient}} mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during <b>planetary</b> differentiation. This process can form a stony or metallic core, {{surrounded by a}} mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some <b>planetary</b> cores generate their own magnetic field, which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.|$|E
5|$|<b>Planetary</b> {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this <b>planetary</b> system, although many new discoveries are still being made.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>Planetary</b> Patrol Program {{was formed}} in 1969 as a {{consortium}} to continually monitor <b>planetary</b> changes. This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars. Their images allow Martian seasonal patterns to be studied globally, and they showed that most Martian dust storms occur when the planet is closest to the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Using the Very Large Telescope {{to study}} the motions of about 300 <b>planetary</b> nebulae, {{it has been shown}} that M87 has absorbed a {{medium-sized}} galaxy over the last billion years. The distinctive spectral properties of the <b>planetary</b> nebulae allowed astronomers to discover a chevron-like structure in M87's halo which was produced by the incomplete phase-space mixing of a disrupted galaxy.|$|E
5|$|A Uranus orbiter {{was listed}} as the third {{priority}} for a NASA Flagship mission by the NASA <b>Planetary</b> Science Decadal Survey, and conceptual designs for such a mission are currently being analyzed.|$|E
5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of <b>planetary</b> systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a <b>planetary</b> system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a <b>planetary</b> system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of <b>planetary</b> orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|Assuming its existence, {{computer}} climate simulations {{have confirmed}} {{the possibility of}} the existence of surface water and these factors combine to a relatively high measure of <b>planetary</b> habitability.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>planetary</b> {{formation}} epoch {{the inner}} Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized <b>planetary</b> embryos. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Because of its <b>planetary</b> system, 47 Ursae Majoris {{was listed}} {{as one of the}} top 100 target stars for NASA's former Terrestrial Planet Finder mission.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, two {{developments}} {{allowed for}} the transits of planets {{across the face of}} the Sun to be predicted and observed: the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, <b>planetary</b> orbits.|$|E
5|$|Free-floating {{planets in}} stellar {{clusters}} have similar velocities {{to the stars}} and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the <b>planetary</b> mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing <b>planetary</b> system.|$|E
5|$|In 1500, Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala {{school of}} {{astronomy}} and mathematics, in his Tantrasangraha, revised Aryabhata's model. In his Aryabhatiyabhasya, {{a commentary on}} Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, he developed a <b>planetary</b> model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his <b>planetary</b> model.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 {{the disk}} around Beta Pictoris {{became the first}} other <b>planetary</b> system to be photographed by an amateur astronomer. Rolf Olsen of New Zealand {{captured}} the disk with a 10-inch Newtonian reflector and a modified webcam.|$|E
5|$|In 904AD, Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture {{discussed}} the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the <b>planetary</b> astral alterations; signs of rain based on {{observation of the}} lunar phases; and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds.|$|E
5|$|In the past, astronomers {{once thought}} the rings formed {{alongside}} the planet when it formed {{billions of years}} ago. Instead, the age of these <b>planetary</b> rings is probably some {{hundreds of millions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has multiple}} jet streams, {{caused by the}} convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating. The factors that control the number of jet streams in a <b>planetary</b> atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the <b>planetary</b> radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of jet streams decreases.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} regular <b>planetary</b> moons, Callisto's {{rotation}} is locked to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and <b>planetary</b> gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.00720.0076 and 0.200.60°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual <b>planetary</b> nebula NGC 5189, {{estimated}} to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish <b>planetary</b> nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse <b>planetary</b> nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant {{themes in the}} book, explored {{against the background of}} both <b>planetary</b> and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission is to convince the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the <b>planetary</b> conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those in each country to view themselves as citizens of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the planets}} in the Solar System have {{secondary}} systems of their own, being orbited by <b>planetary</b> objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury), and, {{in the case of}} the four giant planets, by <b>planetary</b> rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{which was}} {{launched}} in March 2009, collected photometric data continuously over a four-month period in a small area of sky, using a 0.95m Schmidt telescope. When the data collected during this period was analyzed, 1235 <b>planetary</b> candidates were identified amongst the observed 150,000 stars; all of these <b>planetary</b> candidates were suspected of transiting their host stars, in which the <b>planetary</b> body periodically crosses in front of and slightly dims its host star. Because the data collected on the transits of KOI-98 (later known as Kepler-14b) seemed very clearly to indicate a planet, Kepler identified KOI-98 early on in its mission. Data on the object of interest was forwarded to the Kepler Follow-up Program for a follow-up investigation.|$|E
5|$|Neptune has a <b>planetary</b> ring system, {{though one}} much less {{substantial}} {{than that of}} Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.|$|E
