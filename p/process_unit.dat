25|$|A unit {{operation}} {{is a physical}} step in an individual chemical engineering <b>process.</b> <b>Unit</b> operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a {{unit operation}}. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as nitration and oxidation) involve the conversion of material by biochemical, thermochemical and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.|$|E
25|$|The {{overhead}} {{sour gas}} from the stripper contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That sour gas {{is sent to the}} refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main amine gas treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and pentane or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery fuel gas. The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus <b>process</b> <b>unit</b> or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric acid process or in the conventional Contact Process.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of a suitable catalyst {{is also an important}} factor in deciding whether to build an alkylation plant. If sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used, significant volumes are needed. Access to a suitable plant is required for the supply of fresh acid and the disposition of spent acid. If a sulfuric acid plant must be constructed specifically to support an alkylation unit, such construction will {{have a significant impact on}} both the initial requirements for capital and ongoing costs of operation. Alternatively it is possible to install a WSA <b>Process</b> <b>unit</b> to regenerate the spent acid. No drying of the gas takes place. This means that there will be no loss of acid, no acidic waste material and no heat is lost in process gas reheating. The selective condensation in the WSA condenser ensures that the regenerated fresh acid will be 98% weight, even with the humid process gas. It is possible to combine spent acid regeneration with disposal of hydrogen sulfide by using the hydrogen sulfide as a fuel.|$|E

30|$|The primary {{fixed assets}} of a {{refinery}} are its <b>process</b> <b>units,</b> and {{the easiest way}} to describe the units is in terms of their production capacity, technology application, and capital expenditures for acquisition and construction. A refinery represents a collection of integrated <b>process</b> <b>units</b> which are characterized by the number, size, and type of <b>process</b> <b>units,</b> and the technologies applied. It is common to classify refineries broadly by {{the presence or absence of}} particular units (e.g., cracking refineries contain cracking units, coking refineries contain cokers). The manner in which the units are integrated and the cost associated with the receipt and dispatch of feedstock and refined product, including storage capacity, are important but are usually considered secondary factors.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} addressed {{here is how}} {{to integrate}} computational tools, namely interactive general-purpose platforms, {{in the teaching of}} <b>Process</b> <b>Units.</b> Mathematica has been selected as a complementary tool to teach distillation processes, with the main objective of leading students to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} physical phenomena involved and thereafter design the corresponding equipment. This strategy has mutual benefits, allowing a good and wide understanding of the <b>process</b> <b>units</b> studied and, simultaneously, providing a perceptive way of learning how to use a computational platform to solve engineering problems. It is claimed that this methodology represents an improvement to the more traditional strategy of teaching <b>process</b> <b>units</b> and computational tools as separate courses...|$|R
2500|$|The {{required}} methanol {{is obtained}} from synthesis gas (syngas). [...] In principle, the methanol {{could be obtained}} from organic waste or biomass. [...] Other possible improvements call for a dual catalyst system that permits both methanol synthesis and dehydration in the same <b>process</b> <b>unit,</b> with no methanol isolation and purification.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recovered}} NGL {{stream is}} sometimes processed through a fractionation train consisting of three distillation towers in series: a deethanizer, a depropanizer and a debutanizer. The overhead product from the deethanizer is ethane and the bottoms are fed to the depropanizer. The overhead product from the depropanizer is propane and the bottoms are fed to the debutanizer. The overhead product from the debutanizer {{is a mixture}} of normal and iso-butane, and the bottoms product is a C5+ mixture. The recovered streams of propane, butanes and C5+ may be [...] "sweetened" [...] in a Merox <b>process</b> <b>unit</b> to convert undesirable mercaptans into disulfides and, along with the recovered ethane, are the final NGL by-products from the gas processing plant. Currently, most cryogenic plants do not include fractionation for economic reasons, and the NGL stream is instead transported as a mixed product to standalone fractionation complexes located near refineries or chemical plants that use the components for feedstock. In case laying pipeline is not possible for geographical reason,or the distance between source and consumer exceed 3000km, natural gas is then transported by ship as LNG (liquefied natural gas) and again converted into its gaseous state {{in the vicinity of the}} consumer.|$|E

30|$|Production {{processes}} in the wood industry usually consist of several <b>process</b> <b>units</b> and activities, especially when further processed products are being manufactured. Furthermore, the variability of the input material to such a process is usually rather high. Many times this leads to sub-optimization [1, 2], even in cases where all <b>process</b> <b>units</b> {{belong to the same}} company. A system-based thinking, where the whole chain is considered when optimizing, would be more efficient in most cases [3, 4].|$|R

An important aspect of sustainable development is the minimisation of irreversibilities caused by the use of non-renewables. In order to limit the scope of this thesis sustainable development associated with production is considered only. The demonstration cases from practice are selected on four levels: components from <b>process</b> <b>units,</b> <b>process</b> <b>units,</b> complete production <b>processes</b> and, finally, products from production processes.

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of batch <b>process</b> <b>units</b> changes {{with time and}} this makes their precision control difficult. The aim {{of this paper is}} to highlight that the slave process of batch <b>process</b> <b>units</b> can have a more complex dynamics than the master loop has, and very often this could be the reason for the non-satisfying control performance. Since the slave process is determined by the mechanical construction of the unit, the above mentioned problem can be effectively handled by a model-based controller designed using an appropriate nonlinear tendency model. The paper presents the structure of the tendency model of typical slave processes and presents a case study where real-time control results show that the proposed methodology gives superior control performance over the widely applied cascade PID control scheme. 1...|$|R

50|$|Large {{quantities}} of fluid feedstock or product may enter or leave a plant by pipeline, railroad tank car, or tanker truck. For example, petroleum commonly {{comes to a}} refinery by pipeline. Pipelines can also carry petrochemical feedstock from a refinery to a nearby petrochemical plant. Natural gas is a product which comes {{all the way from}} a natural gas processing plant to final consumers by pipeline or tubing. Large {{quantities of}} liquid feedstock are typically pumped into <b>process</b> <b>units.</b> Smaller quantities of feedstock or product may be shipped to or from a plant in drums.
