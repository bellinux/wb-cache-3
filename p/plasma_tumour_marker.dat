40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value of a new tumour marker, cytokeratin fragment 19 (CYFRA 21 - 1), in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for the diagnosis of lung cancer. The cross-sectional study included 36 patients with lung cancer, 19 with benign lung diseases and 13 control subjects. In the group with cancer, BAL was performed in the cancer-involved lung and in the opposite lung. Results in BALF were expressed both as absolute concentrations (ng ml− 1) and referred to total protein (TP) (ng mg− 1 TP), and results in plasma were expressed in ng ml− 1. In BALF, there was no significant difference between cancer and control groups. Using the 95 th percentile of levels obtained in benign lung disease in BALF (specificity 95 %) as the cut-off point, the sensitivity of CYFRA 21 - 1 was 13 %. Positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) at different pretest probabilities, and positive and negative gains were obtained applying a Bayesian analysis. Results showed low positive gains for PPV (maximal increase of 22 %) and almost none for NPV (negative gains < 5 %). In plasma, CYFRA 21 - 1 provided a sensitivity of 65 %. The combination of BALF and <b>plasma</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> levels showed a sensitivity of 69 %. Therefore, measurement of CYFRA 21 - 1 in BALF has poor diagnostic value in lung cancer...|$|E

40|$|Analytic {{measurement}} of serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> {{is one of}} commonly used methods for cancer risk management in {{certain areas of the}} world (e. g. Taiwan). Recently, cancer screening based on multiple serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> has been frequently discussed. However, the risk-benefit outcomes appear to be unfavourable for patients because of the low sensitivity and specificity. In this study, cancer screening models based on multiple serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> were designed using machine learning methods, namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and logistic regression, to improve the screening performance for multiple cancers in a large asymptomatic population. AFP, CEA, CA 19 - 9, CYFRA 21 - 1, and SCC were determined for 20 696 eligible individuals. PSA was measured in men and CA 15 - 3 and CA 125 in women. A variable selection process was applied to select robust variables from these serum <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> to design cancer detection models. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, area under the curve, and Youden index of the models based on single <b>tumour</b> <b>markers,</b> combined test, and machine learning methods were compared. Moreover, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction (ARR), and absolute risk increase (ARI) were evaluated. To design cancer detection models using machine learning methods, CYFRA 21 - 1 and SCC were selected for women, and all <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> were selected for men. SVM and KNN models significantly outperformed the single <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> and the combined test for men. All 3 studied machine learning methods outperformed single <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> and the combined test for women. For either men or women, the ARRs were between 0. 003 - 0. 008; the ARIs were between 0. 119 - 0. 306. Machine learning methods outperformed the combined test in analysing multiple <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> for cancer detection. However, cancer screening based solely on the application of multiple <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> remains unfavourable because of the inadequate PPV, ARR, and ARI, even when machine learning methods were incorporated into the analysis...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to prospectively {{evaluate}} an intensive follow-up programme using serial <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> estimations and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen in patients undergoing potentially curative resection of colorectal liver metastases. Seventy-six consecutive patients having undergone potentially curative resections of colorectal liver metastases in a single unit were followed up with a protocol of 3 monthly carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 estimations and contrast-enhanced spiral CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for the first 2 years following surgery and 6 monthly thereafter. The median period of follow-up was 24 months (range 18 – 60). Recurrent tumour was classed as early if within 6 months of liver resection. Thirty-seven of the 76 patients (49 %) developed recurrence on follow-up. Nineteen recurrences were in the liver alone (51 %), 16 liver and extrahepatic (43 %) and two extrahepatic alone (6 %). Of the 19 patients with isolated liver recurrence, eight developed within 6 months of liver resection none of which were resectable. Of the 11 recurrences after 6 months, five (45 %) were resectable. Of the 37 recurrences, CT indicated recurrence despite normal <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> in 19 patients. <b>Tumour</b> <b>markers</b> suggested recurrence before imaging in 12 and concurrently with imaging in 6. In the 12 patients who presented with elevated <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> before imaging, there was a median lag period of 3 months (range 1 – 21) in recurrence being detected on further serial imaging. Seventeen patients who developed recurrence had normal <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> before initial resection of their liver metastases. Of these 17, 10 (58 %) had an elevation of <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> associated with recurrence. Over a median follow-up of 2 years following liver resection, the use of CT or <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> alone would have failed to demonstrate early recurrence in 12 and 18 patients respectively. A combination of <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> and CT detected significantly more (P< 0. 05) recurrence than either modality alone. <b>Tumour</b> <b>markers</b> and CT should be used in combination in the follow-up of patients with resected colorectal liver metatases, including patients whose markers are normal at the time of initial liver resection...|$|R

Acencio bs phd,* L. R. Teixeira md phd, * and F. S. Vargas md phd* Background The presence of tumour cells in pleural fluid or tissue defines an effusion as malignant. Cytology {{analysis of the}} pleural fluid has about 60 % diagnostic sensitivity. Several tests have been proposed to improve diagnosis—among them, the concentrations of <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> in pleural f luid. We evaluated whether the concentrations of <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> in pleural fluid could improve the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion (mpe) when cytology is doubtful. Methods Lymphocytic pleural fluids secondary to tuberculosis or malignancy from 156 outpatients were submitted for cytology and <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> quantification [carcinoembryonic antigen (cea), cancer antigen 15 - 3 (ca 15 - 3), carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (ca 19 - 9), cancer antigen 72 - 4 (ca 72 - 4), cancer antigen 125 (ca 125), and cyfra 21 - 1). One-way analysis of variance, the Student t-test or Mann–Whitney test, and receiver operating characteristic curves {{were used in the}} statistical analysis. Results Concentrations of the <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> cea, ca 15 - 3, ca 125, and cyfra 21 - 1 were higher in mpes {{than they were in the}} benign effusions (p < 0. 001), regardless of cytology results. The markers ca 19 - 9 and ca 72 - 4 did not discriminate malignant from benign effusions. When comparing the concentrations of <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> in mpes having positive, suspicious, or negative cytology with concentrations in benign effusions, we observed higher levels of cea, ca 15 - 3, cyfra 21 - 1, and ca 125 in malignant effusions with positive cytology (p = 0. 003, p = 0. 001, p = 0. 002, and p = 0. 001 respectively). In pleural fluid, only ca 125 was higher in mpes with suspicious or negative cytology (p = 0. 001) than in benign effusions. Conclusions Given high specificity and a sensitivity of about 60 %, the concentrations of <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> in pleural effusions could be evaluated in cases of inconclusive cytology in patients with a high pre-test chance of malignancy or a history of cancer.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the value of a serum <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel in selecting among the patients with equivocal BS those with bone metastases. Between January 1986 and December 1995, 297 breast cancer patients were followed-up after mastectomy with serial determinations of a CEA-TPA-CA 15. 3 <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel, BS and liver echography. The <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel was used to select patients with equivocal BS for examination of suspicious bone areas by further imaging techniques. Up to December 1995, 158 (53 %) patients showed an equivocal BS and 47 patients developed bone metastases. In the 158 patients with equivocal BS, prolonged clinical and imaging follow-up over 45 months (mean; range 12 – 120) was used to ascertain the presence or absence of bone metastases. In these 158 patients the negative predictive value and positive predictive value of the <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel to predict bone metastases was 97 % and 75 % respectively. This study shows that in breast cancer patients the CEA-TPA-CA 15. 3 <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> panel has a high value in selecting those patients with bone metastases, or at high risk of developing clinically-evident bone metastases, among the large number of subjects with equivocal BS. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the utility of imaging examinations in patients with elevated <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> when (a) the <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> is not validated for as a primary diagnostic test; (b) the patient had no personal history of cancer and (c) the patient had no other imaging indication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients without known cancer who had abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19 - 9, CA 125 and/or CA 15 - 3 serology over a one-year period were included. A retrospective medical record review was performed to assess the number of these cases who underwent imaging because of 'elevated tumour marker' in the absence of a clinical indication for imaging. The number and result of these imaging studies were evaluated. RESULTS: Eight hundred and nineteen patients were included. Of those, 25 patients (mean age: 67. 8 [range 41 - 91] y), were imaged to evaluate: 'elevated tumour marker'. They underwent 29 imaging studies (mean [+/-standard deviation (SD) ] per patient = 1. 2 [+/- 0. 4]), and had 42 elevated <b>tumour</b> <b>marker</b> serology tests (mean [+/-SD] per patient = 1. 7 [+/- 0. 7]). Four patients had > 1 imaging test. No patient had an imaging study which diagnosed a malignancy or explained the elevated <b>tumour</b> <b>marker.</b> CONCLUSION: The non-judicious use of <b>tumour</b> <b>markers</b> can prompt further unnecessary investigations including imaging. In this study, there was no positive diagnostic yield for imaging performed for investigation of 'elevated tumour marker'.
