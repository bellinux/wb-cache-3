30|$|There {{are many}} {{software}} workflows that allow researchers to code, notate timecode for analysis, and pre-edit footage. In the study, Opportunities for Innovation: Game-based Learning in an Engineering Senior Design Course, NVivo qualitative analysis software was used together with paper-based analog coding. In a current study, {{also based on}} a higher education curriculum intervention, we are digitally coding and <b>pre-trimming</b> the footage in Adobe Prelude in addition to analog coding on the printed transcripts. Both workflows offer advantages. NVivo has built-in tools to create frequency maps and export graphs and charts relevant to qualitative analysis whereas Adobe Prelude adds coding notes directly into the footage metadata and connects directly with Adobe Premiere video editing software, which streamlines the editing process.|$|E
40|$|As afecções podais podem alterar negativamente o comportamento, bem estar e produtividade das vacas leiteiras, mas ainda é preciso explorar mais seus efeitos sobre os atributos fisiológicos, limiar da dor e as características físico-químicas do leite. Esse estudo teve por objetivo verificar os efeitos provocados pelo desconforto de vacas com problemas podais severos no escore de locomoção, atributos fisiológicos, limiar da dor, variáveis termográficas e características físico-químicas do leite, além de avaliar a melhoria nessas variáveis após o tratamento. Foram utilizadas 34 vacas lactantes claudicantes, as quais foram classificadas quanto à locomoção antes e depois do tratamento. Foram diagnosticadas as lesões, avaliados a composição do leite, limiar nociceptivo, {{realizadas}} as medidas fisiológicas e imagens termográficas nos membros com e sem lesão. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o completamente casualizado com medidas repetidas no tempo, onde cada vaca foi considerada uma unidade experimental. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância, utilizando o procedimento Mixed do programa estatístico SAS versão 9. 0. Vacas claudicantes apresentaram maior sensibilidade à dor. O tratamento reduziu o escore de locomoção e aumentou limiar nociceptivo, além de influenciar os valores de pH e cálcio iônico, pois maiores valores de pH foram observados no dia pré-tratamento enquanto maiores valores de cálcio iônico foram observados no dia 8. Houve pequena associação entre os valores termográficos e os escores de locomoção. Os maiores valores de pH foram encontrados no dia pré-tratamento, (dia - 1), para vacas da raça Jersey, animais mais velhos ou para animais mais pesados; enquanto os valores de cálcio iônico foram superiores no 8 ° dia em relação aos demais dias. Não houve efeito de escores de locomoção alto x baixo sobre a composição do leite. Por outro lado, fatores ligados aos animais como estádio lactacional, peso, número de tratamentos anteriores, ordem de parto, raça e idade influenciaram as características físico-químicas do leite. Lameness can {{negatively affect}} behavior, well-being and productivity, {{but it is}} still worthy to explore its effect on the nociceptive threshold, physiological attributes and the physicochemical characteristics of milk. This study aimed to verify the effects caused by the discomfort in severely lame cows on locomotion score, physiological attributes, pain threshold, thermographic variables and physicochemical characteristics of milk and assess improvement in these variables after corrective trimming and digital treatment. Thirty-nine severely lame lactating cows were classified according to locomotion score before and 1 week after trimming. In several days, injuries were diagnosed, milk composition evaluated, nociceptive threshold and physiological measurements were done, besides thermographic images of the hoofs with and without injury. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with repeated measurements over time, and each cow was considered an experimental unit. Data was subjected to analysis of variance using the mixed procedure of SAS statistical software version 9. 0. Severely lame cows showed higher sensitivity to pain. Trimming and treatment reduced locomotion score and increased nociceptive threshold, as well as influence the pH and ionic calcium, because higher pH values were observed in the <b>pre-trimming</b> day while larger ionic calcium values were observed on day 8. Cows had higher thermographic values in the affected hoof. There was little association between thermographic values and locomotion scores. Higher pH values were found in the <b>pre-trimming</b> (day - 1) in the milk of Jersey cows, older animals or heavier animals; while the ionic calcium values were higher on the 8 th day compared to other days. There was no effect of high x low locomotion scores on milk composition. On the other hand, factors related to animals as lactation stage, weight, number of previous trimmings, calving order, breed and age influenced the physicochemical characteristics of milk...|$|E

The kit {{is intended to be}} easier to assemble than earlier Van's designs through the use of pre-punched and pre-formed fuselage longerons, pre-installed wiring, plug-in avionics, a <b>pre-trimmed</b> and ready-to-install bubble canopy, pre-welded canopy frame, pre-fitted engine baffles as well as matched pre-punched holes. The RV-14 offers several instrument panel choices, including one designed to take modern EFIS systems, like the Dynon SkyView, without any additional cutting, as well as a blank panel that can be customized by the builder.|$|R
40|$|We {{have built}} a 14 -bit digital-to-analog {{converter}} (DAC) in a standard 0. 25 µm digital CMOS process. We use analog values stored on floating-gate p-channel MOSFETs to trim the DAC linearity. Because the storage is nonvolatile, we {{eliminate the need for}} continuous trimming. Our design has 6 untrimmable LSBs and 8 trimmable MSBs. The <b>pre-trim</b> differential and inte-gral nonlinearity (DNL and INL) exceeded 140 and 200 LSBs, respectively; the post-trim DNL and INL are less than 2 LSBs. We were able to trim the 8 MSBs to 0. 5 LSB linearity; the 2 LSB error is due to an untrimmable bit. Because our DAC does not require continuous trimming, nor laser-trimmable resistors, it oc-cupies only 0. 17 mm 2 of die area and dissipates 11 mW at 100 MHz with a – 10 dBm differential output...|$|R
