5|$|Hospice Medical Director: The hospice medical director, a physician, often <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{support to}} the {{clinical}} staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical care if the primary physician is unavailable or if the patient {{does not have a}} primary care provider. The hospice medical director is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.|$|E

Rosetta <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely structure, but it is not {{definite}} if that is the form the molecule takes or {{whether or not it is}} viable. Folding@home can then be used to verify Rosetta@home's results, and can provide added atomic-level information, and details of how the molecule changes shape.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. However, tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed.|$|E

5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{authors were}} the first to record these events. The {{earliest}} work is Emperor Leo the Wise's Tactics, finished around 904, which recounts the Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896, a military conflict directly preceding the Hungarians' departure from the Pontic steppes. Nearly contemporary narration can be read in the Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk. However, De Administrando Imperio ("On Governing the Empire") <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> detailed account. It was compiled under the auspices of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in 951 or 952.|$|E
5|$|Elephant & Castle {{is located}} in the Elephant and Castle area of Newington in the London Borough of Southwark in central London. The station is in both Travelcard Zones 1 and 2 and is on the Bank branch of the Northern line between Kennington and Borough stations, and is the {{southern}} terminus of the Bakerloo line, the next station being Lambeth North. The station has two surface buildings, separated by a large traffic intersection. The northern building <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> direct access to the Bakerloo line, while the southern one is linked more directly to the Northern line.|$|E

Among the state's largest industries, the aerospace sector generates $11 billion annually.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E

5|$|Quintilian <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{extensive}} {{theory of}} primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, {{a talent for}} learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
