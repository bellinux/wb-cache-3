40|$|The {{liberalization}} of the European energy markets {{combined with the}} rapid spread of unpredictable renewable energy sources have stressed the need of improving the traditional power units flexibility. Fast start-ups/shut downs and rapid load variations have become priority objectives because they guarantee high profits {{in the short term}} but cause a lifetime reduction due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion. To this purpose, in the present work, an innovative procedure, able to predict the power plant dynamic behaviour during load variations, identify the most stressed components and estimate their lifetime reduction is presented and tested. Being combined cycles the most efficient, flexible and widespread technologies, the selected test case is a 380 MW combined cycle unit. To predict the plant dynamic performance a dynamic model has been built in Modelica language and several transient conditions investigated. The high <b>pressure</b> steam <b>drum</b> and superheater are the most stressed components. Results show a 52. 9 % reduction in superheater collectors life if the load variation is 50 % faster than the reference case.

For the same conditions the high <b>pressure</b> steam <b>drum</b> life is reduced by 31. 9 % and increased by 16. 3 %, respectively. Also the superheater tube bank lifetime reduction is computed.

The paper describes the mathematical model that the author has developed to estimate the useful life reduction of the high <b>pressure</b> steam <b>drum</b> belonging to a three pressure levels heat recovery steam generator. The aim of the {{present study is}} to propose a detailed calculation procedure useful to electrical energy producers that want to predict the steam drums useful life reduction, due to different transient operating conditions, in order to optimize plant load cycles.

As described in the paper, one of the innovations introduced by the author to apply the EN 13445 Standard is relative to the analytical method proposed to calculate the allowable number of fatigue cycles without using iterative formulas. Furthermore, it is important to say that the calculation tool can be used to estimate the life consumption of any steam drum of a combined cycle power plant; the model is characterized by low run times and high reliability.

40|$|During the {{generation}} of steam, most water impurities are not evaporated with the steam and thus concentrate in the boiler water. The concentration of the impurities is usually regulated by the adjustment of the continuous blowdown valve, which controls {{the amount of water}} (and concentrated impurities) purged from the steam drum. Since a certain amount of continuous blowdown must be maintained for satisfactory boiler performance, a significant quantity of heat is removed from the boiler. It is necessary to provide a simple-to-use method to calculate the total amount of heat that is recoverable using this system. In the present work, a simple-to-use predictive tool, which is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations and minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps, is formulated to arrive at an appropriate estimation of the percent of blowdown that is flashed to steam as a function of flash <b>drum</b> <b>pressure</b> and operating boiler <b>drum</b> <b>pressure</b> followed by the calculation of the amount of heat recoverable from the condensate.

Pressurized waste drums are a safety hazard that can lead to significant personnel injury and property damage caused by the expelled drum lid or fragments of the burst drum, as well as exposure to the radioactive or other hazardous contents. During the same period, it has become increasingly clear that manual inventory procedures currently being used at DOE sites to mark, track, and manage the vast amount of legacy and newly generated waste throughout the waste’s life-cycle have become obsolete.

40|$|There {{are more}} than five hundred {{thousand}} boilers in China, and they are consuming {{a large portion of}} the nation's natural energy. Most of these boilers are controlled in old fashions and their efficiency is low. One of the most effective means of boiler efficiency enhancement is an improvement of the steam generation control system. Since the dynamics of a boiler display nonlinearity, nonminimum phase behavior, instability and time delay, the control performance using the classical approaches is generally unsatisfactory. The main objective of this research is to develop fuzzy control schemes for drum-boiler systems to achieve better performance. In the first part of the thesis, we investigate some of the existing drum-boiler mathematical models. The step responses of the different boiler models are examined and compared. They show different properties of the boiler system and in particular the swell and shrink effect of drum boilers. One of the boiler models will be used as the main framework in the following boiler control investigations. In the second part of the thesis, fuzzy control systems for <b>drum</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>drum</b> water level are developed and compared with conventional approaches. First, simple fuzzy controllers are designed. The simulation results show that the simple fuzzy controllers have better performance than conventional PI controllers for setpoint tracking and have comparable results for input disturbance rejection. To speed up the responses of the control systems, feed-forward controllers are added to the feedback controllers. In the second fuzzy control methodology, two-level fuzzy controllers that use the feed-forward idea are explored. The fuzzy rule bases of the secondary control systems try to include the functioning of feed-forward control. The primary controllers could be simple PI controllers or the PI-like fuzzy controllers which we have developed early. Finally, an adaptive fuzzy system tuned PI control scheme is developed. Here, a fuzzy system is constructed to tune the parameters of the PI controller automatically. The results reveal that the adaptive fuzzy control system gives improved performance over the conventional PI controllers in both setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection...|$|R

Conventional fossil fueled power plants {{are the leading}} power producers despite the existence of other energy sources and power generation technologies. As renewable power production is integrated into the grid, {{the operation of the}} conventional power plants faces new challenges that demand new control strategies. A key challenge is that the power demanded from conventional plants will continuously change to recover the production shortages caused by the intermittency of the renewable sources. This challenge demands an efficient control structure that is able to accommodate such power fluctuations, in addition to the inherent complexities of power plants such as the existence of deadtime associated with solid fuels. Coal, for example, is pulverized in real time prior to being transported to the furnace, which in turn, introduces deadtime to the power generation process. This thesis proposes the use of deadtime compensated nonlinear controllers that are based on feedback linearization of models obtained from physical principles for the control of coal fired power plants. The designed control strategies aim to control power generation, boiler <b>pressure,</b> boiler <b>drum</b> level, and superheated and reheated steam temperatures. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the control of the boiler pressure and power generation is considered. A single deadtime compensated model state feedback structure is developed to track variations in power demand and to reject applied disturbances. The second part focuses on the development of a control strategy for the drum level dynamics in addition to the boiler pressure and power generation. The strategy proposed aims to decouple the manipulated variables of the boiler <b>pressure</b> and the <b>drum</b> level dynamics and applies a conventional three-element level controller with the deadtime nonlinear controller proposed in the first part. In the last part of the thesis, the control of the boiler pressure, power generation, superheated steam temperatures is considered. The control strategy considers decoupling the performance of the boiler from the superheated steam temperature, the decomposition of the overall plant into three cascading subsystems and the application of deadtime compensated nonlinear controller for each subsystem...|$|R
