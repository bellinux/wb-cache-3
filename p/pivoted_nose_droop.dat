40|$|Six-component {{experimental}} {{force and}} moment data are presented for a low aspect ratio, oblique wing equipped with drooped-nose flaps and mounted {{on top of}} a body of revolution. These flaps were investigated on the downstream wing panel with the <b>nose</b> <b>drooped</b> 5 deg, 10 deg, 20 deg, and 30 deg, and on both wing panels with the <b>nose</b> <b>drooped</b> 30 deg. It was to determine if such flaps would make the moment curves more linear by controlling the flow separation on the downstream wing panel at high lift coefficients. The wing was elliptical in planform and had an aspect ratio of 6. 0 (based on the unswept wing span). The wing was tested at sweep angles of 45 deg and 50 deg throughout the Mach number range from 0. 25 to 0. 95. The drooped-nose flaps alone were not effective in making the moment curves more linear; however, a previous study showed that Kruger nose flaps improved the linearity of the moment curves when the Kruger flaps were used on only the downstream wing panel equipped with drooped-nose flaps deflected 5 deg...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Air {{connectivity}} {{network is}} an important part of the overall connectivity network of any country. This becomes even more crucial for the interior regions, which have no access to sea routes and have inadequate road and rail connectivity. In India there is uniform distribution of airports throughout the country but only a few of them are currently used because of poor infrastructure availability at these airports. Any aircraft operating from these airports, having minimal infrastructure, need to have efficient high-lift systems for short takeoff and landing ability as one of the key requirements. The purpose of this paper is look at the performance of a new high-lift airfoil configuration for application to a general transport aircraft. Design/methodology/approach – The present study deals with two-dimensional analyses of a high-lift system for general transport aircraft. The JUMBO 2 D, a multi-block structured viscous code has been used to make preliminary analysis of the proposed high-lift system. The configuration consists of three elements, namely, the main airfoil with <b>nose</b> <b>droop,</b> a vane and a flap. Findings – In the present work the code has been revalidated by computing for NLF (1) 0416 airfoil (clean) and NACA 1410 airfoil with double-slotted flap. The computed results compare very well with the experimental data. The proposed high-lift configuration of general transport aircraft has then been analyzed in detail for both takeoff and landing conditions with and without <b>nose</b> <b>droop.</b> The effect of gap between main element and vane on the aerodynamic performance has also been investigated.

5000|$|The {{airframe}} of {{the naval}} variant will be modified with a <b>nose</b> <b>droop</b> to provide improved view during landing approach, and wing leading edge vortex controllers (LEVCON) to increase lift during approach. The LEVCONs are control surfaces that extend from the wing-root leading edge and thus afford better low-speed handling for the LCA, which would otherwise be slightly hampered due to the increased drag that results from its delta-wing design. As an added benefit, the LEVCONs will also increase controllability at high angles of attack (AoA). The naval Tejas will also have a strengthened spine, a longer and stronger undercarriage, and powered nose wheel steering for deck manoeuvrability. The Tejas trainer variant will have [...] "aerodynamic commonality" [...] with the two-seat naval aircraft design.|$|R

50|$|The Panther can {{be armed}} with several {{different}} sets of munitions and armaments, dependent upon the intended role.

The weapon systems are integrated with a Crouzet HDH-2A electronic sight and the autopilot, the latter of which provides automatic flight handling assistance during weapons deployment to avoid negative tendencies such as <b>nose</b> <b>droop.</b> For improved survivability, the radar signature is reduced due to the use of composite materials across the airframe {{and the use of the}} fenestron tail rather than a conventional tail rotor; low infrared paints are also typically applied to the exterior surfaces and jet exhaust dilution devices are installed on the engines to reduce the Panther's infrared signature.

50|$|The L-2000-1 {{featured}} a long, pointed nose {{that was almost}} flat on top and curved on the bottom, which allowed for improved supersonic performance, and could be drooped for takeoff and landing to provide adequate visibility. The wing design {{featured a}} sharp forward inboard sweep of 80°, with the remaining part of the wing's leading edge swept back 60°, with an overall area of 8,370 ft² (778 m²). The high sweep angles produced powerful vortices {{on the leading edge}} which increased lift at moderate to high angles of attack, yet still retained stable airflow over the control surfaces during a stall. These vortices also provided good directional control as well, which was somewhat deficient with the <b>nose</b> <b>drooped</b> at low speeds. The wing, while only 3% thick, provided substantial lift due to its large area, which, aided by vortex lift, allowed takeoff and landing speeds comparable to a Boeing 707. Additionally, a delta wing is a naturally rigid structure which requires little stiffening.|$|R
40|$|Since 2007 the DLR Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems {{investigates the}} smart <b>Droop</b> <b>Nose</b> as {{high-lift}} device at {{the leading edge}} for commercial aircrafts [1]. The device is intended to be an enabler for a NLF (natural laminar flow) wing providing the necessary high quality surface on a wings leading edge upper and lower surface and is based on the patent [2] of the Dornier company. Furthermore a slot-less leading edge high-lift system offers the potential for noise reduction since the conventional slat devices are identified {{to be one of the}} major contributors to the airframe noise [3]-[5], so that the smart <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> can be beneficial for turbulent wings too.

After inputting the kinematic optimization results into the skin optimization stage and solving, a maximum error in the order of 13 mm and curvature difference 0. 0028 1 /mm were calculated. The effect of the magnitude of these deviations need to be investigated through aerodynamic evaluations.

The nose and visor are hydraulically operated, by a small lever on the co-pilot's side of the cockpit. There is also a standby droop system if the main system fails (operated from the cockpit centre console), and as a last resort if both hydraulic systems fail, a lever can be pulled in the cockpit which releases the mechanical latches, allowing the nose to fall under gravity to the 12.5 degree position.|$|R

40|$|For the {{application}} of laminar flow at commercial aircraft wings the high-lift devices {{at the leading edge}} play a major role. Since conventional leading edge devices like slats do not comply with the high surface quality requirements needed for laminar flow, alternative concepts must be developed.

However, the research on such morphing devices which can deform to a given target shape and provide a smooth, high-quality surface has to give answers to questions of fundamental industrial requirements like erosion protection, anti/de-icing, lightning strike protection and bird strike protection.

One key feature is provided by an adaptive gapless <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> with an exceedingly high grade of leading edge morphing. The construction of this component is based on a structural optimization framework, developed at DLR.

40|$|Resume : In {{work package}} 2. 3. 1 "LNC Application Studies for 130 -seat Regional A/C" of the Clean Sky GRA LNC project, Fraunhofer proposes a {{high-lift}} wing having {{a leading edge}} depressed downwards (a. k. a. <b>droop</b> <b>nose)</b> for reducing noise radiated from the leading edge. As opposed to the precedent wing models, the current model has a <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> extended almost over the entire wing from 18 % to 98 % span. Good aerodynamic performance (cl max = 2. 6 at 15 degree angle of attack) of this model has been estimated in CFD analysis conducted in a full-scale condition. Due to the Reynolds number effect, CFD analysis in a 1 : 6 -scaled condition has shown smaller cl max = 2. 0, smaller angle of attack and less abrupt stall behavior. The current study aimed {{to confirm that the}} same performance expected in the scaled condition is actually observed in a wind tunnel. For this purpose, a 1 : 6 -scaled half wing model was first designed and manufactured {{so that it can be}} set in three different configurations: (1) clean wing,(2) high-lift baseline having deployed TE flaps but no <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> leading edge and (3) full high-lift with <b>droop</b> <b>nose.</b> WT tests with this model were performed in an automotive WT facility in Weissach, Germany. Flow speed was set at 40 m/s. Aerodynamic forces and moments were measured by a six-component balance at various angles of attack ranging from - 6 to 20 degrees with 2 degree step. In these tests, the model was placed upright on a platform covering a balancerig raised above the WT floor in order not to disturb the flow. In the tests with a transition tripping strip attached on the suction side near the LE, cl max of 1. 0 at AoA of 10 degree for the clean wing, cl max of 1. 7 at AoA of 8 degree for the high-lift baseline and cl max of 1. 9 at 12 degree angle of attack for the droop-nose configuration. All the configurations have less abruptstall behavior as expected. These results are in good agreement with those of the CFD analysis. In the test without the transition tripping strip, very similar results were observed in the clean wing and high-lift baseline configurations. In the <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> configuration, however, a large cl max of 2. 5 at a very large stall angle of 20 degree was observed during the WT test. This results hould be more investigated. In addition to aerodynamic examination, aeroacoustic noise sources were also examined with an acoustic beamforming system during the WT tests. No noise sources would be detected for the clean wing. For both high-lift configurations, these were found at few points on the leading edge, at the outer flap and at one of the stay supporting the inner flap. No qualitative difference insource distribution could be found between these two configurations...|$|R
