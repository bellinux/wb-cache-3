An acoustic axis of the pinna exists above 2 kHz which is located close to the horizonal plane for natural ear positions, whereas azimuthal location of the acoustic axis is determined by pinna orientation on the head. The maximum on-axis acoustic pressure gain of the external ear reaches 25 - 30 dB for frequencies near 5 kHz.

40|$|The Hugoniot {{equations}} {{of state}} {{of a large number}} of representative polymers have been obtained. Two aspects of the results are particularly striking: (1) The u{sub s}(u{sub p}) Hugoniots of all the polymers extrapolate to bulk sound velocities higher than the ultrasonic values, an indication of a rapidly varying rate of change of compressibility in this region. This is attributed both to the two-dimensional nature of polymer compression and to the form of the interchain interaction potential. (2) A relatively high <b>pressure</b> <b>transformation</b> (in the range 20 - 30 GPa), characterized by a change in slope of the u{sub s}(u{sub p}) Hugoniot and sometime by a large volume change as well, is observed for all of the polymers.

We compared pinna gain, directionality of hearing and interaural intensity differences (IID) in echolocating and non-echolocating bats, in species using different echolocation strategies and in species that depend upon prey-generated sounds to locate their targets. In the Pteropodidae, two echolocating species had slightly higher directionality than a non-echolocating species. The ears of phyllostomid and vespertilionid species showed moderate directionality. In the Mormoopidae, the ear directionality of P erono us parnelliiclearly matched the dominant spectral component of its echolocation calls, unlike the situation in three other species. Species in the Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Rhinopomatidae and two vespertilionids that use narrow-band search-phase echolocation calls showed increasingly sharp tuning of the pinna to the main frequency of their signals. Similar tuning was most evident in Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae, species specialized for flutter detection viaDoppler-shifted echoes of high-duty-cycle narrow-band signals. The large pinnae of bats that use prey-generated sounds to find their targets supply high sound pressure gain at lower frequencies.

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of Lessons Learned: Case Studies in Sustainable Use summarizes the overarching {{lessons learned from}} the case studies provided in the volume. 1. Sustainability of uses of renewable natural resources is dependent on the existence of a 'sustainable society'at the local, national and global levels. 2. Successful biological conservation is a function of equity and democracy. 3. To achieve greater sustainability of uses of natural resources will likely require modification of the roles of organizations and government agencies in authority. 4. The current conservation paradigm of Protected Areas (including as applied to the 'biodiversity hotspots'concept) may not be economically viable in many developing countries, simply because the opportunitycosts often exceed the value local people receive from their existence. National and international agencies and organizations realize most of the value from designation of protected areas and 'hotspots'. 5. It is not possible to transpose directly the combination of factors that influence one case to another site, and expect the same impact or result. 6.

Investigations on high temperature coal mine have been done in Northern China, with the constructing of three models of high temperature mines suffering heat-harm, at the Jiahe mine, Sanhejian mine and Zhangshuanglou mine. The domestic and abroad cooling technologies of the mine respectively are also summarized after comparatively analyzing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each technology. Finally, we find that the high temperature exchange machinery system (HEMS) technology that use mine discharge as the cold source, is excellent to heat-harm control in deep mines. Taking the Jiahe coal mine as an example, we systematically introduce this technology by disposing three main workstations. HEMS technology with its operations and functions in different exploitation levels are accomplished, including the extraction of refrigerating output, the transportation of chilled water by closed circulation line, the decompression of circulation lines and equipment by <b>pressure</b> <b>transformation</b> machine, and the heat exchange and cooling of workplace by heat exchange between wind stream and the chilled water. The exchanged heat source from the workplace is taken to ground heating by the circulating water which acts as a carrier. It shows that the HEMS-technology benefit in environment protection and emission reduction. Results of this project illustrate that it is efficient in heat-harm control with the temperature decrease of the workplace down to 26 – 29  °C, and being 4 – 6  °C lower than the original, and the relative humidity 5  %– 15  % lower than before. It greatly improves the working environment of underground workplace suffering heat-harm of high temperature and high humidity. In addition, by the extracting of deep geothermal energy, ground fired boiler for heating has been replaced, reducing environmental pollution.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis thesis {{explores the}} nature of the {{socialization}} and commitment process in the Western Buddhist context, by investigating the experiences of practitioners affiliated with two Buddhist Centres: the Theravadin Blue Mountains Insight Meditation Centre and the Gelugpa Tibetan Vajrayana Institute. Commitment by participants is based on the recognition that, through the application of the beliefs and practices of the new religion, self-transformation has occurred. It follows a process of religious experimentation in which the claims of a religious reality are experientially validated against inner understandings and convictions, which themselves become clearer as a result of experimental participation in religious activity. Functionally, the adopted worldview is seen to frame personal experience in a manner that renders it more meaningful. Meditative experience and its interpretation according to doctrine must be applicable to the improvement of the quality of lived experience. It must be relevant to current living, and ethically sustainable. Substantively, commitment is conditional upon accepting and succesfully employing: the three marks of samsaric existence, duhkha, anitya and anatman (Skt) as an interpretive framework for lived reality. In this the three groups of the Eight-fold Path, sila/ethics, samadhi/concentration, and prajna/wisdom provide a strategy for negotiating lived experience in the light of meditation techniques, specific to each Buddhist orientation, by which to apply doctrinal principles in one’s own transformation. Two theoretical approaches are found to have explanatory power for understanding the stages of intensifying interaction that lead to commitment in both Western Buddhist contexts. Lofland and Skonovd’s Experimental Motif models the method of entry into and exploration of a Buddhist Centre’s shared reality. Data from participant observation and interview demonstrates this approach to be facilitated by the organizational and teaching activities of the two Western Buddhist Centres, and to be taken by the participants who eventually become adherents. Individuals take an actively experimental attitude toward the new group’s activities, withholding judgment while testing the group’s doctrinal position, practices, and expected experiential outcomes against their own values and life experience. In an environment of minimal social <b>pressure,</b> <b>transformation</b> of belief is gradual over a period of from months to years. Deeper understanding of {{the nature of}} the commitment process is provided by viewing it in terms of religious resocialization, involving the reframing of one’s understanding of reality and sense-of-self within a new worldview. The transition from seekerhood to commitment occurs through a process of socialization, the stages of which are found to be engagement and apprehension, comprehension, and commitment. Apprehension is the understanding of core Buddhist notions. Comprehension occurs through learning how various aspects of the worldview form a coherent meaning-system, and through application of the Buddhist principles to the improvement of one’s own life circumstances. It necessitates understanding of the fundamental relationships between doctrine, practice, and experience. Commitment to the group’s outlook and objectives occurs when these are adopted as one’s orientation to reality, and as one’s strategy for negotiating a lived experience that is both efficacious and ethically sustainable. It is also maintained that sustained commitment is conditional upon continuing validation of that experience...|$|E
