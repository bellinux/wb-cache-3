5|$|In February 2014, a {{statement}} was made anonymously {{on behalf of}} some Pussy Riot members that both Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were no longer members. However, both were among the group that performed as Pussy Riot during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, where group members were attacked with whips and <b>pepper</b> <b>spray</b> by Cossacks who were employed as security guards. On 6 March 2014, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were assaulted and sprayed with green paint by local youths in Nizhny Novgorod.|$|E

5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and <b>pepper</b> <b>spray.</b> In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E

5|$|Some {{passengers}} and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin airphone service and mobile phones provided details: several hijackers were aboard each plane; they used mace, tear gas, or <b>pepper</b> <b>spray</b> to overcome attendants; and some people aboard had been stabbed. Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots, flight attendants, and one or more passengers. According to the 9/11 Commission's final report, the hijackers had recently purchased multi-function hand tools and assorted Leatherman-type utility knives with locking blades, which were not forbidden to passengers at the time, but were not found among the possessions {{left behind by the}} hijackers. A flight attendant on Flight 11, a passenger on Flight 175, and passengers on Flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs, but one of the passengers said he thought the bombs were fake. The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites, and the 9/11 Commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 2012, a melee {{occurred}} at a Newark City Council meeting attended by Booker. The nine-seat council was {{to vote on the}} successor to the seat vacated by newly elected U.S. Representative Donald M. Payne,Jr. Booker's opponents on the council, including Ras Baraka, sought to appoint John Sharpe James, son of the former mayor, while Booker and his supporters favored Shanique Speight. Booker attended the meeting to deal with the eventuality of the lack of a quorum or a tie vote, in which state law would allow him to cast a deciding vote. After Baraka was refused an opportunity to address the council by acting Council President Anibal Ramos,Jr., Baraka and two other council members walked away in protest. Booker cast the deciding vote for Speight. Supporters of James stormed the stage and were held back by riot police, who eventually used <b>pepper</b> <b>spray</b> on some members of the crowd. Baraka later blamed Booker for inciting the disturbance, while Booker refused comment to the media after the vote.|$|E

500|$|There is {{currently}} no regulation on {{other type of}} weapons such as knives, <b>pepper</b> <b>sprays,</b> batons or electrical paralyzers. These items can be freely bought and carried. [...] Similarly {{as in the case}} of firearms, it is prohibited to carry these weapons to court buildings, demonstrations and mass meetings. The Ministry of the Interior officially recommends carrying non-lethal weapons such as <b>pepper</b> <b>sprays,</b> paralyzers, or gas pistols as means of self-defense ...|$|R
25|$|However, in the United States, a {{water or}} oil based <b>pepper</b> <b>spray</b> {{is more common}} than CS. This allows for the {{possibility}} of a Taser being used after an individual has been subjected to <b>pepper</b> <b>spray</b> without the concern for a fire.|$|E

50|$|Determining the {{strength}} of different manufacturers of <b>pepper</b> <b>sprays</b> can be confusing and difficult. Statements a company makes about their product strength are not regulated. A method using the capsaicin and related capsaicinoids (CRC) content of the product is unreliable as well, because there are six different types of capsaicinoids, causing different levels of irritation. Manufacturers do not state which particular type of capsaicinoids are used. Personal <b>pepper</b> <b>sprays</b> can range {{from a low of}} 0.18% to a high of 3%. Most law enforcement <b>pepper</b> <b>sprays</b> use between 1.3% and 2%. The federal government of the United States has determined that bear attack deterrent sprays must contain at least 1.0% and not more than 2% CRC. CRC does not measure the amount of OC within the formulation. Instead, CRC is the pain-producing component of the OC that produces the burning sensation.|$|R
50|$|Bear spray {{typically}} contains {{higher levels}} (typically 1-2%) of major capsaicinoids (the key active ingredients) than <b>pepper</b> <b>sprays</b> intended for self-defense against human assailants (typically 0.2-1.3%).|$|R
