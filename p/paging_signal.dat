40|$|In mobile {{telecommunications}} the network should monitor the terminal status, i. e., switched on, switched off, busy. Once a mobile terminal is switched on, it automatically informs the network about its status (attachment action). However, regarding {{the way that}} the network can identify that a terminal is switched off (detachment), there are three alternatives: (a) Periodic detachment scenario. The terminal (when switched on) periodically informs the network about its state. If the network detects that there is no contact with the terminal for more than the agreed time period, it detaches the terminal, (b) Detach on unsuccessful paging. At the instance of a call terminating to a mobile terminal and after a number of unanswered paging messages, the terminal is detached. (c) Detachment action scenario. The moment that the mobile terminal is switched off, it informs the network about its status. Scenarios (a) and (c) claim that <b>paging</b> <b>signaling</b> savings can be achieved when the network is early informed that a mobile terminal is switched off. However, these scenarios require access to the network database, which {{is expected to be a}} bottleneck. On the other hand, scenario (b) requires no access to the database but does not guarantee <b>paging</b> <b>signaling</b> savings. In this paper we model the behavior of a terminal so as to compare the above scenarios in terms of performance.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel {{approach}} to conserving energy in battery-powered communication devices. There are two salient aspects to this approach. First, the battery-powered devices move through multiple, progressively deeper, sleep states in a predictable manner. Nodes in deeper sleep states consume lower energy while asleep, but incur a longer delay and higher energy cost to awaken. Second, the nodes are woken up on demand through a <b>paging</b> <b>signal.</b> To awaken nodes that are in deep sleep, the <b>paging</b> <b>signal</b> has to be decoded using very low power circuits such as those used in radio frequency tags. To accommodate this need, {{in a manner that}} scales well with the number of nodes, the number of distinct paging signals has to be much less than the number of possible nodes. This is accomplished through a group-based wakeup scheme, which initially awakens the targeted node along with a number of other similarly disposed nodes that subsequently return to their original sleep state. Tradeoffs among energy consumption, delay as well as overhead, are presented; comparisons with other protocols show the potential for 16 % to 50 % improvement in energy consumption.

40|$|In {{managing}} {{the locations of}} mobile users in mobile communication systems, the distance-based strategy has been proven to have better performance than other dynamic strategies, but is difficult to implement. In this paper, a simple approach is introduced to implement the distance-based strategy by using the cell coordinates in calculating the physical distance traveled. This approach has the advantages of being independent of the size, shape, and distribution of cells, as well as catering for the direction of movement {{in addition to the}} speed of each mobile terminal. An enhanced distance-based location management strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust {{the size and shape of}} location area for each individual mobile terminal according to the current speed and direction of movement. It can reduce the location management signaling traffic of the distance-based strategy by half when mobile terminals have predictable directions of movement. Three types of location updating schemes are discussed, namely, Circular Location Area, Optimal Location Area, and Elliptic Location Area. Paging schemes using searching techniques such as expanding distance search based on the last reported location and based on the predicted location, and expanding direction search are also explored to further reduce <b>paging</b> <b>signal</b> traffic by partitioning location areas into paging areas. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Water {{conservation}} {{is an important}} issue today. In 2005, the average residential water use in the United States was 371 liters capita 1 day 1 (USGS, 2005). In Utah, water is a limited resource; it’s the second most arid state in the nation, and is prone to droughts. In 2005, the average domestic or residential water use was 971 liters capita- 1 day- 1, of this, 439 liters capita- 1 day- 1 was used for watering lawns, plants, and gardens (Utah Division of Water Resources, 2007). Additionally, Utah is {{one of the fastest growing}} and most highly urbanized states. Therefore, residential and commercial landscape watering is a large potential source of urban water conservation. Climate-based irrigation controllers, also known as “smart controllers”, have been developed to help conserve water in landscapes with an automatic irrigation system installed. Smart controllers measure weather conditions daily to determine the amount of water plants need and allow irrigation. The main objective of this study was to evaluate, in a landscape setting, whether different climate-based irrigation controllers achieve different levels of water conservation. The experiment took place at Utah State University’s Greenville Research Farm in plots composed of an area of turfgrass (21 m 2) irrigated with sprinkler heads and another area of ornamental plants (7 m 2) irrigated with a drip irrigation system. Four experimental treatments with 5 replications were evaluated and arranged in a randomized complete block design. Each treatment represented a different irrigation controller. Hunter® Solar Sync and WeatherMatic® controllers used on-site sensors to measure weather conditions, while Rainbird® ET Manager used a remote <b>paging</b> <b>signal</b> to retrieve weather data from the closest weather station. In addition, standard irrigation controllers were programmed to irrigate control plots with schedules based on historical ETo of the hottest month of the year. Measurements were made during 10 -week periods during 2011 and 2012. Data collected and analyzed included weather conditions, weekly and overall water application amounts, distribution uniformity of the irrigation system, irrigation adequacy, and irrigation efficiency. Overall controller performance was analyzed using correlations between irrigation adequacy and efficiency. Results indicated average water savings based on the control treatment of 37, 39. 5 and 48 % for the Hunter® Solar Sync, Rainbird® ET Manager, and Weathermatic® controllers, respectively. Statistically significant differences in weekly water application indicated that the Weathermatic® controller applied significantly less water than the other treatments; Rainbird® ET Manager and Hunter® Solar Sync were not significantly different from one another. Control plots had significantly higher water applications than the rest of the treatments. Climate-based controllers modified irrigation scheduling based on weather, with noticeable changes during precipitation events. Irrigation efficiency values for all climate-based controllers were significantly higher than the control treatment. In 2011, Weathermatic® controllers had the best performance, followed by Hunter® Solar Sync and Rainbird® ET Manager. In 2012, all climate based-controllers performed significantly better than the control treatment. All of the climate-based controllers evaluated in the study are recommended for use in landscape for improving irrigation efficiency. Additional research that integrates plant health and quality, and evaluations of cost, adaptability, installation, programming and failure events are recommended...|$|E

40|$|In third {{generation}} mobile telecommunication systems, signalling requirements due to location updating and paging {{are expected to}} be remarkable, mainly because of the huge number of mobile subscribers. Location area planning is characterised by the trade-off between the number of location updates and the amount of <b>paging</b> <b>signalling</b> that the network has to deal with. Location area planning should be based on criteria which guarantee that signalling load will be kept under tolerable levels. Various approaches for location area planning in a city environment-the worst case environment-are discussed in this paper. The simplest approach is the use of heuristic algorithms for approximating the optimum location area configuration. Then more complex scenarios which are based on geographical criteria (population distribution, highway topology, etc.) are investigated. Finally, user mobility characteristics are taken into account in the most complex scenarios. All scenarios are applied over a simulation model representing a city area, providing us with a very clear view of their performance characteristics. © 1995 J. C.
