5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the <b>P</b> <b>wave</b> (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E

25|$|Of {{course the}} above picture is a {{generalization}} {{as it pertains}} to materials with an extended lattice rather than a molecular structure. Molecular structure can also lead to localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen <b>p</b> <b>wave</b> functions, but the overlap is limited to the one neighbor in the O2 molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.|$|E
25|$|One {{minute before}} the {{earthquake}} was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which {{includes more than}} 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions. It is believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved many lives. The warning {{for the general public}} was delivered about 8 seconds after the first <b>P</b> <b>wave</b> was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred. However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places, especially in Kanto, Koshinetsu, and Northern Tōhoku regions where the populace warning did not trigger. According to JMA , reasons for the underestimation includes a saturated magnitude scale when using maximum amplitude as input, not fully taken into account the arrea of the hypocenter, and the initial amplitude of the earthquake being less than expected from empirical relationship.|$|E

There {{is usually a}} fixed number of non-conducted <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> for every successfully conducted QRS complex, and this ratio is often specified in describing Mobitz II blocks.

30|$|To {{understand}} how trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> of different frequency components propagate along the oceanic crust, we first demonstrate their frequency dependency. As shown in Figure  2, trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> were clearly observed for all frequency bands at epicentral distances of 90 to 150  km, whereas the long-duration and incoherent coda waves were excited by seismic wave scattering in the crust and mantle. This {{indicates that the}} trapped energy from <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> might not be strongly affected by the scattering loss due to small-scale heterogeneities in the crust.|$|R
30|$|We {{analyzed}} the high-frequency (1 to 16  Hz) trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> propagating along the oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate beneath the Kanto-Tokai region, Japan. The trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> were clearly observed at epicentral distances up to 150  km during earthquakes {{occurring in the}} oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate beneath the central Kanto region, showing pulse-like waveforms without significant dispersion and peak delay. These characteristics suggest that the trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> might {{be caused by a}} specific velocity structure of the subducting oceanic crust, which effectively traps high-frequency P-wave energy.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the PR prolongation, individuals with a primum ASD have a left axis deviation of the QRS complex, while those with a secundum ASD have a right axis deviation of the QRS complex. [...] Individuals with a sinus venosus ASD exhibit a left axis deviation of the <b>P</b> <b>wave</b> (not the QRS complex).|$|E
2500|$|In animals, the {{appearance}} of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (PGO waves) is related {{to that of the}} bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements. These waves are most clearly seen during the transition from non-REM to REM sleep. Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006, reported that the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and memory consolidation. [...] An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions. In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the <b>P</b> <b>wave</b> generator (located in the pontine tegmentum) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the <b>P</b> <b>wave</b> generator was stimulated using a carbachol injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the <b>P</b> <b>wave</b> generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point {{to the fact that the}} activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.|$|E

The trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> were clearly observed at all stations, showing pulse-like waveforms without significant dispersion and peak delay. The averaged amplitudes of the trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> were 5 to 7 {{times larger than}} those of the first arrivals. These characteristics suggest that the trapped <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> might be caused by a specific velocity structure of the subducting oceanic crust, which effectively traps high-frequency P-wave energy.|$|R
40|$|Recent results {{obtained}} by {{the application of the}} Bethe-Salpeter approach to the analysis of elastic electron-deuteron scattering, with the separable NN kernel are presented. We analyze the role of the <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> (negative energy components) on the electromagnetic properties of the deuteron and compare it with the nonrelativistic results. It was shown that the contribution of the <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> {{must be taken into account}} to explain tensor polarization and charge form factor of the deuteron. The connection of the <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> with mesonic exchange currents (MEC) is demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{attenuation}} property of <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> by the scattering due to randomheterogeneities, ultrasonic model experiments are carried out by using two-dimensional modelsof media with randomly distributed velocity and density heterogeneities. The main experimentalresults are as follows. (1) P-wave attenuation by the scattering is negligible in the low-frequencyrange (22 ra/h > 10) where h is shorter than a. (2) When thepredominant wave length of incident <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> is {{two to three times}} the size of heterogeneity(2 < 22 ra/h< 3), the predominant frequency of transmitted <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> becomes higher with theincrease of travel distance...|$|R

Two distinct spectral bands associated with different microseismic P-wave source locations are observed. The short-period DF band (~ 0. 16 – 0. 35 Hz) is dominated by <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> generated in the deep ocean by local wind seas near the storm. In contrast, <b>P</b> <b>waves</b> in the long-period DF band (~ 0. 1 – 0. 15 Hz) are weaker and generated closer to the coast of Japan from swell interactions.
