The 68EC000 chip and SCM68000 core expanded the address bus to 32 bits, removed the M6800 <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus,</b> and excluded the MOVE from SR instruction from user mode programs. In 1996, Motorola updated the standalone core with fully static circuitry, drawing only 2µW in low-power mode, calling it the MC68SEC000.|$|E

50|$|The correct {{term for}} the {{component}} that allows a computer {{to talk to a}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> is host adapter or host bus adapter (HBA). On the other hand, a disk controller allows a disk to talk to the same bus. Those two are often confused, especially in the PC world. In fact signals read by a disk read-and-write head are converted by a disk controller, then transmitted over the <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus,</b> then converted again by the host adapter into the suitable format for the motherboard's bus, and then read by the CPU.|$|E

50|$|Although {{originally}} {{created in}} the late 1960s to connect together automated test equipment, it also had some success during the 1970s and 1980s as a <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> for early microcomputers, notably the Commodore PET. Newer standards have largely replaced IEEE 488 for computer use, but it still sees some use in the test equipment field.|$|E
50|$|PXI is a <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> {{specialized}} {{for data}} acquisition and real-time control systems. Introduced in 1997, PXI uses the CompactPCI 3U and 6U form factors and adds trigger lines, a local bus, and other functions suited for measurement applications.

50|$|In computing, a <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> is a {{computer}} bus designed to support computer peripherals like printers and hard drives. The term is generally {{used to refer to}} systems that offer support {{for a wide variety of}} devices, like Universal Serial Bus, as opposed to those that are dedicated to specific types of hardware, like SATA. This usage is not universal, some definitions include any bus system that is not a system bus, including examples like PCI. Others treat PCI and similar systems as a third category, the expansion bus.|$|E
50|$|The extra {{features}} are integrated memory, PCMCIA, and color LCD controllers connected to an on-die system bus, and five serial I/O channels that {{are connected to}} a <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> attached to the system bus. The memory controller supported FPM and EDO DRAM, SRAM, flash, and ROM. The PCMCIA controller supports two slots. The memory address and data bus is shared with the PCMCIA interface. Glue logic is required. The serial I/O channels implement a slave USB interface, a SDLC, two UARTs, an IrDA interface, a MCP, and a synchronous serial port.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{components}} in the Intel APIC system, the local APIC (LAPIC) and the I/O APIC. There is one LAPIC in each CPU in the system. In the very first implementation (82489DX), the LAPIC was a discrete circuit opposed to its thereafter implementation in Intel processors' silicon. There is typically one I/O APIC for each <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> in the system. In original system designs, LAPICs and I/O APICs were connected by a dedicated APIC bus. Newer systems use the system bus for communication between all APIC components.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} famous users of the SCC was the Apple Macintosh {{computer}} line, which used the SCC to implement two serial ports {{on the back of the}} early designs, labeled [...] "modem" [...] and [...] "printer". AppleTalk was developed to use the RS-422 mode to produce a low-cost medium-performance local area network system called LocalTalk, running at 230.4 kbit/s. AppleTalk evolved from earlier work that intended to produce a <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> similar to Universal Serial Bus, which is why the relatively expensive SCC was selected for the Mac.|$|E
50|$|The Serial Input/Output system, universally {{known as}} SIO, was a {{proprietary}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> and related software protocol stacks {{used on the}} Atari 8-bit family to provide most input/output duties for those computers. Unlike most systems of the era, such as RS-232, SIO included a lightweight protocol that allowed multiple devices to be attached to a single daisy-chained port that supported dozens of devices. SIO required additional logic in the devices which drove up costs. The designer, Joe Decuir, credits his work on Atari SIO {{as the basis of}} USB, which he also designed and on which he holds patents.|$|E

50|$|The Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) was {{introduced}} on the Apple IIGS in 1986. This <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> {{was intended to}} connect low-speed input devices like keyboards and computer mice. Looking for a low-cost connector, the design team selected the 4-pin mini-DIN connector, which is also used for S-Video. ADB only used one data pin and +5V and ground, leaving one pin free. This was used to implement the PSW connection, used {{to turn on the}} machine. A separate connection was required as the keyboard controller of machines of this era was not powered when the machine was powered down.|$|E
50|$|CoreConnect is a {{microprocessor}} bus-architecture from IBM for system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. It {{was designed to}} ease the integration and reuse of processor, system, and peripheral cores within standard and custom SoC designs. As a standard SoC design point, it serves {{as the foundation of}} IBM or non-IBM devices. Elements of this architecture include the processor local bus (PLB), the on-chip <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> (OPB), a bus bridge, and a device control register (DCR) bus. High-performance peripherals connect to the high-bandwidth, low-latency PLB. Slower peripheral cores connect to the OPB, which reduces traffic on the PLB. CoreConnect has bridging capabilities to the competing AMBA bus architecture, allowing reuse of existing SoC-components.|$|E
50|$|Often the {{reconfigurable}} array {{is used as}} a processing accelerator {{attached to}} a host processor. The level of coupling determines the type of data transfers, latency, power, throughput and overheads involved when utilising the reconfigurable logic. Some of the most intuitive designs use a <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> to provide a coprocessor like arrangement for the reconfigurable array. However, there have also been implementations where the reconfigurable fabric is much closer to the processor, some are even implemented into the data path, utilising the processor registers. The job of the host processor is to perform the control functions, configure the logic, schedule data and to provide external interfacing.|$|E

Supports on-chip peripherals like serial ports, CAN, PWM, Quadrature Encoder Pulse (QEP), Event Capture, Serial <b>Peripheral</b> Interface <b>Bus</b> (SPI), I²C, Analog-to-digital converter (ADC), Digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and GPIO.|$|R
5000|$|The Macintosh Plus {{computer}} {{is the third}} model in the Macintosh line, introduced on January 16, 1986, {{two years after the}} original Macintosh and {{a little more than a}} year after the Macintosh 512K, with a price tag of US$2599. As an evolutionary improvement over the 512K, it shipped with 1 MB of RAM standard, expandable to 4 MB, and an external SCSI <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus,</b> among smaller improvements. It originally had the same generally beige-colored case as the original Macintosh ("Pantone 453"), but in 1987, the case color was changed to the long-lived, warm gray [...] "Platinum" [...] color. It is the earliest Macintosh model able to run System 7 OS.|$|E
50|$|AMBA was {{introduced}} by ARM in 1996. The first AMBA buses were Advanced System Bus (ASB) and Advanced <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Bus</b> (APB). In its second version, AMBA 2 in 1999, ARM added AMBA High-performance Bus (AHB) that is a single clock-edge protocol. In 2003, ARM introduced the third generation, AMBA 3, including AXI to reach even higher performance interconnect and the Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) {{as part of the}} CoreSight on-chip debug and trace solution. In 2010 the AMBA 4 specifications were introduced starting with AMBA 4 AXI4, then in 2011 extending system wide coherency with AMBA 4 ACE. In 2013 the AMBA 5 CHI (Coherent Hub Interface) specification {{was introduced}}, with a re-designed high-speed transport layer and features designed to reduce congestion.|$|E
50|$|Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) is a {{proprietary}} bit-serial <b>peripheral</b> <b>bus</b> connecting low-speed devices to computers. It was introduced on the Apple IIGS in 1986 {{as a way}} to support low-cost devices like keyboards and mice, allowing them to be connected together in a daisy chain without the need for hubs or other devices. ADB was quickly introduced on later Macintosh models, on later models of NeXT computers, and saw some other 3rd party use as well. Like the similar PS/2 connector used in many PC-compatibles at the time, ADB was rapidly replaced by USB as that system became popular in the late 1990s; the last external ADB port on an Apple product was in 1999, though it remained as an internal-only bus on some Mac models into the 2000s.|$|E
