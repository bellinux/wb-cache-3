50|$|<b>Phenprobamate</b> (Gamaquil, Isotonil) is a {{centrally}} acting {{skeletal muscle}} relaxant, with additional sedative and anticonvulsant effects. Overdose {{is similar to}} barbiturates. Its mechanism of action is probably similar to meprobamate. <b>Phenprobamate</b> {{has been used in}} humans as an anxiolytic, and is still sometimes used in general anesthesia and for treating muscle cramps and spasticity. <b>Phenprobamate</b> is still used in some European countries, but it has generally been replaced by newer drugs. <b>Phenprobamate</b> is metabolized by oxidative degradation of the carbamate group and ortho-hydroxylation of the benzene ring, and is eliminated in urine by the kidneys.|$|E
