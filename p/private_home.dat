40|$|Aim: This study {{makes an}} {{assessment}} of end-of-life care of the elderly in <b>private</b> <b>homes</b> in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. Participants and Methods: Primary {{data were collected from}} <b>private</b> <b>homes</b> which supported elder care through observation and semi-structured interviews with primary family caregivers of the elderly. Results: The study finds that the major factors preventing <b>private</b> <b>homes</b> from providing adequate care to the elderly were architecturally inadequate housing conditions, paucity of financial support, and scarcity of skilled caregivers. Besides, considerable neglect and domestic abuse of the elderly was also found in some <b>private</b> <b>homes.</b> In addition, the peripheral location of <b>private</b> <b>homes</b> within public health framework and inadequate state palliative policy, including stringent narcotic regulations, accentuated the problems of home care. Conclusion: The study concludes by questioning the rhetoric of <b>private</b> <b>homes</b> as spaces for the dying elderly in Kolkata and suggests remedial measures to improve their capacity to deliver care...|$|R

5|$|A {{range of}} the fortifications were {{opened to the public}} in the post-war years. Deal, Hurst, Pendennis and Portland opened in the 1950s, and Southsea in 1967.

Visitor numbers vary across the sites; Southsea Castle, for example, received over 90,000 visitors in 2011–12. Other forts were put to different uses: Netley was first used a nursing home, and then converted into private flats; Brownsea became a corporate hotel for the employees of the John Lewis Partnership; and Sandgate was restored in the 1970s to form a <b>private</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hampton National Historic Site, in the Hampton area {{north of}} Towson, Baltimore County, Maryland, USA, {{preserves}} {{a remnant of}} a vast 18th-century estate, including a Georgian manor house, gardens, grounds, and the original stone slave quarters. The estate was owned by the Ridgely family for seven generations, from 1745 to 1948. The Hampton Mansion was the largest <b>private</b> <b>home</b> in America when it was completed in 1790 and today {{is considered to be}} one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the U.S. Its furnishings, together with the estate's slave quarters and other preserved structures, provide insight into the life of late 18th-century and early 19th-century landowning aristocracy. In 1948, Hampton was the first site selected as a National Historical Site for its architectural significance by the U.S. National Park Service. The grounds were widely admired in the 19th century for their elaborate parterres or formal gardens, which have been restored to resemble their appearance during the 1820s. Several trees are more than 200years old. In addition to the mansion and grounds, visitors may tour the overseer's house and slave quarters.|$|E

5|$|Stern House, a <b>private</b> <b>home</b> {{in which}} Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. The house {{had become a}} Zionist shrine, with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though {{the house had been}} heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition. The two-story masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work. The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E
5|$|The Carrick Hotel is a two-storey brick {{building}} {{with an iron}} hip roof built in 1833. It is the only licensed premises in Carrick and has been operated as a hotel for the entire of its history. The hotel has been sold and the licence transferred numerous times, including the first instance from John Taylor to Thomas Archer on 12 August 1839, and was called the Hotel Marella from November 1945 to December 1952.John Rudge built the Plough Inn in 1841, though it was referred to in an 1842 survey map as the Carrick Inn. It is a two-story {{brick building}} with an iron roof and 12-panel windows. John Archer was the Inn's first licensee, but by 1863 {{it was no longer}} operating and the building was offered for lease.

5|$|The {{school was}} still {{operating}} in 1937, though a public request {{had been made}} for regular transport to take children to the Hagley District School, in consequence of the Hadspen school's impending closure. Children from the town began attending the Hagley school in March 1938. By {{the middle of the}} same year a tender was approved by the Minister of Education for regular school transport. The transport was also for students from nearby Carrick., whose school closed in the 1930s. The school building was finally removed; a tender in 1944 called for it to be removed and re-erected at Falmouth. Schools have also been run in other town buildings, including a hall near the Anglican church, that was used for worship before the church's completion, in what is now the Uniting Church and also in another building that later became a <b>private</b> <b>home.</b> In the 21st century there are no schools remaining in Hadspen.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of places of worship in Summer Hill. St Patrick's Catholic Church was built in 1874, and is the oldest known {{building}} in the suburb. There is also a small primary school associated with the church and located next to it. The building was originally a <b>private</b> <b>home</b> known as Kelvin Grove, and owned by Mrs Jane Drynan. Much of the exterior of the church is original but none of the internal walls were retained when the building was converted into a church. Following Drynan's death, Kelvin Grove was owned or leased by a succession of different people, including the Haberfield real-estate developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s Kelvin Grove may have been used as a nursing home. The first mass was celebrated in Kelvin Grove on St Patrick's day 1946, giving the church its name.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a <b>private</b> <b>home</b> or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E
