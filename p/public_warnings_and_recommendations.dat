40|$|Obesity {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{to be among the}} principal causes of many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, monitoring, controlling, and preventing obesity will mitigate the risks generated from the complications of these diseases. Comprehensive preventive measures are essential to control the spread of obesity, while healthcare systems should be organized on the basis of locally derived data to provide adequate and affordable care to the increasing groups of overweight and obese people. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that relies on both data collected from sensors and participatory data collected from a social network community established to provide value-added obesity awareness, monitoring, and prevention. The model encompasses some key smart features including tracking food intake, lifestyle, and exercise activities, generating <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations,</b> <b>and</b> triggering interventions whenever needed. Our model also mines the collected data to produce statistical analysis that can be used by health authorities to have a clear picture of the health status of the population and might help in making rational and informed decisions.

40|$|Barmah Forest virus (BFV) is a {{commonly}} occurring arbovirus in Australia. Notifications of Barmah Forest infections diagnosed {{by a single}} positive IgM serology test have been increasing in coastal New South Wales north of Newcastle. We report on a 6 month prospective review of all routine notifications of BFV from the Lower Mid North Coast of New South Wales. Sera from 37 consecutive cases were sent for confirmatory testing by ELISA and neutralisation assays and 32 cases were interviewed. On confirmatory testing, 7 patients' sera (19 %) was found to contain no BFV antibodies and 6 (16 %) had BFV IgG only. Only 4 cases had antibody levels compatible with recent infection.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study is to identify the dimensions implied by female entrepreneurialism, especially its potential economic contribution to national growth, its specificities, or the analysis of public or private initiatives willing to promote it. Thus, our goal is to issue a number of hypotheses as well as <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> for the launch of specific initiatives towards women entrepreneurship. Female entrepreneurship is often considered as an insufficiently-exploited source of economic growth. The recent evolutions of the labour market forced number of women to create their own position so that they can balance their working and family lives with the drive to succeed on a meaningful project. Women entrepreneurs create employment for themselves and for others, sometimes in order to cater for needs a common employee status cannot fill (schedule and/or family obligations). Thanks to their specificities as managers dealing with common business issues such as organisation, they also bring their own potential to society.

40|$|Background and objectives: Bats are {{recognized}} as a major reservoir of lyssaviruses; however, no bat lyssavirus has been isolated in Asia except for Aravan and Khujand virus in Central Asia. All Chinese lyssavirus isolates in previous reports have been of species rabies virus, mainly from dogs. Following at least two recent bat-associated human rabies-like cases in northeast China, we have initiated {{a study of the}} prevalence of lyssaviruses in bats in Jilin province and their public health implications. A bat lyssavirus has been isolated and its pathogenicity in mice and genomic alignment have been determined. Results: We report the first isolation of a bat lyssavirus in China, from the brain of a northeastern bat, Murina leucogaster. Its nucleoprotein gene shared 92. 4 %/ 98. 9 % (nucleotide) and 92. 2 %/ 98. 8 % (amino acid) identity with the two known Irkut virus isolates from Russia, and was designated IRKV-THChina 12. Following intracranial and intramuscular injection, IRKV-THChina 12 produced rabies-like symptoms in adult mice with a short inoculation period and high mortality. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that IRKV-THChina 12 has the same genomic organization as other lyssaviruses and its isolation provides an independent origin for the species IRKV. Conclusions: We have identified the existence of a bat lyssavirus in a common Chinese bat species. Its high pathogenicity in adult mice suggests that <b>public</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> medical education regarding bat bites in China should be increased, and tha...|$|R
40|$|The Tagus estuary is {{bordered by}} the largest {{metropolitan}} area in Portugal, the Lisbon capital city council. It has suffered {{the impact of}} several major tsunamis in the past, as shown by a recent revision of the catalogue of tsunamis that struck the Portuguese coast {{over the past two}} millennia. Hence, the exposure of populations and infrastructure established along the riverfront comprises a critical concern for the civil protection services. The main objectives of this work are to determine critical inundation areas in Lisbon and to quantify the associated severity through a simple index derived from the local maximum of momentum flux per unit mass and width. The employed methodology is based on the mathematical modelling of a tsunami propagating along the estuary, resembling the one occurred on the 1 November of 1755 that followed the 8. 5 M-w Great Lisbon Earthquake. The employed simulation tool was STAV- 2 D, a shallow-flow solver coupled with conservation equations for fine solid phases, and now featuring the novelty of discrete Lagrangian tracking of large debris. Different sets of initial conditions were studied, combining distinct tidal, atmospheric and fluvial scenarios, so that the civil protection services were provided with comprehensive information to devise <b>public</b> <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> alert systems and post-event mitigation intervention.
