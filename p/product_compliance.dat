50|$|A {{number of}} {{standards}} organizations exist that promulgate safety standards. These may be voluntary organizations or government agencies. These agencies first define the safety standards, which they publish {{in the form}} of codes.

40|$|Historical {{examples}} of the deleterious effects of hazardous drugs were described. They were shown to lead to federal legis-lation controlling R&D in the pharmaceutical industry. Safety evaluation R&D extensively utilizes standardized toxicological methodology. Because of this, independent contract research laboratories {{have been able to}} provide professional services in standardized toxicology to the pharmaceutical industry. A case interview study employing prepared questionnaire forms was con-ducted, R&D managers in both the pharmaceutical companies and the independent contract research laboratories were interviewed in order to compare the management of standardized toxicological methodology as it applies to safety evaluation. The results of standardized toxicological studies form the basis for determining the safety of drugs. These data, as summarized in petition form, are evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration in order to determine <b>product</b> <b>compliance</b> with federal law. A model of the interrelationship between the FDA, the pharmaceutical com-pany, the independent contract research laboratory and the consumer, was presented as existing through information feedback systems based on safety evaluation R&D. This model was used to explain past R&D efforts associated with cause and effect relationships in-volving product safety associated with drugs. The management of R&D involving <b>product</b> <b>compliance</b> is shown {{for the first time in}} this study.

The results suggest that a public constraint on private sampling strategies may be a relevant regulatory tool, which has not been considered up until now for the regulation of GM/non-GM coexistence in supply chains.

This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century.

40|$|A CNC {{machine tool}} {{performance}} {{depends on the}} machine accuracy status which {{is very important to}} determine the end <b>product</b> <b>compliance</b> to the specification. The accuracy of the machine can be measured and analyzed; hence the errors' impact can be predicted on a workpiece. This paper presents three types of accuracy tests performed on a CNC Vertical Machining Centre, how the accuracy status affect the end product quality and what are the corrective actions to be taken. First, the laser test to determine the linear positioning accuracy, second the ball bar test to determine the circularity accuracy and third, the static accuracy test to determine the machine current static accuracy status and finally the cutting test to determine the actual machine accuracy effect on a work piece. Machine tool's errors can be diagnosed and minimize or eliminated by either electronic compensation or mechanical maintenance and sometimes both need to be done. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} a successful technology transfer of Gaussian Process (GP) modelling, {{also known as}} kriging, {{to the field of}} industrial metrology. <b>Product</b> <b>compliance</b> to geometrical specifications typically requires an automated inspection cycle operated by a computer controlled machine which sequentially probes the part surface at a small sample of locations.
