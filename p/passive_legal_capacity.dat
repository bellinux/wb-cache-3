40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} named "Legal <b>capacity</b> and related <b>legal</b> proceedings" is to {{introduce}} <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> and related <b>legal</b> proceedings with {{the focus on the}} procedural legislation. <b>Legal</b> <b>capacity</b> is a natural component of each natural person and it is not allowed to be removed. <b>Legal</b> <b>capacity</b> is acquired at birth and is retained until death. Sometime, due to protection of rights of a person, <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> might be restricted. This thesis is divided up into ten parts. The largerst part is focused on legal proceeding which lead to restriction of a person's <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> ie. restriction of an aspect of personal status. Nevertheless, the thesis introduces also legal proceeding leading to prolongation of time of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> restrictions and proceeding concerning <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of a child.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of minors. The main issue is an extent and {{circumstances}} under which minors are legally incapacitated to oblige themselves and to influence their own legal relationships. The thesis is divided into four main parts. The first part {{is focused on}} general definition of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> and the basic concepts of dealing with limited <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> Second part is dealing with evolution of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> from the foundations set by roman law, it's development on Czech territory to the approval of recent civil code and development in Germany. Third part contains an interpretation of German legislation. I pursue the German legislation first because it is very sophisticated and provides us with plenty of vantage points on {{different aspects of the}} Czech legislation. The part dedicated to the German legislation subdivided into two chapters, where the first one focuses on general characteristics of the legislation and the principle of graduated <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of minors and the second part deals with minors without <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> and minors with limited <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> In the fourth part the Czech legislation is analyzed.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> proceedings, which are the {{procedural}} reflection of legislation of restriction on <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> included in the Civil code. The <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> is the key legal institution for the human possibility to make a juridical acts. In some cases, it is neccessary, for the reason of protection of human, to restrict on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> eventually to choose another preferable measure. Procedural regulation of these proceedings is, with effect from 1. 1. 2014, contained in the Code on Special Court Proceedings (Act No. 292 / 2013 Coll.), as it comprises certain derogations from classic contentious proceedings. The aim of the thesis is to comprehensively summarise and interpret this legislation including her relation on the substantive regulation, point out her faults and propose options, how to remove them. To this purpose, opinions of experts and present case law regarding these matters are in the thesis also confronted. The thesis consists of three main chapters, which are subdivided into some subchapters and sections. The content of this three chapters is the general delimitation of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> the excursion {{into the history of}} <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> and the procedural regulation of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> proceedings. The aim of the first chapter is to introduce the concept of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Within law {{and legal}} {{scholarship}} {{there are different}} models of legal personality and <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> The most well known of these emphasises individual rationality, and is distilled into the medico-legal concept of ‘mental capacity’. In connection with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) {{a new approach to}} legal personality is being developed, emphasising relationships of support and recognition of universal <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> Recent scholarship on both ‘mental capacity’ and CRPD approaches to <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> has drawn from feminist writings on relational autonomy. In this paper, I use this scholarship on relational autonomy to explore the differences between these approaches to <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> I argue that the approach connected with the CRPD offers a refreshing take on the importance of relationships of support in exercising <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, despite their pronounced differences, especially in relation to the legitimacy of coercion, there are remarkable similarities in the underlying challenges for each approach: the extent to which others can ‘know’ our authentic and autonomous selves, and the inextricable relationships of power that all forms of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> are embedded within...|$|R
40|$|Does <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> {{matter in}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) ? The {{conventional}} wisdom is that the “right perseveres over might ” under the WTO’s more legalistic dispute settlement system. Yet, others stress that members can only {{take advantage of the}} rule of law if they have the resources to protect their rights through litigation. Despite all the interest in this topic, there is virtually no empirical evidence about how <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> affects patterns of litigation and import protection. Using an original survey of WTO delegations, we construct a novel index of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> and include this in a study of 1321 antidumping (AD) investigations between 1995 and 2005 by 17 WTO Members against firms located in 33 countries. We hypothesize that Members with more <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> are more likely to challenge AD suits brought against them at the WTO, and less likely to be named in AD petitions in the first place. The results strongly bear out our expectations; <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> matters. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) {{is being}} used to argue for wider {{recognition}} of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of people with mental disabilities. This raises a question about the implications of the Convention for attributions of criminal responsibility. The present paper works towards an answer by analysing the relationship between <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> in relation to personal decisions and criminal acts. Its central argument is that because moral and political considerations play an essential role in setting the relevant standards, <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> in the context of personal decisions and criminal acts should not be thought of as {{two sides of the same}} coin. The implications of particular moral or political norms are likely to be different in these two legal contexts, and this may justify asymmetries in the relevant standards for <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, the analysis highlights a fundamental question about how much weight moral or political considerations should be given in setting these standards, and this is used to frame a challenge to those calling for significantly wider recognition of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of people with mental disabilities on the basis of the Convention...|$|R
40|$|This study's main {{objective}} is to analyze certain effects produced by the changes of the Labor Code and by the entry into force of the current Romanian Civil Code. These effects refer {{to one of the}} fundamental conditions for the valid conclusion of the individual employment contract, that is, to the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of employers and employees. Thus, a complete analysis of legal regulations and of the correlations between different provisions on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of parties to the individual employment contract is required to identify the existing noncompliance and to propose solutions. The research demonstrated that the current regulatory framework governing the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of the parties to an individual employment contract does not entirely correspond to the social reality. Therefore, only the employer benefits from a relatively comprehensive statutory regulation on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> to conclude an individual employment contract. The employee, however, does not benefit from the same attention from legislature. Considering the above, the study represents a significant scientific contribution, whose value lies in the proposed changes to modify legislature, so that the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of job holders would benefit from fair regulation, in accordance with the principle of legal protection of employee rights...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} mentally {{disabling}} conditions on <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> are escalating, particularly given the ageing Australian demographic.

Assessing when a person has lost <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> in this context is an ever-increasing concern facing society as a whole but, in particular, the legal and medical professionals conducting the assessments. Empirical and doctrinal research has been undertaken which canvassed legal and medical opinions about the relationship between members of these professions when assessing <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> This research supports the hypothesis that tensions exist when assessing capacity, especially testamentary capacity. One source of tension is the effect of conflicting evidence about the loss of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> given by <b>legal</b> and medical professionals in court, which raises questions such as: which evidence is, and should be, preferred; and who should be responsible? The exploration of these issues will be conducted with reference to the empirical data collected, and a review of the relevant Australian case law...|$|R
