The practical graphs refer to those graphs where nodes vary {{in shape and}} size used in real world applications, such as flowcharts, UML diagrams, E-R diagrams. A robust model has been developed <b>for</b> <b>practical</b> graphs. This model supports the development of automatic layout techniques <b>for</b> <b>practical</b> graphs {{and the development of}} the linkage between the graph structure and applications. Automatic layout <b>for</b> <b>practical</b> graphs is demonstrated and two case studies <b>for</b> <b>practical</b> graph applications are presented...|$|R
