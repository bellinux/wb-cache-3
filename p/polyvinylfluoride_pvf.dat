Radiometers using PVF were {{developed}} that exhibit high sensitivity and frequency response. Normalized detectivities of greater than 10 to the 8 th power cm/Hz/w and responsivities on the order of 100, 000 V/W were measured (500 C BB source, 0. 1 Hz chopping frequency and 1 Hz bandwidth. ...|$|E
40|$|Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) {{films are}} known to be protein-repelling and to reduce biofilms attachment. We use a simple, easy to set up, {{versatile}} atmospheric pressure radiofrequency plasma to deposit plasma-polymerized poly(ethylene glycol) films onto <b>polyvinylfluoride</b> (<b>PVF)</b> and gold surfaces, using liquid or gaseous tetraglyme (CH 3 O(CH 2 CH 2 O) (4) CH 3) as precursor. The chemical composition of the films was studied using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ions mass spectroscopy. Bovine Serum Albumin adsorption has revealed good biocompatible properties that are correlated to the surface composition...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of our}} {{research}} on materials for concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), we are evaluating the optical properties and solar radiation durability {{of a number of}} polymeric materials with potential CPV application. For optical materials in imaging or non-imaging optical systems, detailed knowledge of the wavelength dependent complex index of refraction is important for optical system design and performance. Here we report the index of refraction, optical absorbance and haze results of various polymers of interest for CPV systems. Fluoropolymers such as <b>polyvinylfluoride</b> (Tedlar® <b>PVF</b> Film), which has wide application in crystalline silicon (c-Si) flat plate PV modules, as well as poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (Teflon...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} composites {{are subjected}} {{to a wide range}} of mechanical loads and environmental conditions, such as wind, high/low temperature, moisture, UV light and aggressive solvents. Compared to other structural materials, polymers can absorb more moisture and UV light from outside environment and lose their material properties (e. g., mechanical, electrical, surface and thermal) and thus the service life. In this study, hydrophobic barrier films including <b>polyvinylfluoride</b> (<b>PVF)</b> and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) were applied on the carbon, Kevlar, and glass fiber reinforced epoxy resin composites (laminate and sandwich structures), and then the effects of moisture absorption on those films were investigated in detail. The coupons were immersed in water for a number of days in order to determine the changes in mechanical properties of the composites. Three point bending tests were applied to the laminate composites, while four point bending tests were conducted on the Nomex sandwich structured composites. We found that moisture absorption could be eliminated by using these hydrophobic films. We found that PEEK film could be an alternative barrier film for the aircraft industry...|$|E
