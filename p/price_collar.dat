40|$|We compare several {{emissions}} reduction instruments, including quantity policies with banking and borrowing, price policies, and hybrid policies (safety valve and <b>price</b> <b>collar),</b> using a dynamic model with stochastic baseline emissions. The instruments are compared under the design goal of obtaining the same expected cumulative emissions across all options. Based on simulation analysis with the model parameterized to values relevant to proposed U. S. climate mitigation policies, {{we find that}} restrictions on banking and borrowing, including the provision of interest rates on the borrowings, can severely limit {{the value of the}} policy, depending on the regulator-chosen allowance issuance path. Although emissions taxes generally provide the lowest expected abatement costs, a cap-and-trade system combined with either a safety valve or a <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> can be designed to provide expected abatement costs near those of a tax, but with lower emissions variance than a tax. Consistently, a <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> is more cost-effective than a safety valve for a given expected cumulative emissions outcome because it encourages inexpensive abatement when abatement costs decline. cost containment, safety valve, <b>price</b> <b>collar,</b> climate change...|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis proves how unforeseen macroeconomic conditions can affect policies {{aimed at reducing}} and stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. It has made voters uneasy about potential climate policy that could raise energy costs and unemployment. To improve the political stability of any policy agreement emerging from this December’s annual meeting on the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen, and to ensure the comparability of commitments and ease the inclusion of developing countries, the authors propose that the UNFCCC supplement emissions targets with a <b>price</b> <b>collar.</b> This paper outlines an example that shows that a <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> can have a negligible expected impact on the outcome that matters most for the climate—increasing emissions. ...|$|E

First, it is {{shown that the}} hybrid systems under investigation (price floor using a minimum price guarantee, <b>price</b> <b>collar,</b> allowance reserve, options offered by the regulator, and offset relaxation) can be decomposed into a combination of an ordinary cap-and-trade scheme with European- or American-style call and put options. Then, we quantify and discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the proposed hybrid schemes by investigating whether pre-set objectives (enforcement of permit price bounds and reduction of the compliance costs for relevant companies) can be accomplished while maintaining the original environmental targets. Plain vanilla options are proposed as an alternative that reconciles the otherwise conflicting policy objectives.

40|$|We use a {{stochastic}} dynamic {{framework to}} compare <b>price</b> <b>collars</b> (<b>price</b> ceilings and floors) in a cap-and-trade system. Sources of uncertainty include shocks to baseline emissions, affecting corresponding abatement costs, and shocks to {{the supply of}} offsets. We consider a continuum between soft collars, which have a limited volume of additional emission allowances (a reserve) available at the price ceiling, and hard collars, which provide an unlimited supply of additional allowances, thereby preventing allowance prices from exceeding the price ceiling. For all cases considered, we set the price floors and ceiling such that the expected cumulative emissions net of offsets are equal to the cumulative allowances. Consequently, increasing {{the size of the}} allowance reserve requires higher price ceilings and floors, and a lower probability of reaching the ceiling. Across most parameter values examined, we find that increasing the size of the allowance reserve leads to lower expected net present values of compliance costs, although the differences are not large. However, when offset supply shocks are highly persistent and exhibit strong (negative) correlation with baseline emission shocks, hard collars deliver noticeably lower expected costs, though with a wider range of emission outcomes than the soft collars...|$|R

40|$|Price collars have {{frequently}} been advocated {{to restrict the}} price of emissions per-mits. Consequently, collars were incorporated in the three bills languishing in Congress {{as well as in}} Californias AB- 32; Europeans are now considering price collars for EU ETS. In advocating collars, most analysts have assumed (1) collars will be implemented by government purchases and sales from bu¤erstocks, just like bands on foreign ex-change rates or commodity prices; and (2) 8 ̆ 5 rms must surrender permits whenever they pollute. In fact, however, no actual emissions trading scheme has conformed to these assumptions. In the current paper, we maintain the second assumption (contin-ual compliance) and show that while a <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> supported by a su ¢ ciently large bu¤erstock can restrict permit prices, a <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> supported instead by auctions with reserve prices cannot. In a companion paper (Hasegawa and Salant, 2012), we show that neither method works once account is taken of delayed compliance...|$|E

We discuss how hybrid schemes such as the price floor, <b>price</b> <b>collar,</b> allowance reserve, options offered by the regulator and offset relaxation are related to an ordinary cap-and-trade system and analyze whether hybrid schemes are able to guarantee price bounds and reduce the price volatility.

40|$|We use a {{stochastic}} dynamic {{framework to}} compare price collars (price ceilings and floors) in a cap-and-trade system with {{uncertainty in the}} level of baseline emissions and costs. We consider soft collars, which provide limited volume of additional emission allowances (a reserve) at the price ceiling, and hard collars, which provide an unlimited supply of additional allowances, thereby preventing allowance prices from exceeding the price ceiling. Conversely, allowances are removed from the market if prices fall to the floor. We find that increasing the size of the reserve strictly lowers expected net present values of compliance costs; however, there is a diminishing effect as the allowance reserve is expanded. Most of the expected cost savings are achieved with a modest reserve. Consequently, a rather limited soft <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> could provide considerable assurance about cost while preventing the possibility that emissions could spiral out of control...|$|E

40|$|The revenue risk is {{of great}} {{importance}} to ensure {{the success of a}} real toll public–private partnership (PPP) transportation project. Past research has proposed a revenue guarantee put option as an alternative way to quantify and potentially manage this risk. A practical, or commercial, limitation of this type of option is its requirement for an upfront premium payment, and a concessionaire is likely to shy away from additional monetary requirements. A collar option, which is a combination of a put and call option, not only overcomes this barrier but it also provides other benefits. Modifications to the basic collar’s structure can redistribute downside losses and upside profits to fulfil stakeholders’ needs and thus improve the effectiveness of risk management. The terms, applicability and limitations of a collar option are discussed, and a numerical example is developed to illustrate how to determine the strike <b>prices</b> of a <b>collar</b> option.

5000|$|According to {{the first}} approach, {{investor}} attention can be approximated with particular financial market-based measures. According to Gervais et al. (2001) and Hou et al. (2009), trading volume is a good proxy for investor sentiment. High (low) trading volume on a particular stock leads to appreciating (depreciating) of its price. Extreme one-day returns are also reported to draw investors’ attention (Barber & Odean (2008)). Noise traders tend to buy (sell) stocks with high (low) returns. Whaley (2001) and Baker & Wurgler (2007) suggest Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) as an alternative market sentiment measure. Credit Suisse Fear Barometer (CSFB) is based on <b>prices</b> of zero-premium <b>collars</b> that expire in three months. This index is sometimes used {{as an alternative to}} VIX index. The Acertus Market Sentiment Indicator (AMSI) incorporates five variables (in descending order of weight in the indicator): Price/Earnings Ratio (a measure of stock market valuations); price momentum (a measure of market psychology); Realized Volatility (a measure of recent historical risk); High Yield Bond Returns (a measure of credit risk); and the TED spread (a measure of systemic financial risk). Each of these factors provides a measure of market sentiment through a unique lens, and together they may offer a more robust indicator of market sentiment. Closed-end fund discount (the case when net asset value of a mutual fund does not equal to its market price) reported to be possible measure of investor attention (Zweig (1973) and Lee et al. (1991)). The studies suggest an evidence that changes in discounts of closed-end funds are highly correlated with fluctuations in investor sentiment. Brown et al. (2003) investigate daily mutual fund flow as possible measure of investor attention. According to Da et al. (2014), [...] "...individual investors switch from equity funds to bond funds when negative sentiment is high." [...] Dividend premium (the difference between the average book-to-market ratios of dividend paying and not paying stocks) potentially can be a good predictor for investor sentiment (Baker & Wurgler (2004) and Vieira (2011)). Retail investor trades data is also reported to be able to represent investor attention (Kumar & Lee (2006)). The study shows that retail investor transactions [...] "...are systematically correlated — that is, individuals buy (or sell) stocks in concert". Initial Public Offering (IPO) of a company generate a big amount of information that can potentially be used to proxy investor sentiment. Ljungqvist et al. (2006) and Baker & Wurgler (2007) report IPO first-day returns and IPO volume the most promising candidates for predicting investor attention to a particular stock. It is not surprising that high investments in advertisement of a particular company results in a higher investor attention to corresponding stock (Grullon et al. (2004)). The authors in Chemmanur & Yan (2009) provide an evidence that [...] "...a greater amount of advertising is associated with a larger stock return in the advertising year but a smaller stock return in the year subsequent to the advertising year." [...] Equity issues over total new issues ratio, insider trading data, and other financial indicators are reported in Baker & Wurgler (2007) to be useful in investor attention measurement procedure.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{issues related}} to a market channel. The first essay uses IRI coffee data to estimate six games that model retail-manufacturer interaction with a mixed Logit demand specification. The six games include a vertical integration model, a vertical Nash game, a manufacturer Stackelberg game, a generalized manufacturer Stackelberg game, a retailer Stackelberg game and a generalized retail Stackelberg. The best-fit generalized manufacturer Stackelberg game indicates that coffee manufacturers have significant channel power and price transmission is very poor in the US ground coffee market. The second essay develops a <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> theory for linking prices in a market channel by regulation to redress channel power. Under certain conditions changes in post-regulation retail, wholesale, and input factor prices can be predicted. The theory is then applied to the Southern New England fluid milk market to demonstrate how price collars {{can be used to}} eliminate excessive profits. The third essay develops an efficient bargaining framework in a multi-brand setup and applies it to analyzing the strategic effect of private label products. Empirical results show that private label gives retailers bargaining power over factory brands in the Boston fluid milk market. ...|$|E
40|$|Current and {{proposed}} greenhouse gas cap-and-trade systems allow regulated entities to offset abatement requirements by paying unregulated entities to abate. These offsets from unregulated entities {{are believed to}} contain system costs and stabilize allowance prices. However, the supply of offsets is highly uncertain and may be correlated with other sources of uncertainty in emissions trading systems. This paper presents a model that incorporates both uncertainties in the supply of offsets and in abatement costs. We numerically solve a dynamic stochastic model, with parameters relevant to the U. S. climate debate, {{under a variety of}} parameter settings, including a system that includes allowance price controls, risk aversion, and competitive offset purchasing. We find that as uncertainty in offsets and uncertainty in abatement costs become more negatively correlated, expected abatement plus offset purchase costs increase, as does the variability in allowance prices and emissions from the regulated sector. These results are amplified with risk sensitivity, larger annual offset limits, and competitive offset purchasing. Imposing an allowance <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> substantially mitigates cost increases as well as the variability in prices, while roughly maintaining expected environmental outcomes. In contrast with previous literature we find a collar may also mitigate emissions variability. climate change, offsets, cap-and-trade, price collars, stochastic dynamic programming...|$|E
40|$|Should milk be {{priced at}} $ 2. 00 or $ 6. 00 per gallon, {{or for that}} matter at any other price? What determines the value of milk? Recently at least one {{observer}} has stated opposition to the proposed <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> “compact plus ” policy because it doesn’t reflect the “full value ” of milk. Well, when is milk undervalued? Economics has another name. It is often appropriately called the theory of value. Over the past 200 years different economists have advanced different general economic or value theories. David Ricardo, in the early 19 th century, proffered what is now called the Ricardian or Classical Theory of Value. In a classical economy prices are determined by the costs of production. Ricardo talked of three: rent for land, wages for labor, and profits for capital. Marx unsuccessfully tried to convince the world that there is one input, labor, and that all value comes from it: the labor theory of value. Around 1890 a group of British economists from Cambridge and Oxford led by William Stanley Jevons and Alfred Marshall created the economic theory that is the basis for today’s science. It is called the neoclassical theory of value or neoclassical economics. At its core is the concept of a market where suppliers offer their products a...|$|E
40|$|The central {{pillar of}} European climate policy, the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), is {{currently}} under scrutiny, as the allowance price is persistently low at around 58 ̆ 0 /tCO 2. The cap was met and emissions actually declined in recent years, ensuring the environmental {{effectiveness of the}} scheme. However, the low price may affect the long-term cost-effectiveness of the instrument by reducing the incentive for investment and deployment of low carbon technologies. No {{significant increase in the}} allowance price is expected before 2020, and probably not beyond, without reform. While the reasons for the price decline are controversial, empirical analysis shows that {{only a small portion of}} price fluctuations can be explained by factors such as the economic crisis, renewable deployment or international offsets. Therefore, it is likely that political factors and regulatory uncertainty have played a key role in the price decline. As a consequence, any reform of the EU ETS has to deliver a mechanism that reduces such uncertainty and stabilizes expectations of market participants. The Market Stability Reserve proposed by the EU Commission is unlikely to address the current problem of price uncertainty and insufficient dynamic efficiency. The key element of the alternative reform proposal described in this paper is to set a <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> in the EU ETS with lower and upper boundaries. This is likely to reinforce the long-term credibility and reliability of the price signal. In addition, a price for GHG emissions not covered by the EU ETS has to be set. If additional market failures prevent the market from functioning efficiently, specific policy instruments related to innovation and technology diffusion should be implemented in addition to carbon pricing. Carbon leakage could be addressed through tailor-made trade policies. In parallel, increasing the coalition of countries included in the carbon pricing should remain a priority. This reform package would bring the EU ETS back to life, while avoiding a relapse into potentially costly and inefficient national climate and energy policies...|$|E
40|$|This {{briefing}} {{provides an}} overview {{and analysis of the}} key details of the Australian Government’s recent Clean Energy Future package. If it passes parliament later this year, the scheme, which includes an initial carbon price of $AU 23 per ton CO 2 e, will end a policy log jam spanning almost a decade. The scheme is due to take effect from July 2012. Below are a few of The Climate Group’s key takeaways from the plan: Walking the tightrope. The initial price of $ 23 a ton is a good balance between a starting point that means something and one that is politically feasible Certainty at last. Businesses now have the detail they {{need to look at the}} costs and opportunities that this presents. Once it is passed, it will deliver long overdue certainty and confidence to the market, unlocking crucial investment. The transition from a fixed price to a market based price is “hard wired” into the scheme and an initial <b>price</b> <b>collar</b> and ceiling will provide a buffer against price fluctuations More than a carbon price. The complementary measures and funding contained alongside the price on carbon will encourage the growth of innovative, green technologies and jobs Communication will be key. Julia Gillard still has a tough battle to convince the Australian public that this package is a good idea. The government has not sold the idea well so far, reflected by the fact that 58 %were opposed to a carbon tax, with 14 % unsure just prior to the announcement. The change in language from the government from talking about a carbon tax to a clean energy future is a good start Australia may surprise itself. The fixed price may lead to more abatement than the treasury modeling predicts. Previous emissions trading schemes in New South Wales and around the world have achieved higher reductions for lower cost than predicted at the outset.  Treasury modeling also doesn’t include the extra impact that the negotiated closure of power stations in the scheme will hav...|$|E
