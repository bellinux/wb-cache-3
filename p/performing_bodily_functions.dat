50|$|Embarrassment can be personal, {{caused by}} {{unwanted}} attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps. Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, {{such as being}} caught in a lie or in making a mistake, losing badly in a competition, or being caught <b>performing</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>functions</b> such as flatulence. In many cultures, being seen nude or inappropriately dressed is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see modesty). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation—such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behaviour, discovering one {{is the victim of}} gossip, being rejected by another person (see also humiliation), being made the focus of attention (e.g., birthday celebrants, newlyweds), or even witnessing someone else's embarrassment.|$|E

50|$|The {{gameplay}} of L.O.L.: Lack of Love {{revolves around}} the player's control of a single creature placed on an alien planet during robotic terraforming. The player must cause the creature to evolve into a new form by communicating with other living creatures, establishing symbiotic relationships with them, and thus helping them. The game is non-linear, lacking a HUD almost entirely and requiring the player to simply remain alive. This {{can be done by}} helping, or eating other creatures, as well as <b>performing</b> various <b>bodily</b> <b>functions</b> including sleeping and urinating.|$|R
50|$|The camp {{facilities}} were ammunition depots {{belonging to the}} former Yugoslav Army, consisting of four hangars marked 0, 1, 2, and 3, and three solitary confinement cells. The hangar size was 200 square metres, and up to 500 persons were held inside each. The detainees were exhausted by starvation and thirst, and were tortured. Ten litres of water were provided per 500 persons per day, so many drank urine to quench their thirst. The detainees had to <b>perform</b> their <b>bodily</b> <b>functions</b> in the hangars. They were forced to sing Croatian nationalist songs and to listen to lectures on how correct Croatian policies were.|$|R
50|$|Conjoined {{twins are}} at high risk to being {{stillborn}} or dying shortly after birth. In some cases, a healthy twin and a parasitic twin are born. The parasitic twin has no hope for survival and dies and is then surgically separated from its twin. Depending upon how the twins are attached and what is shared among them, complications can arise from surgically separating the live twin from the dead twin. In Ischiopagus cases, the children share a pelvic region along with the gastrointestinal tract and genital region. Most Ischiopagus twins will need reconstruction surgery of the genitals and the gastrointestinal tract tract so that the twin will be able to <b>perform</b> normal <b>bodily</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|MODAM is {{permanently}} encased {{within an}} exo-skeletal shell of life-supporting machinery which augments her musculature, provides mobility, and <b>performs</b> various <b>bodily</b> <b>functions.</b> Sensors equipped throughout the exoskeleton monitor both her body's functions and the system's mechanical functions and transmit this data telemetrically to AIM headquarters. Thus they monitor both her blood sugar level and her rocket fuel level. MODAM {{is equipped with}} two telescoping tentacle-like arms within which her own arms fit. Each terminates in a pronged [...] "hand". Maximum elongation of these arms is 15 ft. MODAM's [...] "hover-chair" [...] contains anti-gravity generators enabling it to hover and chemically fueled rocket boosters to propel it. MODAM's musculature is atrophied (at least proportionally) while her head has been enlarged, thus she is physically dependent on the exoskeleton provided by her hover-chair for physical support and movement.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Importance of Water Quality in Aquaculture Fish <b>perform</b> {{all their}} <b>bodily</b> <b>functions</b> in water. Because fish are totally {{dependent}} upon water to breathe, feed, grow, excrete wastes, maintain a salt balance, and reproduce, understanding {{the physical and}} chemical qualities of water is critical to successful aquaculture. To a great extent, water determines {{the success or failure}} of an aquaculture operation. Physical Characteristics of Water Water can hold large amounts of heat with a relatively small change in temperature. This heat capacity has far reaching implications. It permits a body of water to act as a buffer against wide fluctuations in temperature. The larger the body of water, the slower the rate of temperature change. Furthermore, aquatic organisms take on the temperature of their environment and cannot tolerate rapid changes in temperature. Water has very unique density qualities. Most liquids become denser as they become cooler. Water, however, gets denser as...|$|R

50|$|A {{fair number}} of baby talk and nursery words refer to <b>bodily</b> <b>functions</b> or the genitals, partly because the words are {{relatively}} easy to pronounce. Also, {{if a child is}} very young, <b>bodily</b> <b>functions</b> such as urination and defecation may be quite exciting for them. Scientific terms may be harder for them to understand and pronounce, so baby talk may be more convenient for a young child. Moreover, such words reduce adults' discomfort with the subject matter, and make it possible for children to discuss such things without breaking adult taboos. However, some, such as pee-pee and poo-poo have been very widely used in reference to <b>bodily</b> <b>functions</b> {{to the point that they}} are considered to be standard words, so ability to mention such subjects without adult negativity has recently faded.|$|R
