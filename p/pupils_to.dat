5|$|A {{junior and}} infant {{department}} opened in September 1997 after {{the closure of}} St Audrey's Convent school. St Audrey's was a feeder school, and its closure allowed the then headmaster, Robert Repper, to transfer most of the teaching staff to the new junior school. The junior and infant school {{has now become a}} preparatory school for the senior school. It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005, a reference to a 17th-century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School <b>pupils</b> <b>to</b> study at Magdalene College, Cambridge. There were 177 pupils registered in 2008, of whom 23 were in reception and the rest in years 1 to 6.|$|E
5|$|The Coronation Bandstand {{was built}} by the cliff edge in 1903, {{at a cost of}} £350, to {{celebrate}} the coronation of King Edward VII. The following year, a group of French Ursuline nuns, who were banned from teaching in France, fled with some of their <b>pupils</b> <b>to</b> Westgate-on-Sea and established the Ursuline Convent School, which in 1995 was re-established as Ursuline College. In 1910, a Swiss-Gothic styled town hall was built. However, it was soon decided that the building could be put to better use, and in 1912, it was transformed into the Town Hall Cinema. In 1932, it was renamed the Carlton Cinema.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{in schools}} in the US, UK, and Singapore, if one misses a {{detention}}, then another is added or the student gets a more serious punishment. In UK schools, for offenses too serious for a normal detention but not serious enough for a detention requiring the <b>pupil</b> <b>to</b> return to school {{at a certain time}} on a non-school day, a detention can require a <b>pupil</b> <b>to</b> return to school 1-2 hours after school ends on a school day, e.g. [...] "Friday Night Detention".|$|R
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school <b>pupils</b> <b>to</b> become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E

The grammar schools are selective and pupils are required to pass the Eleven plus exam. St George's is not selective.

5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by <b>pupils,</b> <b>to</b> maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{visit by}} Radama I to Madagascar's first formal school, {{established}} in Toamasina in 1818 {{by members of the}} London Missionary Society (LMS), the king invited the first Christian artisan missionaries to the capital city to share their knowledge. Beginning in December 1820, LMS missionaries established workshops in Antananarivo to teach brick-making, European carpentry and other practical skills, and developed a network of public schools where numeracy and English were taught alongside literacy using portions of the Malagasy language Bible. Despite high attendance at the schools, the LMS were initially unsuccessful in converting <b>pupils</b> <b>to</b> Christianity. Near the end of Radama's reign, the king came to regard the few Malagasy who had been converted as irreverent toward royal authority. He forbade Malagasy people from being baptized or attending Christian services.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of pupils take four A-levels subjects in Year 12, with most choosing {{to focus on}} three in Year 13. The Joint Sixth Form allows <b>pupils</b> <b>to</b> choose from 63 vocational or academic subjects including: art and photography (separate A-Level or BTEC options), applied Science, biology, bricklaying, business (A-Level or BTEC), childcare, carpentry, chemistry, computing or ICT (A-Level or BTEC), drama or performing arts (A-Level or BTEC), electronics, engineering, English (language and/or literature), film or media studies, French, German, geography, government and politics, health and social care, history, hospitality and catering, law, mathematics and further mathematics, music (A-Level or BTEC), philosophy and ethics, psychology, physical education or sport (A-Level or BTEC), physics, product design, public services, light vehicle maintenance, Spanish, sociology, travel and tourism, and work skills.|$|E
5|$|There is {{capacity}} for 450 pupils in the Sixth Form, including up to 50 people {{from outside the}} Academy. Along with Carre's Grammar School, St George's {{is part of the}} Sleaford Joint Sixth Form, which was founded in 1983 and included Kesteven and Sleaford High School until it withdrew in 2010. It provides a common timetable across both sites and allows for <b>pupils</b> <b>to</b> choose from A-Level options offered at both schools. Pupils may apply to be based at either school, where their pastoral and tutorial activities take place. Pupils are required meet minimum grade requirements for their subject choices and may have interviews to revise offers where appropriate. The Sixth Form has been based in the Arnold Centre since 2012. Sixth Formers are not required to wear school uniform, but must wear business-like attire, namely a lounge suit for boys, including a tie, and a business suit for girls, with either full-length trousers, or a knee-length skirt or dress.|$|E
