30|$|The {{accurate}} {{control for}} the vehicle height and leveling <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> of an electronic air suspension (EAS) still is a challenging problem {{that has not been}} effectively solved in prior researches. This paper proposes a new adaptive controller to control the vehicle height and to adjust the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body (leveling control) during the vehicle height adjustment procedures by an EAS system. A nonlinear mechanism model of the full-car vehicle height <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> is established to reflect the system dynamic behaviors and to derive the system optimal control law. To deal with the nonlinear characters in the vehicle height and leveling adjustment processes, the nonlinear system model is globally linearized through the state feedback method. On this basis, a fuzzy sliding mode controller (FSMC) is designed to improve the control accuracy of the vehicle height adjustment and to reduce the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method more accurately, the full-car EAS system model programmed using AMESim is also given. Then, the co-simulation study of the FSMC performance can be conducted. Finally, actual vehicle tests are performed with a city bus, and the test results illustrate that the vehicle height <b>adjustment</b> <b>performance</b> is effectively guaranteed by the FSMC, and the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body during the vehicle height adjustment procedures are also reduced significantly. This research proposes an effective control methodology for the vehicle height and leveling <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> of an EAS, which provides a favorable control performance for the system.|$|R

40|$|Benefiting {{from low}} cost, light weight and reduced volume in launch, {{deployable}} optical telescopes will be extensively applied in microsatellites. As {{a result of}} manufactured tolerance and external disturbance, the secondary mirror can&# 39;t arrive at designed position precisely after a deployable telescope is unfolded. We investigate an <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> with {{six degrees of freedom}} based on hexapod structure to solve this problem. There are mainly four parts in this paper. Firstly, the adjustment methods of deployable telescopes for microsatellites are introduced. Generally several kinds of optical components can be adjusted to align a deployed telescope: primary mirror, tip/tilt mirror and secondary mirror. Due to its high sensitivity and convenience, the secondary mirror is chosen to collimate the optical system of the telescope. Secondly, an <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> with hexapod structure is designed for a secondary mirror with 85 mm diameter. After comparing the characteristics of step motors, piezo actuators and voice coil motors (VCMs), VCMs are selected as the linear actuators. By using optical gratings as displacement sensors in the system, we can make closed-loop control come true. The hexapod structure mainly consists of 6 VCMs, 6 optical gratings and 6 oblique legs with flexible hinges. The secondary mirror <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> is 83 mm in diameter and 55 mm high. It has tip/tilt rotational ranges of ± 2. 205 ° with resolution of better than ± 0. 007 °, and translational ranges of ± 1. 545 mm with resolution of better than ± 0. 966 μm. Thirdly, the maximum stress and the maximum deformation in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> are computed with finite element method.

40|$|Abstract. Microwave {{circuits}} are {{indispensable for}} mobile and multimedia communication. However, these circuits {{are very difficult}} to design, {{because of the nature of}} distributed-constant circuits in the microwave range (i. e., over 1 GHz). These circuits are also difficult to adjust for optimum performance, even for experienced engineers. These related problems make development costs of microwave circuits very high. In order to overcome these problems, we propose an EHW-based microwave circuit where <b>performance</b> <b>adjustment</b> is carried out automatically by a GA. This new approach of integrating a <b>performance</b> <b>adjustment</b> function within the circuit eliminates many of the design problems with associated these circuits. In this paper, we present an EHW-based image-rejection mixer circuit, which we have developed with this approach, and experimental data that demonstrates that the automatically adjusting circuit is capable of outperforming a circuit adjusted by an experienced engineer. ...|$|R
