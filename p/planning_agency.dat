Five regional educational service agencies and six regional <b>planning</b> <b>agencies,</b> all from Illinois, participated in this study. Data were collected through 68 interviews on site.

Results of this study indicated that significant differences existed between regional <b>planning</b> <b>agencies</b> and regional educational agencies in their response to the needs of the Black community in the five areas of Participation, Access Linkages, Representation, Advocacy Planning, and Program Assessment. The conclusions developed from the data were: There were significant differences in the participation of Blacks in policy formulation in regional <b>planning</b> <b>agencies</b> and in regional educational agencies. The regional educational agencies had significantly more participation by Blacks. There were significant differences in the types of access linkages used by regional <b>planning</b> <b>agencies</b> and by regional educational agencies for interaction with the Black community. The regional educational agencies used access linkages that involved members of the Black community more directly.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of plan implementation by applying a recently-developed Plan Implementation Evaluation methodology. The lack of methodology to assess the implementation of plans has so far precluded any systematic analysis of {{the determinants of}} the implementation of local environmental plans. The article focuses on the implementation of plans in New Zealand. The key factors of implementation are: {{the quality of the}} plan; the capacity and commitment of land developers to implement plans; the capacity and commitment of the staff and leadership of <b>planning</b> <b>agencies</b> to implement plans; and the interactions between developers and the agency. The analysis is based on 353 permits implementing six local environmental plans in New Zealand, and on surveys of the developers who obtained the permits and of the <b>planning</b> <b>agencies</b> that granted the permits. The analysis finds that plan implementation is mainly driven by the resources of the <b>planning</b> <b>agencies</b> and by the quality of the plans, rather than by the characteristics of developers. Investments in <b>plan</b> writing and <b>agency</b> and staff capacity building thus improve the implementation of plans in the long-run. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{downtown}} bus tunnel was first proposed in 1974 during discussions between Governor Dan Evans and Seattle Mayor Wes Uhlman about regional transportation projects {{in response to the}} proposed extension of Interstate 90 into Seattle via a third floating bridge crossing Lake Washington. Metro Transit later commissioned a study into the bus tunnel, released the following July, which determined {{that it would not be}} able to adequately meet the rush hour demand of downtown bus ridership by 1980. The study suggested that a double-decked tunnel with automated guideway transit to complement bus service, running from Union Station to the Seattle Center, would be able to meet projected demand at an estimated cost of $450 million. Ultimately, the plan was rejected because of the high cost of ventilation for diesel buses that would use the tunnel. The bus tunnel proposal resurfaced in 1979, outlining a tunnel from South Jackson Street to Pine Street that would carry 200 buses an hour in each direction at a cost of up to $350 million with the option of conversion for electric rail transit in the future. The tunnel was suggested by Metro officials and engineering consultants Parsons Brinckerhoff as a solution to worsening downtown traffic, and was better received than alternative concepts. The proposal gained further support from Metro Transit in its long-term [...] "Metro 1990" [...] plan, adopted in 1981, as a transit mall or tunnel under 3rd Avenue carrying buses that could be converted for a light rail system. The Puget Sound Council of Governments (PSCOG), a regional <b>planning</b> <b>agency,</b> endorsed Metro Transit's proposal and integrated the tunnel into its proposed light rail line connecting Seattle to Snohomish County.|$|E
