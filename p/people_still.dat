5|$|The Outer Hebrides have {{historically}} been a very strong Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) speaking area. Both the 1901 and 1921 census reported that all parishes were over 75% Gaelic speaking, including areas of high population density such as Stornoway. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 mandated English-only education, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. <b>People</b> <b>still</b> living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school.

5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from <b>people</b> <b>still</b> alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

5|$|At {{the time}} of Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), barely 10% of the Roman Empire's {{population}} were Christians, with most of them being urban population and generally found {{in the eastern part}} of the Roman Empire. The majority of <b>people</b> <b>still</b> honoured the old gods in the public Roman way of religio. As Christianity became a complete philosophical system, whose theory and apologetics were heavily indebted to the Classic word, this changed. In addition, Constantine, as Pontifex Maximus, was responsible for the correct cultus or veneratio of the deity which was in accordance with former Roman practice. The move from the old religion to the new entailed some elements of continuity as well as break with the past, though the artistic heritage of paganism was literally broken by Christian zeal.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the campground was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from the campground would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled there for a vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, {{the majority of the people}} going there were there for a vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to the campground. However, <b>people</b> <b>still</b> continued to go there in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise the campground as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County Republican on July 9, 1891.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of <b>people</b> <b>still</b> practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{there was}} a total of seven {{depressions}} and four cyclonic storms. The most intense and deadly tropical cyclone of the season, the West Bengal cyclone, lashed that province of India and Bangladesh {{in the month of}} November. Rough seas offshore caused at least 173drownings offshore Bangladesh and India, while over 100people were left missing. In West Bengal alone, 124fatalities were reported, with over one hundred <b>people</b> <b>still</b> missing. Flooding occurred there and some areas of Bangladesh, particularly the capital city of Dhaka. Another notable storm was the Oman cyclone in May. It made a rare landfall in the Omani region of Dhofar. The storm brought historic rainfall to Oman, which in turn brought flooding to the region. Nine people drowned and damage to property, crops, and transportation reached $25million (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 <b>people</b> <b>still</b> on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E
