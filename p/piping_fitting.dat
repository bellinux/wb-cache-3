40|$|This paper {{describes}} the general practice and {{lessons learned from}} Commercial-Grade Item dedication for nuclear safety-related system applications in Taiwan. The dedication process qualified the commercial off-the-shelf components to be applied as basic components. In past fifteen years, Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) has actively performed the dedication service to help local nuclear power plants solve their procurement problems of nuclear grade items, due to reduced availability of qualified suppliers and/or obsolete issues of qualified components. The Scope of dedication includes material, electrical and mechanical components located in mild and harsh environment. Thousands of components such as <b>piping,</b> <b>fitting,</b> breaker, relay, motor, and control device etc., have already been dedicated to and successfully used in local nuclear power plants. The Commercial-Grade Item dedication process is based on EPRI documentations. Besides, the technical evaluation and equipment qualification are included during the dedication process. The requirements for equipment qualification are described in IEEE standards. Although the codes and standards for dedication in Taiwan refer to those in USA, the challenges may happen due to different regulators, utility, manufacture’s quality culture, and personal responsibility. The key to successful dedication will be dependent on the well-defined component requirements and good project planning. This paper introduces the self-reliant experiences in dedication and economic benefit to local nuclear power plants...|$|E

40|$|LectureA {{case history}} is {{presented}} pertaining to five pumping systems that operated satisfactorily {{until a new}} production requirement was imposed on the pumping systems. A new slurry product initially developed at lab scale was introduced into the production plant for an initial trial run. Problems began to surface immediately on three out of five batch process pumping systems when the slurry could not be pumped through the plant at contract rate. Additionally, significant "heels" (unwanted fluid levels) were left {{in some of the}} suction vessels that were unable to be pumped out, resulting in considerable yield losses. This manufacturing problem had not been anticipated by the team, and without quick resolution, a loss of customer confidence and a significant delay in the new product would have resulted. Investigation and analysis of the system revealed two major problem areas in pumping non-settling slurries in laminar regimes: 1. Initial prediction of head losses through suction <b>piping</b> <b>fittings</b> was flawed using traditional hydraulic loss methods. The original calculations for NPSHA values for the pumps predicted adequate NPSH margin. The fluid was non-Newtonian and was operating in the laminar regime. Upon further investigation, a weakness was revealed in predictions of fitting losses for laminar flow through the pipe fittings. An improved model for predicting losses through pipe fittings was identified and implemented. The improved model matched operational data much better and provided the critical insight needed to resolve the operational problems and get the facility operating. 2. Piping arrangements that allow for features such as clean-out ports (e. g., branch flow tees) can be counterproductive to unrestricted flow of the process liquid in systems with non-settling slurries operating in laminar regimes. Tees, elbows, diameter changes, and other fittings can introduce significant head losses in the pumping system. The authors present an improved method for analyzing fitting losses in pumping systems when dealing with nonsettling slurries operating in the laminar regime. In addition, design considerations are presented to minimize the impact that piping has on the pumping system when handling non-settling slurries operating in the laminar regime...|$|R
50|$|When the alloys for piping are forged, {{metallurgical}} {{tests are}} performed to determine material composition by % of each chemical {{element in the}} piping, {{and the results are}} recorded in a Material Test Report (MTR). These tests can be used to prove that the alloy conforms to various specifications (e.g. 316 SS). The tests are stamped by the mill's QA/QC department and can be used to trace the material back to the mill by future users, such as <b>piping</b> and <b>fitting</b> manufacturers. Maintaining the traceability between the alloy material and associated MTR is an important quality assurance issue. QA often requires the heat number to be written on the pipe. Precautions must also be taken to prevent the introduction of counterfeit materials. As a backup to etching/labeling of the material identification on the pipe, positive material identification (PMI) is performed using a handheld device; the device scans the pipe material using an emitted electromagnetic wave (x-ray fluorescence/XRF) and receives a reply that is spectrographically analyzed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Corrosion is {{a serious}} issue in {{drinking}} water supplies. Corrosion of pipelines in drinking water distribution system {{can be caused by}} several factors like the type of materials used, the age of <b>piping</b> and <b>fittings,</b> the stagnation time of water in the pipeline and water quality in the system. Corrosion control refers to the action of controlling the corrosion of materials used in drinking water distribution system. The present work aimed to develop a suitable corrosion inhibitor for minimizing the corrosion of pipelines used for supply of drinking water. The inhibitor selected for the study was sodium meta silicate and the inhibition efficiency is calculated based on OCP decay measurements, weight loss method and estimating the iron contamination in the solutions. The corrosion inhibition of metallic pipe (mild steel) increases with increase in concentration of the inhibitor and maximum corrosion prevention is observed when the medium contains 2000 ppm of sodium meta silicate. The inhibitor adsorb on the oxidized surface of the iron leading to the formation of a passive layer which prevents further decay of the material...|$|R

This consists of determining the total heat transfer from the service hot water system piping to the surrounding environment. The heat transfer is then used to define the total pumping capacity based on a given temperature change in the circulating hot water as it flows through the closed loop piping system. The total pumping capacity is used to select a pump model from manufacturer's literature. This established the head generation for that capacity and particular pump model. The total length of all hot water supply and return <b>piping</b> including <b>fittings</b> is then estimated from the plumbing drawings which defines the pipe friction losses that must fit within the available pump head.

40|$|In {{offshore}} subsea engineering, Flow Loops are {{the common}} name of <b>pipings</b> and <b>fittings</b> welded {{together to form}} a loop that carries production media from one point to another. Flow Loops are made of high strength stainless steels which are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. In combination with tensile loads, this may cause failure due to hydrogen induced stress cracking. Finite element simulations are made when investigating the risk of this type of failure. The analyses must follow recommended practice, issued by Det Norske Veritas, to be approved. Problems with these analyses are that the modelling of Flow Loops is time consuming and rather tedious. Also, the recommended practice has been difficult to interpret with the effect that different engineers perform the analyses in various ways. This project aims to solve these problems by creating a tool that automates the procedure of creating Flow Loop finite element models and from the obtained results evaluates the Flow Loop’s resistance against hydrogen induced stress cracking by following the recommended practice. Two plug-ins for the finite element software Abaqus are developed to automate the simulation of Flow Loops. They are built by scripts written in the object oriented programming language Python.
