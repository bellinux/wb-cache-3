50|$|Linum catharticum, {{also known}} as <b>purging</b> <b>flax,</b> or fairy flax, is an {{herbaceous}} flowering plant in the family Linaceae, native to Great Britain, central Europe and Western Asia. It is an annual plant and blooms in July and August.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{vegetation}} {{at the site}} is herb-rich grassland over limestone. With about 5 grass species, 2 sedges and 20 broad-leaved herbs and allows a rich insect fauna to maintain itself. Grasses found include Quaking-grass, Crested Dog's-tail, Sheep's- fescue, Downy Oat-grass and Yellow Oat-grass. Amongst these grasses is Mouse-ear Hawkweed, Wild Thyme, Bird's-foot-trefoil, Lady's Bedstraw, Carline Thistle, Mountain Everlasting, <b>Purging</b> <b>Flax</b> and Eyebright.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} habitats are {{found at the}} site. Parts of the shingle with more moderate toxicity support short grasses such as sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina), or taller grasses including false oat-grass (Arrhena therum elatius) and common knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Amongst these are found a number of species associated with limestone including kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), <b>purging</b> <b>flax</b> (Linum catharticum) and small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria).|$|E
50|$|The {{slopes of}} all three {{properties}} form {{one of the largest}} remaining areas of chalk grassland in the county and support a wide range of flowers and butterflies. Plants found in the grassland include autumn gentian, clustered bellflower, blue fleabane, vervain, common rock-rose, horseshoe vetch, kidney vetch, marjoram, yellow-wort, <b>purging</b> <b>flax,</b> wild carrot, chalk milkwort, stemless thistle, eyebright, mouse-ear hawkweed, salad burnet, ragwort, wild thyme, hairy violet, squinancywort, hawkweed ox-tongue, common spotted orchid and pyramidal orchid. Scattered bands of hawthorn scrub provide shelter for insect life and several butterfly species can be found, including chalkhill blue, marbled white, adonis blue, grizzled skipper and dingy skipper.|$|E
40|$|Burnt mounds or fulachta fiadh as {{they are}} known in Ireland are {{probably}} the most common prehistoric site type in Ireland and Britain. Typically Middle to late Bronze in age (although both earlier and later examples are known), they are artefact-poor and rarely associated with settlements. They generally consist of a low mound of stones often showing signs of fire-exposure arranged by, or around, a pit or trough which may be unlined or lined by wood or stone. The function of these sites has been much debated with the most commonly cited uses being for cooking, as steam baths or saunas, for brewing or textile processing. A number of major infrastructural development schemes in Ireland in the years 2002 - 2007 revealed remarkable numbers of these mounds often associated with wood-lined troughs, many of which were remarkably well preserved. This afforded an opportunity to investigate these sites as landscape features using environmental techniques - specifically plant macrofossils, pollen, beetles and multi-element analyses. This paper presents the results from nine sites from Ireland and compares them with burnt mound sites in Britain. The fulachta fiadh which are generally in clusters are all groundwater-fed by springs along floodplains and at the bases of slopes. The sites are associated with the clearance of wet woodland for fuel and have predominantly ‘natural’ beetle assemblages found in wet woodlands. At 7 out of the 9 sites evidence of nearby agricultural (arable) activity was revealed and all sites revealed, some but not high, levels of grazing. At one site (Cahiracon) both pollen and coleoptera suggested that oak galls or leaves were brought onto site, at another (Coonagh West) both pollen and macrofossils suggested that alder was being used on site and at a third (Jigginstown) the pollen of two dye plants (<b>purging</b> <b>flax</b> and knapweed) was recovered. Multi-element analysis at two sites (Inchagreenoge and Coonagh West) revealed elevated heavy metal concentrations suggesting that non-local soil or ash had been used in the trough. This evidence, taken together with the shallow depth of all the sites, their self-filling nature, attempts to filter incoming water, the occasional occurrence of flat stones and flimsy stake structures at one site (Inchagreenoge), suggests that the most likely function for these sites is textile processing involving both cleaning and/or dying of wool and/or natural plant fibres. This can be regarded as a functionally related activity to hide cleaning and tanning for which there is evidence from one site (Ballygawley) as well as from other Irish burnt mound sites. Whilst further research is clearly needed to confirm if fulachta fiadh are part of the ‘textile revolution’ we should also recognise their important role in the rapid deforestation of the wetter parts of primary woodland and the expansion of agriculture into marginal areas during the Bronze Age...|$|E
