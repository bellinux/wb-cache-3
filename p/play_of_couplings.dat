Phenomenological applications of renormalization group invariant sum rules for soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters are also discussed. 1. Application to the Standard Model High energy physicists have been using renor-malizability as the predictive tool, and also {{to decide whether or}} not a quantity is calculable. It is possible, using the method <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> [1]{[4],[5], to renormalize a theory with fewer number of counter terms then usually coun-ted, implying that the traditional notion of renor-malizability should be generalized in a certain sense. Consequently, the notion of the predictabil-ity and the calculability [6] may also be general-ized with the help <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings.</b> <b>Of</b> course, whether the generalizations of these no-tions have anything to do with nature is another question. The question can be answered if one applies the idea <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> to re-alistic models, make predictions that are specc for reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings,</b> and then wait till ex-perimentalists nd positive results. In ref. [8] the idea <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>couplings</b> has been applied to the SU(3) CSU(2) LU(1) Y gauge model for the strong and electroweak in-teractions.

40|$|Vibrational {{analysis}} of rotating machinery {{is able to}} identify {{a large number of}} system ills. Shaft bow, shaft unbalance and coupling misalignments make up the major portion of the observed vibrational frequency spectra of rotating machinery. These vibrational spectra can be used to determine the type of rotating system abnormality, the degree of misalignment and the rate of alignment degradation. The proper joining of rotating machinery is a critical issue with high power and a high speed equipments. Couplings used to join machinery have a broad spectrum of characteristics and specific purposes. Couplings are used to compensate for axial, lateral and angular misalignments. In addition, couplings may exhibit constant or non-constant input versus output speed relationships. The importance of mating a driving and driven piece of equipment with the properly designed coupling is paramount.
