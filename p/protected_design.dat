50|$|Registered and {{unregistered}} community {{designs are}} available which provide a unitary right covering the European Community.

50|$|Industrial designs can {{generally}} be protected {{if they are}} new or original. Designs may not meet these criteria {{if they do not}} differ significantly from other existing designs or combinations thereof. In most industrial design laws, designs dictated solely by the article’s function are excluded from protection. If the design for an article produced by many manufacturers, such as a screw, were to be dictated purely by the function the screw was intended to perform, then protection for that design would have the effect of excluding all other manufacturers from producing items intended to perform the same function. Such exclusion is not warranted unless the design is sufficiently novel and inventive to qualify for patent protection. In other words, the legal protection offered by industrial designs concerns only the design that is applied to, or embodied in, articles or products. This protection does not prevent other manufacturers from producing or dealing in similar articles or products, as long as these do not embody or reproduce the <b>protected</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

The FFTF tritium and isotope production mission will require a different core loading which features higher enrichment fuel, tritium targets, and medical isotope production assemblies. Changes in several key core parameters, such as the Doppler coefficient and delayed neutron fraction will affect the transient response of the reactor. Both reactivity insertion and reduction of heat removal events were analyzed. The analysis methods and modeling assumptions are described. Results of the analyses and comparison against fuel pin performance criteria are presented to provide quantification that the plant protection system is adequate to maintain the necessary safety margins and assure cladding integrity...|$|E

40|$|While patent {{scholars}} have subjected disclosure doctrines to considerable scrutiny {{in the context}} of utility patent law, very little {{has been written about the}} role of those doctrines in design patent law. At first blush, this is not surprising: modern design patent documents usually contain short disclosures comprised primarily of drawings, accompanied by very little text. Although this might suggest limited aspirations for design patent disclosures, the story is more complex. Design patents contain only a pro forma claim; it is the disclosure that defines the scope of the <b>protected</b> <b>design.</b> Moreover, although the modern practice of relying primarily on visual disclosure (and a mere pro forma claim) is well-established, many early design patents relied heavily on textual disclosure and plural claiming. In this paper, we present the results of new historical and empirical research on disclosure practice in design patents. We use this research as a basis for examining the role of disclosure in early design patent practice, and critiquing some modern decisions applying disclosure doctrines to design patents...|$|E

50|$|By {{rewarding}} creators {{for their}} efforts, industrial design protection {{also serves as}} an incentive to invest in design activity. One of the basic aims of industrial design protection is to stimulate the design element of production. Industrial design laws therefore usually only <b>protect</b> <b>designs</b> {{that can be used}} in industry, or that can be produced on a large scale. This condition of industrial production is a notable difference between industrial design protection and copyright, since the latter concerns only aesthetic creations. However, in some cases, industrial designs may qualify for protection under copyright, for example where the design can be categorized as a work of applied art.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Masking is {{a general}} method used to thwart Dif-ferential Power Analysis, {{in which all the}} {{intermediate}} data inside an implementation are XORed with random Boolean values. As a consequence, the power consumption of the running implementation becomes unpredictable, making first-order power analysis attacks unpractical. Several recent works have shown that such <b>protected</b> <b>designs</b> are still susceptible to higher-order power analysis attacks. In this paper, we propose an extension of the previously introduced higher-order techniques, based on a more general power consumption model, and evaluate its actual feasibility. In particular, we discuss the number of power traces required to mount successful attacks. We also illustrate how this number is affected by parallel computations, making certain implementation contexts (e. g. smart cards, 8 -bit processors) more susceptible than others (e. g. FPGAs, ASICs). I...|$|R
