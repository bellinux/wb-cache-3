40|$|The {{electronic}} nose is {{a rudimentary}} {{replica of the}} human olfactory system. However there has been considerable commercial interest {{in the use of}} electronic nose systems in application areas such as environmental, medical, security and food industry. In many ways the existing electronic nose systems are considerable inferior when compared to their biological counterparts, lacking in terms of discrimination capability, processing time and environmental adaptation. Here, the aim is to extract biological principles from the mammalian olfactory systems to create a new architecture in order to aid the implementation of a nose-on-a-chip system. The primary feature identified in this study was the nasal chromatography phenomena which may provide significant improvement by producing discriminatory spatio-temporal signals for electronic nose systems. In this project, two different but complimentary groups of systems have been designed and fabricated to investigate the feasibility of generating spatio-temporal signals. The first group of systems include the fast-nose (channel 10 cm x 500 μm 2), proto-nose I (channel 1. 2 m x 500 μm 2) and II (channel 2. 4 m x 500 μm 2) systems that were build using discrete components. The fast-nose system was used to characterise the discrete sensors prior to use. The proto-nose systems, in many ways, resembles gas chromatography systems. Each proto-nose system consists of two microchannels (with and without coating) and 40 polymer-composite sensors of 10 different materials placed along it. The second group of systems include the hybrid-nose and the aVLSI-nose microsensor arrays assembled with microchannel packages of various lengths (5 cm, 32 cm, 7 lcm, 240 cm) to form nose-on-a-chip systems. The hybrid-nose sensor array consists of 80 microsensors built on a 10 mm x 10 mm silicon substrate while the aVLSI-nose sensor array consists of 70 microsensors built on a 10 mm x 5 mm silicon substrate using standard CMOS process with smart integrated circuitries. The microchannel packages were fabricated using the Perfactory microstereolithography system. The most advanced microchannel package contains a 2. 4 m x 500 J. lm 2 microchannel with an external size of only 36 mm x 27 mm x 7 mm. The nose-on-a-chip system achieved miniaturisation and eliminates the need for any external <b>processing</b> <b>circuitries</b> while achieving the same capability of producing spatio-temporal signals. Using a custom-designed vapour test station and data acquisition electronics, these systems were evaluated with simple analytes and complex odours. The experimental results were in-line with the simulation results. On the coated proto-nose II system, a 25 s temporal delay was observed on the toluene vapour pulse compared to ethanol vapour pulse; this is significant compared to the uncoated system where no delay difference was obtained. Further testing with 8 analyte mixtures substantiated that spatio-temporal signals can be extracted from both the coated proto-nose and nose-on-a-chip (hybrid-nose sensor array with 2. 4 m long microchannel) systems. This clearly demonstrates that these systems were capable of imitating certain characteristics of the biological olfactory system. Using only the temporal data, classification was performed with principal components analysis. The results reinforced that these additional temporal signals were useful to improve discrimination analysis which is not possible with any existing sensor-based electronic nose system. In addition, fast responding polymer-composite sensors were achieved exhibiting response times of less than 100 ms. Other biological characteristics relating to stereolfaction (two nostrils sniffing at different rates), sniffing rate (flow velocity) and duration (pulse width) were also investigated. The results converge with the biological observations that stereolfaction and sniffing at higher rate and duration improve discrimination. Last but not least, the characterisation of the smart circuitries on the aVLSI-nose show {{that it is possible to}} achieve better performance through the use of smart <b>processing</b> <b>circuitries</b> incorporating a novel DC-offset cancellation technique to amplify small sensor response with large baseline voltage. The results and theories presented in this study should provide useful contribution for designing a higher-performance electronic nose incorporating biological principles...|$|R

Similarly, digital pulse height analyzers with variable bin widths provide much higher resolution data as opposed to analog analyzers with fixed bins. Further, combining a COULTER COUNTER® with a digital computer allows capture of many electrical pulse characteristics, while analog counters typically store a much more limited amount of information about each pulse.|$|E
5000|$|Intermediate {{frequencies}} {{are used}} for three general reasons. At very high (gigahertz) frequencies, signal <b>processing</b> <b>circuitry</b> performs poorly. Active devices such as transistors cannot deliver much amplification (gain). [...] Ordinary circuits using capacitors and inductors must be replaced with cumbersome high frequency techniques such as striplines and waveguides. So a high frequency signal is converted to a lower IF for more convenient processing. For example, in satellite dishes, the microwave downlink signal received by the dish is converted to a much lower IF at the dish, to allow a relatively inexpensive coaxial cable to carry the signal to the receiver inside the building. Bringing the signal in at the original microwave frequency would require an expensive waveguide.|$|E

The system allows recording of 500 V neural signals from axons regenerated through a micromachined silicon sieve electrode.

50|$|To correct audio video sync problems, {{the video}} <b>processing</b> <b>circuitry</b> outputs a DDO (digital delay output) signal, which carries {{information}} {{about the amount of}} delay the video signal experiences due to the video processing. The DDO may, for example, be provided by equipment which adheres to the SMPTE ST2064 Audio to Video Synchronization Standard. The audio synchronizer receives the DDO signal and in response delays the audio by an equivalent amount, thereby maintaining proper audio-video sync. Modern audio synchronizers operate by digitizing and writing the audio signal into a ring memory, which is most commonly a RAM-based memory having independent read and write ability. At the appropriate delay time (as conveyed by the DDO) after an audio sample (or group of samples) are written into the memory the previously stored audio sample is read from the ring memory. The storage and reading of the audio samples take place continuously in response to the respective memory write and read addresses, which increment by 1 count for every write or read operation. For example, an audio sample would be written at address 1, a different sample read from (previously written) address 5, another sample is written at address 2, yet another read from 6, write at 3, read from 7 and so on. The delay between writing and reading a particular sample is 4 addresses which, when multiplied by the amount of time it takes to change from one address to the next, gives the total audio delay.|$|E
