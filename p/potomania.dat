50|$|<b>Potomania,</b> {{also known}} as beer <b>potomania,</b> beer drinker's <b>potomania,</b> and beer drinker's hyponatremia, is a {{specific}} hypo-osmolality syndrome related to massive consumption of beer, which is poor in solutes and electrolytes. With little food or other sources of electrolytes, consumption of large amounts of beer or other dilute alcoholic drinks leads to electrolyte disturbances, where the body {{does not have enough}} of nutrients known as electrolytes, namely sodium, potassium, and magnesium. The symptoms of <b>potomania</b> are similar to other causes of hyponatremia and include dizziness, muscular weakness, neurological impairment and seizures, all related to hyponatremia and hypokalaemia. While the symptoms of <b>potomania</b> are similar to other causes of hyponatremia and acute water intoxication, it should be considered an independent clinical entity because of its often chronic nature of onset, pathophysiology, and presentation of symptoms.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} cases of hyponatremia, extreme caution {{must be taken}} to avoid the fatal {{consequences}} of rapidly correcting electrolytes (e.g. Central pontine myelinolysis, edema). Special considerations with the treatment of <b>potomania</b> are needed. Because this could be a chronic condition, low sodium may be normal for the patient, so an especially careful correction is warranted. It is also very important to note that due to the normal kidney function, and lack of other intrinsic or toxic cause of the electrolyte disturbance, restoration of dietary solutes will correct the electrolytes to normal serum levels. This again must be done with caution.|$|E

40|$|A {{syndrome}} of hyponatraemia {{associated with}} excessive beer drinking was first recognised in 1971. This syndrome has {{been referred to}} as beer <b>potomania.</b> Dilutional hyponatraemia occurs due to excessive consumption of an exclusive beer diet which is poor in salt and protein. We report a case of beer <b>potomania</b> who improved dramatically with introduction of solute load, with no subsequent neurological sequelae...|$|E
30|$|In {{a similar}} vein, “beer potomania” may also result in {{hyponatremia}} together with lowered urine osmolality. In this condition, patients typically {{have a history}} of low solute intake and a diet deprived of protein whereas they ingest vast amounts of beer, a largely hypotonic beverage. Consequently, these patients are unable to produce the osmolar load which drives the free-water excretion in physiological conditions [159]. In the face of large volumes of hypotonic fluid intake, this equates with hyponatremia. A situation that can be very much likened to beer <b>potomania</b> is the “tea and toast” syndrome. Similar to <b>potomania,</b> patients –almost universally elderly, incapacitated subjects- are fed on low protein diet (“toasts”), only in this case the hypotonic beverage consists in tea.|$|E

30|$|Dosing AVP is {{of limited}} usefulness, as {{the levels of}} plasma of AVP have been proven to {{fluctuate}} unpredictably and are often augmented in patients with both true hypovolemia (decreased ECFV) and effective hypovolemia (increased ECFV), {{as a result of}} a non-osmotic stimulus, as well as in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which remains in essence, a diagnosis of exclusion. Nevertheless, other biological features may represent a valuable aid for physicians investigating the presence of SIADH. They include lowered plasma uric acid and blood urea nitrogen, and failure to correct PNa levels following the infusion of 0.9  % saline solution [144, 164]. Uric acid stands out as, perhaps, the most useful static biological parameter. Reduced levels of uric acid levels are thought to result from the mild volume expansion which occurs at the onset of SIADH, as well as from increased urinary excretion [165, 166]. However, the coexistence of hyponatremia and lowered uric acid levels may also be witnessed in other conditions unrelated to SIADH such as the use of diuretics, <b>potomania</b> and cirrhosis [166, 167].|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} {{neurological}} syndrome due to severe hyponatræmia were investigated. Serum-sodium levels ranged between 120 and 98 meq. per litre. Neurological signs included disorders of consciousness (stage I and II coma) sometimes associated with pyramidal signs or epileptic attacks. In all {{cases where the}} electroencephalogram was recorded, it showed diffuse theta and delta waves. Hypokalæmia was frequent. In no case were there signs of intracranial hypertension. Necropsy in three cases, after correction of hyponatræmia, showed no lesions of cerebral œdema, but there were lesions characteristic of alcoholic encephalopathy in two cases. In all twelve cases, a sodium-depletion factor lay at {{the origin of the}} hyponatræmia, often associated with a dilution factor. In the seven most severe cases of hyponatræmia there was beer <b>potomania.</b> The importance of this factor in the pathogenesis of hyponatræmia may be explained by sodium deficiency in the diet, the absorption of large quantities of water, and the possible role of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in these alcoholic patients. Under adequate treatment the neurological symptoms disappeared in all cases. © 1971. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 54 -year-old {{alcoholic}} female patient who was hositalized for neurologic alterations along with a severe hyponatremia (plasma Na+: 97 m-Eq/ 1). She suffered from <b>potomania</b> and was given, a few days before admission, a thiazide diuretic for hypertension. A careful correction of plasma Na+ levels was initiated over a 48 -hour period (rate of correction < 10 mEq/l/ 24 h) in order to avoid brain demyelination. After a 2 -day period of clinical improvement, her neurologic condition started to deteriorate. By the 5 th day of admission, she became tetraplegic, presented pseudobulbar palsy, ataxia, strabism, extrapyramidal stiffness and clouding of consciousness. Scintigraphic and MRI investigations demonstrated pontine and extrapontine lesions associated with Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy. After correction of ionic disorders (hyponatremia, hypokaliemia) and vitamin B (thiamine) deficiency, the patient almost completely recovered without notable disabilities. This case illustrates that profound hyponatremia, in a paradigm of slow onset, can be compatible with life. It also demonstrates that demyelinating lesions, usually considered as a consequence of a too fast correction of hyponatremia, may occur despite the strict observance of recent guidelines. There is increasing evidence to suggest that pontine swelling and dysfunction may sometimes occur in alcoholic patients even in absence of disturbance in plasma Na+ levels. It is therefore of importance, while managing a hyponatremic alcoholic patient, to identify additional risk factors (hypokaliemia, hypophosphoremia, seizure-induced hypoxemia, malnutrition with vitamin B deficiency) for brain demyelination and to correct them appropriately...|$|E
40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} for [8 -arginine]-vasopressin (AVP), {{previously described}} (Czernichow et al. 1975) {{has been used}} for the determination of antidiuretic hormone in a 4 ml urine sample. AVP is extracted from acidified urine with a cation exchanger (Amberlite CG 50) with an overall recovery of 72 %. The blank value measured in extracted samples of urine was 0. 29 pg/ml +/- 0. 21 (SEM) and calculated by extrapolation of the regression line of the recovery experiment was 0. 49 pg/ml. The coefficient of variation within-assay was 13 % and between-assay 18 %. Addition of the amounts of AVP found in each specimen of urine voided gave results nearly identical to those of the amounts found in 24 h pool of urine, indicating that the assay was not affected by changes in concentration of the other urinary components during the day. The daily urinary excretion of AVP measured in 34 subjects was found to be 34 ng in 17 women and 70 ng in 17 men, a significant difference. Urinary concentration and excretion rate of AVP rose during thirst test and during Carter-Robbins test performed in 13 healthy subjects. In the latter test it was observed that the women displayed a strikingly more pronounced AVP elevation after the osmolar stimulus than the men. In both sexes a significant correlation was found between AVP excretion rate and plasma osmolality as well as free water clearance. Three cases of complete or incomplete diabetes insipidus and <b>potomania</b> could be clearly differentiated according to the total output of AVP during the thirst test. Extremely high values of AVP were found in the urine of 5 subjects with Schwartz-Bartter syndrome associated with bronchogenic tumours...|$|E
