5000|$|In the Commonwealth countries—such as England and Wales, Canada, and Australia—the <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> [...] is not permitted.

5000|$|A <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> [...] "autrefois convict" [...] (Law French for [...] "previously convicted") is one {{in which}} the {{defendant}} claims to have been previously convicted of the same offence and that he or she therefore cannot be tried for it again. In the instance where a defendant has been summonsed to both criminal and civil proceedings, a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> autrefois convict is essentially an application to 'merge' proceedings, giving rise to res judicata or a cause of action estoppel in civil proceedings. This means that the secondary proceedings should not go ahead and the complaint stopped. A <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> autrefois convict can be combined with a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty.|$|R

Ordinarily, in relation to a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> self-defense, the necessity for force must be judged from the defendant's perspective.
