25|$|Nonlinear distortions {{generated}} by the <b>photoresistor</b> are lower for a higher light intensity and for a lower resistance of the <b>photoresistor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Circuits with defined {{control voltage}} of the divider can {{compensate}} for the thermal drift of the LED in a RO, {{but not for the}} memory effect and thermal drift of the <b>photoresistor.</b> The latter compensation requires a second (reference) <b>photoresistor,</b> which is illuminated by the same light intensity, at the same temperature as the main (modulating) device. Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same semiconductor chip. The reference <b>photoresistor</b> is included in a divider of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the divider with the target value and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the <b>photoresistor</b> is proportional to the product of the voltage across the <b>photoresistor</b> and the control voltage.|$|E
25|$|Degradation of the <b>photoresistor</b> is gradual and irreversible. If the {{operating}} temperature does {{not exceed the}} limit (typically 75°C or less) then for each year of continuous operation, the dark resistance falls by 10%; at higher temperature such changes can occur within minutes. The maximum power dissipated in the <b>photoresistor</b> is usually specified for 25°C and decreases by 2% for every °C of heating.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{samples of}} <b>photoresistors</b> {{based on a}} Pb 0. 902 Sn 0. 098 Se-solid {{solution}} semiconductor films obtained by the layer-by-layer deposition of individual selenides of lead and tin(II) with subsequent thermal activation are developed. The structure and morphology of the thin-film compositions (SnSe-PbSe) 2 are studied. The temperature dependences of the dark resistance, signal, noise and its ratio, {{as well as the}} frequency and spectral characteristics of <b>photoresistors</b> fabricated on the basis of Pb 0. 902 Sn 0. 098 Se films in the range of 205 - 300 K are studied. The optimal bias voltages are determined. It is shown that the location of the maximum and the right boundary of the photoresponse for Pb 0. 902 Sn 0. 098 Se-based <b>photoresistors</b> is shifted, in comparison with PbSe, toward the long-wavelength region by 0. 7 μm. The maximal detectivity of the studied <b>photoresistors</b> (2. 0 × 2. 0 mm) obtained at 230 K was 9 × 109 cm W- 1 Hz 1 / 2. The advantages of using the Pb 0. 902 Sn 0. 098 Se-based <b>photoresistors</b> in the spectral range of 3. 0 - 5. 5 μm compared with PbSe-based ones are shown. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd...|$|R
25|$|The {{transfer}} characteristic of RO is usually represented as the electrical {{resistance of the}} <b>photoresistor</b> {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, optical coupling and spectral matching between the light source and <b>photoresistor,</b> and the photoresponse of the <b>photoresistor.</b> The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the emission spectrum varies with temperature, and thus with the input current. As to the light detector, its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (memory effect). Therefore, the {{transfer characteristic}} takes a range of values.|$|E
25|$|If {{the voltage}} across the <b>photoresistor</b> does {{not exceed the}} threshold, which varies between 100 and 300 mV {{depending}} on the material, then the coefficient of nonlinear distortions has a value within 0.01%, which is almost independent of the voltage. These distortions are dominated by the second harmonic. Above the voltage threshold, the third harmonic appears, and the amplitude of the distortions increases as {{the square of the}} voltage. For a distortion of 0.1% (−80dB), which is acceptable for high-fidelity sound equipment, the signal voltage should be within 500 mV. The ratio of even and odd harmonics can be controlled by applying a DC bias to the <b>photoresistor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the large}} value of RD, the total {{resistance}} is mainly determined by RI. The dynamic range of the <b>photoresistor</b> with respect to illumination {{is equal to the}} ratio of the critical illumination Φcr to the sensitivity threshold Φth.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Teletronix used the [...] "T4" [...] optical {{attenuator}} in the LA-2 compressor, furthermore, for their unique sound, {{they are still}} used today by Universal Audio in their reproductions of the LA-2. After the 1950s selenium in photocells was gradually replaced by CdS and CdSe. By 1960, ROs based on incandescent lamps and CdS/CdSe <b>photoresistors</b> were used in feedback circuits in the industry, for example, for controlling rotation speed and voltage. In the early 1960s, the introduction of sensitive and compact CdS/CdSe <b>photoresistors</b> resulted in the mass production of cameras with automatic exposure. However, these <b>photoresistors</b> were not adopted in medicine because of their memory effect and rapid aging – they required regular recalibration that was not acceptable for medical practice.|$|R
50|$|The use of CdS and CdSe <b>photoresistors</b> is {{severely}} restricted in Europe {{due to the}} RoHS ban on cadmium.|$|R
50|$|<b>Photoresistors</b> used in opto-isolators rely on bulk {{effects in}} a uniform film of semiconductor; there are no p-n junctions. Uniquely among photosensors, <b>photoresistors</b> are {{non-polar}} devices suited for either AC or DC circuits. Their resistance drops in reverse proportion to the intensity of incoming light, from virtually infinity to a residual floor that may be as low as {{less than a hundred}} Ohms. These properties made the original Vactrol a convenient and cheap automatic gain control and compressor for telephone networks. The <b>photoresistors</b> easily withstood voltages up to 400 volts, which made them ideal for driving vacuum fluorescent displays. Other industrial applications included photocopiers, industrial automation, professional light measurement instruments and auto-exposure meters. Most of these applications are now obsolete, but resistive opto-isolators retained a niche in audio, in particular guitar amplifier, markets.|$|R
25|$|Series {{connection}} of an LED and a low-resistance <b>photoresistor</b> make the RO a trigger (memory cell) {{which can be}} controlled by current pulses. In transparent ROs, the state of such cell can be monitored visually by the LED emission.|$|E
25|$|Cooling below −25°C sharply {{increases}} the response {{time of a}} <b>photoresistor.</b> These changes are reversible unless the cooling induces cracking in the plastic components. Soviet ROs packed in metal cases could withstand even at −60°C, but at these temperatures their response time reached 4 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum output}} {{frequency}} (controlled signal) {{is limited by}} the parasitic capacitance of a RO, which originates from the electrodes formed {{on the surface of the}} <b>photoresistor</b> and shunts the output circuit. A typical value of this capacitance is tens of picofarads that practically limits the output frequency to approximately 100kHz.|$|E
50|$|Galvanometer {{mechanisms}} {{were also}} used to get readings from <b>photoresistors</b> in the metering mechanisms of film cameras (as seen in the adjacent image).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Photoresistors</b> or Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) which change {{resistance}} {{according to}} light intensity. Normally {{the resistance of}} LDRs decreases with increasing intensity of light falling on it.|$|R
50|$|CdSe {{material}} is transparent to infra-red (IR) light and has seen limited use in <b>photoresistors</b> and in windows for instruments utilizing IR light. The {{material is}} also highly luminescent.|$|R
25|$|As for {{ordinary}} resistors, {{the noise of}} photoresistors consists of thermal, shot and flicker noise; the thermal component dominates at frequencies above 10kHz and brings a minor contribution at low frequencies. In practice, the noise of a <b>photoresistor</b> is neglected, if the voltage across its terminals is lower than 80 V.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} frequency {{range of a}} RO depends on the input and output characteristics. The highest frequency of the input (controlling) signal {{is limited by the}} response of the RO light source to the change in the controlling current and by the response of the <b>photoresistor</b> to light; its typical value ranges between 1 and 250Hz. The response time of a <b>photoresistor</b> to switching off of the light typically varies between 2.5 and 1000 ms, whereas the response to switching the illumination on is about 10 times faster. As to the light source, its reaction time to a current pulse is in the nanosecond range for an LED, and is therefore neglected. However, for an incandescent lamp it is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which limits the frequency range of the respective ROs to a few Hz.|$|E
25|$|Irreversible {{degradation}} of a <b>photoresistor</b> can be induced by exceeding its maximum specified voltage {{even for a}} short period. For high-resistivity devices, this voltage {{is determined by the}} leakage currents flowing on the semiconductor surface and varies between 100 and 300 V for. For low-resistivity models, the voltage limit is lower and originates from the Joule heating.|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{research}} {{is focused on}} the development of a low-cost solar tracking system to improve domestic fixed PV installations which performance is dramatically diminished due to the absence of reorientation mechanisms to maximize solar energy capture. A straightforward way to reduce fabrication and maintenance costs of a domestic solar tracking system is to avoid the use of <b>photoresistors.</b> Most solar trackers use <b>photoresistors</b> to reorient their PV panels. However, the daily and seasonal solar path is well known and its variation is negligible when comparing photoresistorbased and preprogrammed reorientation against the amount of solar energy that is captured...|$|R
50|$|One major {{application}} of the phototube was the reading of optical sound tracks for projected films. Phototubes were used {{in a variety of}} light-sensing applications until they were superseded by <b>photoresistors</b> and photodiodes.|$|R
25|$|Some resistors, {{particularly}} those made from semiconductors, exhibit photoconductivity, meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, {{they are called}} <b>photoresistors</b> (or light dependent resistors). These are a common type of light detector.|$|R
25|$|For {{mechanical}} stability, the LED and <b>photoresistor</b> are glued with {{a transparent}} epoxy, glue or an organic polymer. The glue also {{functions as a}} diffuser spreading the light beam – if it would fall near {{the border of the}} semiconductor and electrical contacts then a slight shift of the LED position might significantly alter the RO response.|$|E
25|$|The optimal light {{sources for}} CdS/CdSe photoresistors are AlGaAs heterostructures (emission {{wavelength}} ~660nm) or GaP LEDs (λ = 697nm). The luminosity of the LED is nearly {{proportional to the}} controlling current. The emission spectrum depends on the temperature of LED, and thus on the current, but this variation {{is too small to}} affect the spectral matching of the LED and <b>photoresistor.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{technologies}} used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. Vacuum tubes are used in a configuration called variable-mu where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain. Optical compressors use a <b>photoresistor</b> and a small lamp (Incandescent, LED or electroluminescent panel) to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include field effect transistors and a diode bridge.|$|E
40|$|Servo {{amplifier}} feedback system, {{in which}} the phase sensitive detection, low pass filtering, and multiplication functions required for quadrature rejection, are preformed by light-controlled <b>photoresistors,</b> eliminates complex circuitry.

2500|$|In the European Union, the {{production}} and distribution of Cd-based <b>photoresistors</b> is banned since January 1, 2010. The initial version of the EU Directive on the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS), adopted in 2003, allowed the use of cadmium in the devices that had no Cd-free counterparts. However, in 2009 the European Commission excluded Cd-based ROs used in professional audio equipment {{from the list of}} permitted devices. [...] "From 2 January 2013, the use of cadmium is permitted in <b>photoresistors</b> for analogue optocouplers applied in professional audio equipment. ... However, the exemption is limited in time, since the Commission considers that the research for cadmium-free technology is in progress and substitutes could become available by the end of 2013." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Photoresistors</b> come in many types. Inexpensive cadmium {{sulphide}} cells {{can be found}} in many consumer items such as camera light meters, clock radios, alarm devices (as the detector for a light beam), nightlights, outdoor clocks, solar street lamps and solar road studs, etc.|$|R
25|$|In the Soviet Union, ROs {{were used}} for signal {{compression}} in long-distance telephony. The incandescent lamp of the RO {{was connected to the}} output of the operational amplifier, and the <b>photoresistor</b> was part of a voltage divider in the feedback circuit of a non-inverting amplifier. Depending on the output voltage, the gain of the circuit varied from 1:1 to 1:10. Similar circuits are still used in professional audio equipment (compressors, limiters and noise suppressors).|$|E
25|$|The {{service life}} of a RO is {{determined}} by the lifetime of the light source and the acceptable drift of the parameters of the <b>photoresistor.</b> A typical LED can operate for 10,000 hours, after which its parameters slightly degrade. Its lifetime can be prolonged by limiting the controlling current to half of the maximum value. ROs based on incandescent lamps typically fail after about 20,000 hours, due to the burnout of the spiral, and are more prone to overheating.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} devices whose {{resistance}} changes with various quantities. The resistance of NTC thermistors exhibit a strong negative temperature coefficient, making them useful for measuring temperatures. Since their resistance can be large {{until they are}} allowed to heat up due to the passage of current, they are also commonly used to prevent excessive current surges when equipment is powered on. Similarly, the resistance of a humistor varies with humidity. One sort of photodetector, the <b>photoresistor,</b> has a resistance which varies with illumination.|$|E
5000|$|CdS and CdSe form solid solutions. Increasing {{amounts of}} cadmium selenide, gives {{pigments}} verging toward red, for example CI pigment orange 20 and CI pigment red 108.
