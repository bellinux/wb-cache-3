40|$|Background Opioid {{consumption}} {{has been}} widely increasing across the globe; how- ever, it can cause adverse effects on the body. Morphine, an opioid, can reduce sex hor- mones and fertility. Withania somnifera (WS) is a traditional herb used to improve sexual activities. This study strives to investigate the effect of WS on sex hormones and gonado- tropins in addicted male rats. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, forty-eight male National Maritime Research Institute (NMRI) rats were randomly divided into four groups: i. Control group, ii. WS-treated control group, iii. Addicted group, and iv. WS-treated addicted group. Wa- ter-soluble morphine was given to rats for 21 days to induce addiction, concurrently the treated groups (2 and 4) also received WS <b>plant-mixed</b> pelleted food (6. 25...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} project is to construct and evaluate several bituminous concrete base overlays with various high penetration bituminous products which {{have the potential to}} reduce future maintenance and construction costs. In September of 1981 nine different bituminous test sections were constructed on Osceola County roads A- 34 and A- 46 east of Ashton. Asphalt binders used were AC- 5 asphalt cement, SC- 800 liquid asphalt, MC- 3000 cutback asphalt, CSS- 1 emulsion and HFMS- 2 emulsion. Aggregate for four of the test sections consisted of salvaged bituminous pavement and new aggregate combined. Each section was road mixed using a different binder arid placed 2 - 1 / 4 " thick with a motor patrol. The other five test sections consisted of an AC- 5 Type B asphalt concrete control section and four <b>plant-mixed,</b> cold-laid bituminous concrete overlay sections using new aggregate. The material was mixed in a continuous drum mix plant and laid with a full width paver...|$|E
40|$|Natural sand {{deposits}} and waste screenings from gravel pits and quarries are abundant {{in parts of}} Sweden. Investigations {{have been made to}} stabilize such materials with binders based on waste materials. Both laboratory work and test roads have been performed. In the latter case, mainly secondary roads have been strengthened with a <b>plant-mixed</b> bases. Good results have been achieved with a binder made of milled granulated blast furnace slag, activated with lime or especially with both lime and waste gypsum. Sand and screenings from gravel often contain organic material, deleterous with the binders studied. In such cases, the gypsum addition also seems to counteract the negative effect of the organic material. Fly ash has recently been available in Sweden. Tests made with fly ash-lime, as often used for stabilization abroad,have shown too slow binding for a rather cold climate. Addition of waste gypsum, calcium chloride, alkali-salts or use of an alkali-rich cement kiln dust instead of commercial lime can improve the binding properties. Different fly ashes, however, react in different ways. It is often more suitable to use fly ash-cement as a binder, especially with poorly graded aggregates. The fly ash, added in an optimum amount, work as a filler and high immediate stabilities can be achieved at a correct water content. The puzzolanic properties of the fly ash, at the same time, makes it possible to reduce the cement content considerably in comparison with the case when only portland cement is used as a binder. Promising laboratory work has also been done with binders consisting of condensed silica fume or ash from fluidized bed coal combustion, both in combination with lime.

40|$|Background: Opioids can exert {{adverse effects}} on the body. Morphine, an opioid drug,reduces hormone levels and fertility, and causes sexual {{activity}} disorders. Tribulus terrestris(TT) is a traditional herbal medicine used to enhance sexual activities. This studyinvestigates the possible role of TT on sex hormones and gonadotropins with the intent toshow its usefulness in treating fertility disorders in opioid users. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we randomly divided 48 rats intofour groups: i. control, ii. TT-treated, iii. addicted and iv. TT-treated addicted. Watersolublemorphine was administrated orally for 21 days to induce addiction, after whichthe treated groups 2 and 4 received <b>plant-mixed</b> pelleted food (6. 25 %) orally for fourweeks. At {{the end of the}} treatment period, the sex hormone and gonadotropin levels of allrats’ sera were determined by radioimmunoassay and Elisa kits. The data obtained werestatistically analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance, followed by post-hoc Tukeytest. P< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The addicted group had a significantly lower luteinizing hormone (LH) levelthan the control group (p< 0. 027). LH levels increased significantly in the TT-treated addictedgroup (p< 0. 031). The testosterone level in the treated addicted group was lowerthan the treated control group. The addicted group had a significantly low testosteronelevel (p< 0. 001). The estrogen level was significantly (p< 0. 002) lower in the addictedgroup than in the control group. In addition, {{there was a significant difference}} betweenthe treated addicted group and the treated control group (p< 0. 048). The treated controlgroup had a significant increase in its progesterone level (p< 0. 002). Overall, except forfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), morphine reduced most of the gonadotropins andsexual hormones. Whereas TT caused a considerable increase (p< 0. 05) in the hormonesin the treated addicted group, there was only a slight increase in the treated control group. Conclusion: Oral consumption of TT could markedly antagonize the reduction of sexhormones and gonadotropins (except for FSH) due to morphine addiction...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensively}} used AASHTO {{structural design}} procedures for flexible pavement indicate the required pavement design {{in terms of}} a structural number. For a particular pavement thickness design, this structural number can be computed from the sum of each pavement layer's thickness multiplied by its strength parameter, called the structural layer coefficient. The research work reported herein presents methods for determining the structural layer coefficients for asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. A hot <b>plant-mixed</b> asphaltic concrete was evaluated for structural layer coefficient, and the radial stress vs. fatigue failure relationship was developed using circular specimens and the Jimenez deflectometer. Relationships between structural number and load repetitions to failure for different loading conditions were developed. These relationships were used to evaluate the structural numbers of other specimens when tested to failure in flexural fatigue. Three asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures were designed using CSS-lh asphalt emulsion. The aggregates used for the three mixtures were: (1) Type I aggregate using dense-graded, crushed, river gravel; (2) Type II aggregate using pit-run, coarse sand; and (3) Type III aggregate using a silty sand. These mixtures were evaluated for Marshall stability, Hveem stability and cohesiometer value, unconfined compressive strength, double punch tensile strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity at various ages from 3 to 28 days. Flexural fatigue life, when tested in the deflectometer, was determined for all mixtures at 7 and 28 days. Structural numbers for the specimens and structural layer coefficients for the mixtures were determined. Relationships were developed between the evaluation tests performed and the structural layer coefficients at various mixture ages by using test results from the three mixtures and a regression analysis procedure. A fourth asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixture using CSS-lh asphalt emulsion and a Type II crusher-run aggregate was designed. Evaluation tests were performed at 3 and 7 days and layer coefficients for the mixture were predicted for 7 and 28 days using the regression equations developed. Layer coefficients at 7 and 28 days were also determined by testing specimens in fatigue in the deflectometer and computing their structural numbers and layer coefficients. Layer coefficients determined in these two manners indicated favorable comparisons. The results of this research provides information about the structural layer coefficients for asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. The relationships between the evaluation tests and structural layer coefficient can be used for determining layer coefficients for other asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. Because the evaluation tests used were tests commonly performed in most asphalt laboratories, these determinations can be made without the necessity of additional equipment or procedures in most cases...|$|E
