5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, <b>professional</b> <b>guidelines</b> recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent <b>professional</b> <b>guidelines</b> recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. <b>Professional</b> <b>guidelines</b> recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E

25|$|Previous <b>professional</b> <b>guidelines</b> {{classified}} {{the severity}} of CKD in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or end-stage kidney failure, and is largely synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic renal failure or chronic kidney failure; and usually means the patient requires renal replacement therapy, which may involve a form of dialysis, but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant. Recent international guidelines reclassified CKD based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category (G1, G2, G3a, G3b, G4 and G5), and albuminuria category (A1, A2, A3).|$|E
25|$|The gradual loss {{of blood}} from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and <b>professional</b> <b>guidelines</b> suggest routinely monitoring for anemia with blood tests repeated every three months in active disease and annually in quiescent disease. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anemia should be treated with iron supplements. The form in which treatment is administered depends both on {{the severity of the}} anemia and on the guidelines that are followed. Some advise that parenteral iron be used first because patients respond to it more quickly, it is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is not associated with compliance issues. Others require oral iron to be used first, as patients eventually respond and many will tolerate the side effects. All guidelines advise that parenteral iron should be administered in cases of severe anemia (a hemoglobin level less than 100 g/L).|$|E

Developing a comprehensive understanding of the many barriers to ICU glucose control can aide clinicians in attempting to change practice and improve patient outcomes. Barriers to ICU glucose control include the role of different health professionals in glucose management, communication among health care <b>professionals,</b> <b>guidelines,</b> protocols, ICU culture, fear of hypoglycemia, glucose monitoring, education, systems analysis, health care resources, nutritional needs, and drug utilization. By ensuring compliance, changing ICU culture, developing guidelines and protocols, and incorporating a multidisciplinary approach, clinicians can achieve glycemic control in the critically ill population and improve patient outcomes...|$|R
25|$|The use of heparin {{following}} {{surgery is}} common {{if there are}} no issues with bleeding. Generally, a risk-benefit analysis is required, as all anticoagulants lead to an increased risk of bleeding. In people admitted to hospital, thrombosis is a major cause for complications and occasionally death. In the UK, for instance, the Parliamentary Health Select Committee heard in 2005 that the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25,000, with at least 50% of these being hospital-acquired. Hence thromboprophylaxis (prevention of thrombosis) is increasingly emphasized. In patients admitted for surgery, graded compression stockings are widely used, and in severe illness, prolonged immobility and in all orthopedic surgery, <b>professional</b> <b>guidelines</b> recommend low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration, mechanical calf compression or (if all else is contraindicated and the patient has recently suffered deep vein thrombosis) the insertion of a vena cava filter. In patients with medical rather than surgical illness, LMWH too is known to prevent thrombosis, and in the United Kingdom the Chief Medical Officer has issued guidance to the effect that preventative measures should be used in medical patients, in anticipation of formal guidelines.|$|E

500|$|The {{size of the}} {{pneumothorax}} (i.e. {{the volume}} of air in the pleural space) can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring {{the distance between the}} chest wall and the lung. This is relevant to treatment, as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently. An air rim of 2cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50% of the hemithorax. British <b>professional</b> <b>guidelines</b> have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed {{at the level of the}} hilum (where blood vessels and airways enter the lung) with 2cm as the cutoff, while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the apex (top) of the lung with 3cm differentiating between a [...] "small" [...] and a [...] "large" [...] pneumothorax. The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex, which is a common occurrence. The various methods correlate poorly, but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size. CT scanning (see below) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax, but its routine use in this setting is not recommended.|$|E
