40|$|THE SEARCH FOR PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH TO BUILD A THEORY OF ARCHITECTURE REVEALS THAT <b>PLASTIC</b> <b>FORM</b> IS THE FORM OF THE HIGHEST ORDER [...] NOT BECAUSE IT IS BEAUTIFUL, ALTHOUGH IT POSSESS A BEAUTY THAT LASTS AS LONG AS THE FORCES THAT CREATED IT, BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS TO FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE FORCES ARE CLASSIFIED AS: NATURE FORCES: Gravity Force [...] Wind Force [...] Water Force [...] Earth Force. SENSUAL FORCES: Sonic Force [...] Visual Force [...] Tactile Force. BEHAVIORAL FORCES: Personal Force [...] Circulation Force [...] Sociological Force. They are {{not listed}} as a {{hierarchy}} of forces, although Nature Forces {{should be considered as}} primary. Because these forces do exist in the shaping of form, their understanding is therefore a prerequisite for the designer. Before form may be created the forces that give form must be considered. Primitive man found Gravity Force to be the primary form giver to his dwellings. His materials were those of compressive strength (mud, ice) and their resultant forms were therefore compressive stress forms of similar shape. Later, when tensile strength materials were developed, forms of great beauty emerged as tension structures. Both compression and tensile strong materials were shaped by the Gravity Force to produce <b>Plastic</b> <b>Form.</b> <b>Plastic</b> <b>Form</b> is also produced by the Wind Force. As the wind shifts the desert's fora so it is the prime determinent in the shape of racing car and aircraft. The Water Force has shaped the surface ships of the past with great beauty and will become the prime force determining our sub-aquatic cities of the future. The Earth Force determines the shape of man's objects as they are placed upon and within the earth. Now consider Sensual Forces. Man's visual, sonic and tactile requirements also produce <b>Plastic</b> <b>Form.</b> As the Sonic Force has shaped our ear, so it shapes our theatre. Visual Force relates to man's sensitivity to light and how <b>Plastic</b> <b>Form</b> is shaped in consideration to light. The most intimate of all forces is the Tactile Force. This force gives <b>Plastic</b> <b>Form</b> to all objects man touches - from the coke bottle to the chair. Consider the Behavioral Forces or those forces resulting from man's co-existence with himself and other men. The Personal Force is the expressive force of man. When strengthened by experience and knowledge the designer may then create <b>Plastic</b> <b>Form</b> of his will. The movement of people produce the Circulation Force that shapes homes, theatres, cities. The Sociological Forces involved within the city are the most complex of all. With thorough understanding of these ten forces an environment of unity, beauty and efficiency may be created through <b>Plastic</b> <b>Form...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>Forming</b> Processes are {{integral}} part of the chain that contains a set of other processes as well. The chain is supposed to deliver products that satisfy customer requirements. In {{order to be able to}} achieve so, process inputs have to be defined by customers themselves. It is clear that customers perceive final products only, but not sub-products delivered by <b>Plastic</b> <b>Forming</b> Processes (these are actually contained within the final products). In order to have the «Voice of Customer», as input for <b>Plastic</b> <b>Forming</b> Processes, one has to make use of Quality Tools and Methods. This paper looks at an extended system that includes customers who define their requirements for the final product, <b>Plastic</b> <b>Forming</b> Processes that deliver on these requirements, and at the end, customers once again. Now, customers are supposed to evaluate deliverables. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method helps us take «Voice of Customer » into account, by relying on the first «House of Quality». The remaining three «Houses of Quality » are aimed at establishing critical <b>Plastic</b> <b>Forming</b> Processes, as well as Critical-to-Quality characteristics that are reflecting customer requirements. Critical processes can be simplified using lean tools and analyzed using DMIAC methodology (Define Measure Analyze Improve Control) in order to be able to reach Six Sigma quality level...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{implementation}} of environmental protection, sustainable development and conservation-oriented policies, components and parts of thin-walled welded tubes have gained increasing application in the aircraft and automotive industries because of their advantages: easily achieving forming and manufacturing process at low cost and in a short time. The current research on welded tube <b>plastic</b> <b>forming</b> is mainly concentrated on tube internal high-pressure forming, tube bending forming, and tube spinning forming. The focuses are on the material properties and characterization of welded tubes, finite element modeling for welded tube forming, and inhomogeneous deformation behavior and the mechanism and rules of deformation coordination in welded tube <b>plastic</b> <b>forming.</b> This paper summarizes the research progress in welded tube <b>plastic</b> <b>forming</b> from these aspects. Finally, {{with a focus on}} the urgent demand of the aviation, aerospace and automotive industries for high-strength and light-weight tubes, this paper discusses the development trends and challenges in the theory and technology of welded tube <b>plastic</b> <b>forming</b> in the future. Among them, laser tailor-welded technology will find application in the manufacture of high-strength steel tubes. Tube-end forming technology, such as tube flaring and flanging technology, will expand its application in welded tubes. Therefore, future studies will focus on the FE modeling regarding how to consider effects of welding on residual stresses, welding distortions and microstructure, the inhomogeneous deformation and coordination mechanism of the <b>plastic</b> <b>forming</b> process of tailor-welded tubes, and some end-forming processes of welded tubes, and more comprehensive research on the forming mechanism and limit of welded tubes...|$|E

40|$|Plastics {{processes}} play {{an important}} and irreplaceable role in manufacturing industry {{as well as our}} daily lives. This paper focuses on the <b>plastics</b> <b>forming</b> processes with a focus on moulding processes. An overview of some basic <b>plastics</b> <b>forming</b> processes, their products and production capacities, is presented. These processes include extrusion, blow moulding, rotational moulding, compression moulding, transfer moulding, thermoforming and injection moulding. The future trend is envisaged with respect to the forming processes, machinery, moulds and materials. Also highlighted is the computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology being used by the industry. Some leading CAD/CAM packages are reviewed in light of their capabilities and applicability. The paper also lays an emphasis on the status of the New Zealand situation in the <b>plastics</b> <b>forming</b> industry. A survey showed that the New Zealand plastics industry involves over 400 enterprises, mostly small. The majority of them only operate a single moulding process, with injection moulding being the principal process.
