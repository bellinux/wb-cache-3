5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Matt Fowler of IGN wrote: [...] ""Bullseye" [...] wasn't bad at all, {{but it was}} sort of a flatliner when it came to providing thrills. The spinning wheel bit made for an interesting gambit, but it still seemed like it could have gone further. And while I like the prospect of Dot and Bette trying to separate themselves, their arc this week with Dandy felt a lot like filler. We'll have to see how everything shakes out with Dandy and Jimmy's pow wow." [...] Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A- rating, writing: [...] "When [...] "Bullseye" [...] drops a chainsaw, it loses a <b>pinky</b> <b>toe</b> at most. This is the episode that's been waiting to fight its way out of Freak Show all along, catalyzing the season's potential energy into the genuine spectacle of histrionic freakouts and hypnogogic fantasy." ...|$|E
