It provides a comparative case study of the <b>Pyrenees-Mediterranean</b> <b>Euroregion,</b> located on the French–Spanish eastern border and the Greater Region between Luxembourg, Germany, Belgium and France.

It alsolooks at inter-territorial entities, made up of non-neighbouring entities inwhich the autonomous communities participate, both with regard to constitutionalagreements and to the activities carried out after they have beenestablished. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} Catalonia, as it is the commondenominator among all of them. The author aims to find out what advanceshave been made since the first cooperation experiences, taking into considerationthe recent amendments made to the European and domestic regulationsrelated to this issue. In short, will Catalonia’s new statute of autonomy,known as Estatut de Catalunya, or the Council of Europe’s latest worksand the initiation of the European Union Regulation on the European Groupingof Cross-border Cooperation (EGCC) really have an effect on improving thequality of those associations to which Catalonia belongs, such as Four Motorsfor Europe, the <b>Pyrenees-Mediterranean</b> <b>Euroregion,</b> the Assembly of EuropeanRegions and the Working Community of the Pyrenees (CTP) ? Or will they onlyreinforce that which already exists? At the end of the article, the authorpoints out trends in the composition and activities of cross-border cooperationand inter-territorial bodies with regional participation...|$|E
