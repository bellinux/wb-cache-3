40|$|MicroRNAs are an {{important}} subclass of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), and serve as main players into RNA interference (RNAi). Mature microRNA derived from stem-loop structure called precursor. Identification of precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) is essential step to target microRNA in whole genome. The present work proposed 25 novel local features for identifying stem- loop structure of pre-miRNAs, which captures characteristics on both the sequence and structure. Firstly, we pulled the stem of hairpins and aligned the bases in bulges and internal loops used ‘―’, and then counted 24 base-pairs (‘AA’, ‘AU’, …, ‘―G’, except ‘――’) in <b>pulled</b> <b>stem</b> (formalized by length of <b>pulled</b> <b>stem)</b> as features vector of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Performances of three classifiers with our features and different kernels trained on human data were all superior to Triplet-SVM-classifier’s in po- sitive and negative testing data sets. Moreover, we achieved higher prediction accuracy through combining 7 global sequence-structure. The result indicates validity of novel local features...|$|E

6000|$|On a summer's evening, {{about the}} time nature puts on her sables to mourn the expiry of the cheerful day, a {{shepherd}} boy, belonging to a farmer in the immediate neighbourhood of Alloway kirk, had just folded his charge, and was returning home. As he passed the kirk, in the adjoining field he fell in with a crew of men and women, who were busy <b>pulling</b> <b>stems</b> of the plant ragwort. He observed that as each person pulled a ragwort, he or she got astride of it, and called out, [...] "Up, horsie!" [...] on which the ragwort flew off, like Pegasus, through the air with its rider. The foolish boy likewise pulled his ragwort, and cried with the rest, [...] "Up, horsie!" [...] and, strange to tell, away he flew with the company. The first stage at which the cavalcade stopt was a merchant's wine-cellar in Bourdeaux, where, without saying [...] "By your leave," [...] they quaffed away at the best the cellar could afford, until the morning, foe to the imps and works of darkness, threatened to throw light on the matter, and frightened them from their carousals.|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{experience}} {{shows that}} {{removal of the}} Exeter long-stem femoral component (220 mm, 240 mm, 260 mm) of total hip arthroplasty is extremely difficult, often requiring splitting of the femur. To identify the reason for this, measurements of stem geometry and force required to <b>pull</b> the <b>stems</b> out of the cement mantle were conducted on three original Exeter long-stem and one standard femoral components. All implants required an initial force of approximately 4 kN for release from the cement. The long-stem components then required much larger forces and hence much higher expenditure of energy to pull them clear of the cement. This was attributed to the reverse taper seen on the nominally cylindrical distal section of the long-stem components. Following re-design of the manufacturing process to ensure the taper continued to the implant's distal tip, four further implants were tested. These demonstrated the requirement for initial cement release but then required no further energy expenditure similar to the standard stem. This study clearly demonstrated that the original difficulty in removing these long stems was owing to the manufacturing process resulting in a reverse taper on the distal stem. The adoption of recommended manufacturing changes to ensure the taper continues to the distal tip removed this difficulty...|$|R

40|$|Why {{do people}} switch their mobile phones? What factors make them {{to stick with}} their current phones? This thesis' {{objective}} {{is to find out}} the influences behind consumer mobile phone switching behavior. Academic literature has examined mobile phone switching surprisingly little since the focus has been on mobile phone related adoption research. This thesis aims to fill that gap of lacking mobile phone switching behavior research. An inductive approach is applied on a qualitative data set that was collected from 249 university students from three different continents to determine the consumer expressed reasons to switch and not to switch mobile phones. The results are organized based on consumer responses and examined in the light of PPM framework as well as mirrored to the established adoption literature such as the technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovations framework. The findings suggest that mobile phones of any sort are increasingly switched to smartphones. The main reasons pushing people to switch mobile phones were identified as rational reasons such as dissatisfaction with reliability and advanced functionalities of the device being switched from along with external forced influences. The main reasons pulling towards attractive alternatives were identified as personal desires, advanced functionalities and subjectively perceived factors again along with external social influences. Additionally, brand influence and price value perceptions were pinpointed as pulling clearly towards smartphone adoption. The main elements preventing individuals from wanting to switch their mobile phones were determined as attachment to familiar advanced functionalities and subjectively perceived factors. In a general level, the pull effect is the strongest force leading to switching and the principal causes for this <b>pull</b> effect <b>stem</b> from associations to functional elements of the mobile phones...|$|R
40|$|Yogic {{exercises}} are normally done to tone {{the body and}} the nervous system. Yogic exercises come under Hath Yoga system {{which is one of the}} eight limbs of “Ashtang Yoga ” as enunciated in Patanjali Yoga sutras. Hath Yogis have believed that the body toning is a result of nerve stretching. This belief may have scientific basis. Recently scientists have discovered that cells in human body change depending on how they are stretched [1]. They have shown that if you <b>pull</b> a <b>stem</b> cell in one way it starts developing into a brain cell; stretch it in other ways and a muscle or a bone cell results! And the most far reaching consequence of this stretching is for cancer cells. Change their mechanical stress and they start behaving like normal cells! The Yogic exercises of stretching the nerves and toning the nervous system that ultimately affect the cells mechanically can therefore affect the body in a very positive way at the cellular level. Till now the biological and medical community believed that whenever they wanted to know why a cell behaved in a certain manner, they needed only to identify the genes, proteins and other chemical processes and pathways for the answers. Biological community considers chemical processes to be of paramount importance. However in nature all the forces are taken into account for a system’s evolution and mechanical stress at cellular level is as important and prevalent as the chemical process. Scientists have also discovered that though the cells in human body are subjected to mechanical stress and strain in every part of body, their nativ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{international}} migration of Filipino nurses {{takes place in}} response to [...] "push and pull" [...] factors. The push factors {{are rooted in the}} economic conditions in the Philippines in which there is an overabundance of RNs and a lack of open employment positions. The unemployment rate in the Philippines exceeds 10%. Additionally, health care budgets set up Filipino nurses for low wages and poor benefit packages. There are fewer jobs available, thereby increasing the workload and pressure on RNs. Filipinos often pursue international employment to avoid the economic instability and poor labor conditions in their native country. The government also highly encourages the exportation of RNs internationally. Filipino nurses are pulled to work abroad for the economic benefits of international positions. While a nurse in the Philippines will earn between $180 and $200 U.S. dollars per month, a nurse in the U.S. receives a salary of $4,000 per month. Nurses abroad are greatly respected in the Philippines as they are able to support an entire family at home through remittances. In 1993, Filipinos abroad sent $800 million to their families in the Philippines thereby supporting the economy. Additionally, remittances from Filipinos made up 5.2% of the Filipino GDP (gross national product) between 1990 and 2000. Further <b>pull</b> factors <b>stem</b> from the additional economic benefits of signing bonuses in the U.S. To attract more foreign nurses, U.S. hospitals increased signing bonuses from $1,000 to $7,000. Positions abroad in the health sector are also enticing for their immigration benefits. Throughout the past 50 years of nurse migration, the U.S. has made efforts to ease the visa application process to further encourage international nurses to relieve the nursing shortage. Scholars note that the better living and working conditions, higher income, and opportunities for career advancement draw nurses from the Philippines to work in the U.S.|$|R
40|$|Initial {{stability}} {{is essential for}} successful bone ingrowth into non-cemented prostheses. An entire new concept to increase the initial stability directly after implantation of intramedullary stems was developed (the tension rod prosthesis). The concept {{is based on a}} tension rod made out of memory metal that <b>pulls</b> a proximal <b>stem</b> of a prosthesis towards a distal anchor with a constant force. The stress generated along the long axis of the bone produces a radial stress around the prosthesis in the proximal femur. The main goal of this design is to increase the primary stability of the prosthesis during the ingrowth phase and to prevent stress shielding and bone resorption, as realized by the radial force applied to the proximal endosteum of the bone. To assess the efficacy of this concept and to collect data for the anchor design, an implant was developed for implantation into the tibia of the goat. Analyses of push-out strength and bone reactions were performed postoperatively. After 48 weeks the push-out strength of this implant was increased and the histological evaluation showed almost complete osseousintegration. Histomorphometrical analysis showed pronounced, permanent periosteal reactions, located around the anchor of the implant, which generates the radial stress. These first results showed that the bone can withstand the radial stress provoked by the anchor of the tension rod. It is concluded that the concept of a tension rod prosthesis is viable...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study has been to build general models of the mechanics in tree felling with chain-saw and to compare felling torque for different tools. The theoretical models are completed and validated with a comparative study. The study includes {{a great number of}} felling tools of which some are used with different methods. Felling torque was measured using a naturally like measuring arrangement where a tree is cut at about 3. 7 m height and then anchored with a dynamometer to a tree opposite to the felling direction. Notch and felling cut was made as ordinary with exception that the hinge was made extra thin to reduce bending resistance. The tree was consequently not felled during the trials and several combinations of felling tools and individuals could be used on the same tree. The results show big differences between tools, methods and persons. The differences were, however, not general, but could vary depending on conditions (first of all tree diameters). Tools and methods that push or <b>pull</b> on the <b>stem</b> are little affected {{by the size of the}} tree, while tools that press on the stump are very much dependent of a large stump-diameter. Hand force asserted on a simple pole is consequently a powerful tool on small trees. For trees of medium size there are several alternative methods with different sizes and brands of felling levers and wedges. Larger and more ungainly tools and methods like tree pusher, winch, etc. develop very high felling torque on all tree sizes. On large trees also the felling wedge and especially the use of several wedges together develop very high felling torque...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{difficult}} for plants to grow in mudstone area due to the fierce geologic and climatic condition. The relationship between plants and environment must be studied {{in order to improve}} the situation of continuing exposedness and advance the work of vegetation establishment. Usually, we can get the information about the plant living and adapting to fierce environment by investigating into its roots. The root distribution, pulling resistance, xylem pressure potential, and daily changes of physiology of Clerodendron inerme and Pluchea indica were collected to infer the adaptation of these plants to mudstone area’s environment and apply them as vegetation materials in mudstone area. After surveying and caculating the root distribution, we suggested that Clerodendron inerme and Pluchea indica belong to M-type and R-type with shallow roots. It would be helpful for Clerodendron inerme to grow and expand with lots underground and creeping stems. The roots of Pluchea indica are more and dense which will increase the absorption of water. From the results of root mechanical experiment, we got the regression equations of pulling resistance on maximum of basal diameter shown as (1),the regression equations of <b>pulling</b> resistance on <b>stems</b> weight shown as (2),and the regression equations of root tensile strength on root diameter are shown as (3). The maximum value of net photosynthesis of Clerodendron inerme appeared at pm 12 : 00,and that of Pluchea indica appeared at pm 1 : 00. The minimum value of xylem pressure potential of both plants appeared at pm 1 : 00. The transpiration rate was influenced and changed constantly by the daily environment changes. The area between the base of steep slopeland and the deposition zone are suitable for the tested plants to grow up. Finally, we can recognized that Pluchea indica and Clerodendron inerme are pioneer plants at the base of slopland.
