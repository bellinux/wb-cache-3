Vacancies can be filled by <b>promotion</b> <b>from</b> <b>within</b> the service. In the case of basic ranks or where promotion is not possible or where there is a special need, vacancies are filled by open recruitment. To achieve the target of reducing the civil service establishment, the Government implemented a general recruitment freeze {{to the civil}} service with effect from April 1, 2003, with exemption granted only on very exceptional circumstances. Entry requirements for civil service posts in general are set on the basis of academic or professional qualifications obtainable from local institutions or professional bodies (or equivalent), technical skills, work experience, language proficiency and other qualities and attributes as required. To achieve the aim of a civil service which is biliterate (Chinese and English) and trilingual (generally conversant in spoken Cantonese, English and Mandarin), language proficiency in Chinese and English is also required. From January 2003 onwards, for civil service posts requiring degree or professional qualifications, applicants should pass the two language papers (Use of Chinese and Use of English) in the Common Recruitment Examination before job application. For civil service posts with general academic qualifications set below degree level, applicants should attain at least Grade E in Chinese and English (Syllabus B) in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, or equivalent.

It placed employees on a centre stage in analysing HRM to provide theoretical insights. Design/methodology/approach - To explore the theme, a survey of 252 employees drawn from eight organisations was conducted. Furthermore, on-site interviews were carried out with managers, thereby contributing to the generalisability of the findings. Findings - The findings from the study indicate a positive attitude of employees to HRM practices, such as <b>promotion</b> <b>from</b> <b>within,</b> staffing, equal employment opportunity, quality of training, reasonable compensation and paid vacation and sick days. Moreover, the evidence also shows that productivity has been increasing while employee turnover, absenteeism, and grievances are low. However, the evidence also reveals that training was not integrated in a planned way to employee career development. Research limitations/implications - The present study adds to a growing literature that helps the understanding of HRM policies and practices in a developing country context. Future research would benefit from additional {{research in this area}} in other geographical settings to better understand the generalisability of the findings reported. Originality/value - In contrast with previous research, which has predominantly been conducted from a managerial perspective, this article deals with employee perceptions.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} flexible, multi-method case-study (after Yin 1994, 2003), was {{to elicit}} the 'student perspective' on issues {{relating}} to mental well-being within the Higher Education Institution setting. It has been guided by {{the ideology of the}} health promotion model, the concept of salutogenesis and the Health Promoting University initiative. Phase One consisted of eleven focus group discussions involving fifty one self-selecting participant undergraduates and a semi-structured interview conducted with the lead medical practitioner of the Medical Centre on site. In Phase Two, a quota sample of 806 undergraduates completed a questionnaire. The three datasets were analysed according to a facilitative and complementary approach (Brannen 2004) and in keeping with assumptions of the paradigms from which they originated. The qualitative data were analysed within the framework provided by Miles and Huberman (1994) and the survey was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings demonstrated that this multi-site university may have specific difficulties with regard to the provision of equal access to the support services. Reduced pastoral care could pose risks to the mental well-being of some students whereas the allocation of students to a personal tutor might increase levels of social capital and reduce symptoms of 'anomie'. Conclusions of the study suggest that HEIs need an understanding of the concerns of the students and their help-seeking behaviour in order to define 'health assets' and minimise 'health deficits'. Overall, the development of co-ordinated institutional support service provision - that is responsive to the needs of a diverse student body - facilitates and supports the creation of a salutogenic environment that both promotes and sustains mental well-being. Health education programmes need to address the persistence of stigma and discrimination. Attention should be focused on health protection measures so that all groups of students are treated equally and fairly in order to counter-balance a possible residual biomedical approach to health <b>promotion</b> <b>from</b> <b>within</b> the medical sector provision. As a case-study of one university, the findings may be theoretically generalisable to other similar multi-site HEIs in their mental health promotion provision.

40|$|Cette {{recherche}} a pour {{objet de}} clarifier un nouveau domaine de la gestion des ressources humaines, soit la gestion des carrières. Jusqu'à présent, les travaux ont abordé ce domaine en décrivant les pratiques de gestion de carrière une à une au lieu de décrire des systèmes de carrière (c'est-à-dire des configurations de pratiques). En développant une taxonomie des systèmes de carrière, la présente recherche comble cette lacune. À partir d'un échantillon de 254 observations, quatre types de système de carrière ont été empiriquement identifiés. Selon les résultats de cette recherche, ces quatre types ont une certaine validité, puisqu'ils sont associés significativement à 13 variables n'ayant pas servi à identifier les types (par exemple la taille, la philosophie de relations avec les employés, la stratégie de dotation, l'orientation du système, l'intégration avec les autres pratiques de gestion des ressources humaines). Finalement, ces quatre types ont été nommés et discuté. The {{purpose of this}} research is to clarify a new area of human resource management, i. e. the practice of career management. Up to now studies investigated this field by describing career activities one by one instead of describing the career system (i. e. the configuration of these activities). Such a gap can be bridged by developing a taxonomy of career Systems. Building such a taxonomy involves a three-step data analysis strategy. Firstly, principal component analysis is used to group 14 career activities into a few dimensions (grouping of variables). Secondly, cluster analysis (Ward method) takes advantage of these three dimensions to identify career Systems (grouping of observations). Thirdly, a profile of clusters is obtained through analysis of variance. A questionnaire was sent to 1061 organizations in Québec. Of these, 254 were retumed (23. 9 % response rate). The profile of this sample is as follows: 57 % of private firms, median size of 600 employees, mean unionization rate of 69 %. More than 70 % of respondents are heads of the human resource function. Three dimensions emerged from the principal component analysis. The first axis that is called "organizational career" includes five career activities (succession planning, high potential management, data collection on employees, job matching and data collection on future jobs). The second axis called "internal staffing" has three career activities (job posting, <b>promotion</b> <b>from</b> <b>within</b> and lateral mobility). The last axis called "individual career" has two career activities (career planning and career counselling). Four types emerged from cluster analysis. The first one called "traditional model" (30 % of observations) is characterized by a strong involvement in internal staffing and a weak one in organizational career. The second one, called "anemic model" (39 % of cases), has a weak involvement in both internal staffing and organizational career. The third one, called "organizational model" (19 % of observations), has a strong involvement in both internal staffing and organizational career. The last one, called "club model" (17 % of cases), has a strong involvement in individual career but a weak one in internal staffing as well as in organizational career. The present study showed that this taxonomy has some validity since these four types were found to be linked to several variables not previously used in the cluster analysis. These variables used for validation purposes deal with (1) the context (e. g. organizational size, business strategy, employee relations philosophy), (2) internal staffing System (e. g. staffing strategy, mobility culture), and (3) the career System itself (e. g. number of career activities, career objectives). Profiling each type was then carried out. For instance the organizational model is associated with a strong employee relations philosophy, a strong mobility culture, a large number of career activities, and so on while the anemic model is related to a weak employee relations philosophy, a weak mobility culture and a small number of career activities. Then the four types are discussed. Our results show that the traditional and anemic models prevail (69 % of the sample), which means that the majority of career Systems do not try to reconcile employees' and employer's needs...|$|E

40|$|Cette {{recherche}} porte sur les clivages ethniques au sein du groupe de la haute direction des grandes entreprises ayant leur siège social au Québec. Des différences significatives de comportement à l'égard des francophones ont été enregistrées entre firmes canadiennes francophones et anglophones et entre canadiennes et étrangères. Ce souci de contrôle est encore plus affirmé dans les firmes possédées totalement par des étrangers. No systematic {{study has}} been done until now {{on the impact of}} ethnic differences within the senior management of major Quebec-based firms. Owing to the theoretical and practical importance of the headquarters executive group, the problem of ethnically based differences deserves special attention. Generally speaking, it is the possession of considerable holdings which potentially guarantees a person a place on the board. As a result, members of the dominated ethnic group can rise to the top positions in the firm only through <b>promotion</b> <b>from</b> <b>within.</b> To be precise, because of the interpenetration of the board and senior management, the directors must enjoy the full confidence of the board — a confidence based not only on objective data relating to a long record of service out but also on affinities corresponding quite closely to Weber's notion of elective affinity. Such affinities are very common within the same ethnic group. This explains the phenomenon of "inbreeding" in Québec. Elective affinity may be interpreted as confidence and trust in a particular individual, and this involves a certain risk. Therefore, as the degree of affinity decreases, so the level of perceived risk is higher. In other words, in a multiethnic situation, an officer with an ethnic background different from than that of the owners of capital presents a risk. That is, he creates some degree of uncertainty concerning the overall performance expected from him and, therefore, represents a possible loss of control. Elective affinity serves to reduce risk. The desire to maintain control consequently involves an ethnic cost, and the need for community of thought and action at the highest strategic level in the firm constitutes a barrier preventing members of an ethnic group other than the one holding control from acquiring greater power. However, this barrier is not uniform: the officers play different roles giving them different kinds of power. If an executive from an ethnic group other than that of the capital owners is in a position with few, if any, powers, he presents a smaller risk than if he holds a position providing him with a strategic power of control. From {{a list of all the}} officesmaller risk than if he holds a position providing him with a strategic power of control. From a list of all the officers (767) in the 67 Quebec-based industrial and fînancial concerns that are among the 300 largest in Canada, some statistically significant differences have been established:i) between Anglophone and Francophone firms, regarding the proportion of Francophones in the executive group; this reflects the phenomenon of inbreeding (internal recruitment) and ethnocentricity at the senior management level;ii) between major Canadian firms and foreign subsidiaries, regarding the proportion of Francophones;iii) between Canadian and foreign firms, regarding the proportion of foreigners in the executive group; this reflects a strong desire to maintain control on the part of foreign owners of capital;iv) between Anglophone and Francophone firms and between Canadian and foreign-controlled firms, regarding the proportion of Francophones with positions giving them strategic power of control; this reflects the impact of ethnically based differences on the distribution of power within senior management between an ethnic group enjoying elective affinity with the group owning the firm's capital and an ethnic group with little, if any, affinity with the capital-owning group. Generally, Francophones have positions of this kind in Francophone concerns. The relationship between ownership and management — specifically the close link between the distribution of power within the headquarters executives and ethnic background of its members — has been brought out in this study. This relationship has been elucidated with the help of the notions of uncertainty and risk as they relate to Weber's concept of elective affinity. The desire to maintain control leads to a desire to minimize uncertainty and, hence, to the recruitment of officers who present as little risk as possible and who, accordingly, come from the same cultural background as that of the controlling group. A member of an ethnic group other than the capital-owning, or controlling group must negotiate an entry barrier in order to join the executive — precisely because he belongs to a different ethnic group. The desire to maintain control tends to restrict potential access to executive positions both quantitatively and qualitatively: representatives of an ethnic group other than the one in control are brought in on a distinct and different basis, and they are not given positions carrying strategic power of control...|$|E
