5000|$|As of 2006, between 1000 and 3000 {{cases of}} clostridial myonecrosis were {{reported}} in the United States each year, typically accompanied by another pre-existing medical condition. C. septicum {{is one of several}} bacteria responsible for myonecrosis, otherwise known as gas gangrene. Infection by C. septicum was once thought to be extremely rare, however anaerobic laboratory techniques allowed for the discovery of the true potential of this infectious microbe. Infections are typically seen in settings of immunodeficiency, trauma, surgery, malignancy, skin infections/burns, and septic abortions. Sites prone to infection are those with poor vascular supply, although because of pH, electrolyte and omsotic differences, the colon may promote the growth of C. septicum better than most other anatomical regions. One of the more aggressive progenitors of gas gangrene, C. septicum infection progresses very rapidly, with a mortality rate of approximately 79% in adults, typically occurring within 48 hours of infection. The greatest survival rates are typically seen in patients without pre-existing medical conditions, and with infection localized to the extremities. Gas gangrene proceeds via disruption of blood flow to the infected site, resulting in diminished levels of oxygen and nutrients ultimately causing <b>premature</b> <b>cell</b> death and tissue necrosis. Four toxins have been isolated from C. septicum: the lethal alpha toxin, DNase beta-toxin, hyaluronidase gamma toxin, and the thiol-activated/septicolysin delta toxin. Alpha toxin causes intravascular hemolysis and tissue necrosis and is well known as the main virulent factor in C. septicum. Symptoms of infection include pain, described as a heaviness or pressure that is disproportionate to physical findings, tachycardia, and hypotension. Tissue necrosis then causes edema and ischemia resulting in metabolic acidosis, fever, and renal failure. The carbon dioxide and hydrogen produced during cellular respiration move through tissue planes, causing their separation, producing features characteristic of palpable emphysema. This also results in a magenta-bronze skin discoloration and bulla filled with a foul-smelling serosanguinous fluid.|$|E

40|$|Organ {{failure is}} a severe {{complication}} frequently seen in injured patients, with mortality rates {{of up to}} 80 %. Failure of function {{of one or more}} organs after trauma occurs during an early phase (0 - 3 days) and/or a late phase (> 7 days). Neutrophils and monocytes (both leukocytes and important effector cells of the innate immune system) are essential in the pathophysiology of organ failure after trauma. It is thought that early phase organ failure is caused by the excessive activation of the above mentioned cells, while organ failure during the late phase is the consequence of severe infection resulting in sepsis. The exact mechanisms underlying early and late phase organ failure are currently unknown. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment remain difficult. The pathophysiology of organ failure after injury was studied by investigating the phenotype and function of neutrophils and monocytes in trauma patients. Severe injury is known to cause stimulation of these innate immune cells. Indeed, activated neutrophils were found in the lungs, however, neutrophils with decreased functionality were found in the circulation. Functionality of neutrophils was measured by the responsiveness of an active receptor complex (active Fc-gamma-RII) towards in vitro stimulation with a bacterial derived product (fMLP). With increasing injury severity, a decreasing responsiveness of neutrophils in the peripheral circulation was found. In addition, patients who developed early phase respiratory failure (ARDS) demonstrated a striking decreased neutrophil responsiveness. Similar changes in the monocyte population were found, measured by the expression of a receptor used for antigen recognition (e. g. HLA-DR). An increase in trauma severity was related to a marked redistribution of the HLA-DR monocyte population. Patients who developed ARDS demonstrated a distinctly lower percentage of HLA-DR positive monocytes after trauma. Trauma led to neutrophils in the circulation with a decreased functionality and a redistribution of the monocyte population. As a result in injured patients with an excessive inflammatory response, the innate immune system becomes exhausted after a week. Exhaustion of the immune system was demonstrated by 1) a further decline of neutrophil responsiveness, reaching its minimum prior to the development of sepsis and 2) an inadequate response of HLA-DR negative monocytes in the second week after trauma, predisposing the patient to severe infections. Besides a decreased neutrophil responsiveness, subpopulations of neutrophils appeared in the peripheral circulation of injured patients. After severe trauma, <b>premature</b> <b>cells</b> (i. e. metamyelocytes) and toxic neutrophils coexist besides normally mature neutrophils. All cells have distinct morphology, phenotype and function. In patients with septic shock, these toxic neutrophils were also found in the lymphatic system. It is hypothesized that under the extreme conditions of sepsis, fresh neutrophils are not produced in a sufficient number, which forces the release of <b>premature</b> <b>cells</b> from the bone marrow and recirculation of toxic neutrophils from the tissues. Above mentioned data provide important information on the normal homeostasis of human innate immune cells and their role after excessive stimulation by injury.

Inducible and specific expression of the orf 507 gene in the pepper maintainer line found that transformants were morphologically similar to untransformed and transformed control plants, but had shrunken anthers that showed little dehiscence and fewer pollen grains with lower germination rate and higher naturally damaged rate.

BAK activation induces apoptosis by cooligomerizing with another proapoptotic protein, BAX. Together, BAK and BAX form pores in the mitochondrial membrane, releasing apoptogenic proteins like cytochrome c. This and other proteins released from the mitochondria lead to activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and the resulting apoptotic program. However, in adenovirus-infected cells, activated BAK and BAX are sequestered by E1B-19k, preventing the pathway.|$|R
40|$|Specialized {{forms of}} {{physiologic}} cell death lacking certain characteristic morphologic features of apoptosis occur in terminally differentiating tissues, {{such as in}} the outer cell layers of epidermis. In these cell layers, NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces target gene expression. In light of its potent role in regulating apoptotic cell death in other tissues, NF-κB activation in these cells suggests that this transcription factor regulates cell death during terminal differentiation. Here, we show that NF-κB protects normal epithelial cells from apoptosis induced by both TNFα and Fas, whereas NF-κB blockade enhances susceptibility to death via both pathways. Expression of IκBαM under control of keratin promoter in transgenic mice caused a blockade of NF-κB function in the epidermis and provoked <b>premature</b> spontaneous <b>cell</b> death with apoptotic features. In normal tissue, expression of the known NF-κB–regulated antiapoptotic factors, TRAF 1, TRAF 2, c-IAP 1, and c-IAP 2, is most pronounced in outer epidermis.

These data identify a new role for NF-κB in preventing <b>premature</b> apoptosis in <b>cells</b> committed to undergoing physiologic cell death and indicate that, in stratified epithelium, such cell death normally proceeds via a distinct pathway that is resistant to NF-κB and its antiapoptotic target effector genes.

Several studies have been or are being conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of Irinotecan admin-istered for malignant glioma [3, 4]. A major problem of this cytotoxic drug is leukopenia and severe diar-rhea, which limits the dose of administration. An early cholinergic syndrome has been reported in more than 80 % of patients soon after receiving Irinotecan therapy or even during the administra-tion, but the symptoms are controlled by atropine administration. Delayed-onset diarrhea occurs in 87 % of the cases, usually 7 – 10 days after treatment [5], and this side effect may lead to cessation of therapy.
