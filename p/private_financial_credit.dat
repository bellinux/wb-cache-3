40|$|PAK {{policy is}} one of the {{important}} policies that has been adopted in housing market during the two recent decades. It mainly focuses on saving, development and downsizing. Now given that housing can be considered both as a capital and an expendable property and it has unique characteristics such as heterogeneity, durability and spatial stability, the present paper investigated how this policy-making is effective on housing supply considering the above characteristics and by means of Lucas supply function. The results revealed that this policy cannot have the required efficiency in this sector despite high saving of households and decreased floor area of residential units. This is while housing supply has not been influenced by investment of the <b>private</b> sector and <b>financial</b> <b>credits...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at verifying {{the nature}} of the {{relationship}} between financial development and economic growth in Brazil. From the theoretical point-of-view, although the prevailing view through which financial development generate direct impacts on economic growth, there are distinct positions. Some authors argue that, in fact, the two variables are jointly determined, while others simply insert this relation in the theoretical framework of demand for financial assets. In face of this, the causality test proposed by Granger was adopted for the empirical verification. Thus, using the data from 1947 - 2000, 1963 - 2000 and 1970 - 2000, the obtained results empirically support the existence of direct and unidirectional impacts of financial development on economic growth, when the following ratios are used as financial development indicators: banking <b>credit</b> to <b>private</b> sector/GDP, <b>financial</b> system <b>credits</b> to <b>private</b> sector/GDP and public resources in the financial system/M 2. ...|$|R

As a result, policy makers need to be more flexible in their responses to both credit problems.|$|R

40|$|The central goal of my {{research}} is to integrate the long and the short run analysis {{of the effects of}} financial development on the growth performance of countries. The domestic financial development can be measured by the development of <b>private</b> <b>credit,</b> <b>financial</b> depth or the relative size of the competitive banking sector 1. The impact of international financial liberalization will be reflected in the size and composition of foreign capital inflows. In the long run, the causal positive effect of financial development on growth has been established in the recent empirical literature (Beck-Loayza-Levine[2000]; Benhabib-Spiegel [2000]). In the short run, episodes of boom-bust cycles following financial liberalization in middle income economies have been documented (Tornell-Westerman [2001]) : a rapid financial development increases the vulnerability of the financial system that may eventually end up in a financial crisis associated with a sharp output contraction. My first paper (Loayza-Ranciere [2002]) establishes empirically the coexistence of long run pos-itive effects and short run negative effects of financial development on growth. We first extend the result of Beck-Loayza-Levine[2000] using the same instrumental technique and we show that the growth enhancing effect of financial depth is weaker but still significantly positive in countries tha...|$|R
