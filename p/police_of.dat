5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true.

Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E

5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best <b>police</b> <b>of</b> The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
