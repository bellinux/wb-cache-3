50|$|Punching, {{and press}} work in general, {{is a process}} well suited to mass production. However the initial tooling costs, of both the machine and the job-specific <b>press</b> <b>tool,</b> are high. This limits punch work from being used for much small-volume and {{prototype}} work. A turret punch {{is one way of}} addressing this cost. The tooling of a turret punch uses a large number of standard punch tools: holes of varying sizes, straight edges, commonly-used notches or mounting holes. By using a large number of strokes, with several different tools in turn, a turret press may make a wide variety of parts without having to first make a specialised <b>press</b> <b>tool</b> for that task. This saves both time and money, allowing rapid prototyping or for low volume production to start without tooling delays.|$|E

This combination makes rubber pad pressing very suitable for smaller and medium-sized series (up to 5,000-10,000 pieces per year), even though traditional cutting, lace, welding, finishing etc. is used more due to the unfamiliarity with rubber pad forming.|$|E
