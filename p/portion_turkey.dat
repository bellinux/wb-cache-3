50|$|The {{size and}} {{geography}} of Turkey {{accounts for the}} wide climatic variation of Turkey's wine regions. The wine regions of Thrace along the Sea of Marmara have slight Mediterranean climates that resembles those of neighboring southwest Bulgaria and northeast Greece. This area is responsible for nearly 40% of Turkey's wine production which also produces the most elegant and balanced wines in Turkey. The sub region of Thrace, Kirklareli, is known for her crisp white wines and fine reds. The wine regions along the Aegean coast, mostly near İzmir, account for 20% of the country's wine production, and have much more pronounced Mediterranean climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. The remaining <b>portion</b> of <b>Turkey's</b> wine production takes place in scattered pockets throughout the Eastern and Central Anatolia regions. The region of Central Anatolia is the most climatically difficult region to produce wine, with most vineyards being located at altitudes near 1,250 meters (4,000 feet) above sea level. Winter frost is a serious viticultural hazard, with winter temperatures often dropping to −25 °C (−13 °F). In the summer, grapes of this region can receive up to 12 hours of sunshine a day. The vineyards of Eastern Anatolia around Elazığ, Malatya and Diyarbakır {{are located in the}} Euphrates valley, {{which is one of the}} world's oldest wine regions and the anecdotal location of Noah's vineyards from the 9th chapter of Genesis.|$|R

40|$|The Khabour River, southernmost {{tributary}} to the Euphrates, is a {{case study}} in the complexity of managing riparian resources. The river is located entirely within Syria but the watershed includes <b>portions</b> of <b>Turkey</b> and Iraq. Indeed, on account of the steep southward precipitation gradient in the region, the spring-fed Khabour is recharged almost exclusively by precipitation that falls on Turkish soil. For millennia the northern portions of the Khabour watershed have been used for rainfed agriculture. Until recently, however, cultivation along the dry southern stretch of the river was limited to the floodplain, where traditional gravity methods of irrigation could be practiced. In {{the last half of the}} 20 th century irrigation initiatives in both Turkey and Syria fundamentally altered the human and hydrologic character of the watershed. First came broad introduction of the diesel-powered pump, which allowed farmers to draw on deep groundwater reserves from virtually anywhere in the basin. Next came major impoundment and diversion schemes. In the 1990 s alone two major dams were constructed along the Khabour and plans to import water to the Turkish portion of the basin neared completion. We have used paired Landsat TM images from September 1990 and 2000 together with ASTER-derived digital elevation data and the statistical tools of landscape ecology to quantify changes in the distribution of irrigation projects in the Khabour watershed. Through these analyses we can describe the changing character of agriculture in this region, and by integrating this remotely sensed data with biophysical information on climate and hydrology it is possible to evaluate the hydrologic impact of various water extraction and diversion schemes...|$|R

After crossing the railroad tracks, the route intersected LA 29 at West Bacciochi Avenue. LA 13 then turned west onto PR 6-400 (Murphy Richard Loop) and finally, north onto PR 6-401 (North 8th Street) to rejoin the current alignment. [...] All four right-angle turns were eliminated when the current alignment was constructed in the early 1970s, smoothing the route and relocating the junction with LA 29.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The lateral {{variations}} of seismic attenuation in the crust of Turkey and surrounding regions have been imaged from the inversion of interstation Lg Q-measurements. This study develops the first tomographic model for Lg Q 0 in this region. That model {{is consistent with}} previous more qualitative Lg-attenuation models that showed inefficient or blocked Lg across the Eurasian-Arabian plate boundary. In general, the northern Arabian platform has low to normal Lg Q 0 -values (250 – 350), whereas high Q 0 -values (670 – 800) occur in the southern Arabian Plate. Addition-ally, we have found a dramatic decrease in Lg Q 0 across the Bitlis suture, the plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Beneath the Turkish Plateau, our high to moderate Lg-attenuation values (Q 0 100 – 200) probably originates from both scattering and intrinsic attenuation due to the tectonic complexity and the wide-spread young volcanics in the region. We conclude that the lowest Q 0 -values for the East Anatolian plateau (70 – 100) and the <b>portion</b> of western <b>Turkey</b> around the Men-deres Massif (60 – 150) are probably caused by intrinsic attenuation. We find low to normal Lg Q 0 -values (150 – 300) beneath the part of the Taurus Mountains in western Anatolia. These higher values {{may be related to the}} nature of the crust in the Tauride mountain belt. We also mapped the lateral variations in Lg g and observed a fairly consistent negative correlation between g and Lg Q 0 in the northern Middle East...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{skeletal system}} undergoes adaptation {{in response to}} external forces, but {{the relation between the}} skeletal changes and such forces is not understood. In this context, the variation in the amount and location of calcification has been compared with changes in mechanical properties of the normally mineralizing turkey gastrocnemius tendon using ash weight measurements, X-ray radiography, and mechanical testing. Radiographic evidence from 12 - to 17 -week-old birds showed calcification in only portions of gastrocnemius tendons proximal to the tarsometatarsal joint. Mechanical testing of these dissected proximal regions demonstrated an increased ultimate stress and modulus and a decreased maximum strain that appeared to parallel calcification. Further, stress-strain curves of <b>portions</b> of uncalcified <b>turkey</b> gastrocnemius tendon were shaped similar to those of other typical unmineralized tendon curves while highly calcified tendons yielded curves resembling those of bone. The proximal portions of the gastrocnemius where mineralization begins were observed to have a decreased tendon cross-sectional area compared with distal portions which do not mineralize. Based on the resultant measures of mineral content and location and mechanical properties, it is hypothesized that increased calcification is a result of increased stresses at certain locations of the tendon, perhaps the consequence of the natural forces exerted by the large leg muscles of the bird into which the gastrocnemius inserts. More specifically, tendon calcification {{may be the result of}} stress-induced exposure of charged sites on the surfaces of collagen molecules, fibrils, or fibers so that deposition of mineral and subsequent mechanical reinforcement occur in the tissue.
