40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the “hidden” cooperative/competitive relations among the industrial production branches, which are neither technologically nor operationally in- terconnected. We assume the existence of two relation forms. In the cooperation form, the busi- ness, legal, tax and financial conditions positively affect the production across the industries. In the competitive relations case, the industries compete for common resources and supply their production in the same consumer market. We assume that this kind of the competition/coopera- tion relations among the industries define an equilibrium, which can be modeled by vector error correction model. Using the vector error correction model, we identified both the long-run and the short-run equilibrium relationships among the sales indicators and other exogenous variables. We analyzed seven industrial production branches/sectors according to Branch Statistical Classifica- tion of the Economic Activities. The selected industrial indicators involve sales, wages and number of employees across the industrial branches. The research showed that even though the industrial branches are not obviously interconnected, the statistical significant relations among them may exist. Using the Slovak monthly time series cover the time period 1998 – 2007, we discovered the statistically significant long-term relations among the sales indicators. Here, the industrial bran- ches Manufacture of electrical machinery and Manufacture of radio, television and communication as well as branches Manufacture of electrical machinery and Manufacture of medical, <b>precision</b> <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> <b>instruments</b> were in the hidden long-term competitive relation and the branches Manu- facture of radio, television and communication and Manufacture of medical, <b>precision</b> <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> <b>instruments</b> were in the hidden long-term cooperative relation. On the other hand, the statistically significant sales short-term relations to restore the equilibrium were also proved. The short-term relations between the sales indicators on one side and both the cross-sales lagged variables and the exogenous variables on the other side were not statistically significant...|$|E

3000|$|Table  4 shows, {{whether it}} is from the {{perspective}} of “global comparative advantage” or of “local comparative advantage” (Deardorff 2004), the aggregate trade cost has the effect on export structure of manufacturing, 9 which indicates the trade cost is similar with the material capital and human capital, and is also a factor that influences the trade pattern or structure. The increase in Chinese aggregate trade cost significantly reduces the export share of manufacturing. This effect in the industry with higher trade cost sensitivity is more obvious, and thereby affects the structure of trade commodities. Specifically, the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacturing of office, accounting and computing machinery (C 30)” is highest with the value of 0.523639; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of radio, television and communication equipment and apparatus (C 32)” ranks second with the value of 0.464463; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of medical equipment, <b>precision</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> <b>instruments,</b> watches <b>and</b> clocks manufacturing (C 33)” ranks third with the value of 0.464463. The decline of aggregate trade cost contributes to the effect of these industries export ranking the top three. The trade cost sensitivity of “food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing (C 15 T 16)” is lowest with the value of 0.118279. The trade cost sensitivity of “other non metallic mineral products manufacturing (C 26)” is in the reciprocal second with the value of 0.166794. The trade cost sensitivity of “wood products (C 20)” is in the reciprocal third with the value of 0.178894. The decline of aggregate trade cost contributes to the effect of these industries export in the reciprocal three. This paper calculates the average degree of the effect of aggregate trade cost on different industries: for the first column that reflects the “global comparative advantage”, one unit decreasing of standard deviation in the Chinese aggregate trade cost contributes to 0.081 percentages increasing of export average value of the 17 industries; for the second column that reflects the “local comparative advantage” with the developed countries as the sample, one unit decreasing of standard deviation in the Chinese aggregate trade cost contributes to 0.095 percentages increasing of export average value of the 17 industries; for the third or fourth column that reflects the “local comparative advantage” with developing countries and countries along the “Belt and Road” as the sample, respectively, one unit decreasing of standard deviation in the Chinese aggregate trade cost contributes to 0.062 and 0.033 percentages increasing of export average value of the 17 industries, respectively. 10 [...]...|$|R

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxii, 185 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe export-led growth hypothesis {{is one of}} the most popular topics in growth economy. Many researchers have tried to test the hypothesis by using different variables and a range of test methods. The results were mixed. This study emphasizes the specific industries by using industry-level data to test Granger type causality. We used a five-variable Lag Augmented-VAR (LA-VAR) model to test the export-led growth hypothesis in the case of Korea. We found that all light manufacturing industries show bi-directional causality and the result is robust to lag structure and data characteristic. The Non-metallic Mineral Products (industry 36) and The Motor Vehicles and Transport Equipment (industry 385) supported the export-led growth hypothesis in the sense that there is unidirectional causality from export to productivity. In heavy industry, we found more industries that have clear causal direction from productivity to export, rather than from export to productivity. However, some heavy industries showed sensitivity in lag structure, meaning the causal direction could not be determined. No causality at all was found in the Medical, <b>Precision</b> <b>and</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Instruments</b> industry. We suspect that there is "productivity paradox" in Electric and Electronic Equipment (industry 383) and Medical, <b>Precision</b> <b>and</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Instruments</b> (industry 384). Industry-specific industrial policy turns out to be superior to across-the-board industrial policy because policy implications differ by industry. Promotion of export behavior is not always the path to economic growth in every industry. As can be learned from the analysis of light manufacturing industries, promotion of competition and better networking and the reduction of sunken cost for industry would be a good focus for future policy. Better understanding of the mechanism for transmission of externalities could lead to better policy analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates both {{aggregate}} and distributional {{impacts of}} the trade integration of China, India, and Central and Eastern Europe in a quantitative multi-country multi-sector model, comparing outcomes with and without factor market frictions. Under perfect within-country factor mobility, the gains {{to the rest of}} the world from trade integration of emerging giants are 0. 37 %, ranging from - 0. 37 % for Honduras to 2. 28 % for Sri Lanka. Reallocation of factors across sectors contributes relatively little to the aggregate gains, but has large distributional effects. The aggregate gains {{to the rest of the}} world are only 0. 065 percentage points lower when neither capital nor labor can move across sectors within a country. On the other hand, the distributional effects of the emerging giants' trade integration are an order of magnitude larger, with changes in real factor returns ranging from - 5 % to 5 % across sectors in most countries. The workers and capital owners in emerging giants' comparative advantage sectors such as Textiles and Wearing Apparel experience greatest losses, while factor owners in Printing and Medical, <b>Precision</b> <b>and</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Instruments</b> normally gain the most...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} paper deals with an export structural transformation model providing for {{a transition from}} the production and exports of goods with low value added to the production and exports of goods with high value added. It {{is essential for the}} improvement of a nation's welfare, as observations show that in a longer perspective the level of economic development is related to the degree of export sophistication. The speed of structural transformation depends on the distance in the product space between the potential export goods and the existing export goods with revealed comparative advantage. Estimations within the research suggest that the relative distance of Latvian export goods to goods with comparative advantage is rather small. Potential of almost all groups of currently produced goods to act as drivers of development has already been exhausted to a large extent. In order to enhance sophistication of Latvia's export structure, the production of goods with their implicit income level exceeding the current average weighted value of the export basket should be augmented. Potential goods for exports include pharmaceutical products, medical, <b>precision</b> <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> <b>instruments</b> as well as chemicals and chemical products. However, it is rather unlikely that comparative advantage in these products can be developed without extra supportive measures taken by the Government. structural transformation, comparative advantage, export sophistication...|$|E
