Shrubs and small trees of Elaeaguaceae have ring-porous or semi-ring-porous wood with simple perforation plates, vascular tracheids, fiber-tracheids, diffuse or rarely <b>paratracheal</b> axial <b>parenchyma,</b> and uni- or biseriate rays in Hippophae and Shepherdia, but wider rays in Elaeagnus. Walls of vessel elements, especially narrow ones, tracheids, or fiber-tracheids sometimes show helical thickenings; {{in a few}} instances these intergrade with small bud-like protrusions associated with pits. Scanning electron microscopy illustrates that small to vestigial vestures are present in all species studied, although nonvestured pits are also common. The analogous nature of vestures and helical thickenings is considered.

5000|$|As a tree grows, its cambium adds {{an annual}} {{increment}} (or ring) of new wood, {{and in many}} species of trees the older wood towards {{the centre of the}} tree becomes less important for physiological processes like water and nutrient transportation, and this is converted by the tree to heartwood. This heartwood has no active defenses against infection, but is protected from infection and decay by the blockage of the xylem vessels with tyloses and various substances such as gums, resins and waxes containing high concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as terpenes that are toxic to insect larvae and tree pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. These products are produced by the cambium and transported to the centre of the stem by cellular structures called medullary rays radiating {{from the center of the}} stem [...] and then enter living axial <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells. As the wood ages, the contents of the parenchyma cell burst into the dead vessel through the pit linking the two.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} wood anatomy as {{it relates}} to safranine solution penetration in Samanea saman, which belongs to the family Mimosoideae and is native to Bangladesh. The wood of this species was characterized by diffuse-porous vessels with simple perforations, alternate and opposite vestured intervessel pits, gums in heartwood vessels, vascicentric <b>paratracheal</b> axial <b>parenchyma,</b> lozenge-aliform, confluent prismatic crystals in fiber, and chambered axial parenchyma cells. Different anatomical features affect longitudinal and lateral liquid permeability. Herein microstructures that controlled liquid penetration are described and compared. We observed that ray cell lumen diameter, end-wall pit number and diameter, ray cell length, vessel number, and both vessel and fiber diameter and length affected the depth of liquid flow. Safranine solution formed a meniscus while traveling through different types of cells. Air trapped in capillaries blocked safranine solution penetration.

40|$|Sengon (Falcataria moluccana) is {{fast growing}} species mostly planted by farmers {{due to its}} high productivity. Sengon {{originating}} from Solomon Island has been known with the high productivity eventhough susceptible to gall rust attack; on the other hand, sengon originating from Wamena {{is known to be}} more tolerant to gall rust attack. There is no previous study in terms of stem xylem structures comparing sengon from those seed origins. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the differences in anatomical structure of sengon stem; and to compare the xylem cell based on proportions and dimensions of the stems between the two provenances. Six stem samples of tolerant Wamena provenance and six samples of susceptible Solomon provenance were used in this study. Samples were collected from progeny trial of sengon in Lumajang, Jawa Timur. The observations include the anatomical structures and vessel element, parenchyma apotracheal cell, <b>parenchyma</b> <b>paratracheal</b> cell, xylem fiber, fiber length, and fiber diameter.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{secondary}} growth {{and structure of}} secondary xylem was studied in the stem of the Neotropical liana Securidaca rivinifolia A. St. -Hil. (Polygalaceae). Increase in thickness of the stem was achieved by formation of successive cambia, from which initially two or three successive rings formed complete oval to circular cambia. Thereafter, the successive cambia were always crescent-shaped and never formed a complete cylinder, resulting in dumbbell-shaped cross-sectional outlines of the stems. The first successive cambium originated in the pericyclic parenchyma located outside the crushed protophloem. Prior {{to the development of}} cambium, pericyclic parenchyma formed a meristematic band of radially arranged cells. From this band, cells located {{in the middle of the}} band became the new ring of cambium. Cells on the inner face of the xylem produced by newly formed cambium differentiated into conjunctive tissue. The first elements to be differentiated from the newly developed cambium were always xylem fibres but differentiation of vessels was also observed occasionally.

40|$|Sassafrasoxylon gottwaldii sp. nov. {{is a new}} taxon for fossil {{wood with}} a suite of {{features}} diagnostic of Sassafras Nees & Eberm. of the Lauraceae. The fossil wood described is from Late Cretaceous (Santonian- Maastrichtian) sediments of the northern Antarctica Peninsula region. This new species of Sassafrasoxylon Brezinová et Süss resembles the species of extant Sassafras in being distinctly ring-porous, having vessel elements with simple perforation plates and very occasional scalariform plates with relatively few bars in the narrowest latewood vessels, alternate intervascular pitting, marginal (initial) <b>parenchyma</b> bands and <b>paratracheal</b> vasicentric <b>parenchyma</b> in the latewood, multiseriate rays and oil and /or mucilage cells. The fossils were found as isolated pieces of wood and therefore it is not certain whether the parent plant was Sassafras- like in all characters. Consequently the fossils {{have been placed in}} an organ genus rather than in extant Sassafras. This is the oldest record of an organ with features closest to extant Sassafras and may suggest that Sassafras first appeared in Gondwana and later radiated into the Northern Hemisphere.

40|$|Features {{in which}} Agdestis differs from Phytolaccaceae s. s. include {{presence}} of both libriform fibers and vasicentric tracheids (rather {{than one or}} the other); bands and strands of thin-walled apotracheal parenchyma (in addition to <b>paratracheal</b> scanty <b>parenchyma,</b> and raylessness (also reported for Bougainvillea of Nyctaginaceae, a family close to Phytolaccaceae). Dimorphism in vessel diameter in Agdestis (narrow vessels like libriform fibers in diameter) is attributable to the lianoid habit. Packets of crystals coarser than typical for raphides occur idioblastically in Agdestis, as do raphides in Phytolacca. ln Phytolacca and in other Phytolaccaceae, one finds an unusual feature that occurs in Agdestis: nonbordered simple perforation plates. Anatomical data support Agdestis as forming a mono- generic subfamily within Phytolaccaceae s. l. The nature of successive cambia in Agdestis is compared with those in other Phytolaccaceae and in Nyctaginaceae. A common pattern is probably present, although differences in terminology and observations obscure the pattern. The term 2 ̆ 2 interxylary phloem 2 ̆ 2 is a misnomer because conjunctive tissue is not secondary xylem as generally understood. After cessation of the cambium in the first cylinder, radial rows of cells form outside the phloem and inside the cortex; this activity may constitute a lateral meristem. Apparently within the radial rows of cells, successive cambia form; each of these cambia produce secondary phloem externally and secondary xylem internally.

Yet, {{there is a strong}} demand for comparative reference material, seeking for an improvement in the precision of taxonomic determination, both in palaeoecological and palaeoethnobotanical studies and to help preventing illegal charcoal production. This work presents descriptions of charcoal anatomy of eleven Anacardiaceae species from six genera native to Brazil (Anacardium occidentale, Anacardium parvifolium, Astronium graveolens, Astronium lecointei, Lithrea molleoides, Schinus terebenthifolius, Spondias mombin, Spondias purpurea, Spondias tuberosa, Tapirira guianensis, and Tapirira obtusa). They are characterized by diffuse-porous wood, vessels solitary and in multiples, tyloses and spiral thickenings sometimes present; simple perforation plates, alternate intervessel pits, rounded vessel-ray pits with much reduced borders to apparently simple; <b>parenchyma</b> <b>paratracheal</b> scanty to vasicentric; heterocellular rays, some with radial canals and crystals; septate fibres with simple pits. These results are quite similar to previous wood anatomical descriptions of the same species or genera.

40|$|Summary. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (Pch) {{is one of}} {{the main}} causal agents of {{tracheomycosis}} in grapevine. We characterize how this fungus affects the response of Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon to bark and xylem-tissue wounding after six weeks post-treatment. A histological investigation shows that, in xylem tissue, cell-wall modifications in response to wounding are related to suberin deposits rather than to lignin-induced wall thickening. The xylem response does not appear to be disturbed by Pch infection. Therefore, cell-wall modification strongly inhibits the development of wound-closure tissue (WCT) but does not prevent the differentiation of the necro-phylactic periderm. Hyphae localization in tissue surrounding the wound or inoculation sites indicates that Pch colonizes all cell types, such as vascular tissues, <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, fibers and rays. The results also suggest that efficient compartmentalization separating fascicular xylem portions is assured by thick suberized cell walls bordering the ray parenchyma...|$|E

Capsicodendron dinisii hhas scalariform perforation plates and oil cells associated with the axial parenchyma. Axial parenchyma paratracheal vasicentric and in marginal bands beyond the rays' width, can separate Osteophoeum platyspermum from Simaba cedron.

40|$|The {{circumscription}} of Bignoniaceae genera and tribes {{has undergone}} major changes following an increased understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the family. While DNA sequence data have repeatedly reconstructed major clades within the family, {{some of the}} clades recovered still lack diagnostic morpho-anatomical features, complicating their recognition. In this study we investigated the wood anatomy of all major lineages of Bignoniaceae (except Tourrettieae) in search for anatomical synapomorphies for clades. We sampled 158 species of Bignoniaceae, representing 67 out of the 82 genera currently recognized. Detailed descriptions of quantitative and qualitative wood anatomical features are presented for each clade and interpreted {{in the light of}} a molecular phylogeny for the family. Jacarandae are characterized by a paratracheal winged-aliform parenchyma, with the traditional subdivision of Jacaranda into sections Monolobos and Dilobos supported by the uniseriate and homocellular rays of Monolobos versus the wide and heterocellular rays of Dilobos. Tecomeae s. s. are characterized by scanty <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> septate fibers, and heterocellular rays, traits also found in Delostoma, a genus previously included in Tecomeae s. l., but recently shown to represent a separate lineage. Crescentiina includes two sub-clades, the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade, which share abundant aliform parenchyma, short and mainly homocellular rays, less commonly with heterocellular rays with body procumbent and one row of marginal square cells. Members of the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade can be distinguished from each other by the narrow vessels with a widespread storied structure found in members of the Tabebuia alliance, versus the vessels with medium to wide width and a non-storied structure found in members of the Paleotropical clade. Oroxyleae are characterized by a combination of simple and foraminate perforation plates and homocellular rays, while Catalpeae are characterized by scanty <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> abundant tyloses and vessel-ray pits simple to semi-bordered. Bignonieae differ from all other clades by a variant secondary growth and a typically lianoid wood anatomy. Overall, wood anatomical characters are not very labile within the family, being distributed across clades in a very predictive manner. Several anatomical characters represent good anatomical synapomorphies and provide further support to clades identified in molecular phylogenetic studies...|$|E
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty <b>paratracheal</b> to aliform <b>parenchyma.</b> The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s. s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae. Variation in quantitative characters (vessel member length, vessel diameter and frequency) can partly be explained from the ecological preference of the species concerned.

Climbing rauvolfi oid taxa can generally be distinguished from erect species by their wider vessels, tendency to form paratracheal axial parenchyma, presence of tracheids, and occurrence of laticifers in rays. With respect to the entire family, there is a general phylogenetic trend toward shorter vessel elements, a higher proportion of vessels in multiples and more vessels per multiple, higher tracheid abundance, more <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> and fewer cells per axial parenchyma strand in the more derived Apocynaceae.

Tetrameristaccae and Pellicieraceae are found to be closely related based on the occurrence of unilaterally compound vessel-ray pitting and multiseriate rays with long uniseriate ends. The narrow rays in Pelliciera are characteristic of this genus, but a broader concept of Tetrameristaceae including Pelliciera is favored. Within Marcgraviaceae, wide rays (more than five-seriate) are typical of the genus Marcgravia. Furthermore, there is evidence that the impact of altitude and habit {{plays an important role in}} the wood structure of this family. The wood structure of Balsaminaceae cannot be compared systematically with other balsaminoids because of their secondary woodiness. Balsaminaceae wood strongly differs due to the presence of exclusively upright ray cells in Impatiens niamniamensis, the absence of rays in Impatiens arguta, and the occurrence of several additional paedomorphic features in both species. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|During gel (gum) {{formation}} in angiosperm trees, fibrillar material accumulated in protective layers of xylem parenchyma cells before being secreted across half-bordered pit membranes into vessel elements. Immunogold labeling demonstrated that this fibrillar material was mainly composed of partially esterified pectic polysaccharides. The primary wall of expanding tyloses, {{an extension of}} the parenchyma protective layer, secreted similar pectic substances to completely block vessel elements. In most studies, these occluding structures were reported to be formed in response to causative factors such as aging processes, injuries, or infections. Current observations support the view that partial to complete embolism, which almost always accompanies these factors, might be the main cause triggering the formation of vessel occlusions. Whereas pectin seems to be the basic component of gels (gums) and of the external layer of tyloses, other substances, such as phenols, were also detected either as a part of these plugs or as accumulations beside them in vessels. Finally, it is proposed that the term "gel" instead of "gum" be used in future studies to describe the occluding material secreted by ray and <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells.

40|$|Protoxylem {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the hydraulic function of vascular systems of both herbaceous and woody plants, but relatively little is known about the processes underlying the maintenance of protoxylem function in long-lived tissues. In this study, embolism repair was investigated in relation to xylem structure in two cushion plant species, Azorella macquariensis and Colobanthus muscoides, in which vascular water transport depends on protoxylem. Their protoxylem vessels consisted of a primary wall with helical thickenings that effectively formed a pit channel, with the primary wall being the pit channel membrane. Stem protoxylem was organized such that the pit channel membranes connected vessels with <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> or other protoxylem vessels and were not exposed directly to air spaces. Embolism was experimentally induced in excised vascular tissue and detached shoots by exposing them briefly to air. When water was resupplied, embolized vessels refilled within tens of seconds (excised tissue) to a few minutes (detached shoots) with water sourced from either adjacent parenchyma or water-filled vessels. Refilling occurred in two phases: (1) water refilled xylem pit channels, simplifying bubble shape to a rod with two menisci; and (2) the bubble contracted as the resorption front advanced, dissolving air along the way. Physical properties of the protoxylem vessels (namely pit channel membrane porosity, hydrophilic walls, vessel dimensions, and helical thickenings) promoted rapid refilling of embolized conduits independent of root pressure. These results have implications for the maintenance of vascular function in both herbaceous and woody species, because protoxylem plays a major role in the hydraulic systems of leaves, elongating stems, and roots...|$|E

The primitive nature of Prionoteae and Archerieae {{is supported by the}} presence of scalariform perforation plates with many bars and scalariform to opposite vessel pitting. The wood structure of Oligarrheneae {{is similar to that of}} Styphelieae, but the very narrow vessel elements, exclusively uniseriate rays and the lack of prismatic crystals in Oligarrheneae distinguish these two tribes. The secondary xylem of Monotoca tamariscina indicates that it does not fit in Styphelieae; a position within Oligarrheneae is possible. Like most Cosmelieae, all Richeeae are characterized by exclusively scalariform perforation plates with many bars, a very high vessel density and <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> although they clearly differ in ray width (exclusively uniseriate rays in Cosmelieae vs. uniseriate and wide multiseriate rays in Richeeae). Several wood anatomical features confirm the inclusion of epacrids in Ericaceae s. l. Furthermore, there are significant ecological implications. The small vessel diameter and high vessel frequency in many epacrids are indicative of a high conductive safety to avoid embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles, while the replacement of scalariform by simple vessel perforation plates and an increase in vessel diameter would suggest an increased conductive efficiency, which is especially found in mesic temperate or tropical Styphelieae.

40|$|The {{circumscription}} of Bignoniaceae genera and tribes {{has undergone}} major changes following an increased understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the family. While DNA sequence data have repeatedly reconstructed major clades within the family, {{some of the}} clades recovered still lack diagnostic morpho-anatomical features, complicating their recognition. In this study we investigated the wood anatomy of all major lineages of Bignoniaceae (except Tourrettieae) in search for anatomical synapomorphies for clades. We sampled 158 species of Bignoniaceae, representing 67 out of the 82 genera currently recognized. Detailed descriptions of quantitative and qualitative wood anatomical features are presented for each clade and interpreted {{in the light of}} a molecular phylogeny for the family. Jacarandae are characterized by a paratracheal winged-aliform parenchyma, with the traditional subdivision of Jacaranda into sections Monolobos and Dilobos supported by the uniseriate and homocellular rays of Monolobos versus the wide and heterocellular rays of Dilobos. Tecomeae s. s. are characterized by scanty <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> septate fibers, and heterocellular rays, traits also found in Delostoma, a genus previously included in Tecomeae s. l., but recently shown to represent a separate lineage. Crescentiina includes two sub-clades, the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade, which share abundant aliform parenchyma, short and mainly homocellular rays, less commonly with heterocellular rays with body procumbent and one row of marginal square cells. Members of the Tabebuia alliance and the Paleotropical clade can be distinguished from each other by the narrow vessels with a widespread storied structure found in members of the Tabebuia alliance, versus the vessels with medium to wide width and a non-storied structure found in members of the Paleotropical clade. Oroxyleae are characterized by a combination of simple and foraminate perforation plates and homocellular rays, while Catalpeae are characterized by scanty <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> abundant tyloses and vessel-ray pits simple to semi-bordered. Bignonieae differ from all other clades by a variant secondary growth and a typically lianoid wood anatomy. Overall, wood anatomical characters are not very labile within the family, being distributed across clades in a very predictive manner. Several anatomical characters represent good anatomical synapomorphies and provide further support to clades identified in molecular phylogenetic studies. The authors are indebted to Alex C.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Phytophthora ramorum, an oomycete plant pathogen, is {{the causal}} agent of sudden oak death, a serious disease of Fagaceous trees in California and Oregon {{over the last}} decade. Tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) {{is one of the}} most {{susceptible}} host species, but the cause of host mortality is poorly understood. Previous research has implicated disruption in stem water transport, phloem girdling, and activity of a class of secreted proteins known as elicitins as possible mechanisms of pathogenesis. In this study I investigated certain physiological impacts of P. ramorum infection on tanoak saplings and tanoak seedlings. In growth chamber experiments, stems of plants were inoculated with isolates that differed in the amount of elicitin secreted in vitro. Stem-wounded, non-inoculated plants served as controls. Parameters measured included net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, whole plant water usage, stem specific hydraulic conductivity, tylosis production, starch partitioning, and mortality. Inoculated saplings exhibited a reduction in whole plant water usage, followed by a reduction in stem specific hydraulic conductivity implicating an interruption in stem water transport as the primary symptom. A reduction in net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance occurred one week later. Experiments conducted on inoculated tanoak seedlings supported the hypothesis that a reduction in stem water transport is the primary disease symptom. Stem specific hydraulic conductivity was the only parameter that appeared to be significantly impacted when treatments were compared during each measurement period. There was, however, a significant difference between treatments over the course of the entire experiment. Due to differences in isolate growth rates and similar levels of elicitin secretion, symptom expression could not be tied to elicitin production. To determine where elicitins are produced in planta, an immunolabeling technique was tested utilizing an elicitin-specific fluorescent antibody. The elicitin protein was most apparent in <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, although nonspecific staining in control samples confounded interpretation...|$|E
40|$|The current {{practices}} of collection and processing of herbal materials by traditional practitioners (mostly Malays) in Perak, Malaysia, were reviewed {{in order to}} evaluate how these practices could possibly {{have an impact on}} the quality of the final products. The documentation was done through a structured interview survey conducted on 56 practitioners selected from each district of Perak. A majority of the selected practitioners were of the older generation. The method of gathering the plant materials combines collection from the wild, small scale cultivation as well as purchasing from grocery shops or other practitioners. The most commonly used plant parts are roots and leaves. The initial processing practices generally involve slicing of the raw materials into smaller pieces, drying under direct sunlight and grinding. The materials are commonly stored loosely packed, unprotected from light or pest. In total these practitioners use 184 types of plant according to their vernacular names. An analysis of the data showed that the plant known as Ajisamat corresponds to two different species from different families - Salacia macrophylla Blume (Celastraceae) and Prismatomeris glabra (Rubiaceae). Therefore pharmacognostical studies were undertaken to determine identity and quality criteria for these plants. Macromorphological inspection of the vegetative parts of the two plants reveals only a slight difference in the arrangement of the petioles. However, a microscopic investigation of the plants roots revealed distinctive anatomical features. Prismatic calcium oxalate crystals and banded <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> seen in the root section were characteristics of S. macrophylla while P. glabra is characterised by an abundance of raphide crystals in the root. Other features like the differences of vessels diameters and arrangements were also of diagnostic importance for identification of the plants. Some of these characters were also identified in the powder of these plants and proposed for diagnostic purpose...|$|E
