5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, Hitler ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia should be destroyed. The Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen (Special Prosecution Book Poland)—lists of <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed—had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939. The Einsatzgruppen (special task forces) performed these murders {{with the support of}} the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland. Members of the SS, the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), and the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign. Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani people, and the mentally ill.|$|E

The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.|$|E

The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> well educated and eligible for state service.|$|E
40|$|This article revisits ‘diversion’ in {{the context}} of youth justice in Australia. Although ‘diversion’ is omnipresent in youth justice, it <b>is</b> rarely subject <b>to</b> {{critical}} examination. This article raises four interrelated questions: what young <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ‘diverted’ from and to; whether young <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ‘diverted’ from the criminal justice system or from offending; whether young <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ‘diverted’ from criminal justice processes or outcomes; and whether ‘diversion’ should be considered distinct from crime prevention and early intervention. The article concludes that the confusion about youth ‘diversion’ may foster individualised interventions in young people’s lives...|$|R

5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from.

You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor.

5|$|It {{is written}} in the same style as the Tory {{publications}} that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by some <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a genuine vindication of their view. The pamphlet raised embarrassing questions about {{the handling of the}} issue by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for seditious libel. His imprisonment, during which he fell into bankruptcy, was to have a lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose and his own views.|$|E

Ten players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, Sam Jones and Bailey Howell.

Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars, old people and sick <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept from the streets.
