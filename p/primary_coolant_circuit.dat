40|$|The International Phebus Fission Product programme, {{initiated}} in 1988 and {{performed by the}} French Institut de adioprotection et de Suret´e Nucl´eaire (IRSN), investigates {{through a series of}} in-pile integral experiments, key phenomena involved in light water reactor (LWR) severe accidents. The tests cover fuel rod degradation and the behaviour of fission products released via the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>circuit</b> into the containment building. The results of the first two tests, called FPT 0 and FPT 1, carried out under low pressure, in a steam rich atmosphere and using fresh fuel for FPT 0 and fuel burned in a reactor at 23 GWdt− 1 for FPT 1, were immensely challenging, especially with regard to the iodine radiochemistry. Some of the most important observed phenomena with regard to the chemistry of iodine were indeed neither predicted nor pre-calculated, which clearly shows the interest and the need for carrying out integral experiments to study the complex phenomena governing fission product behaviour in a PWR in accident conditions. The three most unexpected results in the iodine behaviour related to early detection during fuel degradation of a weak but significant fraction of volatile iodine in the containment, the key role played by silver rapidly binding iodine to form insoluble AgI in the containment sump and the importance of painted surfaces in the containment atmosphere for the formation of a large quantity of volatile organic iodides. To support the Phebus test interpretation small-scale analytical experiments and computer code analyses were carried out. The former, helping towards a better understanding of overall iodine behaviour, were used to develop or improve models while the latter mainly aimed at identifying relevant key phenomena and at modelling weaknesses. Specific efforts were devoted to exploring the potential origins of the early-detected volatile iodine in the containment building. If a clear explanation has not yet been found, the non-equilibrium chemical processes favoured in the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>circuit</b> and the early radiolytic oxidation of iodides in the condensed water films are at present the most likely explanations. Models that were modified or developed and embodied in the computer codes for organic iodide formation/destruction in the gas phase and Ag–I reactions in the sump lead, in agreement with the Phebus findings respectively to greatly enhanced organic iodide formation kinetics and long term concentration in the containment atmosphere on one hand and, in the conditions of Phebus experiments, to significantly limited molecular iodine volatilisation from the sump in so far as silver was in excess compared to iodine, on the other hand. Organic iodides then quickly gain in importance and become the predominant volatile iodine species at long term. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the code assessment and maintenance program (CAMP) of the US NRC the reflood model of the RELAP 5 code is being validated at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) using data from the test PKL-IIB. 5. The primaerkreislauf-(PKL) test IIB. 5 simulates a double-ended break of the cold leg of a German 1300 MWe PWR with emphasis on the reflood heat transfer phenomena. The PKL-facility includes all major <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>circuit</b> components and some secondary components, and a containment. After transient initiation the coolant is dumped to the containment while the ECC-systems (accumulators and low pressure injection systems) inject a large amount of cold water leading to a progressive core rewetting. Under such conditions complex heat transfer mechanisms take place in the core region. A novel reflood model, developed at PSI, was implemented in the code version RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2. 2 Gamma (322 G). The heat transfer coefficient in the film and transition boiling flow regime is dependent on the distance from the quench front. The transition boiling heat transfer is predicted by the empirical Weisman correlation. The post-test calculation of the PKL-IIB. 5 test showed that the PSI-reflood model is able to describe the reflooding process in an reasonable manner. But the empirical Weisman correlation tends to over-predict the transition boiling heat transfer. Hence the semi-mechanistic FZK-transition boiling model was implemented in RELAP 5 instead of the Weisman correlation. The resulting code version was named RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2. 2 G+FZK (322 G+FZK). Based on the re-calculation of the PKL-test with the modified RELAP 5 -version it can be concluded that the rewetting temperature predicted by the FZK-transition boiling model is much closer to the experimental data than that obtained using the Weisman approach. Results of these investigations are presented and discussed in this report. (orig.)

40|$|FPT 3 was {{the last}} of the five in-pile {{integral}} experiments in the Phébus FP programme, whose overall purpose was to investigate fuel rod degradation and behaviour of Fission Products (FPs) released via the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>circuit</b> into the containment building. The results contribute to validation of models and computer codes used to calculate the source term for a severe accident with core meltdown in light water reactors. Unlike the previous tests, FPT 3 used B 4 C as absorber material in the pre-irradiated (24. 5 GWd/tU) fuel bundle, while featuring a steam-poor period as in FPT 2, that used Ag/In/Cd absorber. The main FPT 3 containment results are summarised: the source term of FPs, fuel and structural materials from the experimental circuit into the containment; the composition, morphology and deposition processes of aerosols in the containment atmosphere; the specific behaviour of the radiologically-significant FP iodine; and finally the performance of Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs) exposed to the containment atmosphere just after the transient. The major elements contributing to the aerosol mass in the containment are the volatile FPs Cs and Mo, the control rod material B, the cladding material Sn, and the instrumentation materials Re and W (specific to Phébus tests). The fractional compositions, leaving aside the control rod materials, were very similar in FPT 2 and FPT 3. After reactor shutdown, homogenisation of the aerosol size in the containment led to only one aerosol population, similar to the previous tests. Long-term aerosol deposition in the containment is dominated by gravitational settling and diffusiophoresis, but also significant deposits were measured on the vertical wall, consisting of multi-component aerosols, again comparable with FPT 2. A significant result of FPT 3 is that iodine is mainly in gaseous form in the atmosphere up to containment isolation; the rest in aerosol form. Another important result is the fast decrease of the iodine concentration in the atmosphere, for total iodine (gas and aerosol), mainly due to deposition on the painted condensers; the depletion of the airborne aerosols Cs and Te was about a factor of 3 slower. As in FPT 2, gaseous iodine is mainly in molecular form. Iodine collected in the sump is essentially in soluble form throughout, probably due to the replacement of Ag/In/Cd by B 4 C as the absorber material. Concerning the PARs, which were introduced in the vessel when the overall aerosol, FP and hydrogen releases in the containment atmosphere had ended, analysis of their surface temperature evolution indicated that, despite the very low oxygen concentration in the FPT 3 containment, they worked quite well and were not poisoned by FPs during their 30 minute exposure time.

40|$|Damage to {{insulation}} materials located near to a <b>primary</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>coolant</b> leak may compromise {{the operation of}} the emergency core cooling system (ECCS). Insulation material in the form of mineral wool fiber agglomerates (MWFA) maybe transported to the containment sump strainers, where they may block or penetrate the strainers. Though the impact of MWFA on the pressure drop across the strainers is minimal, corrosion products formed over time may also accumulate in the fiber cakes on the strainers, which can lead to {{a significant increase in the}} strainer pressure drop and result in cavitation in the ECCS. An experimental and theoretical study performed by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and the Hochschule Zittau/Görlitz is investigating the phenomena that maybe observed in the containment vessel during a <b>primary</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>coolant</b> leak. The study entails the generation of fiber agglomerates, the determination of their transport properties in single and multi-effect experiments and the long-term effect that corrosion and erosion of the containment internals by the coolant has on the strainer pressure drop. The focus of this paper is on the verification and validation of numerical models that can predict the transport of MWFA. A number of pseudo-continuous dispersed phases of spherical wetted agglomerates represent the MWFA. The size, density, the relative viscosity of the fluid-fiber agglomerate mixture and the turbulent dispersion all affect how the fiber agglomerates are transported. In the cases described here, the size is kept constant while the density is modified. This definition affects both the terminal velocity and volume fraction of the dispersed phases. Note that the relative viscosity is only significant at high concentrations. Three single effect experiments were used to provide validation data on the transport of the fiber agglomerates under conditions of sedimentation in quiescent fluid, sedimentation in a horizontal flow and suspension in a horizontal flow. The experiments were performed in a rectangular column for the quiescent fluid and a racetrack type channel that provided a near uniform horizontal flow. The numerical models of sedimentation in the column and the racetrack channel found that the sedimentation characteristics are consistent with the experiments. For channel suspension, the heavier fibers tend to accumulate at the channel base even at high velocities, while lighter phases are more likely to be transported around the channel...|$|R
