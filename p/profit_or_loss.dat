5|$|Statement of {{financial}} activities or statement of support, revenue and expenses. This statement resembles {{the income statement}} of a business, but may use terms like excess or deficit rather than <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss.</b> It shows the net results, by each fund, of the organization's activities during the fiscal year reported. The excess or deficit is shown as a change in fund balances, simpler to an increase or decrease in owner's equity.|$|E
25|$|To {{calculate}} the <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss,</b> reserves were {{set aside for}} future claims payments, for claims {{that had already been}} notified but not yet paid, as well as estimated amounts for claims that had been incurred but not reported (IBNR). This estimation is difficult and can be inaccurate; in particular, liability (long-tail) policies tend to produce claims long after the policies are written.|$|E
50|$|Partnership {{taxation}} in Hong Kong is the taxation of the <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses</b> {{generated by}} partnership business entities. First, these <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses</b> {{of the partnership}} are assessed according to the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22. After assessment, then said <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses</b> flow through the partnership to the partners who are then taxed on their share of said <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses</b> generated by the partnership without any taxes levied against the partnership.|$|R

5000|$|The default {{distribution}} {{scheme of}} <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses</b> follows the proportion to capital contributions {{made by the}} partners. [...] However, the distribution scheme may follow an informal negotiated agreement or abide by scheme adopted in the partnership agreement. [...] If the proportions of capital contributions cannot be discerned, then the <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses</b> will be distributed equally by the partners.|$|R
25|$|The {{reserve for}} future claims {{liabilities}} was {{set aside in}} an unusual way. The syndicate bought a reinsurance policy to pay any future claims; the premium was equal {{to the amount of}} the reserve. In other words, rather than putting the reserve into a bank to earn interest, the syndicate transferred its (strictly, its members') liability to pay future claims to a reinsurer. This was RITC â€“ a transaction that allowed the syndicate to be closed, and a <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> declared.|$|E
25|$|In a {{partnership}} or joint venture where money is lent, the creditor only provides the capital yet is guaranteed {{a fixed amount}} of profit. The debtor, however, puts in time and effort, but is made to bear the risk of loss. Muslim scholars argue that such practice is unjust. As an alternative to usury, Islam strongly encourages charity and direct investment in which the creditor shares whatever <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> the business may incur (in modern terms, this amounts to an equity stake in the business).|$|E
25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} of a futures {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying {{asset to the}} buyer, or, {{if it is a}} cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} analysis {{can also be}} applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.|$|E

2500|$|In a Latin letter dated 3 October 1550, Hooper {{laid out}} his {{argument}} contra usum vestium. With Ridley's reply (in English), it marks the first written representation of a split in the English Reformation. Hooper's argument is that vestments {{should not be used}} as they are not indifferent, nor is their use supported by scripture, a point he takes as self-evident. He contends that church practices must either have express biblical support or be things indifferent, approval for which is implied by scripture. Furthermore, an indifferent thing, if used, causes no <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss.</b> Ridley objected in his response, saying that indifferent things do have profitable effects, which is the only reason they are used. Failing to distinguish between conditions for indifferent things in general and the church's use of indifferent things, Hooper then all but excludes the possibility of anything being indifferent in the four conditions he sets: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Reserve is self-funded. The vast {{majority}} (90%+) of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically {{the interest on}} the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as [...] "capital gains/losses" [...] that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans. The Board of Governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses {{as well as the}} net <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> is the large report simply titled, [...] "Annual Report".

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{investment decisions}} {{that can be}} made in a modular form. It is motivated by the empirical observation that managements are particularly worried about "downside" risk. With a sequential approach this risk is minimized. An investment in a module produces information as well as <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses.</b> In our model a larger investment produces more information in addition to larger <b>profits</b> <b>or</b> <b>losses.</b> Costs for changing the level of the investment from period to period are introduced. The optimal sequential investment policy is studied for a two-period problem. Conditions are presented under which no investment, a partial investment, or a full investment in the first period is optimal. ...|$|R
