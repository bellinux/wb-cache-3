40|$|In this paper, a novel {{plane strain}} small punch test (SPT) method is {{proposed}} for material plastic properties characterization. The plane strain SPT {{is different from}} the standard SPT in the two ways: (a) a long thin rectangular specimen (with dimensions of about 20 mm× 8 mm× 0. 5 mm) is used, and (b) the resulting test tool components - such as <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> and upper and lower die - are also different. The <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> is a prism with a half-circular shape and the upper and lower die consists of left and right long blocks, with a chamfer at each of the inner top corners of the lower die. The tool components have been designed and assembled and the plane strain small punch tests have been performed to obtain the punch force and the corresponding central displacements of the specimen. This information is then used to characterize the material's plastic parameters...|$|E
40|$|The forming of a micro {{tapered hole}} {{is based on}} {{nanosecond}} pulsed laser processing, which conforms to fast processing time and high throughput; however, the microhole quality should be improved. Micro stamping is a technology providing high precise size and speed. The greatest difficulty in forming a microhole by micro stamping is the precision alignment of the <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> to the lower die. In order to overcome the difficulty, we proposed a concept of stamping without die (SWD). Without a lower die, the tapered <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> was directly applied to the workpiece for micro stamping, and a thicker workpiece surrounding the punching area provides a better support to the stamping process. Thus, a successful forming of micro tapered holes is completed. The micro tapered hole depth is 300 μm, and the maximum ratio of inlet to outlet diameter is 18 : 1. In {{order to reduce the}} number of experiments, the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 3 D was used for forming analysis. The simulation forecast result was compared with the experimental processing, which was well validated. Under different experimental parameters of laser energy and defocusing distance, drilling results by two methods show that the microhole quality by stamping process is better than by laser processing...|$|E

40|$|A novel small punch beam testing (SPBT) system {{consisting}} of a top die, a bottom die and a flat punch with semi-circular cross-section head has been designed and tested. The specimen is a small beam with rectangular cross-section. This SPBT method has the advantage over conventional tensile testing for much less material required for testing and also over the traditional small punch testing because not only less material required but also high accuracy to make the <b>punch</b> <b>head.</b> Through coupling the numerical modelling and experimental results, genetic algorithm has been employed to successfully characterize the material plastic properties...|$|E
40|$|Average plastic {{properties}} of friction stir-welded AA 2024 -T 3 are obtained by coupling novel small punch beam testing with a neural network algorithm. The small punch beam test utilizes a cylindrical <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> and miniature rectangular beam specimens. The specimens may be manufactured by material removed from in-service components with minimal effect on mechanical performances. Specimen preparation, material model, and identifying procedure are systematically presented. Predicted load–displacement results agree {{well with the}} experimental results and the identified strain–stress relationship demonstrates useful agreement with tensile test. Since the load–displacement curve is insensitive to base material properties, knowledge of these properties is not required in the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|The small punch {{test method}} of characterizing {{material}} properties was introduced about thirty years ago. It has {{an advantage over}} conventional tensile test methods in {{that only a small}} sample of material is needed. A disadvantage of the method is that manufacture of the small hemispherical <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> is difficult and expensive due to the high dimensional accuracy requirements. Here an alternative design of punch is presented: a small punch beam test system consisting of a top die, a bottom die and a flat punch with semi-circular cross-section head.

40|$|Small punch test (SPT) {{has been}} widely used to {{evaluate}} in-service materials in nuclear fusion facilities. Early use of SPTs is largely based on empirical relations or curve fitting from experimental data, while recent applications of SPTs take advantage of finite element methods. In this study, an improved inverse finite element analysis procedure is proposed to obtain constitutive relations from load-displacement curves recorded in SPTs. In addition, a parametric study is performed to evaluate the effects of SPT parameters including friction coefficient, <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> diameter, sample thickness, specimen scale and boundary conditions. The proposed inverse finite element (FE) method improves the accuracy of existing inverse FE methods, and the current parametric study provides {{a basis for the}} standardization of SPT procedures in the future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigations of single hat longitudinal rail under quasi-static crush loading. A set of identical specimen which was simplified from actual automotive longitudinal rail was fabricated, and quasi-static testing (i. e., compression and bending test) were conducted. The main {{objective of this}} research was to study the failure mode, bending and tensile behaviour of the structure under bending and axial compression. In order to get the compressive load-displacement response and its corresponding deformation pattern, the compression test was carried out using a Universal Testing Machine. Stress-strain curve and energy absorption of the specimen were derived from the compressive load-displacement response. It was found that the quasi-static response of the specimen in compression case was affected by the number and position of spot welds. For the bending test, the bending load was found to be fluctuated with the displacement in a way analogous to the folding behaviour and deformation of the cross-section of the specimen. Bending moment-rotation characteristic was derived from bending load-displacement curve to investigate the energy absorption of the specimen in bending case. Lastly, the von Mises stress at the top and bottom surface of the specimen is increased with increment of the <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> travel distance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} effect of {{temperature}} on stretchability of anisotropic AZ 31 (Mg- 3 %Al- 1 %Zn) magnesium alloy sheet. Results of stretching process test are {{compared with those}} of tensile test. The sheet has an anisotropic character for angle to hot-extrusion direction(ϕ= 0 °, 45 °, and 90 °). Here, ϕ= 0 ° means a direction of extrusion. Tensile specimens cut down to three directions of ϕ= 0 °, 45 °, and 90 ° are a shape of 14 mm in elongation, 3 mm in width and 0. 44 mm in thickness. Test piece for investigating the limiting stretching stroke is a sheet of side length 90 mm and 0. 44 mm in thickness. For the stretching process test, the <b>punch</b> <b>head</b> is a hemispheric shape of 20 mm in diameter and the die is a cylindrical shape of 27 mm in inside diameter. Both tension and stretching process tests were performed at four kinds of test temperature(T= 293, 393, 473, and 573 K) in a thermostatic chamber and at a crosshead speed(v) of 5 mm/min using an Instron-type testing machine. Comparing the limiting stretching stroke determined by the stretching test with elongation, r-value, and n-value obtained by the tensile test, it is confirmed that the limiting stretching stroke is qualitatively related to the elongation and r-value, and not to n-value...|$|E
