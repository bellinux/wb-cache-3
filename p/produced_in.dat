40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{research was conducted}} to observe the effect liquid formulation bioinsecticide of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium againts nymphs of brown plant hopper (BPH) (Nilaparvata lugens). The formulations used were B. bassiana <b>producing</b> <b>in</b> maize media with shrimps shell compost extract (A), Metarhizium <b>producing</b> <b>in</b> maize media with shrimps shell compost extract (B), B. bassiana <b>producing</b> <b>in</b> rice media with shrimps shell compost extract (C), Metarhizium <b>producing</b> <b>in</b> rice media with shrimps shell compost extract (D), B. bassiana <b>producing</b> <b>in</b> SDB (Saborroud Dextrose Broth) (E), and Metarhizium <b>producing</b> <b>in</b> SDB (F). Conidia density of the formulations were aplied topically at 103, 105, and 107 spores/ml. The results showed that two formulations (A and B) provided the greatest suppression (100 %) of the six formulations againts the BPH nymphs. LT 50 of the both formulations were 1, 81 and 1, 16 days, respectively. Overall, formulation A and B were the best formulation to supress the nymphs...|$|R
