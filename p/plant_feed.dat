25|$|In <b>plant</b> <b>feed,</b> {{environmental}} factors influence {{the availability of}} crucial nutrients or micronutrients, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments. In Australia, for instance, where the soil contains limited phosphate, cattle are being fed additional phosphate {{to increase the efficiency}} of beef production. Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil. Plant toxins are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, sodium fluoroacetate, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the cellular metabolism. Certain man-made pollutants such as methylmercury and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.|$|E

Subsequent refinements to the process, including changes in the disposition of the major equipment items in the synthesis section, have further reduced both capital and operating costs.|$|E
50|$|The Wassa {{open pit}} gold mine {{produced}} 2,149 kg {{of gold in}} 2005. The mine, which is located about 150 km west of Accra, was owned by Golden Star (90%) and the government (10%). The mine had been in operation as an open pit heap-leach mine in the 1990s but was closed in 2001. Golden Star acquired the mine in 2002 after determining that conventional CIL processing was economically feasible. <b>Plant</b> <b>feed</b> in 2005 {{was a mixture of}} newly mined ore from the Wassa pit blended with material from the heap-leach pads left by the previous operation. Golden Star’s planned to increase production at Wassa to about 3,700 kg (reported as 120,000 troy ounces) in 2006 and to produce about 4,000 kg (reported as 130,000 troy ounces) in 2007 as higher-grade ores are reached at deeper levels.

40|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{combined with}} chemometrics {{was applied to}} construct a hybrid model for the non-invasive detection of protein content in different types of <b>plant</b> <b>feed</b> materials. In total, 829 samples of <b>plant</b> <b>feed</b> materials, which included corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS), corn germ meal, corn gluten meal, distillers' dried grains (DDG) and rapeseed meal, were collected from markets in China. Based on the different preprocessed spectral data, specific models {{for each type of}} <b>plant</b> <b>feed</b> material and a hybrid model for all the materials were built. Performances of specific model and hybrid model constructed with full spectrum (full spectrum model) and selected wavenumbers with VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores value bigger than 1. 00 (VIP scores model) were also compared. The best spectral preprocessing method for this study was found to be the standard normal variate transformation combined with the first derivative. For both full spectrum and VIP scores model, the prediction performance of the hybrid model was slightly worse than those of the specific models but was nevertheless satisfactory. Moreover, the VIP scores model obtained generally better performances than corresponding full spectrum model. Wavenumbers around 4500 cm- 1, 4664 cm- 1 and 4836 cm- 1 were found to be the key wavenumbers in modeling protein content in these <b>plant</b> <b>feed</b> materials. The values for the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and the relative prediction deviation (RPD) obtained with the VIP scores hybrid model were 1. 05 % and 2. 53 for corn DDGS, 0. 98 % and 4. 17 for corn germ meal, 0. 75 % and 6. 99 for corn gluten meal, 1. 54 % and 4. 59 for DDG, and 0. 90 % and 3. 33 for rapeseed meal, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that the protein content in several types of <b>plant</b> <b>feed</b> materials can be determined using a hybrid near-infrared spectroscopy model. And VIP scores method can be used to improve the general predictability of hybrid model...|$|E

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>feeding</b> {{insects and}} the <b>plants</b> they <b>feed</b> upon {{represent}} an ecological association that {{is thought to}} be a key factor for the diversification of many <b>plant</b> <b>feeding</b> insects, through differential adaptation to different plant selective pressures. While {{a number of studies have}} investigated diversification of <b>plant</b> <b>feeding</b> insects above the species level, relatively less attention has been given to patterns of diversification within species, particularly those that also require plants for oviposition and subsequent larval development. In the case of <b>plant</b> <b>feeding</b> insects that also require plant tissues for the completion of their reproductive cycle through larval development, the divergent selective pressure not only acts on adults, but on the full life history of the insect. Here we focus attention on Rhinusa antirrhini (Curculionidae), a species of weevil broadly distributed across Europe that both feeds on, and oviposits and develops within, species of the plant genus Linaria (Plantaginaceae). Using a combination of mtDNA (COII) and nuclear DNA (EF 1 -a) sequencing and copulation experiments we assess evidence for host associated genetic differentiation within R. antirrhini. We find substantial genetic variation within this species that is best explained by ecological specialisation on different host plant taxa. This genetic differentiation is most pronounced in the mtDNA marker, with patterns of genetic variation at the nuclear marker suggesting incomplete lineage sorting and/or gene flow between different host plant forms of R. antirrhini, whose origin is estimated to date to the mid-Pliocen...|$|R

The uncertainty in the physical parameters is based on the one provided by the recently developed concept of thermochemical tables.

The protein digestibility was not significantly lower for the <b>plant</b> <b>feed</b> ingredients, except for extracted soybean meal, oat, canola, and sunflower. Canola meal contains {{a high level of}} carbohydrates and other antinutritional factors, such as phytic acid, tannins, sinapine, and goitrogenic compounds, lowering the nutrient availability of this feed ingredient to aquatic species (Kousoulaki et al. 2009). Further processing into a protein concentrate should remove more of the antinutritional factors and carbohydrates; however, significant amounts of phytic acid could remain (Burel and Kaushik 2008). In rainbow trout (O. mykiss), experimental diets that contained 20 % fishmeal and 19.4 % canola protein concentrate significantly lowered growth (Drew et al. 2007).|$|E
