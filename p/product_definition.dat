The Summer Hill side of the stop is dominated by the flour mill complex, which is also undergoing redevelopment. The mill provided the final traffic for the freight railway line, and the cessation of traffic after the mill's closure provided the catalyst for conversion of the line to light rail.

These include measurement of product usage, current and capital expenditure on products, domestic production, and trade in goods and services.

This document presents the definition of information economy (IE) products developed by the WPIIS Classifications Expert Group. The <b>product</b> <b>definitions</b> complement the IE sector definitions that were released in early 2007. The latter are based on the 2007 revision of the UNSD’s International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC Rev. 4).

Typically, such <b>product</b> <b>definitions</b> are created after the bulk of [shape] designing has been completed because their creation requires a detailed knowledge of the shape {{that is to be}} defined. Shape grammars have been applied in a range of domains to generate design shapes that conform to a given style early in design processes. A key challenge that restricts their implementation lies in the detection of embedded shapes, sub-shapes, which are manipulated according to shape rules to create new shapes. The automatic detection of sub-shapes is an open research question within the shape grammar community. The research reported in this paper explored the use of computer vision techniques to address this problem; the results achieved to date show real promise.

40|$|Clear {{communication}} of product and price {{is essential to}} any economic interaction. Energy pricing varies according to regulatory regime and social policy across the country. The outcome of these various approaches can be summarized in all cases as a simple price. Clear standards for communicating that price are necessary {{for the development of}} national markets for systems and software that intelligently use and manage energy in homes, commercial buildings, and industrial sites. A similar argument requires clear consistent descriptions of the product bought or sold in a particular market. Electricity <b>product</b> <b>definitions</b> include more than mere electrons, and include such characteristics as source, reliability, and regulatory burden. Energy products also include non-electricity products such as natural gas. Clear <b>product</b> <b>definitions</b> are critical to the development of products that dynamically differentiate between energy sources. This paper discusses the requirements of clear price and product communications to and from energy markets. We discuss how such communications enable national markets in energy management systems even when there are no national markets in energy. We also discuss how such communications foster the adoption of service oriented architectures in integrating smart grids, and how these architectures will further the goals of smart grids. 1...|$|R
