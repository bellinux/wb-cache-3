The present laboratory study examines {{the importance of}} individual factors, namely age, gender and personality traits on short term physiological and affective response to vehicle <b>pass-by</b> <b>noises.</b> Four groups of subjects (20 - 30 vs. 40 - 55 year-old male or female, n = 66 in total) were exposed {{to a series of}} vehicle <b>pass-by</b> <b>noises.</b> Physiological responses (finger-pulse amplitude [FPA], skin conductance level [SCL]) were registered during the exposure; affective responses and judgements regarding the sounds were assessed by questionnaires. Noise sensitivity and sensation seeking were measured by validated questionnaires. The results show different patterns of response depending on age, gender and personality. The strongest sympathetic stress reaction as measured by SCL was found for the older female group. In regression analysis, the SCL response was predicted by the female gender and low score of sensation seeking only (adjusted R 2 = 0. 139). The FPA response was strongest among the young men and age was the only significant predictor. For affective responses of pleasantness and activation, regression analysis proved noise sensitivity and sensation seeking to be significant predictors (adjusted R 2 = 0. 187 respectively 0. 154). Age, gender and personality influence physiological and affective reactions to traffic noise, which might affect health conditions. Especially, a potential risk of older women for CVD owing to noise should be investigated further. Individual sensitiveness in terms of noise sensitivity or sensation seeking proves to be important for explaining differences in response to noise...|$|R

Vehicle <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> tests are conducted according to the international standard ISO 362, which is suppose to reflect the noise emission of a vehicle in an urban traffic environment.

Current European legislation aims to limit vehicle noise emissions since many people are exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. Vehicle <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> is measured {{according to the international}} standard ISO 362 in Europe. More recent investigations of urban traffic have led to the proposal of a revised ISO 362 which includes a constant-speed test in addition to the traditional accelerated test {{in order to determine the}} <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> value. In order to meet the legal <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> requirements, vehicle manufacturers and suppliers must analyse and quantify vehicle noise source characteristics during the development phase of the vehicle.

Furthermore, three vehicle noise sources are replicated experimentally under laboratory conditions. This involves an orifice noise source, represented by a specially designed loudspeaker on a moving trolley, shell noise, represented by a metal cylinder structure, and tyre cavity and sidewall noise, represented by an annular membrane mounted on a tyre-like structure. The experimentally determined directivity characteristics of the acoustically excited noise sources are utilised in the <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> prediction method.

40|$|Noise is {{a growing}} health concern as urban {{residents}} increases rapidly and more reports of noise causing sleep disturbances and increasing the risk of cardiovascular health problems are published. Noise has a negative influence on life quality. This life quality deficiency also shows in housing and office pricing in noisy environments. Housing and office prices are often higher in quiet areas than in noisy areas. Therefore noise is both a health issue and has big economic consequences. The biggest contributor to the road traffic noise is the tire/road noise at speeds above 50 km/h. Therefore {{this is an important}} aspect to monitor and the problem has to be alleviated. In this thesis the client Ramböll has gotten many contracts concerning the state of the roads from governmental institutes. As a part of the evaluation of the roads they want to implement the noise emission as a factor. This gives the government institutions another parameter that helps in the decision of which part of the road network to refurbish first. In the effort to decide what is best way for Ramböll to measure noise a new setup for measuring noise has been developed. The most used ways of measuring tire/road-noise is the close proximity (CPX) -method and the statistical pass-by (SPB) -method. These methods both give accurate results but they have drawbacks. The SPB measurements are time consuming and only give noise levels for a small patch of a road. CPX measurement on the other hand require costly and time consuming development of a measurement trailer. Certifying the trailer and maintenance work of it is expensive. So this report shows a first step in how to build a measurement setup and what aspects were taken into consideration when it was designed. A close proximity measurement setup {{in the form of a}} tube with a microphone placed inside it was built and installed underneath the measurement vehicle. The  measurement setup designed and built was named the Tube-CPX measurement setup in this report. The measurements performed with this Tube-CPX measurement setup show promising results. Similarities between CPX measurement setup and the Tube-CPX setup have been found both in the frequency spectrum as well as in the relation with <b>pass-by</b> measurement <b>noise</b> levels. The repeatability of the Tube-CPX measurements is even better than the compared CPX measurements. Although results are promising more work is required before the Tube-CPX setup can be seen in operation at Ramböll. In particular the question which source causes which sound pressure is required to understand the measured levels. And also more controlled pass-by measurements have to be performed to determine the relation of the absolute values measured at the tire/road impact spot to the values that are most interesting, namely the sound pressure levels that the human at the side of the road depicts...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to separate the}} track noise contribution is proposed based on identifying and extracting the track signature from the <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> information measured with a microphone array relatively close to the track. Separation of {{the contributions of the}} vehicle and the track in the <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> spectra is a challenging task, which is currently addressed by a combination of direct and indirect measurements and model predictions. Due to the uncertainties in the separation of the track contribution, whether a vehicle will comply with regulations during certification tests is still very much track dependent. Therefore, accurate means to identify the track contribution to the <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> are needed. In this paper we propose {{to make use of the}} fact that in a wide frequency range the track is a distributed source that radiates plane waves at a given angle with respect to the track. By measuring the sound field close to the track with a microphone array, the wavenumber spectrum of the radiated sound can be determined. For the track contribution this wavenumber spectrum is tonal and therefore sparse.

SNCF has therefore developed the software VAMPPASS dedicated to <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> simulation. The synthesis method implemented in VAMPPASS requires the definition of equivalent noise sources representative to real noise sources on the train. Equivalent sources definition is mainly based on experimental characterization. Measurement methods based on 1 D-array devices have been optimized on a real train and post-processing methods have been developed for identifying mono-multipole equivalent sources, defined with the spherical harmonics formalism. This kind of method needs a heavy optimization process, applied on several parameters. It can imply large error coefficients on the radiated pressure field. The present study aims to investigate the potential of Equivalent Source Method (ESM, a transfer matrix based method) to fulfil the requirements of VAMPPASS. In the first chapter, the ESM basis is presented. The second chapter is dedicated to the ESM implementation on a train scale model, with multi-monopoles or multi-dipoles equivalent sources.

40|$|In {{the modern}} urban lifestyle, {{more and more}} people are exposed to noise {{pollution}} in form of traffic noise. As a response to this, the automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) are put under pressure to reduce the emitted noise from vehicles. To be able to meet the upcoming, stricter regulations, the automotive OEMs seeks new techniques to be able to front load the <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> engineering in the vehicle development process and to identify and understand the different sources that contributes to the exterior noise. Earlier exterior sources ranking using ASQ (Airborn Source Quantification) with an energetic approach during <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> test has yielded very good and reliable results for an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicle. In this Master Thesis, two exterior source ranking methods have been tested and evaluated for an electric vehicle during in-room <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> test. The two methods were: ASQ and OPA (Operational Path Analysis). In total, five models were built from the two methods and each model was evaluated for, in total, three driving conditions corresponding to the current ISO 362 - 1 : 2007 and the proposed, revised version. The results show that the ASQ models are not capable to correctly estimate the engine contribution due to its high tonality. Moreover, it was seen that the energetic ASQ model is very sensitive to small changes. Both ASQ models underestimated the tire noise. The OPA model on the other hand managed to estimate the total contribution very well. Both the engine contribution and the tire contributions are well estimated. Nevertheless, OPA as method has several weaknesses and building an OPA model is not a straightforward task. Its weaknesses and the process to reach a final OPA model are discussed in this thesis. It was seen that one of the most crucial steps in an OPA model is to have clean references to get meaningful results. A MIMO-FIR filter was therefore used to filter out engine harmonics from the tire references. Its principles and importance for the end results are also discussed.

Because of the large existence of small radius curves, metro lines are particularly affected. This case study is performed {{as part of a}} project which aims at developing a numerical tool for prediction of rail corrugation growth on curves. The development of corrugation on a 120 m radius curve of the Stockholm metro has been monitored by repeated measurements of rail roughness and train <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise.</b> Within a grinding interval of 1 year, severe short-pitch corrugation was build up with maximum peak-to-peak magnitudes of about 0. 15 mm. Spectral analysis of measurement data shows large roughness magnitudes in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm, with peaks at approximately 5 cm and 8 cm. The corrugation pattern has a pure longitudinal direction (with corrugation ridges transverse to the track direction) and an irregularly varying magnitude along the 100 m long measured track section. The roughness growth rate increased with time until 300 days after rail grinding, thereafter only moderate additional roughness growth was observed. Because of moderate train speeds of about 30 km/h, the rolling noise caused by the corrugation has a low-frequency content (< 200 Hz). A 10. 1 dB unit increase (139 - 300 days after grinding) in roughness level in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm was found to correspond to an increase in rolling noise level in the frequency interval 60 - 200 Hz of 4. 9 dB.

The proposed solution uses interface agent technology to control the data acquisition system, deal with the complex test set-up and perform automatic and on-line data validation check on measured data. status: publishe...|$|E

This paper explores the actual noise impact of this alternative drivetrain technology on the noise emission of a mid-size delivery truck powered by a parallel hybrid powertrain, compared with an equivalent internal combustion engine truck on the basis of <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> measurements. It investigates jointly the overall emission, the main noise sources and the vertical directivity of the vehicle. The essential benefit results from the existence of a full-electric mode below 50 km/h, with a significant noise reduction which may exceed 8 dB(A) at low constant speed. Even if smaller, this noise advantage is still valuable when the vehicle is accelerating or braking. Due to weaker noise emitted upwards, the benefit should be even greater for residents living on upper building floors. The rolling noise associated with the drive wheel/road contact is the main noise source in all driving situations in electric mode, and beyond 50 km/h in the configurations with engine...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{procedures}} for estimating the {{sound absorption coefficient}} when the specimen has inherently low absorption are discussed. Examples of this include the measurement of the absorption coefficient of pavements, closed cell foams and other barrier materials whose absorption coefficient is nevertheless required, and the measurement of sound absorption of muffler components such as perforates. The focus of the paper is on (1) obtaining an accurate phase correction and (2) proper correction for tube attenuation when using impedance tube methods. For the latter it is shown that the equations for tube attenuation correction in the standards underestimate the actual tube attenuation, leading to an overestimate of the measured absorption coefficient. This error could be critical, for example, when one is attempting to qualify a facility for the measurement of <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise.</b> In this {{paper we propose a}} remedy – to measure the actual tube attenuation and to use this value, as opposed to the value recommended by the standards, to correct the measured sound absorption. We also recommend an alternative way to determine the microphone phase error...|$|E
