40|$|Enhanced field {{emission}} (EFE) presents the main impediment to higher acceleration gradients in superconducting niobium (Nb) radiofrequency cavities for particle accelerators. The strength, number {{and sources of}} EFE sites strongly depend on surface preparation and handling. The main objective of this thesis project is to systematically investigate the sources of EFE from Nb, to evaluate the best available surface preparation techniques with respect to resulting {{field emission}}, and to establish an optimized process to minimize or eliminate EFE. To achieve these goals, a scanning field emission microscope (SFEM) was designed and built as an extension to an existing commercial scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the SFEM chamber of ultra high vacuum, a sample is moved laterally in a raster pattern under a high voltage anode tip for EFE detection and localization. The sample is then transferred under vacuum to the SEM chamber equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer for individual emitting site characterization. Compared to other systems built for similar purposes, this apparatus has low cost and maintenance, high operational flexibility, considerably bigger scan area, as well as reliable performance. EFE sources from planar Nb have been studied after various surface preparation, including chemical etching and electropolishing, combined with ultrasonic or high-pressure water rinse. Emitters have been identified, analyzed and the preparation process has been examined and improved based on EFE results. As a result, field-emission-free or near field-emission-free surfaces at ~ 140 MV/m have been consistently achieved with the above techniques. Characterization on the remaining emitters leads {{to the conclusion that}} no evidence of intrinsic emitters, i. e., no fundamental electric field limit induced by EFE, has been observed up to ~ 140 MV/m.

The eruptions of Shiveluch {{commonly}} result in major environmental damage caused by debris avalanches, hot pyroclastic flows, tephra falls and lahars. Constraining these events in time and space is important for the understanding and prediction of these natural hazards. The last major eruption of Shiveluch occurred in 2005; earlier ones, dated by instrumental, historical, 14 C and tephrochronological methods, occurred in the last millennium around AD 1030, 1430, 1650, 1739, 1790 – 1810, 1854, 1879 – 1883, 1897 – 1898, 1905, 1927 – 1929, 1944 – 1950, and 1964. A lava dome has been growing in the 1964 crater since 1980, occasionally producing tephra falls and pyroclastic flows. Several Shiveluch eruptions (~AD 1050, 1650, 1854, 1964) may have been climatically effective and are probably recorded in the Greenland ice cores. Previously, most dates for eruptions before AD 1854 were obtained by tephrochronology and constrained by radiocarbon dating with an accuracy of several decades or centuries. In this paper we report tree-ring dates for a recent pyroclastic flow in Baidarnaia valley. Though the wood buried in these deposits is carbonized, fragile and poorly preserved, we were able to measure ring-width using standard tree-ring equipment or photographs and to cross-date these samples against the regional Kamchatka larch ring-width chronology. The dates of the outer rings indicate the date of the eruptions. In the Baidarnaia valley the eruption occurred shortly after AD 1756, but not later than AD 1758. This date coincides with the decrease of ring-width in trees growing near Shiveluch volcano in 1758 – 1763 in comparison with the control "non-volcanic" chronology. The pyroclastic flow in Kamenskaia valley, although similar in appearance to the one in Baidarnaia valley, definitively yielded a different age. Due to the age limit of the reference chronology (AD 1632 – 2005) and its short overlap with the sample chronology in Kamenskaia valley the dates of these <b>deposits</b> are very <b>preliminary.</b> The <b>deposits</b> probably date back to approximately AD 1649 or a few years later.

The characterization of organic matter indudes the determination of buk parameters (hydrogen index values and C/N ratios) and the analysis of specific biomarkers (n-alaknes, fatty acids, alkenones, and pigments). Total organic carbon (TOC) values vary between 0. 3 and 2 %. In general, the organic matter from the Laptev Sea continental margin is dominated by terrigenous matter throughout.

The increased amounts of faity acids, however, may also have a freshwater origin due to increased river discharge at that time.

The materials, although very different in origin, are similar in terms of fracturing, porosity and hydraulic conductivity and DNAPLs are expected to behave in similar fashions in the two materials. This allows the researchers to share their expertise, as well as helping to determine whether the findings of these studies are applicable to a broader spectrum of fractured clay-rich materials.

40|$|A coated {{conductor}} {{is generally}} fabricated by depositing a high Tc superconducting layer onto a flexible metallic substrate, using intermediate buffer layers to prevent chemical interaction. In {{order for the}} superconductor {{to be capable of}} carrying a high current density, its grains must have good crystallographic alignment {{in order to avoid the}} presence of high angle grain boundaries. This can be ensured by transferring the texture from the substrate through epitaxial film growth. The main substrate considered in this thesis is a Ni-Fe alloy. When cold-rolled, NiFe develops a preferential orientation and upon annealing at an elevated temperature, undergoes primary recrystallisation to form grains with the cube texture { 100 }. The recrystallisation process and the texture of the tapes has been examined and various buffer layers have been fabricated. As silver does not react adversely with high temperature superconductors, it has been deposited onto Pd-buffered NiFe by DC sputtering and very sharp cube texture is obtained. Ceramic buffer layers, CeO 2 and YSZ, have been deposited by RF sputtering, though an undesirable (111) oriented component accompanies the cube textured material. Also a technique has been developed to produce a suitably oriented native oxide of NiFe by a simple oxidation technique. <b>Preliminary</b> attempts to <b>deposit</b> YBCO films onto these buffer layers have shown that the quality of the metallic buffers is degraded by rapid inter-diffusion at elevated temperatures, but that cube textured material can be deposited on the oxide buffer layers. The percolative nature of current flow in such coated conductors has been considered through the development of a grain network model. As the texture of the superconducting layer is directly influenced by the underlying layers, measurements from the substrate and buffer layers are applied in order to model the orientations of the grains in a superconducting overlayer. The model calculates the critical current of coated conductors as a function of parameters such as length, width, grain size and texture, as well as examining factors such as cracks and highly misoriented grains.

The system {{makes use of}} a dual energy x-ray line scan sensor, which generates images of the transmitted x-rays, similar to images generated for suitcase inspection in airport security applications. The dual energy x-ray system allows for rapid approximation of atomic number range, which is utilised to evaluate the mineral and maceral content {{of a variety of}} minerals, including coal. The process is independent of particle surface condition, and can thus be utilised as a dry process. A unique application of this technology is in the removal of torbanite from a coal deposit located in Mpumalanga, South Africa. The separation of coal from torbanite has been a problem for the coal industry for a long time. The separation of coal and torbanite by conventional gravity separation techniques is difficult, due to the overlapping densities of torbanite and coal. The commercial value of both commodities is significantly compromised if contaminated with the other, thus impacting negatively on the financial viability of mining such a <b>deposit.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> laboratory DE-XRT testwork results on high quality coal and torbanite products were promising.

There are 4 main factors that determine final cost of PV modules: the conversion efficiency, materials amount per unit area of module, production yield, and the economy of scale. It is therefore valuable to investigate alternative and/or innovative deposition techniques and processes which {{have the potential to}} impact on these factors. Metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) is a powerful technique offering increased process repeatability, achieving a high level of control of materials characteristics. Recent improvements in CdTe devices using atmospheric–pressure (AP) MOCVD have led to efficiencies of 13. 3 % using 2 μm absorber layers and 11 % with a 1 μm absorber layer [11, 12]. These results were achieved: by extending the optical band gap of the window layer, using a ternary alloy (Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S), with intentional p-type doping of the CdTe layers with As, and the use of an in situ (dry) deposited CdCl 2 layer and anneal. All layers, except the front and back contact, are grown by a sequential MOCVD process. Furthermore this is a dry process without the need for any etch treatment. The inherent design of the horizontal MOCVD laboratory chambers do not lend themselves well to large scale production. However, the CSER group has designed and built an experimental inline reaction chamber to evaluate AP-MOCVD as an inline production process. Discussion is made based on kinetically limited growth and molar supply models to assess the suitability of the MOCVD process to deposit fast enough for an inline process. The AP-MOCVD inline reactor uses a showerhead to deliver the precursors onto a moving 5 × 7. 5 cm 2 substrate and <b>preliminary</b> results for <b>deposited</b> layers are given. From these preliminary results it has been extrapolated that a 1 μm thick CdTe layer can be deposited on substrates moving at 60 cm/min...|$|R
