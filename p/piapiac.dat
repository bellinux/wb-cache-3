5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow was {{described}} by Edgardo Moltoni in 1938. This species has been placed in several bird families since its description. It has long been considered {{a member of the}} crow family Corvidae; however, several atypical features, such as its lice being from the suborder Mallophaga, its bare facial skin being capable of movement, and the structure of its palate, have suggested that it may belong in another family. Some authors placed the species within the starling family Sturnidae due to the bushcrow's similarities in behavior and size with the wattled starling. Other authors have placed it in its own monotypic family, Zavattariornithidae. DNA-sequencing analysis supports its placement in the corvids, with its closest relatives being the ground jays, magpies, and the <b>piapiac.</b> It has been suggested that the bushcrow is a surviving relict ancestor to several of these relatives. However, its taxonomic situation is still considered to be in flux.|$|E
50|$|The <b>piapiac</b> often nests in a palm tree, {{but other}} nesting sites are also used. Strips of palm leaf and grass stems are {{cemented}} together with mud and lined with palm fibre {{to form a}} cup, in which three to seven eggs are laid between March and April. <b>Piapiac</b> eggs are very pale blue, or greenish-blue with a few brown blotches.|$|E
50|$|The <b>piapiac</b> (Ptilostomus afer) is an African {{member of}} the crow family, {{and is the only}} {{member of the}} genus Ptilostomus. According to recent findings, it is most closely related to the Central Asian ground jays (Ericson et al., 2005).|$|E
50|$|Of the avifauna, 5000-7000 Sudan {{crowned crane}} have been reported. Other bird life {{includes}} yellow-billed stork, Abdim's stork, African sacred ibis, Arabian bustard, African collared dove, golden nightjar, red-throated bee-eater, yellow-billed shrike, <b>piapiac,</b> red-pate cisticola, foxy cisticola, cricket longtail, Senegal eremomela, chestnut-bellied starling, black scrub-robin, chestnut-crowned sparrow-weaver, bush petronia, black-rumped waxbill.|$|E
5000|$|The key list {{of birds}} {{reported}} by BirdLife International is: garganey (Anas querquedula), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), fox kestrel (Falco alopex), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus), Savile's bustard (Eupodotis savilei), black crowned-crane (Balearica pavonina), African collared-dove (Streptopelia roseogrisea), Senegal parrot (Poicephalus senegalus), red-throated bee-eater (Merops bulocki), Sahelian woodpecker (Dendropicos elachus), <b>piapiac</b> (Ptilostomus afer), Sennar penduline-tit (Anthoscopus punctifrons), red-pate cisticola (Cisticola ruficeps), river prinia (Prinia fluviatilis), Senegal eremomela (Eremomela pusilla), purple glossy-starling (Lamprotornis purpureus), chestnut-bellied starling (Lamprotornis pulcher), black scrub-robin (Cercotrichas podobe), chestnut-crowned sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser superciliosus), Sudan golden sparrow (Passer luteus), bush petronia (Petronia dentata), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytes), and waterbirds ...|$|E
50|$|See {{classification}} box for relevant genera links. Traditionally, the crested jay (Platylophus galericulatus) {{is placed}} here, but apparently {{this is not}} correct, as suggested by anatomical and molecular evidence. Its placement remains unresolved; {{it does not seem}} to be a corvid at all. According to Ericson et al. (2005), jays are not a monophyletic group. Rather, they can be divided into an American and an Old World lineage (the latter including the ground jays and the <b>piapiac),</b> while the gray jays of the genus Perisoreus form a group of their own. The black magpie, formerly believed to be related to jays, is classified as a treepie.|$|E
