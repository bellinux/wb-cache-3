By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty, Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the Emperor and to defend the Empire {{whenever}} needed. He also accepted the appointment of a Greek Patriarch. In return, he was given the titles of sebastos and doux (duke) of Antioch, and he was guaranteed the right to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his heirs the County of Edessa. Following this, Bohemond retreated to Apulia and died there. His nephew, Tancred, who was regent in Antioch, refused to accept {{the terms of}} the Treaty. Antioch came temporarily under Byzantine sway in 1137, {{but it was not until}} 1158 that it truly became a Byzantine vassal.|$|E
5|$|An ancient {{division}} {{between east and}} west Wessex continued to be important in the 9th century; the boundary was Selwood Forest on the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Selborne in the west and Winchester in the east. Æthelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed Swithun to succeed Helmstan as bishop in 852–853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846 he granted a large estate to himself in South Hams in west Devon. He thus changed it from royal demesne, which he was obliged to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his successor as king, to bookland, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a frontier zone.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} {{of the television}} series Supergirl, Lionel (portrayed by Ian Butcher) is portrayed to be benign; however, his family become dysfunctional after Lex's birth due to his wife Lillian (Brenda Strong), who gradually reveals herself being ruthless and narcissistic; these traits also later <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Lex which leads him to become Superman's archenemy and tarnishes his family name in the process. Lionel begins an extramarital affair {{that would lead to}} Lena Luthor's (Katie McGrath) conception, but remains with his family {{for the sake of his}} son. After Lena's mother's death, Lionel takes his illegitimate daughter in but lies to her and the public that his second child is adopted, and he favors Lena over Lex due to his love for her mother.|$|E

5|$|In a {{marathon}} meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions {{and other}} {{literary}} records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected {{the crown prince}} based on heredity. The crown did not always <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (Mahasandhivigrahi) whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called Panchamahashabdas. Under him was the commander (Dandanayaka), the foreign minister (Mahakshapataladhikrita) and a prime minister (Mahamatya or Purnamathya), {{all of whom were}} usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier. A Mahasamantha was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (Rajneeti) and possessed military training. There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of Amoghavarsha I, administered Edathore Vishaya.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E

5|$|Lucidi {{offered to}} let Edgardo's father {{accompany}} {{them to the}} inquisitor {{to discuss the matter}} with him—Momolo refused—then allowed Momolo to send his eldest son Riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna's uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna's Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna's brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal why it was thought that Edgardo had been baptised, saying that this was confidential. When the men begged him to at least give the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to this effect to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras' bedroom and watch over Edgardo.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty was {{weighted}} in Alexios' {{favor and}} {{provided for the}} eventual absorption of Antioch and its territory into the Empire. Alexios, recognizing the impossibility of driving Bohemond out of Antioch, tried to absorb him into the structure of Byzantine rule, and put him work for the Empire's benefit. Bohemond was to retain Antioch until his death with the title of doux, unless the emperor (either Alexios or, in the future, John) chose for any reason to renege on the deal. The principality would revert to direct Byzantine rule on Bohemond's death. Bohemond therefore could not set up a dynasty in Antioch, although he was guaranteed the right to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his heirs the County of Edessa, and any other territories he managed to acquire in the Syrian interior.|$|E

In Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Robin Williams's character is wowed by ao dai-clad women when he first arrives in Saigon. The 1992 films Indochine and The Lover inspired several international fashion houses to design ao dai collections, including Prada's SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film The White Silk Dress (2007), an ao dai is the sole legacy that the mother of a poverty-stricken family has to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an ao dai-inspired design.
