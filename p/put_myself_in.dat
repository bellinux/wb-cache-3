25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E

500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet". The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Jason Derulo, E. Kidd Bogart, Lindy Robbins and Emanuel [...] "Eman" [...] Kiriakou, who also {{produced}} the track. The engineering process was handled by Jens Koerkmeier. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song's keyboards, whistle, guitars, bass, percussion and drum programming were provided by Eman, with additional keyboards and drum programming by Koerkmeier and Andrew Goldstein. On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a position as if I'd found my It Girl, to make myself feel like if I found that one true love. I've basically described {{what it would be}} like if I found her." [...] Derulo further elaborated about the concept of the song in another interview with Matt Elias of MTV News: ...|$|E

But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the zone that my life was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E

500|$|Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker {{originally}} {{suggested the}} genus name Utahraptor {{for a new}} dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in Utah. Bakker {{was at the time}} consulting with the designers of the Jurassic Park film, whose largest portrayed Velociraptorcalled the [...] "big female" [...] in the scriptwas coincidentally {{the same size as the}} newly discovered Utahraptor. Bakker was motivated to write the book by both his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment, saying that [...] "nature is a drama. It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You've got life and death and sex and betrayal and the best way to approach it is through individual animals." [...] According to Bakker, [...] "It was fun to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the mind of a raptor, especially since being a top predator is so challenging ... much harder than [...] a herbivore." [...] He credited the turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton's works that focused on life from the perspectives of grizzly bears and wolves as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur's point of view.|$|E

I {{have to be}} able to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the song for it to ring true to me. If it doesn't ring true to me, it's not going to be {{believable}} to anyone else." [...] Lewis described the album's style as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", containing R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds; however, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends, but are songs that can be performed acoustically.|$|E

2500|$|According to Björk herself, {{the lyrics}} express {{how she felt}} obliged to produce music because {{of the people that}} occupationally {{depended}} of her. The lyrics [...] "I will bring back the goods/But don't know when" [...] refer to her songwriting process; in her own words: [...] "Sometimes I don't do things that people I work with do —like spend time with families and lead a normal life. I have to isolate myself and <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a state so I will write a song." [...] After the success Björk encountered as a solo artist with Debut (1993) and Post (1995) —her most promoted album—, she began to feel more pressured as she noticed how her creative output directly affected the life of those around her. In an interview with Dave Hemingway she stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} her artistry Shakira stated, [...] "my music, I think, is a fusion of many {{different}} elements. And I'm always experimenting. So I try not to limit myself, or <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a category, or... be the architect of my own jail." [...] Shakira has frequently stated she is inspired by oriental music and Indian music, which influenced many of her earlier works. She has also been influenced by her Arabian heritage, which was a major inspiration for her breakthrough world hit [...] "Ojos Así". She told Portuguese TV, [...] "Many of my movements belong to Arab culture." [...] She also cites her parents as having been major contributors to her musical style. She is also strongly influenced by Andean music and South American folk music, using her native instrumentation for her Latin dance-pop songs.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that. It was hard for me sometimes to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> that mode you know".|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible.
