500|$|The {{division}} of royalties {{was a source}} of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for [...] "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part [...] "Pigs on the Wing". Wright commented: [...] "It was partly my fault because I didn't <b>push</b> <b>my</b> material... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there." [...] Mason recalled: [...] "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." [...] Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: [...] "Animals...wasn't a fun record to make... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band... that it was only because of him that [...] were still going... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Huang {{stood by}} her advice, saying, [...] "What I {{try to do}} is give advice from experience, and to give the advice that would serve the writer well into the {{long-term}} future. I’m taking their best interests to heart rather than being in one camp or another camp or trying to <b>push</b> <b>my</b> own political agendas." [...] She said she hoped to write a follow-up column with other people’s suggestions for dealing with the situation.|$|E
2500|$|When Churchill's many fanciful {{strategic}} ideas {{collided with}} sound military strategy {{it was only}} Brooke on the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{who was able to}} stand up to the Prime Minister. Churchill said about Brooke: [...] "When I thump the table and <b>push</b> <b>my</b> face towards him what does he do? Thumps the table harder and glares back at me. I know these Brookes – stiff-necked Ulstermen and there's no one worse to deal with than that!" [...] It has been claimed that part of Churchill's greatness was that he appointed Brooke as CIGS and kept him for the whole war.|$|E

2500|$|After taking office, Ali {{was interviewed}} by the Associated Press while [...] "holding his snoozing 8-month-old {{daughter}} outside the House chamber". When asked about the anti-Muslim protester during the campaign, Ali said the protester “was an exception to his experience on the campaign. 'It was disappointing {{that that kind of}} bigotry would still rear its head, but I understand it was an isolated incident. Occasionally people would ask if I was Muslim, {{but most of the time}} it was a curiosity, not an obstacle.'" [...] Ali did not want to be seen as just a novelty because of his religion, he said he'd “like to work on transportation matters and to pass a bill making it tougher for companies to track information and buying habits of private citizens." [...] He wanted his constituents to know he's one of them and said, [...] "I will represent the Muslims, but more importantly, I will represent all the people. I’m a Muslim, but I’m also a resident." [...] In other interviews that asked the same question, Ali replied “I'm Muslim, and that'll always be the case, but I'm here to push good issues and good policy for all Marylanders.... We're looking for good ideas", and [...] "I'm here to push good ideas, not so much to <b>push</b> <b>my</b> faith." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am grieved {{it should}} have so chanced, mother," [...] replied the youth, [...] "and much did I value the token, as coming from you.

60|$|The more I {{dive into}} this matter of whaling, and <b>push</b> <b>my</b> {{researches}} {{up to the}} very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.|$|E
60|$|Again, I must <b>push</b> <b>my</b> method {{beyond that}} of Dr. Munro, by {{considering}} the subject of Magic, in relation to perforated and other stones, whether inscribed with designs, or uninscribed.
