For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete by hand.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a detailed design and modeling approach for <b>power</b> <b>planes</b> with integrated high-impedance elec-tromagnetic surfaces (HIS). These novel <b>power</b> <b>planes,</b> which were introduced recently, have the unique ability of providing effective broadband simultaneous switching noise (SSN) mitigation. Full-wave electromagnetic simulation {{is used to}} study {{the impact of the}} geometry on the performance of these novel <b>power</b> <b>planes.</b> It is demonstrated that <b>power</b> <b>planes</b> using inductance-enhanced HIS can be designed for broadband mitigation of the SSN from the upper hundred megahertz to the gigahertz frequencies. Physics-based compact models for the unit cell of <b>power</b> <b>planes</b> with in-tegrated HIS are developed and several of them connected in a two-dimensional array to build full models for large and mul-tilayer <b>power</b> <b>planes.</b> The compact model offers fast analysis of <b>power</b> <b>planes.</b> As an example, we show that the full-wave simula-tion time of a 10 × 10 cm <b>power</b> <b>plane</b> with integrated HIS can be dramatically reduced from 24 to 48 h using a commercially avail-able three-dimensional full-wave solver to less than 1 min when using the compact circuit model developed here.

This work presents a numerical and analytical method for analyzing and assessing signal integrity issues relating to discontinuities, interconnects, and irregularly shaped <b>power</b> <b>planes</b> {{through the development of}} two independent methods. To address the coupling issue the finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique has been used, which is an accurate and robust algorithm capable of analyzing an arbitrary geometry in both the frequency and time domains. The analysis of signal integrity issues is carried out using examples such as transmission lines placed in close proximity, co-planar to co-planar transitions, and board level via interconnects. To take advantage of FDTD 2 ̆ 7 s ability to work natively in the time domain an analysis of two closely spaced transmission lines made where a series of digital pulses were applied to one transmission line while a low RF power analog signal is present on the other. Using voltage and current extraction techniques the corruption of the RF signal due to the coupling of the digital waveform is obtained. To address the resonances occurring in a <b>power</b> <b>plane</b> cavity excited due to ground/Vdd bounce an analytical method based on a segmentation technique in conjunction with the cavity model with arbitrary port placement has been developed for irregularly shaped <b>power</b> <b>planes.</b> Using this technique the resonant frequencies and noise coupling for irregular <b>power</b> <b>planes</b> can be accurately computed. Some popular <b>power</b> <b>plane</b> configurations such as the L-shaped and rectangular ring shape are considered and comparisons have been made with the equivalent circuit based transmission line matrix (TLM) method, HFSS, and experimental results.

40|$|Abstract—Planar {{electromagnetic}} bandgap (EBG) structures with novel meandered lines and super cell configuration are pro-posed for mitigating simultaneous switching noise propagation in high-speed printed circuit boards. An ultrawide bandgap extend-ing from 250 MHz to 12 GHz and beyond {{is demonstrated by}} both simulation and measurement, and a good agreement is observed. These perforated EBG-based <b>power</b> <b>planes</b> may cause spurious and unwanted radiation. In this paper, leakage radiation through these imperfect planes is carefully investigated. It is found that the leakage field from these planar EBG structures is highly concen-trated around the feed point, and the field intensity is attenuated dramatically when passing across several periods of patches. A novel concept of using these EBG structures for electromagnetic interference reduction is also introduced. Finally, the impact of <b>power</b> <b>plane</b> with EBG-patterned structures on signal integrity is studied.

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the radiation depends on the height above the ground <b>plane</b> or <b>power</b> <b>plane</b> (at RF, one {{is as good as}} the other) and the length of the conductor in relation to the wavelength of the signal component (fundamental frequency, harmonic or transient such as overshoot, undershoot or ringing). At lower frequencies, such as 133 MHz, radiation is almost exclusively via I/O cables; RF noise gets onto the <b>power</b> <b>planes</b> and is coupled to the line drivers via the VCC and GND pins. The RF is then coupled to the cable through the line driver as common-mode noise. Since the noise is common-mode, shielding has very little effect, even with differential pairs. The RF energy is capacitively coupled from the signal pair to the shield and the shield itself does the radiating. One cure for this is to use a braid-breaker or choke to reduce the common-mode signal.|$|R
