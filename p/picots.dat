40|$|Abstract: The PKC-interacting {{cousin of}} {{thioredoxin}} (<b>PICOT)</b> protein was discovered {{based on its}} ability to bind PKC in human T lymphocytes. Overexpression of <b>PICOT</b> was found to impose negative regulatory ef-fects on PKC-dependent functions. This included the inhibition of PKC-dependent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the activator protein 1 (AP- 1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) transcription factors. <b>PICOT</b> is a modular protein consisting of a single thioredoxin (Trx) -like homology domain (HD) and two highly homologous PICOT-HDs. The overall structure of each of the three domains resembles the ca-nonical thioredoxin fold, which is common in enzymes that catalyze disulfide bond formation. Nevertheless, the three <b>PICOT</b> domains lack essential catalytic cysteine residues and their mode of activity is therefore un-clear. <b>PICOT</b> is involved in the regulation of heart muscle function. Its overexpression in the heart of trans-genic mice increased the ventricular function and cardiomyocyte contractility, and inhibited the overall car-diac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. The effects of <b>PICOT</b> on the cardiac tissue are likely to be mediated via the muscle LIM protein (MLP), which was shown to interact with <b>PICOT</b> in cardiomyocytes, and colocalize with <b>PICOT</b> at the Z-disc of the sarcomer. <b>PICOT</b> interaction with MLP interfered with bind-ing of the latter protein to the Ca 2 +-dependent Ser/Thr phosphatase, calcineurin, causing the displacement of calcineurin from the Z-disc. As a result, <b>PICOT</b> inhibited the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), and the transcriptional activation of NF-AT regulated genes. Whether the effects of <b>PICOT</b> are dependent on PKC, and whether it can mediate cata-lytic activity and/or operate as an adaptor protein are only few of the open questions related to the biological mechanism of action of <b>PICOT...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{protein kinase}} C-interacting cousin of {{thioredoxin}} (PICOT; also termed glutaredoxin 3) protein was discovered {{a decade ago}} as a protein kinase C θ (PKCθ) -binding protein in human T lymphocytes. <b>PICOT</b> possesses an amino-terminal monothiol thioredoxin-like domain and a carboxy-terminal tandem repeat of a monothiol glutaredoxin-like domain. Nevertheless, the enzymatic activities of <b>PICOT</b> and its potential substrates {{have not yet been}} characterized and its biological importance is unknown. Earlier studies reported the presence of <b>PICOT</b> in several different cell lines and tissues, but its expression pattern has not been thoroughly investigated. We performed Northern blot analysis of 19 different human organs and tissues and found the expression of <b>PICOT</b> mRNA in all organs and tissues tested. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of <b>PICOT</b> at the protein level in all organs and tissues tested and showed, in addition, that <b>PICOT</b> and PKCθ expression in different tissues only partially overlap. These findings support the involvement of <b>PICOT</b> in biological functions that are independent of PKCθ. To analyze the in vivo expression pattern of <b>PICOT</b> within cells of different human organs, we performed immunohistochemical staining using PICOT-specific antibodies. Analysis of breast, pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, and kidney sections demonstrated a differential expression of <b>PICOT</b> in various cell types, with a predominant cytosolic staining of epithelial cells and low or undetectable levels of <b>PICOT</b> in the stroma.

50|$|Where <b>picots</b> used to {{be largely}} for ornament, they are now used {{functionally}} as well. In tatting, the picot {{is the site of}} the join between two rings, chains, or other pieces of work. This means that rather than creating some volume of independently tatted rings or chains and then sewing or tying them together, an integral system of <b>picots</b> can be used to join these rings and chains as the work progresses.|$|E

50|$|To {{create a}} <b>picot</b> in tatting, {{the first half}} of a double stitch is made. However, instead of pulling that half-stitch taut against the stitch before it, the half-stitch is pinched against the {{foundation}} thread and held some distance from the stitch before it. The distance at which the half-stitch is held indicates the final size of the <b>picot.</b> The second half of the stitch is formed, and this stitch is slid down the foundation thread and into place next to the stitch before it. The resulting <b>picot</b> is then anchored between two double stitches. It is also possible to anchor the <b>picot</b> between the two halves of a full double stitch.|$|R
