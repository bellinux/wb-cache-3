50|$|On September 1, 2009 Penny Ballem, {{the city}} manager of Vancouver, {{announced}} that Johnston would be hired as Deputy City Manager {{to lead the}} city's environmental efforts. During his time in Vancouver, Johnston has led {{the development and implementation}} of the City of Vancouver's Greenest City Action Plan (GCAP). The plan, which has been recognized globally has 10 goal areas, with ambitious targets in areas such as carbon, green transit, green jobs, waste, food, and green buildings. Vancouver has reduced the community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by over 6% since 1990, despite an over 30% increase in the population and an over 20% increase in jobs. Johnston has supported the establishment of CityStudio, a first in the world partnership between a city and six universities and colleges to help solve urban challenges. Johnston highlighted Vancouver's efforts to improve local food infrastructure in a recent city video, which went viral and was viewed across the world. Johnston <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> of GCAP to ASEAN Sustainable Development Conference in Thailand which provides a succinct overview of Vancouver's efforts.|$|E

40|$|Class of 2010 AbstractOBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the knowledge of third year pharmacy students about the safety of certain medications during pregnancy and to assess their awareness of an important resource available on medication safety. METHODS: The study used an analytical cross-­‐sectional design. A pre-­‐test was administered to determine baseline knowledge. Dee Quinn <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> on teratogens. The same test was then administered as a post-­‐test to assess the amount of knowledge gained from the presentation. The pre and post-­‐tests were matched for data analysis. A mean and standard deviation were developed for pre and post-­‐test data and the results were compared to each other using a t-­‐test for dependent groups. RESULTS: Students showed a significant increase in knowledge after the presentation (p< 0. 0001). 78...|$|E
40|$|Through a {{previously}} funded research project, Encouraging Low-Income Households to Make Location-Efficient Housing Choices, our team developed a toolkit to assist households utilizing Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers with finding location-efficient/affordable housing.

This technology transfer project provided the tools to social service providers who work with voucher recipients in the Portland region and <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> on research findings and policy implications to transportation researchers, professionals and students. Specific activities included: • In-person presentations to groups of social service providers in three counties (four presentations total) who provide case management and other intensive social services for households with low incomes. • A TREC-sponsored presentation/webinar {{as part of the}} TREC Friday Transportation Seminar series In addition, final edits were completed on a manuscript included in Housing Policy Debate’s special issue on location-affordable housing.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) offices in Rockville, Maryland, between {{industry}} respresentatives of Westinghouse, Southern Nuclear, and the NRC staff. The NRC requested this meeting to obtain some design and background information on the ASIC-Based Replacement Module (ABRM) Development Program. Attachment I is a list of attendees and Attachment 2 are the meeting handouts. Mike Eidson from Southern Nuclear opened the meeting by providing the utilities ' perspective on the ABRM progrm. Mr. Eidson is the Chairman of the ASIC Subgroup, which consists of eight utilities who sponsor the ABRM program. Following Mr. Eidson, Carl Vitalbo from Westinghouse <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> on the ABRM program objectives, background, ASIC chip design features, and main board and personality module design. Mr. Vitalbo also provided the status of the test programs and the licensing approach. During the presentation, Eric Lee, the NRC reviewer, raised concerns on the sufficiency of validation test vectors for the ASIC chip. He and Keith Mortenson, a NRC staff member,. pointed out to Mr. Vitalbo that although Westinghouse performed about one quarter of million credible tests on ASIC, there are more than one million test vectors per each of the quarter million tests that Westinghouse performed. Mr. Vitalbo agreed with the staff, but stated that th...|$|E
