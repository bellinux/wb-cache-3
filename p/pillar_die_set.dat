40|$|CAD-designers of {{aluminum}} extrusion <b>die</b> <b>set</b> {{have to make}} many decisions on tooling type, construction etc. by experience, their own metal flow sense and special methods of tooling design produced by manufacturer. There was created some software products for designing the planar <b>die</b> <b>set.</b> In addition, metal flow simulation programs using three-dimensional <b>die</b> <b>set</b> models as initial data were developed. However, {{it is a difficult}} task to create a high-quality solid <b>die</b> <b>set</b> model from scratch shortly. This led to three-dimensional <b>die</b> <b>set</b> parametrization systems development. QForm Extrusion Die Designer is one of them. Based on QExDD the automated design technique of <b>die</b> <b>set</b> elements is proposed. It takes into consideration the volumetric metal flow factor and design experience. In addition, it is aimed at CAD-CAE connection with QForm-Extrusion program. The proposed technique consists of two stages: preliminary designing and correction cycle. The first stage is to prepare profile contour and choose the first <b>die</b> <b>set</b> construction version. The algorithms implemented at this stage use only geometrical data, particularly profile contour. A received three-dimensional <b>die</b> <b>set</b> model is transferred to the second stage for iterative construction modification based on extrusion simulation results. As a result of automated design process there is the <b>die</b> <b>set</b> parametrical model that is ready for production and further extrusion test. The first version of the proposed technique is implemented using the QExDD software program and is now under tests in companies of Russia and UK. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Dies are {{generally}} sold in sets {{of two or}} three dies, depending on the shape of the case. A three <b>die</b> <b>set</b> is needed for straight cases, while a two <b>die</b> <b>set</b> is used for bottlenecked cases. The first <b>die</b> of either <b>set</b> performs the sizing and decapping operation, except in some cases in the 3 <b>die</b> <b>set,</b> where decapping may be done by the second die. The middle die in a three-die set is used to expand the case mouth of straight cases (and decap in the case where this is not done by the first die), while in a two <b>die</b> <b>set</b> the entire neck is expanded as the case is extracted from the first die. The last <b>die</b> in the <b>set</b> seats the bullet and may apply a crimp. Special crimping dies are often used to apply a stronger crimp after the bullet is seated. Progressive presses sometimes use an additional [...] "die" [...] to meter powder into the case (though it is arguably not a real die as it does not shape the case).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the manufacturing process}} for wide chord fan blades (WCFB) and how the production of <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> used for their manufacture can be substantially improved using reverse engineering. Super plastic formed WCFBs are manufactured by diffusion bonding five separate blade pieces under high pressure. The blade is then hot creep formed into the required shape, using pressure to force the blade against the die walls to yield the desired form, blade twist and the honeycomb centre required. Two <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> are required, one for the hot creep forming of the blade billet and the second for the super plastic blade forming process. Their manufacture requires three solid models to be generated from a bespoke ‘Fan Key System’. This calculates the <b>die</b> <b>set</b> geometry required for both hot and cold states. The three solid models comprise the casting model geometry which incorporates the draw angle and shrinkage allowance, the pattern model for {{the top and bottom}} <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> and a <b>die</b> <b>set</b> model used to define the NC part programs for the five axis finish machining process. The machining process has three elements, pre-machining sometimes termed water line or terrace machining, semi-finish and finish machining. Distortion caused by rate of cooling, graphite precipitation and mould dilation cause massive amounts of metal removal in the waterline machining process which can take up to 35 h and is a non-value added process. It often leaves the die wall thin with the resulting effect on performance and life. A reverse engineering solution was used to improve the geometry of the castings by predicting die distortion more accurately. Point cloud models of nine casting sets were imported into reverse engineering software, ‘Surfacer’ which made possible a comparison with the surface geometry representation required. The resulting design information enabled more accurate <b>die</b> <b>set</b> design. Waterline machining had been substantially reduced and die life has been extende...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The work {{presented}} in this paper might be used for basic data in the design of a lot extruded aluminum products using the variable section extrusion process. Design/methodology/approach: The capacity of a CNC extruder was calculated and decided as analyzing the FEM results performed by commercial software DEFORM- 2 D. CNC extruder and <b>die</b> <b>set</b> for variable section extrusion was invented by field extrusion experts. Findings: CNC extruder had a key role in variable extrusion process. Furthermore there was few <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> with mold feeding parts for aluminum extrusion. To be capable of extruding aluminum products with variable cross section are CNC extruder and the <b>die</b> <b>set.</b> Research limitations/implications: For future research of developed CNC extruder, frame structures of the extruder would be analyzed and designed using FE analysis. In addition CNC extruder would be operated by the control program for variable section as a PC version. Practical implications: Aluminum parts with variable section would increase as utilizing the CNC extruder and cost price of the parts be down. Many industrial products using the variable section extrusion process would be used in diverse fields. Originality/value: Extruded aluminum part with variable section is rarely used since extruders don’t be designed and developed for variable section extrusion. It is important that an extruder with CNC control, which could be easily handled and have accessible software to be operated by field user, are invented. As stated above, CNC extruder is needed for production of industrial products with variable section for today. Therefore design and development of CNC extruder having the <b>die</b> <b>set</b> for mold feeding parts was tackled in this paper as efficient approach using commercial FEM code...|$|R
