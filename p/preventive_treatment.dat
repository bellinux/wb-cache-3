5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that {{reduces the risk of}} clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a <b>preventive</b> <b>treatment</b> for heart attacks and strokes.|$|E
5|$|An {{aneurysm}} may {{be detected}} incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms {{are associated with}} potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH {{were more likely to}} bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for <b>preventive</b> <b>treatment</b> only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. At the same time, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.|$|E

40|$|Background: In a prospective, multicenter, {{randomized}} controlled trial, 4, 146 patients were randomized to receive standard care or standard care plus coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Objectives: The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the consequences of CCTA-assisted diagnosis on invasive coronary angiography, <b>preventive</b> <b>treatments,</b> and clinical outcomes. Methods: In post hoc analyses, we assessed changes in invasive coronary angiography, <b>preventive</b> <b>treatments,</b> and clinical outcomes using national electronic health records.

25|$|Rigorous plaque control {{programs}} {{along with}} periodontal scaling and curettage also {{have proved to}} be helpful, although according to the American Dental Association, periodontal scaling and root planing are considered as a treatment for periodontal disease, not as a <b>preventive</b> <b>treatment</b> for periodontal disease. In a 1997 review of effectiveness data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found clear evidence showing that toothpaste containing triclosan was effective in preventing gingivitis.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{development}} of more effective treatments, PCP was a common and rapid cause of death in persons living with AIDS. Much of the incidence of PCP has been reduced by instituting a standard practice of using oral co-trimoxazole (Bactrim / Septra) to prevent the disease in people with CD4 counts less than 200/μL. In populations that {{do not have access to}} <b>preventive</b> <b>treatment,</b> PCP continues to be a major cause of death in AIDS.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: The eye can be {{directly}} affected {{in the form of}} episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision. <b>Preventive</b> <b>treatment</b> of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E

50|$|According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, {{chronic illness}} {{account for the}} {{majority}} of diseases in South Korea, a condition exacerbated by the health care system’s focus on treatment rather than prevention. The incidence of chronic disease in South Korea hovers around 24 percent. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rate of prevalence at the end of 2003 was less than 0.1 percent. In 2001 central government expenditures on health care accounted for about 6 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP). South Korea is experiencing a growing elderly population, which leads to an increase in chronic degenerative diseases. The proportion of the population over 65 is expected to rise from 13% in 2014 to 38% in 2050. Majority of health care professionals treat patients on curative, rather than <b>preventive</b> <b>treatments,</b> because of the lack of financial incentives for <b>preventive</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|R
25|$|Teeth {{cleaning}} (also {{known as}} prophylaxis, literally a <b>preventive</b> <b>treatment</b> of a disease) is a procedure {{for the removal}} of tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing, especially in areas that are difficult to reach in routine toothbrushing. It is often done by a dental hygienist. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling and tooth polishing and debridement if too much tartar has accumulated. This involves the use of various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth.|$|E
25|$|Equatorial Guinea’s {{innovative}} malaria control {{programs in}} the early 21st century have achieved successes in reducing malaria infection, disease, and mortality in the population. Their program consists of twice-yearly indoor residual spraying (IRS), the introduction of artemisinin combination treatment (ACTs), the use of intermittent <b>preventive</b> <b>treatment</b> in pregnant women (IPTp), {{and the introduction of}} very high coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLINs). Their efforts resulted in a reduction in all-cause under-five mortality from 152 to 55 deaths per 1,000 live births (down 64%). The drop occurred rapidly and timed directly with the beginning of the program.|$|E

Abnormal results may suggest the presence of precancerous changes, allowing examination and possible <b>preventive</b> <b>treatment.</b> The treatment of low-grade lesions may adversely affect subsequent fertility and pregnancy. Personal invitations encouraging women to get screened are effective at increasing the likelihood they will do so.

40|$|Some {{women are}} at risk of forming blood clots in a deep vein during pregnancy, after a {{caesarean}} birth, or during the first few weeks after childbirth. If part of the clot breaks off and lodges in a blood vessel in the lungs, it can be life-threatening. <b>Preventive</b> <b>treatments</b> include blood-thinning drugs to prevent clots, support stockings, and exercise soon after the birth to keep circulation moving. However, some drugs might cause problems such as increased blood loss after the birth. Drugs used include heparin, low molecular weight heparin and aspirin. We included 16 randomised controlled studies in the review but only 13 trials with 1774 women contributed data for the outcomes of interest. We did not find enough evidence from the trials to be sure about the effects of these different <b>preventive</b> <b>treatments.</b> This means there is not enough evidence to show which are the best ways to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during or following pregnancy, or after a caesarean birth...|$|R
40|$|Background. Healthcare {{workers have}} an {{increased}} risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but previous studies suggested that they might be reluctant to accept <b>preventive</b> tuberculosis (TB) <b>treatment.</b> We aimed to examine doctors’ and nurses’ experience of TB screening and to explore their attitudes towards <b>preventive</b> TB <b>treatment.</b> Methods. We conducted a survey among randomly selected healthcare workers at a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia, using a paper-based questionnaire. Results. A total of 1, 304 questionnaires were distributed and 311 (24 %) responses were received. The majority of hospital staff supported <b>preventive</b> TB <b>treatment</b> in health care workers with evidence of latent TB infection (LTBI) in general (74 %, 164 / 223) and for them personally (81 %, 198 / 244) while 80 and 53 healthcare workers respectively had no opinion on the topic. Staff working in respiratory medicine were significantly less likely to support <b>preventive</b> TB <b>treatment</b> in health care workers in general or for them personally if they would have evidence of LTBI compared to other specialties (p = 0. 001). Only 13 % (14 / 106) of respondents with evidence of LTBI indicated that they had been offered <b>preventive</b> TB <b>treatment.</b> Twenty-one percent (64 / 306) of respondents indicated {{that they did not know}} the difference between active and latent TB. Among staff who had undergone testing for LTBI, only 33 % (75 / 230) felt adequately informed about the meaning of their test results. Discussion. Hospital staff in general had positive attitudes towards <b>preventive</b> TB <b>treatment,</b> but actual treatment rates were low and perceived knowledge about LTBI was insufficient among a significant proportion of staff. The gap between high support for <b>preventive</b> TB <b>treatment</b> among staff and low treatment rates needs to be addressed. Better education on the concept of LTBI and the meaning of screening test results is required...|$|R
500|$|HIV can be {{transmitted}} from mother to child during pregnancy, during delivery, or through breast milk, resulting in the baby also contracting HIV. This is the third most common way in which HIV is transmitted globally. In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20% and in those who also breastfeed 35%. As of 2008, vertical transmission accounted for about 90% of cases of HIV in children. With appropriate treatment the risk of mother-to-child infection {{can be reduced to}} about 1%. <b>Preventive</b> <b>treatment</b> involves the mother taking antiretrovirals during pregnancy and delivery, an elective caesarean section, avoiding breastfeeding, and administering antiretroviral drugs to the newborn. [...] Antiretrovirals when taken by either the mother or the infant decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed. However, many of these measures are not available in the developing world. If blood contaminates food during pre-chewing it may pose a risk of transmission.|$|E

40|$|Managing a {{pavement}} {{network has}} become more complex as the competition for pavement preservation funds has grown {{and the need to}} justify decisions has increased. As a result, tools that can help an agency collect, analyze, and summarize data have become increasingly important. As a result, asset management tools, such as pavement management systems, have become a necessary component of today’s transportation agencies. Coupled with a change in agency focus from expansion to preservation, pavement management systems are now being used to support the use of cost-effective preservation strategies such as preventive maintenance. However, the use of pavement management tools to support preventive maintenance programs is impacted by the degree to which <b>preventive</b> maintenance <b>treatments</b> are integrated into a pavement management system.
