500|$|Australia batted {{first and}} Loxton {{came in to}} bat {{in front of a}} {{supportive}} home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He made 80, putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey, who made his first Test century in his second international match, as Australia amassed 8/575. The debutant all-rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey [...] "was going along merrily and he soon settled me down". Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings. Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent, Brown threw the ball to his debutants. Johnson was given the ball first change, but failed to make an impact, so Loxton was handed his chance. He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2/61 in the first innings, removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad. In the words of Brown, the Victorian all-rounder [...] "looked twice the bowler Johnson did". The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings. The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948. He reflected that [...] "It's not the fellow who gets the opportunity it's the fellow who <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> around it and grabs it. I just {{happened to be in the}} right place at the right time." [...] After his position in the touring party was confirmed, he continued his late-season resurgence, scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England.|$|E
2500|$|Tevez {{is known}} for his tango flare goal {{celebrations}} ever since playing for Boca Juniors, as well with Corinthians of Brazil. During his time at Manchester United, he would hide a baby's dummy in his shorts and put it in his mouth after scoring a goal as a commemorative gesture to his baby daughter. After his move to Manchester City, Tevez often performed a dance where he <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> together, bends down and rocks his body; this dance has been named after him as the [...] "Tevez Dance".|$|E
2500|$|On the August 1 {{episode of}} SmackDown, McMahon {{had a serious}} {{argument}} with Kevin Owens due to losing to AJ Styles for the United States Championship. Owens demanded a competent referee, Daniel Bryan chose McMahon to become the special guest referee. The following week on SmackDown, McMahon was accidentally attacked by Styles during a brawl between Styles and Owens. Following the incident, on the August 15 episode of SmackDown, McMahon warned Styles that if he <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on him, he will {{put his hands on}} Styles. The warning later came to Owens after he accidentally attacked McMahon. At SummerSlam, McMahon was about to count the pin and declare Owens the winner, however after seeing Styles foot on the bottom rope, McMahon continued the match. A frustrated Owens pushed McMahon, causing Shane to push him back which caused a distraction for Styles to win back the United States Championship. On the August 22 episode of SmackDown, McMahon allowed a rematch between Styles and Owens, during the match Shane make himself referee after seeing poor the officiating from guest referee Baron Corbin which caused a confrontation from Owens, this allowed Styles to take advantage and pin Owens to retain the championship.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said little}} Abraham, brightly, from the window-bench; [...] "and I seed it! {{and it did}} twinkle when he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up to <b>his</b> mistarshers.

60|$|The {{young man}} slipped from the table, and lounged to the door. The Doctor <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>his</b> pockets and {{followed}} him.

60|$|The trooper starts up, clasps {{his mother}} round the neck, and falls {{down on his}} knees before her.

6000|$|The almost {{universal}} habit of batsmen of shouting [...] "Heads!" [...] at whatever height {{from the ground}} the ball may be, is not a little confusing. The average person, on hearing the shout, <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over his skull, crouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent plan if the ball is falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground.|$|E

6000|$|LADY (letting {{her hands}} fall [...] ). Tear them from me--by force! (As he glares {{at her like}} a tiger about to spring, she crosses her arms on her breast in the {{attitude}} of a martyr. The gesture and pose instantly awaken his theatrical instinct: he forgets his rage in the desire to show her that in acting, too, she has met her match. He keeps her a moment in suspense; then suddenly clears up his countenance; <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> behind him with provoking coolness; looks at her {{up and down a}} couple of times; takes a pinch of snuff; wipes his fingers carefully and puts up his handkerchief, her heroic pose becoming more and more ridiculous all the time.) ...|$|E

But I could tell them better than you if I set my mind to it. Next time you are asked why a letter compromising a wife should not be sent to her husband, answer simply that the husband would not read it. Do you suppose, little innocent, that a man wants to be compelled by public opinion to make a scene, to fight a duel, to break up his household, to injure his career by a scandal, when he can avoid it all by taking care not to know? ...|$|E
60|$|When a man {{who hates}} cats wakes {{up in the morning}} and finds a little squirming kitten on his breast, or <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> into his ulster-pocket and finds a little half-dead kitten where his gloves should be, or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among his dress-shirts, or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh {{strapped}} on his saddle-bow and shakes a little squawling kitten from its folds when he opens it, or goes out to dinner and finds a little blind kitten under his chair, or stays at home and finds a writhing kitten under the quilt, or wriggling among his boots, or hanging, head downward, in his tobacco-jar, or being mangled by his terrier in the veranda,--when such a man finds one kitten, neither more nor less, once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or should be, he is naturally upset. When he dare not murder his daily trove because he believes it to be a Manifestation, an Emissary, an Embodiment, and half a dozen other things all out of the regular course of nature, he is more than upset. He is actually distressed. Some of Lone Sahib's co-religionists thought that he was a highly favored individual; but many said that if he had treated the first kitten with proper respect--as suited a Toth-Ra-Tum-Sennacherib Embodiment--all this trouble would have been averted. They compared him to the Ancient Mariner, but none the less they were proud of him and proud of the Englishman who had sent the Manifestation. They did not call it a Sending because Icelandic magic was not in their programme.|$|E

60|$|There {{is nothing}} in the world so brisk as the ways and manners of lawyers when in any great case they come to that portion of it which they know to be the real bone of the limb and kernel of the nut. The doctor is very brisk when after a dozen {{moderately}} dyspeptic patients he comes on some unfortunate gentleman whose gastric apparatus is gone altogether. The parson is very brisk when he reaches the minatory clause in his sermon. The minister is very brisk when he asks the House for a vote, telling his hoped-for followers that this special point is absolutely essential to his government. Unless he can carry this, he and all those hanging on to him must vacate their places. The horse-dealer is very brisk when, after four or five indifferent lots, he bids his man bring out from the stable the last thorough-bred that he bought, and the very best that he ever put his eye on. But the briskness of none of these is equal to the briskness of the barrister who has just got into his hands for cross-examination him whom we may call the centre witness of a great case. He plumes himself like a bullfinch going to sing. He spreads himself like a peacock on a lawn. He perks himself like a sparrow on a paling. He crows amidst his attorneys and all the satellites of the court like a cock among his hens. He <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> this way and that, settling even the sunbeams as they enter, lest a moat should disturb his intellect or dull the edge of his subtlety. There is a modesty in his eye, a quiescence in his lips, a repose in his limbs, under which lie half-concealed,--not at all concealed from those who have often watched him at his work,--the glance, the tone, the spring, which are to tear that unfortunate witness into pieces, without infringing any one of those conventional rules which have been laid down for the guidance of successful well-mannered barristers.|$|E
6000|$|One person {{works the}} [...] "drill-stick" [...] with a rude bow, {{and with his}} other hand holds a piece of stone or of wood above it, both to steady it and to give the {{requisite}} pressure--gentle at first, and increasing judiciously up to the critical moment when the fire is on the point of bursting out. Another man <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on the lower piece of wood, the [...] "fire-block," [...] to steady it, and holds a piece of tinder ready to light it as soon as fire is produced. If a serious emergency should occur, {{it is by no means}} hopeless to obtain fire after this method. A large party have considerable advantages over only one or two men, because as the work is fatiguing, the men can undertake it in turns; and, again, as considerable knack is required for success, it is much more probable that one man out of many should succeed, than that only one man, taken at hazard, should do so. But the best plan of all for a party of three or more men is for one of them to hold the upper block, another to hold the lower block and the tinder, should there be any, and the third man to cause the drill-stick to rotate. He will effect this best by dispensing with the [...] "bow," [...] and by simply using a string or thong of a yard or four feet long. He makes one or two turns with the string round the drill-stick, and then holding one end of the string in either hand, he saws away with all his force. I believe that a party of three men, furnished with dry wood of an appropriate quality and plenty of string, would surely produce smoke on the first few trials, but that they would fail in producing fire. If, however, they had a couple of hours' leisure to master the knack of working these sticks, I think they would succeed in producing fire before the end of that time. The period of time necessary for a successful operation is from one to three minutes. It is of little use fatiguing yourself with sustaining the exertion for a longer period at a time, unless the wood becomes continuously hotter. As soon as the temperature remains uniform it shows that you have let the opportunity slip; it is then the best economy of effort to desist at once, to rest, to take breath, and recommence with fresh vigour.|$|E
