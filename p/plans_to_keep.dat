Haydar seemingly objected to the idea of Hafez's <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> succession to the Syrian Presidency within the Assad family.

[...] He encouraged the colonists to [...] "bear one another's burdens" [...] and to view themselves as a [...] "Company of Christ, bound together by Love." [...] He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state.

[...] Winthrop's son Henry Winthrop missed the Arbella sailing and ended up on the Talbot, which also sailed from Wight. [...] Winthrop wrote a sermon entitled A Modell of Christian Charity, which was delivered either before or during the crossing. [...] It described the ideas and <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Puritan society strong in faith, while also comparing the struggles {{that they would have to}} overcome in the New World with the story of Exodus. In it, he used the now-famous phrase [...] "City upon a Hill" [...] to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently [...] "the eyes of all people are upon us." [...] He also said, [...] "In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient—and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.|$|E

Ada intercepts the delivery of the locket in France, and kills Hunk and his men. As a consequence of an accidental T-virus leak in Loire Village, the destination of the delivery, Ada is forced to retreat to an old castle. Along with a unit of the French Air Force sent to burn down the village, she encounters Christine Henry, the Umbrella facility director who gave Hunk the order to deliver the G-virus to France. Jacob, the leader of the airborne unit, is revealed to be Christine's co-conspirator. However, he <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the G-virus sample for himself, and shoots her. Philippe, another member of the unit, convinces Ada to give him the pendant, after which he injects himself with the G-virus to give himself the power to stop Jacob. Ada escapes and realizes her feelings for Leon, deciding to quit the spy business and return to him. The two drama albums are considered [...] "what-if" [...] scenarios and are not acknowledged in later series releases. The characters' story arcs are continued differently: Sherry is taken into custody by the U.S. Government immediately after the events of Resident Evil 2, and Ada keeps the pendant with the G-virus and resumes her activities as a spy. Hunk successfully delivers a separate G-virus sample to Umbrella.|$|E
