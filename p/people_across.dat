Further restrictions were imposed in 1964, and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles. In 1969, after the passing of the Gibraltar Constitution Order, to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard tracked {{north of}} Honduras, strong winds along the {{coastline}} downed trees and power lines. Mudslides stranded up to 15,000 <b>people</b> <b>across</b> 40 different towns.

5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful").

Pandals are erected in various cities, towns and villages throughout West Bengal. The whole city of Kolkata undergoes a transformation during Durga Puja, as it is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of goddess Durga and her four children are worshipped and displayed. The idols of the goddess as brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work round the year fashioning the clay-models of the goddess.

5|$|The Compilation titles act as continuations and {{expansions}} on {{the core}} narrative, with them focusing on various characters. Advent Children begins {{two years after}} VII, when <b>people</b> <b>across</b> the world are succumbing to a disease called Geostigma and Cloud, suffering from guilt, is forced to confront Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo, avatars of Sephiroth's will.

5|$|The {{worship of}} some Egyptian gods spread to {{neighboring}} lands, especially to Canaan and Nubia during the New Kingdom, when those regions were under pharaonic control. In Canaan, the exported deities, including Hathor, Amun, and Set, were often syncretized with native gods, {{who in turn}} spread to Egypt. The Egyptian deities {{may not have had}} permanent temples in Canaan, and their importance there waned after Egypt lost control of the region. In contrast, many temples to the major Egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in Nubia. After the end of Egyptian rule there, the imported gods, particularly Amun and Isis, were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of Nubia's independent Kingdom of Kush. These gods were incorporated into the Nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in Egypt, so that Amun was considered the divine father of the king and Isis and other goddesses were linked with the Nubian queen, the kandake. Some deities reached farther. Taweret became a goddess in Minoan Crete, and Amun's oracle at Siwa Oasis was known to and consulted by <b>people</b> <b>across</b> the Mediterranean region.|$|E

5|$|While {{weakening}} after peaking in intensity, Oliwa passed about 60miles (95km) {{north of}} Agrihan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Sustained winds {{on the island}} reached 75mph (120km/h), with gusts to 85mph (135km/h). The winds downed two coconut trees onto a radio antenna, which left the island temporarily without contact to the outside world. On the Japanese island of Kyushu, where Oliwa made landfall as a weakened typhoon, thousands of homes were flooded, and dozens were destroyed. Its slow movement caused heavy rainfall that created a mudslide in Tashiro, Kagoshima, killing three <b>people.</b> <b>Across</b> Kagoshima Prefecture, officials issued evacuations due to flooding, although many did not heed the warnings.
