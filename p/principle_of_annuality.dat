40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{balanced}} budget {{is one of}} the most fundamental budgetary principles. It guarantees that the state expenditure does not go beyond the amount of the revenue received for a given fiscal year. Therefore, a possibility of budgetary deficit - so dangerous for the financial stability of the state - is precluded. The paper describes the functioning and the legal mechanism of systems which have been responsible for the {{balanced budget}} in the USA since the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Holdings Act reform, and the system in the European Union. It is worth noticing that together with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the equilibrium, it is necessary to impose a compliance of the state budget with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> universality, and - for technical reasons - the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>annuality</b> and unity.

40|$|An annual {{life history}} is {{often viewed as}} a model {{adaptation}} to arid environments. Annuality is predicted to have evolved in response to low adult survival and high seedling survival. In this study I evaluated the idea that increases in aridity should {{be associated with the}} evolution of an annual life history. I also investigated the correlated evolution <b>of</b> <b>annuality</b> and growth form. Ancestral character states for life history characters and climate variables were mapped onto a molecular phylogeny (obtained using plastid trnL-trnF and psbA-trnH and nuclear ETS sequences) of the genera Trichogyne and Ifloga (Asteraceae). Bayesian methods were used for phylogeny inference and maximum likelihood methods for ancestral state reconstructions. Only two phylogenetically independent contrasts were obtained and so the association between changes from annuality to perenniality and increases in aridity along branches of the tree were recorded and evaluated using Fisher's exact test. In order to account for ancestral character state reconstruction uncertainty, four different possible scenarios suggested by the maximum likelihood methods for the evolution <b>of</b> <b>annuality</b> were examined. This is the first molecular phylogeny of the group. Bayesian analysis of the sequence data places the Trichogyne+ Ifloga clade within the Gnaphileae. The genus Ifloga is shown to be paraphyletic. Trichogyne ambigua, as currently described, is polyphyletic and may contain two species. The origin of the Trichogyne+ Ifloga clade is within southern Africa and a northwards migration via the arid corridor is suggested to explain the disjunct distribution of the two Northern Hemisphere species. There is an association between the duration of the moisture growing season and the evolution <b>of</b> <b>annuality.</b> This is consistent with the idea that annuality is favoured by long drought periods making perennation difficult. The evolution <b>of</b> <b>annuality</b> was correlated with a non-woody, tufted, growth form. Amphi-basicarpy was discovered for T. polycnemoides, making it only the second known example of this reproductive strategy within Asteraceae...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course of the budgetary year. In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> budgetary <b>annuality</b> as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the budgetary systems of the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the budgetary year (”structural flexibility”), the system of compulsory vs non-compulsory expenditure (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of commitment appropriations, the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law may fall into all three categories of sources <b>of</b> law. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations.

Considering their content and legal nature, the general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are divided into: compulsory or axiomatic principles, regulatory or structural principles (which all national laws of the Member States have in common), and the general principles inherent to the EU legal order.

40|$|RONO: 00 Darnel (Lolium temulentum L.), {{the subject}} of this review, is botanically and {{culturally}} significant because of its evolutionary origin as a mimic weed of cereals and its reputation as a source of potent psychoactive toxins. Evidence from molecular phylogeny, palaeontology and archaeology allows the source and spread of darnel in time and space to be reconstructed. Contemporaneously with the progenitors of wheat and barley, at the dawn of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent region of Mesopotamia and the Eastern Mediterranean, darnel was derived from a perennial ancestor that was subject to the same human-mediated selection pressures as the earliest cereal species, and shares with them the domestication traits <b>of</b> <b>annuality,</b> self-fertility, high harvest index and non-shattering grains. Because it combines the characteristics of cereals with those of forage species of the Lolium-Festuca complex, L. temulentum is a useful experimental subject {{for the study of the}} physiology of temperate grasses. In particular, it has been a model for research on the control of flowering by day length, as well as investigations of vegetative development, resource allocation and responses to abiotic stresses. Recent studies of the chemical basis for darnel's noxious reputation reveal a complex picture in which endophytic fungi, nematodes and pathogenic bacteria separately or in combination account for the toxicity of the darnel grain. The relationship, and frequent historical conflation, of darnel and ergot poisoning is considered in detail. Finally, some examples of literary allusions to L. temulentum, from Aristophanes to Shakespeare, are given...|$|R
