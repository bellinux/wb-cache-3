These generally include, {{but are not limited}} to, mechanical amplifiers, electrical/electronic <b>amplifiers,</b> hydraulic/fluidic <b>amplifiers,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> optical amplifiers and quantum amplifiers.

2500|$|The wide use of {{feedback}} controllers {{did not become}} feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain <b>pneumatic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added {{by the use of}} a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the [...] "Stabilog" [...] controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 An {{experimental}} study {{was made of}} acoustic switching of <b>pneumatic</b> turbulence <b>amplifiers.</b> The development of fluidic devices was generally reviewed, and {{the operation of the}} <b>pneumatic</b> turbulence <b>amplifiers</b> made for testing was described. The characteristics of the turbulence amplifiers were experimentally determined and found to be typical for this type of device. Two acoustic switching devices, the sonic vibrating reed and the acoustic resonance sensor, were introduced. The vibrating reeds vibrated at their natural frequency to interrupt the control jet of a turbulence amplifier and the acoustic resonance sensor interrupted the control jet, when resonance occurred in the resonator chamber. Both devices produced turbulence amplifier switching when excited by proper acoustic signals. Their basic response characteristics were determined. The vibrating reeds produced satisfactorily switching at signal resonance frequencies between 40 to 100 cycles per second, while the resonance sensors operated between 400 and 2000 cycles per second. The response time for both switching devices was found to be approximately 0. 24 second.

Heretofore, in cascading amplifiers to increase gain, it has been common practice to interconnect the amplifiers by use of wires and/or thin films on substrates. This practice has not yielded satisfactory results at frequencies greater than 200 Hz, in each case, for either or both of two reasons: Wire bonds introduce large discontinuities. Because the interconnections are typically tens of wavelengths long, any impedance mismatches give rise to ripples in the gain-vs. -frequency response, which degrade the performance of the cascade...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} on-orbit {{performance}} of the first civilian operational use of a Global Positioning System Receiver (GPSR) at a geostationary orbit (GEO). The GPSR is on-board the newly launched Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R). GOES-R {{is the first of}} four next generation GEO weather satellites for NOAA, now in orbit GOES-R is formally identified as GOES- 16. Among the pioneering technologies required to support its improved spatial, spectral and temporal resolution is a GPSR. The GOES- 16 GPSR system is a new design that was mission critical and therefore received appropriate scrutiny. As ground testing of a GPSR for GEO can only be done by simulations with numerous assumptions and approximations regarding the current GPS constellation, this paper reveals what performance can be achieved in using on orbit data. Extremely accurate orbital position is achieved using GPS navigation at GEO. Performance results are shown demonstrating compliance with the 1007575 meter and 6 cms radial/in-track/cross-track orbital position and velocity accuracy requirements of GOES- 16. The aforementioned compliance includes station-keeping and momentum management maneuvers, contributing to no observational outages. This performance is achieved by a completely new system design consisting of a unique L 1 GEOantenna, low-noise <b>amplifier</b> (LNA) <b>assembly</b> and a 12 channel GPSR capable of tracking the edge of the main beam and the side lobes of the GPS L 1 signals. This paper presents the definitive answer that the GOES- 16 GPSR solution exceeds all performance requirements tracking up to 12 satellites and achieving excellent carrier-to-noise density (C/N 0). Additionally, these performance results show the practicality of this approach. This paper makes it clear that all future GEO Satellites should consider the addition of a GPSR in their spacecraft design, otherwise they may be sacrificing spacecraft capabilities and accuracy along with incurring increased and continual demand on ground support...|$|R
