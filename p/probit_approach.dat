40|$|Links between employees' {{commitment}} to their organizations and satisfaction with their jobs {{have been the subject}} of a large amount of empirical research, and still there seems little agreement about the causal connections between these two important employee attitudes. Understanding these attitudes is important because they have an important effect on organizational performance, and these attitudes can be influenced by human resource policies and practices. This paper assesses the gains from the use of a bivariate <b>probit</b> <b>approach</b> in measuring the connections between job satisfaction and organizational commitment. This paper is the first to make use of the bivariate <b>probit</b> <b>approach</b> in this context, and it improves our understanding of the connections between HR policy and these important employee attitudes. The approach taken allows a direct test of the hypothesis that job satisfaction and organizational commitment are jointly determined by demographic and policy factors.

Further {{understanding of the relationship}} between these two risk factors can assist in reducing avoidable morbidity and mortality. This study investigates the empirical association between obesity and the propensity to smoke and to quit smoking, using a Seemingly Unrelated (SUR) <b>probit</b> <b>approach</b> that takes into consideration the potential for reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity. Using Australian health survey data, this article demonstrates the usefulness of the SUR <b>probit</b> <b>approach</b> in generating information on the relationship between unobserved factors influencing both smoking behaviour and obesity, and in providing estimates of the conditional probabilities of each risk factor. Results suggest the two risk factors are not independent. The presence, size and direction of correlation between the unobserved factors are found to vary by smoking behaviour and by gender. Estimates of conditional probabilities demonstrate smokers have a lower probability of obesity, particularly among females, and ex-smokers have a higher probability of obesity, particularly among males.

An inevitable predictive implication of this rapid growth is the growing concerns with regard to credit risk management which is the motivation of conducting this research. The paper focuses on the credit scoring aspect of credit risk management using both logit and <b>probit</b> regression <b>approaches.</b> Real data on corporate customers are available for conducting this research {{which is also a}} contribution to this area for all other developing countries. Our questions focus on how future customers can be classified in terms of credibility, which models and methods are more effective in better capturing risks. Findings suggest that <b>probit</b> <b>approaches</b> are more effective in capturing the significance of variables and goodness-of-fitness tests. Seven variables of the Ohlson O-Score model are used: CL_CA, INTWO, OENEG, TA_TL, SIZE, WCAP_TA, and ROA; two were found to be statistically significant in logit (ROA, TL_TA) and three were statistically significant in probit (ROA, TL_TA, SIZE).

Employing a Markov-regime-switching approach also allows to predict the out-of-sample crisis. The {{answer to the question of}} which method made the run in forecasting the June 2006 currency crisis is: the Markovswitching approach, since it called most of the pre-crisis periods correctly. However, the “victory” is not straightforward. In-sample, the probit models perform remarkably well and it is also able to detect, at least to some extent, out-of-sample currency crises before their occurrence.

40|$|The use of {{multiple}} risk management tools {{at the same time}} is a common practice among the farming communities around the world. However, most of the previous studies ignored the correlation among the risk management adoption decisions and the potential for simultaneous adoption of the risk management tools. This study is therefore, designed to investigate the impact of farm and farm household characteristics, farmer's perceptions of catastrophic risk sources and farmer's attitude towards risk on their decisions to adopt diversification and precautionary savings to manage farm risk keeping in view the possible correlation between the risk management adoption decisions using a bivariate and multinomial probit models. 330 respondents are randomly selected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan using a multistage sampling technique. The results confirmed the correlation between the risk management adoption decisions and revealed that adoption of one risk management tool may make it more likely to adopt the other risk management tool at the same time. Moreover, the results also highlighted the role of age and education of the household head, monthly household income, land ownership status and risk averse nature of the farmers on the decisions to adopt diversification and precautionary savings to manage farm risks. The use of both bivariate and multinomial <b>probit</b> <b>approaches</b> provides richer interpretations, better inferences, and more information that may further improve understanding of the risk management decisions of farmers and will help policy maker to better anticipate which farmer will adopt government support risk management tool in the presence of traditional risk management tools.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide additional empirical evidence of what explains respondent uncertainty in contingent valuation (CV) and how this in turn affects stated willingness to pay (WTP). Air travelers asked to pay a carbon travel tax to offset carbon emissions from flying were asked how likely it is that they will actually pay if the tax is voluntary. When changing the market compliance imperative from a mandatory carbon tax to a voluntary contribution, a third of all air travelers consider it unlikely they will actually pay their stated WTP amount. An ordered <b>probit</b> estimation <b>approach</b> is applied to identify the sources of respondent uncertainty. Besides the bid price, respondent sense of responsibility and belief in the effectiveness of the voluntary carbon market are among the main reasons for the experienced uncertainty. © 2008 Elsevier B.

Additionally, {{it is important to consider}} that only companies with R&D activities have the option to capitalize. Therefore, we restrict our subsample to companies with R&D activities in the adoption year, and we employ our <b>probit</b> regression <b>approach</b> for this sample of voluntary and mandatory adopters in the adoption year, based on Eq. (9). Then, we estimate propensity scores, which reflect the probability of capitalizing R&D costs.

We explore the extent to which economic and social factors influence the psychological well-being of individuals and their perceptions of the social support that they receive, using Health Survey for England data. We employ a random-effects ordered <b>probit</b> modelling <b>approach</b> and find that unobserved intrahousehold characteristics help to explain the variation in our dependent variables, particularly for co-resident females. Our results indicate that individuals with acute and chronic physical illness, who are female, unemployed or inactive in the labour market and who live in poor households or areas of multiple deprivation report lower levels of psychological well-being. Reduced perceptions of social support are associated with being male, single or post marriage, from an ethnic minority, having low educational attainment and living in a poor household, but are not statistically related to area deprivation measures.
