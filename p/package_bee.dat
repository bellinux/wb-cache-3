He sold durable cypress hives and woodware originally built in Louisiana then later at his factory in Kentucky. He created or greatly improved upon ventilated bee gloves (1938), wired foundation (1939), bee blowers (1969), and plastic bottom boards (1975). Kelley's business included a 100 acre farm in Cade, Louisiana where his queen and <b>package</b> <b>bee</b> operation grew to 1500 colonies. He sold queens and replacement bees throughout North America. After 85 years the company is still providing beekeeping supplies today.|$|E
40|$|Fatty {{acid esters}} {{extractable}} {{from the surface}} of honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), larvae, called brood pheromone, significantly increase rate of colony growth {{in the spring and summer}} when flowering plant pollen is available in the foraging environment. Increased colony growth rate occurs as a consequence of increased pollen intake through mechanisms such as increasing number of pollen foragers and pollen load weights returned. Here, we tested the hypothesis that addition of brood pheromone during the winter pollen dearth period of a humid subtropical climate increases rate of colony growth in colonies provisioned with a protein supplement. Experiments were conducted in late winter (9 February– 9 March 2004) and mid-winter (19 January– 8 February 2005). In both years, increased brood area, number of bees, and amount of protein supplement consumption were significantly greater in colonies receiving daily treatments of brood pheromone versus control colonies. Amount of extractable protein from hypopharyngeal glands measured in 2005 was significantly greater in bees from pheromone-treated colonies. These results suggest that brood pheromone may be used as a tool to stimulate colony growth in the southern subtropical areas of the United States where the <b>package</b> <b>bee</b> industry is centered and a large proportion of migratory colonies are overwintered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Numerous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} using oxalic acid (OA) to control Varroa mites in honey bee colonies. In contrast, techniques for treating package bees with OA {{have not been}} investigated. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a protocol for using OA to reduce mite infestation in package bees. We made 97 mini packages of Varroa-infested adult bees. Each package contained 1, 613 ± 18 bees and 92 ± 3 mites, and represented an experimental unit. We prepared a 2. 8 % solution of OA by mixing 35 g OA with 1 l of sugar water (sugar:water = 1 : 1; w:w). Eight treatments were assigned to the packages based on previous laboratory bioassays that characterized the acute contact toxicity of OA to mites and bees. We administered the treatments by spraying the OA solution directly on the bees through the mesh screen cage using a pressurized air brush and quantified mite and bee mortality over a 10 -day period. Our results support applying an optimum volume of 3. 0 ml of a 2. 8 % OA solution per 1, 000 bees to packages for effective mite control with minimal adult bee mortality. The outcome of our research provides beekeepers and <b>package</b> <b>bee</b> shippers guidance for using OA to reduce mite populations in package bees...|$|E

50|$|New Zealand had 2,602 beekeepers {{at the end}} of 2007, {{who owned}} 313,399 hives. Total honey {{production}} was 9700 tonnes. Pollen, beeswax, and propolis are also produced.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many European and North American {{countries}} have reported {{a high rate of}} disorders (mortality, dwindling and disappearance) affecting honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera). Although beekeeping has become an increasingly professional activity in recent years, the beekeeping industry remains poorly documented in Europe. The European Union Reference Laboratory for Honeybee Health sent a detailed questionnaire to each Member State, in addition to Kosovo and Norway, to determine the demographics and state of their beekeeping industries. Based on data supplied by the National Reference Laboratory for honeybee diseases in each European country, a European database was created to describe the beekeeping industry including the number and types of beekeepers, operation size, industry production, and health (notifiable diseases, mortalities). The total number of beekeepers in Europe was estimated at 620, 000. European honey production was evaluated at around 220, 000 tons in 2010. The price of honey varied from 1. 5 to 40 €/kg depending on the country and on the distribution network. The estimated colony winter mortality varied from 7 to 28 % depending on the country and the origin of the data (institutional survey or beekeeping associations). This survey documents the high heterogeneity of the apicultural industry within the European Union. The high proportion of non-professional beekeepers and the small mean number of colonies per beekeeper were the only common characteristics at European level. The tremendous variation in European apicultural industries has implication for any comprehensive epidemiological or economic analysis of the industry. This variability needs {{to be taken into account}} for such analysis as well as for future policy development. The industry would be served if beekeeping registration was uniformly implemented across member states. Better information on the <b>package</b> <b>bee</b> and queen production would help in understanding the ability of the industry to replace lost honey bee stocks...|$|E

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{strategies for}} reducing Varroa mite populations (Varroa destructor) in honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera) using oxalic acid (OA). I examined {{the efficacy of}} OA in both broodless colonies and colonies that contain brood. My data indicate that OA is most effective at reducing Varroa populations when colonies are broodless because repeated applications of OA did not significantly reduce mite populations in colonies when brood was present. Next, I quantified the contact toxicity of OA to Varroa mites and their honey bee hosts in laboratory bioassays. The results indicate that OA has a low acute toxicity to honey bees and a high acute toxicity to mites. The toxicity data will help guide scientists in delivering lethal dosages of OA to the parasite and in protecting its host. ^ I also investigated how OA is distributed in honey bee colonies when applied using the trickle method. For this study, I constructed nine divided Langstroth hives using 3 different types of dividers that allowed trophallaxis, physical contact, or fumigation. I treated bees {{on one side of}} the divider and then monitored mite mortality on both the treated and untreated sides. Bee-to-bee contact was the primary route for OA distribution. Finally, I developed a protocol for using OA to eliminate mites from <b>package</b> <b>bees.</b> I made 97 packages of Varroa-infested adult bees. I sprayed an OA solution directly on the bees through the mesh screen of the package cages using a pressurized air brush. I quantified mite and bee mortality and estimated the optimum dosage of OA to apply to <b>package</b> <b>bees</b> for mite control without injuring bees. The application of 3 mL of a 2. 8 % OA sugar water solution per 1000 bees will allow beekeepers to safely reduce populations of Varroa mites from packages prior to installation. My research is significant because it offers beekeepers a safe, effective, and sustainable method for reducing Varroa populations. ...|$|R

40|$|Beekeeping is a {{livelihood}} improvement {{potential that}} {{is yet to}} be fully utilized in most rural areas of Tanzania. Majority of rural communities practice beekeeping mainly for domestic consumption and rarely for commercial purposes. This potential (beekeeping) has failed to improve beekeepers’ income due to inadequate knowledge and skills among the beekeepers in processing bee products. As a result, honey produced in rural areas does not meet minimum standards required at national and international market. However the challenges in bee products presentation and market issues, beekeeping has remain among the common interventions practiced in rural areas because it is easier to manage compared to other activities like farming or livestock keeping which require some big initial and management cost. Hence, through capacity building, beekeepers can develop the necessary attitude, knowledge and skills for improving bee products as an economic enterprise. After community needs assessment which involved Solya ward beekeepers and non-beekeepers in the area, the study on designing and implementing a project for improving capacity of beekeeping group in processing and <b>packaging</b> of <b>bee</b> products was prioritized. The target group has 40 members and it is located at Solya ward, Manyoni district in Singida region. The overall objective for establishing the project is to establish a reliable source of income generation to beekeepers through improving the quality of bee products. In achieving this objective, capacity building on bee products harvesting, extraction, processing and packaging, marketing and group management have been emphasized.

40|$|Graduation date: 1939 This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} of the major bee diseases found in Oregon with notes on minor ailments of bees and on diseases not yet present followed by a history of the introduction and spread of the more important diseases, a history of bee legislation in Oregon and {{a discussion of}} the distribution and occurrence of American foulbrood and European foulbrood in Oregon as shown by inspection reports of the state apiary inspector for 1935, 1937 and 1938. A bibliography of 39 titles is included. Chapter I. American foulbrood is the most serious disease of bees. It is an infectious disease of the later larval stages and pupal stage caused by Bacillus larvae. The disease is practically always fatal to the colonies contracting it, no race of bees is resistant to it, it is spread largely by beekeepers in manipulating their bees, can be spread in <b>package</b> <b>bees</b> and in commercial honey although neither are important factors {{and it is difficult to}} control except by burning diseased colonies as soon as they are found. Some work is being done on breeding resistant stock and this work has some prospect of being successful since a method of controlling the mating of the queen has been discovered. Chapter II. European foulbrood is an infectious disease of bees attacking the brood of bees in the earlier larval stages while the sugar content of the digestive tract is still relatively high. It is caused by Bacillus alvei, a germ that assumes quite variable morphological forms during its development. Italian, Caucasian and Carniolan bees are usually resistant taken as colonies and not as individuals. The disease may be spread in honey and pollen and on equipment. It may be controlled by strengthening infected colonies and requeening with queens of resistant stock. Chapter III. Sac brood is an infectious disease caused by a filterable virus which does not live long in honey, pollen nor in dead larvae. Its principal damage is in weakening colonies and its seriousness is not usually realized because most of the dead larvae are removed by the bees. Nosema-disease and paralysis are diseases of adult bees, both of them are present in Oregon but are of little importance. Dissentery of bees in winter and early spring is due to stores with too high a water content. Parafoulbrood is not present in Oregon. Isle of Wight disease, caused by a mite in the trachea, is not present in North America. Septicemia and fungus diseases of bees are of little importance. Chapter IV. Instructions are given for methods of diagnosing the common bee diseases in the apiary with a chart listing symptoms of the common diseases. Chapter V. Bee diseases have been known since before the Christian era but it was not until 1903 that the different types of brood diseases were separated and their causative organisms isolated. It is not known just when or how American foulbrood was brought to Oregon but it was present in Malheur county in 1907 and was found in nearly all parts of the state by 1920. It is now present in every county in the state. There was a virulent type of European foulbrood in Clatsop county in 1908 and the disease was common in western Oregon by 1920. At present it is decreasing in importance and is seldom found in central and eastern Oregon. Sac brood is found all over the state but is generally confused with poisoning. Spray poisoning is serious only in Jackson, Hood River and Wasco counties. The first inspection law was passed in 1905, the next in 1917, another in 1920 and the present law in 1933. The first three were ineffective. Chapter VI. The present distribution of bee diseases is given by counties for 1935, 1937 and 1938 as shown by inspection records...|$|R
