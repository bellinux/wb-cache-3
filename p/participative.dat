25|$|India {{has often}} been {{described}} as a noisy democracy with incessant and rumbustious activism. The ever-growing availability of internet access, <b>participative</b> social-media journalism, a myriad of radio & television stations and massive print media has led to a culture where political debate has {{become an integral part of}} Indian society. Indians, while conscious of their colonial past as subjects of the Mughal Empire and European powers thereafter, are rapidly discarding contemporary ideas about India's place in the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the district, under {{superintendent}} Frank Petruzielo, massively rezoned Houston schools, moving {{students from}} overcrowded ones to underutilized ones. Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD {{school board member}} and author of Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston, wrote that Petruzielo accomplished this goal {{with a minimum of}} press coverage and controversy by using a <b>participative</b> process that minimized conflict between various Houston neighborhoods. McAdams credits the move with being the catalyst for the 1995 establishment of 11 geographic districts patterned around high school feeder patterns.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{influences}} of public sector reforms, several authors (Kezar and Eckel 2004; Lapworth 2004; Middlehurst 2004) point out that next {{to the concept of}} shared and <b>participative</b> governance a new form of governance has emerged, i.e. the notion of corporate governance of institutions, that has increasingly become a more dominant approach to tertiary management. According to Lapworth, the rise of the notion of corporate governance and the decline of the shared or consensual governance can be seen to be a result of the decline in academic participation, a growing tendency towards managerialism and the new environment where the universities are operating.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} the {{indigenous}} groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized, isolated or minimally <b>participative</b> one, in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence {{and participate in the}} external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and land rights.|$|E
25|$|Trick-or-treating {{typically}} happens between 5:30pm and 9:30pm on October 31, {{although some}} municipalities choose other dates. Homeowners wishing {{to participate in}} it sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch, others might be more <b>participative</b> and would even ask an effort from the children {{in order to provide}} them with candy. In more recent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighbourhood being visited by children, including senior residences and condominiums. Although people decorate their homes for Halloween, when homes would like to participate in handing out candy, a porch light is usually left on to signify that a home is handing out candy.|$|E
25|$|The police mutiny {{broke out}} when the RIC were ordered to play a more <b>participative</b> role during their routine escort of {{traction}} engines driven by blackleg carters through the city. Blackleg carters had been recruited to drive the traction engines that {{had been sent to}} Belfast to deliver the goods which had been unable to leave the port due to the striking carters. The traction engines, equipped with makeshift armour, were almost always blocked en route by flying pickets. The RIC were enlisted to provide an escort for the blackleg carters, who constantly came under attack. In one incident in East Belfast, a crowd of shipyard workers threw a telegraph pole at a blackleg carter and his traction engine. The merchandise he had been transporting ended up in the nearby Connswater River.|$|E
25|$|The {{institutional}} framework for {{water resources management}} at national and river basin level is fragmented. The newly created National Water Authority (Autoridad Nacional del Agua – ANA) was established on December 2006 replacing the Water Resources Intendancy (Intendencia de Recursos Hídricos – IRH) and {{is responsible for the}} design and implementation of sustainable water resources policies and irrigation nationally. The creation of ANA improves the prospects for sound WRM, because it has a clear mandate for integrated, <b>participative,</b> basin-scale WRM, enjoys financial and administrative autonomy, is able to issue sanctions and will have local offices in river basins. Some of the modifications included are (i) ANA is the new water authority, however, it is still under the Ministry of Agriculture, which could hinder the impartiality required for sound WRM; (ii) ANA will have River Basin Authorities (Autoridades Administrativas del Agua—AAA), in each of Peru's 14 hydrographic regions and Local Water Authorities (Autoridades Locales de Agua—ALA) in selected river basins; and (iii) ANA is now also responsible for water quality.|$|E
25|$|Engagement {{in social}} media {{for the purpose of}} a social media {{strategy}} is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content (digital photos, digital videos, text) and conversations, as well as the sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging Traditional media such as TV news shows are limited to one-way interaction with customers or 'push and tell' where only specific information is given to the customer with few or limited mechanisms to obtain customer feedback. Traditional media such as paper newspapers, of course, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor, but this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is <b>participative</b> and open, as participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer (or citizen).|$|E
500|$|Within the Labour Party, Livingstone {{was aligned}} with the hard left. Historian Alwyn W. Turner noted that Livingstone's entire {{approach}} to politics revolved not simply around providing public services, but in trying to change society itself; in his words, {{he wanted to get}} away from the concept of [...] "old white men coming along to general management committees and talking about rubbish collection." [...] Biographer John Carvel, a journalist from The Guardian, remarked that Livingstone's political motivation was a [...] "fundamental desire... for a more <b>participative,</b> cooperative society", leading him to oppose [...] "concentrations of power and... exploitation in all its forms – economic, racial and sexual." [...] However, Livingstone has also described his approach to fiscal policy as [...] "monetarist": [...] "I was a monetarist right from the beginning when I was leader of the GLC. We paid down debt every year. We had an absolutely firm rule." ...|$|E

Blondie's video cassette Eat to the Beat accompanied their 1979 album of the same title. The First National Kidisc, {{one of the first}} interactive and educational videodiscs, contained activities designed for children. Without [...] "fancy digital effects", Green's Kidisc provided five to ten hours of interactive capability within a 30-minute video through the use of dual audio tracks, freeze framing, slow motion, and other techniques.

2500|$|Bishop Untener's {{career was}} marked by a {{consistent}} focus on egalitarianism in the church, ministry {{to the poor and}} <b>participative</b> liturgy. [...] His liberal views often put him at odds with orthodox Catholics and with the Vatican. He was regarded as being sensitive to the viewpoints of liberal Catholics. His overall view was that one should keep an open mind, consider the logic of one's actions and how they affect the church, and reflect openly over controversial issues. He frequently derided the Vatican for avoiding debate on real issues that potentially harmed the entire church.|$|E

The durability and universal acceptance {{is a result of the}} process through which they came into being in the form they have. Rather than an effort to arrive at agreement, it was an attempt to answer the question of what did they have in common, over the past 100 years, those operations and organisational units that were successful? As a result, the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent were not revealed, but found - through a deliberate and [...] <b>participative</b> process of discovery.|$|E
2500|$|The third WSF {{was again}} held in Porto Alegre, in January 2003.

[...] Among the speakers was American linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky. Some credit this meeting of World Social Forum for the connections that made the global day of action on February 15, 2003 so successful. The global day of action was an international protest attended by an estimated 12 million people in 700 cities across 60 countries protesting the Bush Administration's plans to invade and occupy Iraq. At the time, the New York Times called international public opinion, a superpower to counter the United States.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that the majority of scholarly research done on these topics have been from North America. Words like [...] "leadership" [...] and [...] "entrepreneurship" [...] do not always translate well into other cultures and languages. For example, in North America, a leader is often thought to be charismatic, but German culture frowns on such charisma due to the charisma of Adolph Hitler. Other cultures, like some Europeans, view the term [...] "leader" [...] negatively, like the French. The <b>participative</b> leadership style that is encouraged in the United States is considered disrespectful in many other parts of the world due to the differences in power distance. Many Asian and Middle Eastern countries do not have [...] "open door" [...] policies and would never informally approach their managers/bosses. For countries like that, an authoritarian approach to management and leadership works best, as is custom.|$|E
2500|$|This {{approach}} earned {{praise from}} two influential intellectual {{figures of the}} Romanian diaspora, critics Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, whose letter to the author read: [...] "the distances you take from your own background are of most-rare authenticity and tact. You accomplish a radical break, being {{at the same time}} <b>participative,</b> negating things only after you have understood them, being dissociated from both roles of judge and defense counsel." [...] Cioroianu also notes: [...] "He is not the only son of (relatively) well-known communists; but {{he is one of the}} few to have reached the level of detachment needed in order to X-ray, in a cold and precise way, a political system. Does this seem easy to you? I do not know how many of us would be capable of introspecting with such lucidity our own parents' utopias, phantasms and disappointments". The historian opposes Tismăneanu's approach to that of Petre Roman, Romania-s first post-1989 Premier, whose attempts at discussing the public image of his father, the communist politico Valter Roman, are argued by Cioroianu to have [...] "failed".|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{assigned}} an unimportant role to King Michael, Antonescu {{took steps}} to increase the monarchy's prestige, personally inviting Carol's estranged wife, Queen Mother Helen, to return home. However, his preferred military structures functioned in cooperation with a bureaucracy inherited from the National Renaissance Front. According to historian of fascism Philip Morgan: [...] "Antonescu probably wanted to create, or perpetuate, something like Carol's front organization." [...] Much of his permanent support base comprised former National Christian Party members, {{to the point where}} he was seen as successor to Octavian Goga. While maintaining a decorative replacement for Parliament—known as Adunarea Obștească Plebiscitară a Națiunii Române ("The General Plebiscitary Assembly of the Romanian Nation") and convoked only twice— he took charge of hierarchical appointments, and personally drafted new administrative projects. In 1941, he disestablished <b>participative</b> government in localities and counties, replacing it with a corporatist structure appointed by prefects whom he named. In stages between August and October 1941, he instituted civilian administration of Transnistria under Governor Gheorghe Alexianu, whose status he made equivalent to that of a cabinet minister. Similar measures were taken in Bukovina and Bessarabia (under Governors Corneliu Calotescu and Gheorghe Voiculescu, respectively). Antonescu strictly relied on the chain of command, and his direct orders to the Army overrode civilian hierarchies. This system allowed room for endemic political corruption and administrative confusion. The Romanian leader also tolerated a gradual loss of authority over the German communities in Romania, in particular the Transylvanian Saxon and Banat Swabian groups, in agreement with Hitler's views on the Volksdeutsche. This trend was initiated by Saxon Nazi activist Andreas Schmidt in cooperation with the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle, resulting in de facto self-governance under a Nazi system which was also replicated among the 130,000 Black Sea Germans of Transnistria. Many young German Romanian men opted to join the Schutzstaffel as early as 1940 and, in 1943, an accord between Antonescu and Hitler automatically sent ethnic Germans of recruitable age into the Wehrmacht.|$|E
2500|$|The Mufti opposed all {{immigration}} of Jews into Palestine, {{and during the}} war he campaigned against the transfer of Jewish refugees to Palestine. No evidence has been forthcoming to show he was opposed to transferring Jews to countries outside the Middle East. The Mufti’s numerous letters appealing to various governmental authorities to prevent Jewish refugees from emigrating to Palestine have been republished and widely cited as documentary evidence of his <b>participative</b> support for the Nazi genocide. For instance, Husseini intervened on 13 May 1943, before the meeting with Himmler when he was informed of the Holocaust, with the German Foreign Office to block possible transfers of Jews from Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania to Palestine, after reports reached him that 4,000 Jewish children accompanied by 500 adults had managed to reach Palestine. He asked that the Foreign Minister [...] "to do his utmost" [...] to block all such proposals and this request was complied with. According to Idith Zertal, none of the documents presented at Eichmann's trial prove {{that it was the}} Mufti's interference, in these 'acts of total evil,' that prevented the children's rescue. [...] In June 1943 the Mufti recommended to the Hungarian minister {{that it would be better}} to send Jews in Hungary to concentration camps in Poland rather than let them find asylum in Palestine. [...] A year later, on 25 July 1944 [...] he wrote to the Hungarian foreign minister to register his objection to the release of certificates for 900 Jewish children and 100 adults for transfer from Hungary, fearing they might end up in Palestine. He suggested that if such transfers of population were deemed necessary, then:I ask your Excellency to permit me to draw your attention to the necessity of preventing the Jews from leaving your country for Palestine, and if there are reasons which make their removal necessary, it would be indispensable and infinitely preferable to send them to other countries where they would find themselves under active control, for example, in Poland, thus avoiding danger and preventing damage." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{too much}} the custom, perhaps, to regard as a special advance, that unavoidable, and merely <b>participative</b> progress, which any one class makes in sharing the general {{movement}} of the race. Thus, because the sailor, who to-day steers the Hibernia or Unicorn steam-ship across the Atlantic, is a somewhat different man from the exaggerated sailors of Smollett, {{and the men who}} fought with Nelson at Copenhagen, and survived to riot themselves away at North Corner in Plymouth;--because the modern tar is not quite so gross as heretofore, and has shaken off some of his shaggy jackets, and docked his Lord Rodney queue:--therefore, in the estimation of some observers, he has begun to see the evils of his condition, and has voluntarily improved. But upon a closer scrutiny, it will be seen that he has but drifted along with that great tide, which, perhaps, has two flows for one ebb; he has made no individual advance of his own.|$|E

She was King August's natural daughter; a French {{milliner}} in Warsaw had produced her for him there. In due time, a male of the three hundred and fifty-four, one Rutowski, soldier by profession, whom we shall again hear of, took her for mistress; regardless of natural half-sisterhood, which perhaps he did not know of.
