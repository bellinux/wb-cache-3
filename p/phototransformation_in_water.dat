40|$|International audienceIt {{is shown}} here that {{carbamazepine}} (CBZ) would undergo direct photolysis and reaction with *OH {{as the main}} <b>phototransformation</b> pathways <b>in</b> surface <b>waters.</b> Environmental lifetimes are expected to vary from {{a few weeks to}} several months, and predictions are in good agreement with available field data. Acridine (I) and 10, 11 - dihydro- 10, 11 -trans-dihydroxy-CBZ (V) are the main quantified phototransformation intermediates upon direct photolysis and *OH reaction, respectively. The photochemical yield of mutagenic I from CBZ is in the 3 − 3. 5 % range, and it is similar for both direct photolysis and *OH reaction: it would undergo limited variation with environmental conditions. In contrast, the yield of V would vary in the 4 − 8. 5 % range depending on the conditions, because V is formed from CBZ by *OH (9. 0 % yield) more effectively than upon direct photolysis (1. 4 % yield). Other important photointermediates, mostly formed from CBZ upon *OH reaction, are an aromatic-ringdihydroxylated CBZ (VI) and N,N-bis(2 -carboxyphenyl) urea (VII). Compounds VI and VII are formed by photochemistry and are not reported as human metabolites; thus, they could be used as tracers of CBZ <b>phototransformation</b> <b>in</b> surface <b>waters.</b> Interestingly, VI has recently been detected <b>in</b> river <b>water...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{shows that}} the {{addition}} of phenol and 2 -propanol as model organic compounds significantly decreases the direct photolysis quantum yield of 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) upon UVB irradiation in aqueous solution.

40|$|International audienceTriclosan (5 -chloro- 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenol) is {{a widely}} used {{antimicrobial}} agent that undergoes fairly slow biodegradation. It is often found <b>in</b> surface <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> both the acidic (HTric) and basic (Tric−) forms (pKa ∼ 8), and it can undergo direct photodegradation to produce several intermediates including a dioxin congener (2, 8 -dichlorodibenzodioxin, hereafter 28 DCDD). The latter is formed from Tric− and causes non-negligible environmental concern. Differently from current literature reports, {{in this paper we}} show that the direct photolysis would not be the only important transformation pathway of triclosan <b>in</b> surface <b>waters.</b> This is particularly true for HTric, which could undergo very significant reactions with •OH and, if the laser-derived quenching rate constants of this work are comparable to the actual reaction rate constants, with the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (3 CDOM*).

40|$|Trenbolone acetate (TBA), {{melengestrol}} acetate (MGA) and zeranol are synthetic growth promoters extensively used in animal husbandry, yet despite occurrence <b>in</b> <b>water</b> and soil {{little is known}} about their environmental fate. The work provides some of the first details related to the persistence and mobility of these synthetic growth promoters and their metabolites (SGPM) in natural aquatic systems. Here, laboratory experimental studies explore their tendency to undergo <b>phototransformation</b> <b>in</b> surface <b>waters</b> and their interaction with soil via sorption or mineral-promoted reactions. <b>In</b> sunlit surface <b>waters,</b> results suggest that the families of TBA (including 172 ̆ 6 beta-trenbolone, 172 ̆ 6 alpha-trenbolone and trendione) and MGA (including melengestrol) will readily undergo direct photolysis. They exhibit half-lives between 0. 25 - 1 h in both natural and simulated sunlight that were largely insensitive to environmental variables (e. g., temperature, pH and cosolutes). In contrast, zeranol, 2 ̆ 6 beta-zearalanol and zearalanone only degrade via indirect photolysis pathways mediated by dissolved organic matter. Their transformation is attributable primarily to hydroxyl radical and triplet DOM at neutral pH values, whereas the contribution of singlet oxygen becomes greater <b>in</b> more alkaline <b>waters.</b> An observed pH-dependence for rates of indirect photolysis suggests these photooxidants react primarily with the monodeprotonated form of zeranol, as well as its metabolites. Given their high rates of direct phototransformation, close attention was paid to elucidating the photoproducts for the TBA family. Generally, all metabolites of TBA photodegrade primarily to a species hydroxylated at the C 12 position of the steroid ring. While this 12 -hydroxy trenbolone species is photostable, it can hydrolyzes to di- and tri-hydroxy products. Most notably, however, it is also prone to dehydration, which results in the regeneration of the TBA metabolite from which it was derived. This dehydration pathway can be acid- and base-catalyzed, but it also occurs to an appreciable extent at neutral pH. It is also temperature dependent, with greatest rates of parent metabolite regeneration at higher temperature. Consequently, the rapid rate of photolysis for TBA metabolites observed in daylight is followed by photoproduct-to-parent reversion mechanism in the dark. This phenomenon has broad and important implications for the fate of TBA metabolites <b>in</b> surface <b>waters.</b> Generally, they will be far more persistent than currently realized, and their concentration will exhibit, pH, diurnal and seasonal dependencies. In soil systems, all SGPMs exhibit a high affinity for organic rich soil (e. g., peat), consistent with an important role for hydrophobic interactions in governing their uptake. However, the extent and reversibility of sorption in such systems is not predictable from common metrics for compound hydrophobicity (e. g., octanol-water partitioning coefficients), suggesting that specific chemical interactions also influence uptake.

Two types of photoactivation are currently being distinguished, reversible photoswitching between fluorescent and nonfluorescent forms and irreversible photoconversion. Here, we have combined crystallography and (in crystallo) spectroscopy to characterize the Phe- 173 -Ser mutant of the tetrameric variant of EosFP, named IrisFP, which incorporates both types of <b>phototransformations.</b> <b>In</b> its green fluorescent state, IrisFP displays reversible photoswitching, which involves cis–trans isomerization of the chromophore. Like its parent protein EosFP, IrisFP also photoconverts irreversibly to a red-emitting state under violet light because of an extension of the conjugated ?-electron system of the chromophore, accompanied by a cleavage of the polypeptide backbone. The red form of IrisFP exhibits a second reversible photoswitching process, which may also involve cis–trans isomerization of the chromophore. Therefore, IrisFP displays altogether 3 distinct photoactivation processes.

40|$|International audienceThe photoreactivity of {{chlorothalonil}} was {{studied by}} means of steady-state irradiation and laser-flash photolysis. Experiments were conducted <b>in</b> <b>water</b> containing acetonitrile as a co-solvent. This fungicide undergoes very slow <b>phototransformation</b> <b>in</b> the first stages of the reaction, but the consumption profile is auto-accelerated. To understand the reaction mechanism, we undertook a detailed study of the rates, products and transient species. The rates and photoproduct distribution vary greatly with the oxygen concentration. Concerning the transient species, we measured the absorption of the triplet, its yield of formation, and its reactivity with oxygen in various water–acetonitrile mixtures and with isopropanol. The reduced radical, CTH˙, could be produced and its transient spectrum was recorded. Combining all the experimental data, it is hypothesized {{that in the first}} step of the reaction CT is excited to the triplet state. The triplet has several possible fates including reduction by organic constituents to form the radical which gives photoproducts. Another characteristic of the CT triplet is its capacity to generate singlet oxygen. The production of this species was measured by phosphorescence and compared to the percentage of the triplet trapped by oxygen in air-saturated solutions. The yield varies from 0. 88 in pure acetonitrile to 0. 48 in water–acetonitrile (95 : 5, v/v).

A non-photoactive Pchlide form with an emission maximum at 650 nm was transiently detected in leaves during regeneration of a photoactive Pchlide form with an emission maximum at 654 nm. Gaussian deconvolution of fluorescence spectra of isolated membranes showed that this 650 nm form appeared in conditions of excess NADP(+), as suggested in previous studies.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of pharmaceuticals {{has increased in}} the last few decades. After usage, pharmaceuticals are excreted via urine and feces and transported to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) where they are subjected to treatment processes, and finally discharged into rivers. In order to assess aquatic risk associated with short- and long-term exposure to pharmaceuticals, temporal-spatial variability in the concentrations should be monitored <b>in</b> different <b>water</b> compartments. <b>In</b> this thesis, occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals and other organic pollutants were studied in Swedish and Canadian rivers and WWTPs, and the major sources of contaminations were identified. The ranges of mean concentrations of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), hormones, and pesticides were 2. 4 - 13755 ng L- 1 and 0. 5 - 112 ng L- 1 in treated wastewaters and rivers, respectively. WWTPs and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) were identified as major sources of PPCPs in rivers. However, a large gathering of people at a river shore could temporarily contribute to a high input of pharmaceuticals. A temporal study of mass flows and corresponding removal efficiencies (REs) of WWTP-derived pharmaceuticals showed winter accumulations for most of the compounds. This might reflect high water flow rates and negligible rates of bio- and <b>phototransformation</b> <b>in</b> this season. REs of beta-blockers were season-dependent, with the highest removal in the summer and fall. This was due to biotransformation, indicated by high water temperature and chlorophyll a mass flows during those seasons. Yearly median REs of nutrients were low compared to pharmaceuticals. Yet, REs of atenolol and nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) were related and had similar seasonal trends. Carbamazepine REs were the lowest among the pharmaceuticals. The latter combined with the persistence of carbamazepine in WWTPs and a lake showed its potential as an indicator of cumulative contamination. A correlation between caffeine concentrations and fecal coliforms in rivers confirmed caffeine as an indicator of recent urban fecal contamination. A high caffeine/carbamazepine ratio might be indicative of raw sewage discharge in a river, justified by higher concentrations of caffeine than carbamazepine in raw sewage and negligible removal of carbamazepine in WWTPs. The outcomes of the thesis show that source characteristics, water flow rates, and environmental conditions are essential factors that control detection frequency, concentrations and associated mass flows, and the fate of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments.

A protocol for the uniform labelling and purification of phycocyanobilin (PCB) with 13 C- and/or 15 N has been developed.

In this study we have investigated Pchlide reaccumulation in cotyledons from etiolated wild-type (WT), aurea and yg- 2 seedlings using low-temperature fluorescence spectroscopy. WT cotyledons showed two characteristic Pchlide emission maxima at 630 nm (F 630) and 655 nm (F 655) respectively, while the aurea and yg- 2 mutants contained only phototransformable Pchlide F 655. Following a white-light flash to WT cotyledons, reaccumulation of phototransformable Pchlide F 655 in the first 30 min was absolutely dependent on the presence of Pchlide F 630 before the flash. Reaccumulation of Pchlide F 630 was not apparent until at least 2 h after the <b>phototransformation.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, Pchlide F 630 never accumulated in aurea cotyledons. The relative rates of both Pchlide F 655 and total Pchlide synthesis were approximately twice as high in WT compared to aurea.

In addition, feeding of ALA resulted in a substantial and equal increase of non-phototransformable Pchlide in both WT and aurea indicating that aurea cotyledons are capable of accumulating high levels of Pchlide that is not associated to the active site of NADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductase (POR).
