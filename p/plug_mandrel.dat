50|$|In {{production}} of a product where the bend is not critical a <b>plug</b> <b>mandrel</b> can be used. A form type tapers {{the end of the}} mandrel to provide more support in the bend of the tube. When precise bending is needed a ball mandrel (or ball mandrel with steel cable) should be used. The conjoined ball-like disks are inserted into the tubing to allow for bending while maintaining the same diameter throughout. Other styles include using sand, cerrobend, or frozen water. These allow for a somewhat constant diameter while providing an inexpensive alternative to the aforementioned styles.|$|E

Medical use needs accurate dimensions and a smooth finish {{of the inner}} and outer surfaces. This paper deals with 316 L stainless steel tubes which are manufactured by means of cold drawing with or without inner <b>plug</b> (<b>mandrel</b> drawing and hollow sinking, respectively). To improve the quality of the finish of the tubes, numerical modelling can be used. In this way, a thermomechanical study of the drawing process is proposed to determine experimentally the physical parameters. This study proposes to evaluate the different parameters of the constitutive equations, of the thermal and friction models using specific experimental tests or using an inverse analysis on the drawing process. These parameters are validated by analysing other tube drawings. Finally the importance of physical parameters fit on drawing limits is emphasised, using a Cockcroft-Latham failure criterion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{drawing process}} using {{tools such as}} dies, <b>plugs</b> and <b>mandrels</b> has been {{conventionally}} applied {{as a means of}} miniaturizing tubes. However, {{it is not easy to}} scale down the conventional process to micro sizes for many reasons related to the tools used in the process. It is difficult to fabricate micro tools with high accuracy, and to insert a <b>plug</b> or a <b>mandrel</b> into a fine tube. Thus, the development of new drawing technologies for the fabrication of micro-tubes without the need for tools such as dies, <b>plugs</b> and <b>mandrels</b> is necessary. A laser dieless drawing technique with local heating using a laser as the heating source has been focused on for the fabrication of micro-tubes. In this study, a dieless drawing with a semiconductor laser setup is designed and developed. A tube of stainless steel, SUS 304, with an outer diameter of 0. 52 mm and thickness of 0. 1 mm is used in the experiments. A laser dieless drawing experiment is carried out to investigate the effect of the laser power and drawing speed on the drawing limit. Finally, the effectiveness of laser dieless drawing process is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Tethered plug drawing, {{also known}} as {{semi-floating}} mandrel drawing, is a mix between floating plug drawing and fixed <b>plug</b> drawing. The <b>mandrel</b> is allowed to float, but it still anchored via a tether. This process gives similar results to the floating plug process, except that it is designed for straight tubes. It gives a better inner surface finish than rod drawing.|$|R
40|$|Modeling and {{simulation}} of metal forming processes are increasingly in demand {{from the industry}} as the resulting models {{are found to be}} valuable tools considering the optimization of the existing and development of new processes. By the application of modeling and simulation techniques, it is possible {{to reduce the number of}} time-consuming experiments such as prototyping. Seamless tubes of various sizes and shapes are manufactured by various processes like sinking, fixed plug, floating <b>plug,</b> moving <b>mandrel,</b> cold working and hot working. The present work deals with the {{simulation of}} round tubes while passing through the sink pass, using ANSYS software. The simulation results are the displacement and von Mises stresses. The procedure can be used to improve the product quality and to study the effect of various parameters like die angle on the product quality...|$|R
