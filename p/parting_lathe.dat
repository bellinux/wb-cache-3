30|$|As {{a result}} of {{continuous}} changes in business environment and uncertainty of demand and production processes, manufacturing industries are having to develop and evolve rapidly. Therefore, in the future, the production system should be flexible and {{able to respond to}} factor alterations quickly. The system should create high quality products, support small production volumes and meet all needs of customer specifications. Modern production systems consist of high-performance technology and equipment, which increase production capacity. However, at the same time, the system operations become more sophisticated and complex. Manufacturing processes involve inputs from various departments including management, production, finance, marketing, and engineering etc. Hence, the created production system should be able to allow relevant departments to influence the manufacturing operations conveniently and effectively. The production system should consist of the following three components of inputs including manpower, raw materials, machines, energy, money and information; processes including preparation of materials, assembly of all components into various shapes as well as packaging for distribution and outputs including products or outputs in the form of goods or services. Turning is a basic process that is commonly used in various industries. The operation involves rotating the work-piece while moving a cutting tool linearly toward the work-piece to improve the work-piece. Turning can cut or decrease the size of a work-piece by removing external surface with a cutting tool positioned vertically to its rotating axis. Types of turning methods include facing, straight turning, thread turning, boring, necking and <b>parting.</b> <b>Lathe</b> machines can be classified as manually controlled or automatically controlled.|$|E
