5|$|Harmon was {{preceded by}} his two older brothers, Kenneth B. Harmon, {{of the class of}} 1910, and Millard F. Harmon, Jr., of the class of 1912. Hubert Harmon was ejected when it was {{discovered}} that he had two brothers at West <b>Point,</b> <b>as</b> it was felt that the taxpayers would not be getting their money's worth educating three sons of the same family. He was readmitted in June 1911 after his father lobbied numerous government officials. He now only had one brother at West <b>Point,</b> <b>as</b> Kenneth had graduated the year before. Both Millard Jr., and Hubert subsequently became three-star generals.|$|E
5|$|The road existed {{prior to}} this <b>point</b> <b>as</b> a {{northern}} development road. However, on April1, 1937, the DND merged into the DHO. As a result, numerous highways were assumed in the northern regions of Ontario in mid-1937.|$|E
5|$|ALP's Letter {{becomes the}} focal <b>point</b> <b>as</b> it is {{analysed}} {{in detail in}} I.5. This letter was dictated by ALP to her son Shem, a writer, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a postman, for delivery. The letter never reaches its intended destination, ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. Chapter I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail, {{in the form of}} twelve riddles and answers.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this <b>point,</b> <b>as</b> Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E
5|$|After the {{elections}} in 1864 the state's Republican legislative majority arrived at a critical turning <b>point,</b> <b>as</b> the North was slowly tightening its blockade of the South. The new Republican-controlled legislature fully supported Morton's policies and worked to meet the state's commitments to the war effort. In 1865 the Indiana General Assembly validated the loans Morton had secured to run the state government, assumed them as state debt, and commended Morton for his actions during the interim.|$|E
5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that <b>point</b> <b>as</b> early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E

5|$|For a {{brief period}} Orkney emerged from {{prehistory}} and into protohistory. The Greek explorer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his On the Ocean he refers to the most northerly <b>point</b> <b>as</b> Orcas, conceivably a reference to Orkney.|$|E
5|$|Halotus died {{close to}} the end of the century, his public {{reputation}} somewhat restored after his rise in stature and wealth. His date of death is not mentioned by ancient historians of the time, such as Tacitus or Suetonius, who were also some of the main recorders of the events around Claudius' death and the political trauma that followed. Whether Halotus was involved in the murder of Claudius and to what extent remains an unresolved <b>point,</b> <b>as</b> do many other aspects related to Claudius' passing.|$|E

Eichelberger transferred back to the infantry in July 1937, although he remained Secretary of the War Department General Staff until October 1938, in the rank of colonel from 1 August.|$|E
5|$|It {{consists}} of three buildings, namely the station itself, the operation center on the northeast side, and the parking tower on the southwest side.

5|$|Returning to the United States {{after the}} war, Olds was {{assigned}} at West <b>Point</b> <b>as</b> an assistant football coach for Red Blaik. Apparently resented by {{many on the}} staff for his rapid rise in rank and plethora of combat decorations, Olds transferred in February 1946 to the 412th Fighter Group at March Field, California, to fly the P-80 Shooting Star, which began a career-long professional struggle with superiors he viewed as more promotion- than warrior-minded.|$|E
5|$|The Lal Masjid siege gave hardliners in Pakistan a {{rallying}} <b>point,</b> <b>as</b> well as generating new martyrs (i.e. volunteers {{to commit suicide}} bombings) and prompting al-Qaeda, Jaish-e-Muhammad, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and the Taliban to launch retaliation attacks in Pakistan.

5000|$|The [...] "Duke of York's Men" [...] can {{be argued}} to fetch 20,000 points, by {{reference}} to the nursery rhyme, but can also be argued to score only four <b>points</b> <b>as</b> the name does not specify how many men. Similarly, [...] "The Beehive" [...] could be argued to equal 60000 <b>points,</b> <b>as</b> there {{would be at least}} 10,000 bees in a beehive; conversely it could be argued to gain twelve <b>points</b> <b>as</b> the number of bees are not specified. It could also be argued that the beehive is the hive itself and therefore scores no points.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it to Osama bin Laden in 1996. At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were {{in a period of}} transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning <b>point,</b> <b>as</b> bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E
5|$|Toshack had a {{moderately}} successful Third Test, in which England elected to bat first. England lost two early wickets, and when Toshack came on, Jack Crapp repeatedly defended {{a sequence of}} deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly <b>point.</b> <b>As</b> the hosts were in trouble, they played cautiously and Toshack's first five overs were all maidens. Crapp then hit Toshack to Sid Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs.|$|E
