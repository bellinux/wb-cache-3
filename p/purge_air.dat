Although the engines require high gas temperature at turbine entry for good performance efficiency, the ingested gas shortens the lives of the cavity internals, particularly that of the rotor disks. Steps such as installing seals at the disk rims and injecting purge (secondary) air bled from the compressor discharge into the cavities are implemented to reduce the gas ingestion.

40|$|Secondary air, {{known as}} <b>purge</b> <b>air,</b> is {{injected}} through seals in the hub and shroud of axial turbines to prevent hot gas ingestion into the endwall cavities. An {{investigation into the}} interaction of purge ow with turbine main ow has been undertaken, to determine where losses are generated, how they are generated, {{and what are the}} most eective ways for reducing them. The eect of purge ow design on the system's susceptibility to ingestion was also studied. Tools developed for accomplishing these objectives include: a consistent framework for isolating entropy generated due to viscous effects, a procedure for factoring out individual loss categories, and a linear model for secondary air ow response to the main flow pressure field. These tools, applied to steady computations, elucidate four routes through which change in loss generation is brought about by <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> injection: a shear layer between purge and main streams, modification of the secondary ow through the blade passage, an increase in degree of reaction, and the potential for reducing tip clearance ow (for the case of purge ow injected from the shroud). It was further determined that <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> mass ow and swirl velocity are eective parameters for mitigating loss, with a potential for 70 % reduction in purge ow losses. By contrast, purge slot axial inclination and gap width do not affect the loss characteristics of purge ow by more than 6 %. The benet of pre-swirling purge ow can be negated by decreased sealing effectiveness, if ingestion is driven by the pressure non-uniformity associated with the rotor upstream in influence. However for a representative vane-rotor stage, in which the vane-induced circumferential pressure non-uniformity dominates in the intra vane-rotor gap, pre-swirling purge flow can be beneficial to deterring hot gas ingestion. Finally a framework has been formulated for assessing the time-averaged impact of unsteady vane-rotor interaction on purge ow-induced loss generation. Preliminary results suggest that ow unsteadiness can result in substantially higher losses associated with purge flow injection. by Metodi B. Zlatinov. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Maximizing {{the turbine}} entry {{temperature}} (TET) is fundamental to increase engine efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. Nonetheless, safety and reliability requirements have to be fulfilled. The life of gas turbine blades is strictly connected to their temperature through the creep deformation process. For this reason temperature monitoring is an essential requirement. Commonly this is achieved by means of devices such as thermocouples which are placed in the bulk flow. The usefulness of these devices as the means of supplying turbine blade temperature information is limited given their slow response time {{and the fact that}} the blade temperature is inferred from that of the surrounding gas rather than measured directly. This in turn means that critical blades parts (e. g., trailing edge) or the presence of hot spots are not identified in a discrete manner. These drawbacks can be addressed by using instead a radiation pyrometer, which is characterized by a fast response time, high accuracy, and by being contactless. The pyrometer optical front-end is a lens which collects the radiation emitted by a spot on the turbine blades. However, since the lens is exposed to the harsh engine environment, contaminants entrapped by the turbine flow can therefore be easily deposited on the lens thus filtering the radiation and resulting in an under-estimation of the actual blade temperature. The fouling of the lens is generally tackled by using a <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> system that employs air bled from the compressor to divert those particles whose trajectory is directed towards the lens. Currently the employment of optical pyrometry is often confined to military applications due to the fact that their {{turbine entry temperature}}s are higher than in civil applications. Besides, the maintenance schedule established for military engines is far more frequent than what is practiced in airline engines. Therefore, the design of current <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> systems reflects these facts. Before optical pyrometers can be commonly used for civil applications more research is required since some of the fundamentals of the fouling mechanisms remain to be clarified. This is then the knowledge gap the present research sought to fill. Its aim was to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the phenomena that underpins the lens fouling process in order to provide a set of guidelines for optimising the design of <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> systems. The initial part of the research was dedicated to the study of the purge flow inside a given pyrometer configuration. The scope was to identify the main flow structure that determines the fouling process and at the same time to validate the results obtained via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses conducted in a second phase of the research. Given the reduced dimensions of the pyrometer purge system, it was not possible to gain the appropriate optical access to take flow measurements. Consequently, a large scaled experiment was performed, employing the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique for the acquisition of experimental data of the flow field. The distortion of the image and light reflection introduced by the presence of curved glass surfaces was investigated by means of a feasibility experiment. The experimental study highlighted the presence of a large recirculation zone that can trap contaminants and direct them towards the pyrometer lens. The experimental data were in agreement with computational fluid dynamics results obtained by using two different turbulence models. In a second instance, attention was focused on the particle deposition as seen from a fluid dynamics perspective. A computational fluid dynamics analysis aimed at reproducing the flow field of an existing pyrometer purge system enabled the identification of those features that can significantly impact on the lens fouling process. It was found that the geometry of the air curtain configuration plays a fundamental role. However, given the high speeds involved, the main force governing the contaminants deposition is the drag. Additionally, particles with high inertia hit the purge tube wall and then bounce towards the pyrometer lens, while contaminants with low inertia can be trapped by a large recirculation zone and subsequently directed towards the lens. In a third phase of the research, the impacts between the contaminant particles and the lens were investigated through a finite element analysis (FEA) aimed at identifying the most important factors that contribute to the lens fouling process. Particles moving at low speed can be deposited on the lens by means of electrostatic and Van der Waals forces. Conversely, particles with very high velocity can be deposited on the lens through the same mechanisms involved in the cold spraying process, which is a technique commonly used for coating deposition. A local melting can occur at the interface between the lens and the contaminants due to the high stresses created by the asperities and high sliding velocity of the particles. As a result, while large particles bounce back, debris remains bonded to the lens surface. Last but not least, the findings of the several steps of the present research have been brought together in order to produce guidelines to be followed by engineers engaged in the redesign of more efficient pyrometer purge systems...|$|E

The objective of the work was to perform the calculations for the benzene mixing behavior in the vapor space of Tank 48 {{and its impact on the}} local concentration of benzene. The calculations were used to evaluate the degree to which <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> mixes with benzene evolving from the liquid surface and its ability to prevent an unacceptable concentration of benzene from forming. The analysis was focused on changing the tank operating conditions to establish internal recirculation and changing the benzene evolution rate from the liquid surface. The model used a three-dimensional momentum coupled with multi-species transport. The calculations included potential operating conditions for air inlet and exhaust flows, recirculation flow rate, and benzene evolution rate with prototypic tank geometry. The flow conditions are assumed to be fully turbulent since Reynolds numbers for typical operating conditions are in the range of 20, 000 to 70, 000 based on the inlet conditions of the air purge system. A standard two-equation turbulence model was used. The modeling results for the typical gas mixing problems available in the literature were compared and verified through comparisons with the test results. The benchmarking results showed that the predictions are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and literature data. Additional sensitivity calculations included a reduced benzene evolution rate, reduced air inlet and exhaust flow, and forced internal recirculation. The modeling results showed that the vapor space was fairly well mixed and that benzene concentrations were relatively low when forced recirculation and 72 cfm ventilation air through the tank boundary were imposed. For the same 72 cfm air inlet flow but without forced recirculation, the heavier benzene gas was stratified. The results demonstrated that benzene concentrations were relatively low for typical operating configurations and conditions.
