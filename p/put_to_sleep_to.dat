40|$|Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{consist of}} a large number of small and low cost sensor nodes powered by small {{batteries}} and equipped with various sensing devices. Usually, for many applications, once a WSN is deployed, probably in an inhospitable terrain, it is expected to gather the required data for quite some time, say for years. Since each sensor node has limited energy, these nodes are usually <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>to</b> conserve energy, and this helps to prolong the net work lifetime. There are two major approaches to sleep scheduling of sensor nodes, viz. (i) random (ii) synchronized. Any sleep scheduling scheme has to ensure that data can always be routed from source to sink. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for sleep scheduling of sensor nodes using a tree and an energy aware routing protocol which is integrated with the proposed sleep scheduling scheme. The tree is rooted at the sink node. The internal nodes of the tree remain awake and the leaf nodes are made to sleep. This provides an assured path from any node to the sink node. The tree is periodically reconstructed considering the remaining energy of each node with a view to balance energy consumption of nodes, and removes any failed nodes from the tree. The proposed approach also considerably reduces average energy consumption rate of each node as we are able to put more number of nodes to sleep in comparison to other approaches. Additional fault-tolerance is provided by keeping two paths from each node towards the sink. The most important issue that must be solved in designing a data gathering algorithm for wireless sensor networks (WSNS) is how to save sensor node energy while meeting the needs of applications/users. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware routing protocol (EAP) for a long-lived sensor network. EAP achieves a good performance in terms of lifetime by minimizing energy consumption for in-network communications and balancing the energy load among all th...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{academic}} {{developments have}} initiated {{a paradigm shift}} in the way spatial sensor data can be acquired. Traditional localized and regularly arranged sensor arrays are replaced by sensor nodes that are randomly distributed over the entire spatial field, and which {{communicate with each other}} or with a master node through wireless communication links. Together, these nodes form a so-called `wireless sensor network' (WSN). Each node of a WSN has a local sensor array and a signal processing unit to perform computations on the acquired data. The advantage of WSNs compared to traditional (wired) sensor arrays, is that many more sensors can be used that physically cover the full spatial field, which typically yields more variety (and thus more information) in the signals. It is likely that future data acquisition, control and physical monitoring, will heavily rely on this type of networks. Most contributions in this thesis focus on (but are not limited to) the application of WSNs for distributed noise reduction in speech recordings. Noise reduction for speech enhancement is crucial in many applications such as hearing aids, mobile phones, video conferencing, hands-free telephony, automatic speech recognition, etc. In this thesis, we develop novel signal and parameter estimation techniques that rely on distributed in-network processing, i. e., without gathering all the sensor data in a central processor as it is the case in centralized estimation algorithms. In WSNs, a distributed approach is often preferred, especially so when it is scalable in terms of its communication bandwidth requirement, transmission power and local computational complexity. In almost all distributed estimation techniques that are proposed in this thesis, the goal is to obtain the same estimation performance as in a centralized estimation algorithm. We distinguish between two different types of distributed estimation problems: signal estimation and parameter estimation. Both problems usually have to be tackled in very different ways. In distributed signal estimation, the number of estimation variables grows linearly with the number of temporal observations, i. e. for each sample time of the sensors, a new sample of the desired signal(s) has to be estimated. Iterative refinement of these signal estimates would require that intermediate signal estimates are retransmitted multiple times between the same node pairs, which is usually not feasible in real-time systems with high sampling rates. In distributed parameter estimation problems on the other hand, the number of estimation variables are either fixed, i. e., it does not grow with the number of temporal observations, or the data acquisition happens at a very low sampling rate such that sufficient time is available to iteratively refine intermediate estimates. In the context of distributed signal estimation in WSNs, we propose a distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) algorithm, which operates in a fully connected WSN. The term `node-specific' refers to the fact that each node estimates adifferent signal, although the desired signals of all nodes have to share a common low-dimensional signal subspace. In this case, DANSE significantly reduces the exchange of data between nodes, while still obtaining an optimal estimator in each node, as if all nodes have access to all the sensor signal observations in the network. In the original version of DANSE, the local fusion rules of each node are iteratively updated in a sequential round-robin fashion. The DANSE algorithm is then extended to the case where nodes update their local fusion rules simultaneously, which allows the algorithm to adapt more swiftly to changes in the environment. Both versions of the algorithm are then applied in a speech enhancement context. To this end, the algorithm is extended to a more robust version, to avoid numerically ill-conditioned quantities that often arise in such practical settings. The DANSE algorithm is also extended to operate in WSNs with a tree topology, hence relaxing the constraint that the network has to be fully connected, i. e., each node only has to communicate with nearby nodes. Finally, the DANSE algorithm is extended with node-specific linear constraints, yielding an optimal node-specific linearly-constrained minimum variance beamformer in each node. In the second part of this thesis, we tackle distributed linear regression problems, based on distributed parameter estimation techniques. In particular, we focus on the case where the data or regression matrix is noisy, for which traditional least-squares methods yield biased results. To reduce this bias, we propose two novel methods. The first one is a distributed version of the well-known total least squares estimation technique, which yields unbiased estimates if the regressor noise is white. A second method, that can also cope with colored noise, is based on a bias-compensated recursive least squares algorithm with diffusion adaptation. This algorithm is analyzed in an adaptive filtering context, where it is demonstrated that the cooperation between nodes indeed reduces the bias, and furthermore reduces the variance of the local parameter estimates at each node. In the third part of this thesis, we propose two supporting techniques {{that can be used in}} WSNs for (acoustic) signal estimation. The first one is an energy-based multi-speaker voice activity detection algorithm, that aims to track the individual speech power of multiple speakers talking simultaneously. Finally, we propose a technique for sensor subset selection, which is an efficient greedy approach to select the subset of sensors that contribute the most to the estimation. The other nodes can then be <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>to</b> save energy. This method also yields efficient formulas to compute optimal fall-back estimators in the case of link failure. status: publishe...|$|E

In this paper, we explore the potential of architectural techniques to reduce leakage through power-gating of execution units. This paper first develops parameterized analytical equations that estimate the break-even point for application of power-gating techniques. The potential for power gating execution units is then evaluated, for the range of relevant break-even points determined by the analytical equations, using a state-of-the-art out-of-order superscalar processor model. The power gating potential of the floating-point and fixed-point units of this processor is then evaluated using three different techniques to detect opportunities for entering sleep mode; ideal, time-based, and branch-misprediction-guided. Our results show that using the time-based approach, floating-point units can be <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for up <b>to</b> 28 % of the execution cycles at a performance loss of 2 %.

The schedules are decided based on a node’s own traffic and that of its neighbors.

Furthermore, unlike SMAC, only the sensor nodes involved in communication wake up frequently in PMAC and hence energy is conserved in other sensor nodes. I...|$|R
