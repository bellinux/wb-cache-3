50|$|Sleeping {{while on}} duty {{is such an}} {{important}} issue that it is addressed in the employee handbook in some workplaces. Concerns that employers have may include the lack of productivity, the unprofessional appearance, and danger that may occur when the employee's duties involve watching to prevent a hazardous situation. In some occupations, such as <b>pilots,</b> <b>truck</b> and bus drivers, or those operating heavy machinery, falling asleep while on duty puts lives in danger.|$|R
50|$|However, in April 11, 1981, the {{locomotive}} suffered a cracked front flue sheet at Dalton, Georgia during an excursion trip from Atlanta, GA to Chattanooga, TN. So a diesel locomotive pulled {{the remainder of}} the trip and 4501 was towed back to the Irondale Workshop in Birmingham, Alabama for a long term rebuild. She would not operate again until November 1984. Following the rebuild, 4501 received a newly welded tender body to replace her old one along with the tender's old Andrews <b>pilot</b> <b>trucks</b> replaced with modern roller bearing trucks.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Camel" [...] engines {{were all}} low-speed, heavy haul units.

The most distinctive feature of the [...] "Camel" [...] was the cab atop the boiler. They had a large steam dome, slide valves, and used staybolts in the boiler. More than 100 iron tubes, each over 14 ft long, were installed in the boiler.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 80's when {{designing}} the truck GAZ-3307 and other {{models of the}} fourth generation provides ample unification on sites and aggregates existing production car (chassis and gasoline power plant, in fact, moved from model GAZ-53-12), which allowed {{reduce the cost of}} automobiles {{and at the same time}} facilitate the maintenance, repair and operation. The car received a more spacious, modern double cab, equipped with efficient ventilation and heating system, first applied in the <b>pilot</b> <b>truck</b> GAZ-4301 in 1984. The design of the steering unlike their predecessors, for the first time, includes power steering. Serial production of 4.5-ton truck GAZ-3307 (4×2) with a carbureted engine ZMZ-511 125 hp began in late 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1930s, with train tonnage increasing, the Milwaukee {{began to}} create three-unit {{locomotives}} {{out of the}} boxcab units. A simple combination of three was classified EF-2. Twelve EF-2s were assembled, and renumbered 10500-10511ACB. On these, the cab on the center (C) unit was unnecessary and just added weight and length. The center units were therefore shortened by removing the cab, the <b>pilot</b> <b>truck</b> and the frame extension; these were nicknamed [...] "bobtails". These were assembled in between two standard units to create EF-3 sets. These [...] "bobtail" [...] units weighed 52000 lb less than a regular unit. Additional EF-2s were created, but no more were modified into [...] "bobtails". The locomotives were renumbered in 1939, the EF-3s being numbered E25-E36, and the EF-1s E50-E73.|$|E
50|$|Norris {{built the}} Lafayette for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad the {{following}} year based on plans of the George Washington. Named after the Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette, this new 4-2-0 engine was the B&O's first locomotive to feature a leading truck {{and may have been}} the first standardized production model locomotive in the entire world. Innovations included positioning of cylinders outside and adjacent to the smokebox with pistons connecting to the face of the drive wheels instead of a crank axle, the four-wheel swiveling <b>pilot</b> <b>truck,</b> inside bar frame support, and placement of the two drivers ahead of the firebox (this supposedly offered greater power output as more of the locomotive's weight rested on the drivers and therefore increased tractive effort). The Lafayette established the configuration that American steam locomotives would follow {{until the end of the}} steam era.|$|E

40|$|On first glance, {{it seems}} self-evident: sleep-deprived physicians-intraining (residents) {{are more likely}} to make {{mistakes}} that could harm patients. Like <b>pilots</b> and <b>truck</b> drivers, these new physicians might need restrictions on how much they work. Such restrictions were created in 2003, but the impact of these new rules is unclear. Are patients any safer? Is hospital care more fragmented? Who’s doing the work that residents performed prior to duty hour reform? This Issue Brief summarizes several studies that offer evidence about the impact of these regulations on patient mortality, as well as on residents’ perceptions of the effects on quality of care, medical education, and residents’ quality of life...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} perform much differently for {{the crews}} {{going up the}} grade. The #70 has more power and does not usually struggle with a loaded train, however the #192, with larger drivers, longer frame, and lower boiler pressure, needs to be run with the throttle wide open and speed adjusted with the Johnson Bar. The first grade {{right out of the}} station is upwards of 5%, and the #192 will stall and need to make another run at the hill if it loses enough momentum. The grade does flatten out for a couple hundred feet as it approaches the Thunderhead Gap bridge. The engineer will blow a warning whistle for the crossing just beyond the bridge, and as the train emerges from the trees, the throttle is opened up as the engine hits the second hill and grinds up the 3-4% grade to the horseshoe curve beyond Sawmill Rd. At the end of this curve, the #192 with its long frame will buck against the curvature which is evidenced by the wear on the frame behind the trailing and <b>pilot</b> <b>trucks.</b> After negotiating a small S-curve through a cut in the hillside, the grade steepens again to about 6% until topping over near the upper loop switch. The crew will need to have enough water in the boiler to keep the crown sheet of the firebox covered for the downhill trip, and while the engineer is blowing the whistle and making the first brake pipe reduction, the fireman is using the raging fire to inject water against the climbing pressure gauge.|$|R
5000|$|Norfolk & Western #578 is a 4-6-2 [...] "Pacific" [...] E2a steam {{locomotive}} built in March 1910 by the American Locomotive Company's Richmond Works. The full length including the tender is 90 ft. The weight fully loaded is 285 tons (259 t). The 6 sets of wheels {{from front to}} back are two sets of 33 in wheels for the <b>pilot</b> <b>truck,</b> 3 sets of 70 in wheels for the drivers, and one set of 42 in wheels for the trailing truck. The tender has 2 Buckeye steel built 6 wheel trucks each wheel at 33 inches. The full height of the locomotive is 15 ft The fuel capacity is 26 tons of coal and 18,000 U.S. gallons (68,000 L) of water. This locomotive was donated to the Ohio Railway Museum on Thursday, February 12, 1959 from the Norfolk and Western Railway Company.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Challenger" [...] {{was given}} to steam {{locomotives}} with a 4-6-6-4 wheel arrangement. This means that they have four wheels in the leading <b>pilot</b> <b>truck,</b> which helps guide the locomotive into curves, two sets of six driving wheels, and finally four trailing wheels, which support {{the rear of the}} engine and its massive firebox. Each set of six driving wheels is driven by two steam cylinders. In essence, the result is two engines under one boiler. The Union Pacific Railroad sponsored development of this type to meet the need for higher speeds in main-line service. Historically, articulated locomotives had been limited to slow speeds by factors inherent in their design. The technical breakthroughs achieved with the Challenger enabled the carrier to develop the Big Boy with the same speed expectations. Speeds in excess of 60 M.P.H., while unheard-of on other railroads using articulated steam locomotives, became commonplace on the Union Pacific.|$|E
5000|$|The 4-6-2 {{designation}} {{indicates that}} there are four wheels in the <b>pilot</b> <b>truck,</b> six driving wheels, and two wheels in the trailing truck. The term [...] "Pacific" [...] was given to this wheel arrangement because it was first used on the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The E2a locomotives were first used for mainline passenger service and later for branch line service when replaced by larger equipment. The E2a's could pull up to 8 heavy Pullman passenger cars at 70 miles per hour. Through the years, these locomotives were equipped with various types of tenders. The current tender on #578 is the largest used with any E2a and is originally from a larger 4-8-2 [...] "Mountain" [...] type locomotive. It {{is equipped with a}} stoker and can be operated with an auxiliary tender for greater range. #578 was assigned to the Scioto division operating into Columbus from 1917 to 1944, and was transferred to the Norton branch from Bluefield, West Virginia to Norton, Virginia, and was retired from service in December 1958.|$|E

5000|$|Bridgton {{machine shop}} foreman Millard M. [...] "Mel" [...] Caswell {{was born in}} 1850. [...] He took an early {{interest}} in mechanical affairs of the proposed railroad and served as master mechanic for the B&SR until he retired in 1926. He remained interested in the railroad and frequently attended the railfan excursions of the 1930s. His son, Wilfred H. Caswell, was born in 1876 and shared his father's mechanical aptitude. Wilfred Caswell was the engineer assigned to the construction train for the Harrison extension in 1898. Wilfred was the Portland Company mechanical engineer who supervised construction of the first Maine narrow gauge Forney locomotive with a <b>pilot</b> <b>truck</b> (B&SR locomotive number 5) in 1906. Wilfred then served as a consulting engineer for Baldwin Locomotive Works during construction of B&SR locomotive number 6 and an identical locomotive for the Sandy River Railroad. In May 1909 Wilfred became master mechanic of the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad (SR&RL). Wilfred's early recognition of the technical value of photography produced excellent photographic documentation of SR&RL operations through the period of Maine Central Railroad ownership. When SR&RL profits declined in 1922, Wilfred and his wife Blanche, {{who had been the}} SR&RL book-keeper, moved to Dedham, Massachusetts, where Wilfred worked for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.|$|E
5000|$|The T1 class {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} performance and design issues including difficulties regarding the poppet valves used by the locomotives. The original materials used to construct the poppet valves used by the T1 had fatigue issues which were increased when the locomotives were operated above 100 miles an hour. In 1947, a higher strength and fatigue resistant alloy was used and retrofitted to the T1 class to solve the fatigue problems. Nevertheless, the design of the Franklin Type A poppet valves made several key areas of the valves hard to access during maintenance overhauls. Despite the constant issues, the poppet valves did allow the T1 to perform better than conventional valved locomotives at high speeds. The poppet valves required less horsepower for fast operation and were able to distribute steam flow with precision valve operation when going at high speeds. The T1's were further burdened by excessive wheel slip on one of the two engine sets when the locomotive operated at high speed or when the engine started moving. The Pennsylvania Railroad tried to address the problem by changing the spring bed arrangement on the T1, from being a single bed that supported only the eight drivers, to two beds; the forward bed supporting the <b>pilot</b> <b>truck</b> and first engine and the aft bed supporting the second engine and trailing truck. Despite this, a permanent solution couldn't be found to ultimately prevent violent wheel slip, even though an [...] "anti-slip" [...] mechanism had been installed on the PRR Q2 class duplexii. It is possible that the engineers, more familiar with the K4s class were better used to the slower throttle action of the K4s, whereas the T1 reacted more immediately to the engineer's throttle input {{due in part to the}} use of poppet valves.|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, Bede came up {{with another}} novel {{solution}} {{to the problems of}} converting pilots to the new aircraft. They took an engine-less example and bolted it to the front of a pickup truck on a trapeze, attaching the pilot's throttle control to the <b>truck's.</b> <b>Pilots</b> could test fly the aircraft without danger - if a problem developed the driver of the truck simply hit the brakes.|$|R
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{supplied by}} Timken or SKF were {{used on the}} four wheel <b>pilot</b> and trailing <b>trucks</b> {{as well as the}} six wheel tender trucks. The first 20 examples, (2100-2119) used friction bearings on the eight driving wheels, while the final 10 (2120-2129), intended for both freight and passenger service, had roller bearings throughout. The driving wheels themselves used the Boxpok design with a diameter of 70 in.|$|R
