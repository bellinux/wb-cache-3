50|$|In 1925, the Nevada Department of Highways {{advocated}} mitigating corrugations with crushed <b>pit-run</b> <b>gravel,</b> using material 1 in and smaller, including {{only the}} fines from crushing. Contemporaneous advice from Colorado {{was to use}} a well-graded gravel, not exceeding 1.25 in and including 25-40% fines passing a 0.25 in sieve, {{but not more than}} 5% passing a #10 (2.0-mm) sieve. The maintenance advice from Colorado was to drag or grade the road frequently, applying light volumes of new gravel with minimal sand content and providing good drainage with a crown. The same source advises reduction of traffic speed.|$|E
5000|$|The Cartier Railway is an {{engineering}} marvel and was constructed using all the modern, state-of-the art techniques {{available at the}} time, including making extensive use of aerial mapping to select the best route through the very mountainous terrain. The initial 190 mi rail line used natural drainage extensively by following the Rochers and Toulnustouc River valleys to keep the grades at a minimum. The ruling grade for southbound loaded trains was kept to a very easy 0.4% while the northbound ruling grade was only 1.35%. Numerous rock cuts had to be blasted and five tunnels, ranging from 350 to 1440 ft, were built where rock cuts weren't possible. The heavy haul nature of this railway, all rail, including sidings and yard tracks made all constructed be using [...] rail in 78 ft lengths. Since curves account for 54.3% of the main line, extensive use of flange oilers was needed. The oilers were located every 8 mi or 250 degrees of curvature, whichever was less. Granite, blasted and removed during construction of the harbor at Port Cartier was crushed and used as ballast on the first 54 mi of the line, while local <b>pit-run</b> <b>gravel</b> {{was used for the}} remainder. Twenty-two bridges were needed for the railroad, with the bridge at Milepost 68.5 being the longest (880 ft) and highest (120 ft) on the line. The railway also required the construction of 1,524 culverts for drainage.|$|E
