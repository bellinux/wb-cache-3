The most significant among those were from Hungarian, Viennese, Central European, as well as Turkish and Arab cuisines brought by series of conquests and accompanying social influences. The ingredients of traditional dishes are pickled vegetables, dairy products and smoked meats. The most famous traditional <b>preserved</b> <b>meat</b> product is kulen, {{one of a handful}} Croatian products protected by the EU as indigenous products.|$|E

500|$|With some {{residents}} forced to seek refuge in caves, the Government of Vanuatu asked the Australian, New Zealand and American governments for emergency food supplies and other assistance. In accordance, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) dispatched two Hercules transport planes {{to help with}} recovery efforts. The first carried a helicopter that transported Vanuatu military forces, medical teams and supplies to the affected northern islands, especially remote villages inaccessible to larger aircraft. The other plane was used to transport more than [...] of fuel and relief supplies including food and shelter provisions. The Royal New Zealand Air Force also provided a plane, which transported relief supplies from Espiritu Santo to the northern islands up to three times daily, with the bulk of supplies donated by Australia. The European Commission provided Vanuatu with €100,000 in emergency aid to purchase local foods, including rice, <b>preserved</b> <b>meat,</b> and fish, and to distribute it to Anne's victims. The total cost of relief and reconstruction efforts was estimated between US$1.2–2 million.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the process}} of food preservation, {{potassium}} nitrate has been a common ingredient of salted meat since the Middle Ages, but its use has been mostly discontinued because of inconsistent results compared to more modern nitrate and nitrite compounds. Even so, saltpeter is still used in some food applications, such as charcuterie and the brine used to make corned beef. [...] When used as a food additive in the European Union, the compound {{is referred to as}} E252; it is also approved for use as a food additive in the USA and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed under its INS number 252). Although nitrate salts have been suspected of producing the carcinogen nitrosamine, both sodium and potassium nitrates and nitrites have been added to meats in the US since 1925, and nitrates and nitrites have not been removed from <b>preserved</b> <b>meat</b> products because nitrite and nitrate inhibits the germination of Clostridium botulinum endospores, and thus prevents botulism form bacterial toxin that may otherwise be produced in certain <b>preserved</b> <b>meat</b> products.|$|E
2500|$|Moose or Alaska moose Alces alces gigas (tuntuvak in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tuntuwag in Cup'ig, {{literally}} [...] "big caribou"). The {{most commonly}} received resources for Manokotak residents were moose (%79.6 of households). Moose were not usually {{seen in the}} lower Kuskokwim River drainages until the early 1940s. Moose meat (tuntuviim kemga) was preserved by freezing and drying. Rarely was moose meat preserved by smoking or caning. Hunters who harvested moose at spring camps in the mountains <b>preserved</b> <b>meat</b> by cutting it into strips and hanging it on racks or bushes to dry in the sun, making jerky. This jerky was eaten without further preparation, or it was boiled. Virtually all of the moose was used. Bones were cracked and the marrow was removed. Fat from the back and rump was {{cut into small pieces}} and eaten uncooked along with meals at home and when in the field. Part of the stomach was cleaned and prepared, and the heart, liver, and kidneys were also eaten. The whole head was usually kept so that the muscles, brain, tongue, and nose could be removed and cooked. The feet and hooves were also cooked and eaten. Moose was cooked in variety of ways including boiling, roasting, stewing, frying and in soups.|$|E

2500|$|Camels are the {{ultimate}} pillars that support national economies of many developing countries, because they are useful for transport, and provide food {{in the form of}} meat and milk (Tariq et al.,2010). A camel carcass can provide a substantial amount of meat. The male dromedary carcass can weigh , while the carcass of a male Bactrian can weigh up to [...] The carcass of a female dromedary weighs less than the male, ranging between [...] The brisket, ribs and loin are among the preferred parts, and the hump is considered a delicacy. The hump contains [...] "white and sickly fat", which {{can be used to make}} the khli (<b>preserved</b> <b>meat)</b> of mutton, beef, or camel. On the other hand, camel milk and meat are rich in protein, vitamins, glycogen, and other nutrients making them essential in the diet of many people. From chemical composition to meat quality, the dromedary camel is the preferred breed for meat production. It does well even in arid areas due to its unusual physiological behaviors and characteristics, which include tolerance to extreme temperatures, radiation from the sun, water paucity, rugged landscape and low vegetation (Aleme, 2013). Camel meat is reported to taste like coarse beef, but older camels can prove to be very tough, although camel meat becomes more tender the more it is cooked. The Abu Dhabi Officers' Club serves a camel burger mixed with beef or lamb fat in order to improve the texture and taste. In Karachi, Pakistan, some restaurants prepare nihari from camel meat. In Syria and Egypt, there are specialist camel butchers.|$|E
