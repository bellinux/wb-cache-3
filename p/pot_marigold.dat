50|$|Calendulas are {{considered}} by many gardening experts as among the easiest and most versatile flowers to grow in a garden, especially because they tolerate most soils. In temperate climates, seeds are sown in spring for blooms that last throughout the summer and well into the fall. In areas of limited winter freezing, seeds are sown in autumn for winter color. Plants will wither in subtropical summer. Seeds will germinate freely in sunny or half-sunny locations, but plants do best if planted in sunny locations with rich, well-drained soil. <b>Pot</b> <b>marigolds</b> typically bloom quickly from seed (in under two months) in bright yellows, golds, and oranges.|$|R

The hypothesis that marigold root tissue can protect sugarbeets against root-knot nematodes in sequential cropping systems was tested. Marigolds were grown in sand substrate and a 50 : 50 ratio of sand:MSU soil mix. Above ground marigold tissues were cut at soil level and removed 5. 5 months postgermination. Sugarbeets were planted in pots of both substrates containing intact marigold roots and in <b>pots</b> without <b>marigold</b> roots. Second stage juvenile (J 2) southern root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne incognita Kofoid and White, were used to inoculate (300 J 2 s per 5 week old sugarbeet seedlings). The root gall index was highest (4. 19) for sand without marigold roots. Presence of roots of Mexican marigold, Tagetes minuta and MSU soil mix, separately, significantly reduced populations of M. incognita indicated by root-gall index. Integration of these two amendments further reduced nematode populations. SandrMSU mix with marigold roots had the lowest gall index (1. 69). No studies of marigolds effect on cyst nematodes have been reported for any host plant. The hypothesis that root exudates of T. minuta, residual after roots are still left in soil, are effective against the sugarbeet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii (Schmidtt) was tested.

The <b>pot</b> <b>marigold</b> inflorescences (commonly used as pharmaceutical herbs) and leaves were collected at distances of 20 to 80 m from the roadside; the lead content was estimated using the dithizone lead determination technique. The 2. 5 m high dense spruce hedgerow reduced the lead contamination of <b>pot</b> <b>marigold</b> leaves for 40 m from the hedgerow; the average lead content of leaves was 12. 5 µg pro 100 cm 2. Contrary, at the 60 m distance to the hedgerow, a peak in lead content (33 µg/ 100 cm 2) was found. The absolute lead contents for the inflorescences were much lower (2 - 8 µg/ 100 cm 2) and no unidirectional impact of the hedgerow on the lead content of inflorescences was found.

40|$|Abstract Background Calendula officinalis L. (<b>pot</b> <b>marigold)</b> is {{an annual}} {{aromatic}} herb with yellow or golden-orange flowers, {{native to the}} Mediterranean climate areas. Their seeds contain significant amounts of oil (around 20 %), of which about 60 % is calendic acid. For these reasons, in Europe concentrated research efforts have been directed towards the development of <b>pot</b> <b>marigold</b> as an oilseed crop for industrial purposes. Results The oil content and fatty acid composition of major lipid fractions in seeds from eleven genotypes of <b>pot</b> <b>marigold</b> (Calendula officinalis L.) were determined. The lipid content of seeds varied between 13. 6 and 21. 7 g oil/ 100 g seeds. The calendic and linoleic acids were the two dominant fatty acids in total lipid (51. 4 to 57. 6 % and 28. 5 to 31. 9 %) and triacylglycerol (45. 7 to 54. 7 % and 22. 6 to 29. 2 %) fractions. Polar lipids were also characterised by higher unsaturation ratios (with the PUFAs content between 60. 4 and 66. 4 %), while saturates (consisted mainly of palmitic and very long-chain saturated fatty acids) were found in higher amounts in sterol esters (ranging between 49. 3 and 55. 7 % of total fatty acids). Conclusions All the <b>pot</b> <b>marigold</b> seed oils investigated contain high levels of calendic acid (more than 50 % of total fatty acids), making them favorable for industrial use. The compositional differences between the genotypes should be considered when breeding and exploiting the <b>pot</b> <b>marigold</b> seeds for nutraceutical and pharmacological purposes. </p...|$|E

For this purpose a split plot experiment based on completely randomized block design with three replications was used. The main factor consist of four different fertilizers (50 kg. ha- 1 N, 40 t. ha- 1 Cow manure, 20 t. ha- 1 Compost fertilizer and 10 t. ha- 1 Hen manure) beside control (without fertilizer) and three sowing dates (10 th April, 1 th May and 21 th May) were allocated as sub factor.

The aim of the present study, conducted in the years 2003 – 2004 in Mydlniki near Kraków, was to determine the effect of intercropping carrot Nardin F 1 with French marigold (Tagetes patula nana L.) 'Kolombina' and <b>pot</b> <b>marigold</b> (Calendula officinalis L.) 'Promyk' on carrot yield, its quality, and the occurrence of pests. On average in both years of the study, intercropping did not reduce total or marketable carrot yield.

Treatments included Fe, Zn, Mn, mixed solutions of these elements (Fe+Zn, Fe+Mn, Zn+Mn, Fe+Zn+Mn) and control (water). Treatments were applied in 2 g/litter twice at stem elongation and early flowering stages. Different traits such as plant height, number of capitol per plant, number seed per capitol, thousand seed weight, biological yield, seed yield, seed oil percentage and oil Yield were recorded. The results showed that foliar application of micronutrients had significant effects {{on all of these}} traits. Yield components, seed yield, oil percentage and yield were enhanced by foliar application, compared with control (untreated plants). The maximum number seed per capitol, thousand seed weight and biological yield were relevant to Fe treatment. The highest numbers of capitol per plant and seed yield (643. 33 kg. ha- 1) were relevant to Zn+Fe treatment and the maximum oil yield (124. 20 kg. ha- 1) was produced by Zn+ Fe+ Mn treatment.
