40|$|Adenovirus-mediated {{expression}} of a modified simian rotavirus capsid protein (SA- 11 VP 7 sc) in 293 cells has been demonstrated. Based on this observation and due to the high-level similarity between VP 7 proteins from different rotavirus serotypes, VP 7 sc from the Wa strain (serotype Gl) was rescued into the adenovirus (Ad 5) El region to obtain its expression following infection of 293 cell This gene which has been constructed and expressed in COS cells, was prepared from pJCWaVPTsc plasmid. The gene was first subcloned into Bluescript to facilitate selection of recombinants following ligation of the CMV promoter DNA upstream of it. This cassette was then subcloned into the <b>polycloning</b> <b>site</b> of pXCX 3, a plasmid containing 16 % left-hand sequences of Ad 5. This step produced pXCVPV Plasmid which could give rise {{to the rescue of}} WaVP 7 in the El region of Ad 5 following cotransfection and homologous recombination with pJMlT, a plasmid containing aknost the entire genome of Ad 5...|$|E
40|$|CcpA was {{purified}} from Escherichia coli BL 21 (lambda DE 3) /pLysS carrying plasmid pTSC 5, {{which was}} constructed by inserting the ccpA gene into the <b>polycloning</b> <b>site</b> of pGEM 4. The purified protein migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent mass of 38 kDa but was eluted from a calibrated Bio-Gel P- 100 column with an apparent mass of 75 kDa. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed {{the presence of}} CcpA in E. coli BL 21 (lambda DE 3) /pLysS/pTSC 5, which carries ccpA, and in wild-type Bacillus subtilis 168 but not in E. coli BL 21 (lambda DE 3) /pLysS/pGEM 4 or in B. subtilis WLN- 29, in which ccpA is inactivated by transposon Tn 917 insertion. Purified CcpA bound to DNA containing amyO and retarded its mobility in electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Complete retardation of the DNA required 75 ng of CcpA per assay. In DNase protection analysis, CcpA bound to DNA containing amyO and protected a region spanning amyO when either DNA strand was labeled. Mutant forms of amyO not effective in catabolite repression were not retarded by CcpA...|$|E
40|$|Brucella abortus is a gram {{negative}} bacteria that can infect and cause serious disease in many mammals including humans. Any organism, including Brucella, that can survive as an intracellular parasite {{must be able}} to survive the stress of a foreign and often hostile environment of the host. Stress usually results in a dramatic change in gene expression including an elevated synthesis of heat shock proteins;We have subcloned, sequenced and expressed the Brucella HSP 70 and the upstream sequences. The gene was put {{under the control of the}} strong 2 ̆ 2 tac 2 ̆ 2 promoter. However, when expressed, we saw a high accumulation of a 23 kDa polypeptide. Upon sequencing, this peptide was shown to be from the N-terminus of the protein;Upstream of the initiation codon of the Brucella HSP 70 gene is a small ORF complete with its own initiation and termination codon and a good ribosome binding site. Various subclones were made and western blots from these showed that if the Brucella HSP 70 gene is expressed without the ORF, the 23 kDa polypeptide accumulates. If the ORF is present, the protein accumulates intact. So, we concluded that this ORF is an important upstream regulatory element. Such a system has not been reported before and seems to be unique to Brucella. However, Brucella is an unusual parasite in that it can survive and multiply in the macrophage [...] the cell type of the immune system designed to kill it. It 2 ̆ 7 s unknown whether this form of regulation has any relationship to survival as an intracellular parasite;To facilitate expression we also constructed seven expression vectors, pJE 1 -pJE 7. All these plasmids were derived from pKK 223 - 3. They all carry the M 13 origin of replication to facilitate production of single stranded DNA and an expanded <b>polycloning</b> <b>site</b> to facilitate cloning. pJE 1 - 6 are in vivo constitutive expression vectors with modified promoters such that there is a graded expression with pJE 1 carrying the strongest promoter. pJE 7 is designed for in vitro regulated expression using the 2 ̆ 2 tac 2 ̆ 2 promoter. This plasmid carries the lac I[superscript]q gene to prevent over expression from the 2 ̆ 2 tac 2 ̆ 2 promoter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} {{expression}} vectors has been constructed as {{based on the}} pML derivative of pBR 322. The eukaryotic transcription units employ various promoters followed by <b>polycloning</b> <b>sites</b> for 3 – 9 commonly used restriction enzymes and are completed by the SV 40 polyadenylation sequence. In 4 of the vectors, designed for co-transfection or transient expression studies, only a single transcription unit containing either a constitutive or an inducible promoter was incorporated. The human ubiquitin (UbC) promoter {{was used as a}} strong constitutive promoter, while the mouse metallothionein promoter and the promoter of the long terminal repeats of the mouse mammary tumor virus were used as inducible promoters. Another vector contained an additional transcription unit encoding a eukaryotic selection marker, the neomycin resistance encoding gene. The vectors were used in CHO cells and in neuroendocrine CA 77 cells to synthesize peptide precursors, protease inhibitors and a protease. It is shown that these vectors are very efficient for the constitutive and inducible expression of nucleotide sequences in both transient and stable transfections of eukaryotic cells...|$|R
