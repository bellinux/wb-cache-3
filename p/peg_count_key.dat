50|$|A block, a {{contiguous}} {{number of}} bytes, is the minimum unit of storage that is read from and written to a disk by a disk driver. The earliest disk drives had fixed block sizes (e.g. the IBM 350 {{disk storage unit}} (of the late 1950s) block size was 100 6 bit characters) but starting with the 1301 IBM marketed subsystems that featured variable block sizes: a particular track could have blocks of different sizes. The disk subsystems on the IBM System/360 expanded this concept {{in the form of}} <b>Count</b> <b>Key</b> Data (CKD) and later Extended <b>Count</b> <b>Key</b> Data (ECKD); however the use of variable block size in HDDs fell out of use in the 1990s; one of the last HDDs to support variable block size was the IBM 3390 Model 9, announced May 1993.|$|R

50|$|Beginning {{with its}} 1964 System/360 {{announcement}} IBM's mainframes initially accessed CKD (<b>Count</b> <b>key</b> data) subsystems via a channel connected to separate Storage Control Units (SCUs) with attached Direct Access Storage Devices (DASD), typically a hard disk drive.

5000|$|In the 1960s most {{disk drives}} used IBM's {{variable}} block length format (called <b>Count</b> <b>Key</b> Data or [...] "CKD").Any block size could be specified {{up to the}} maximum track length. Since the block headers occupied space, the usable capacity of the drive was dependent on the block size. Blocks ("records" [...] in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of 80- and 96-character punch cards. The drive capacity was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100-megabyte 3336 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Cryoglobulinemia {{has been}} {{reported}} sometimes to cause false elevation in platelet and/or leukocyte counts in au-tomated blood cell counters due to temperature-dependent pro-tein precipitates that are falsely interpreted as blood cells at room temperature. Upon heating to 37 &deg;C, these blood counts decrease to normal levels as cryoproteins dissolve. Therefore, cryoglobulins could theoretically lead to erroneous diagnosis of spontaneous platelet aggregation in platelet counting and tur-bidometric methods as platelet count and turbidity of the plate-let-rich plasma decrease at 37 &deg;C, respectively. Here, the event of pseudospontaneous platelet aggregation is confirmed in two patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia, both had spuriously el-evated blood cell <b>counts.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: Cryoglobulinemia&mdash; Platelet function tests&mdash;Pseudospontaneous platelet aggrega-tion&mdash;Pseudoleukocytosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To date, {{the neural}} {{decoding}} of time-evolving physical state – for example, {{the path of}} a foraging rat or arm movements – has been largely carried out using linear trajectory models, primarily due to their computational efficiency. The possibility of better capturing the statistics of the movements using nonlinear trajectory models, thereby yielding more accurate decoded trajectories, is enticing. However, nonlinear decoding usually carries a higher computational cost, which is an important consideration in real-time settings. In this paper, we present techniques for nonlinear decoding employing modal Gaussian approximations, expectatation propagation, and Gaussian quadrature.
