40|$|We {{consider}} a multi-sector {{general equilibrium model}} with IO linkages, sector-specific <b>productivities</b> and tax rates. Using tools from network theory, we investigate how the IO structure interacts with <b>productivities</b> and taxes in the determination of aggregate income. We show that aggregate income is a simple function {{of the first and}} second moments of the distribution of the IO multipliers, sectoral <b>productivities</b> and sectoral tax rates. We then estimate the parameters of the model to fit their joint empirical distribution. Poor countries have more extreme distributions of IO multipliers than rich economies: there are a few high-multiplier sectors, while most sectors have very low multipliers; by contrast, rich countries have more sectors with intermediate multipliers. Moreover, the correlations of these with <b>productivities</b> and tax rates are positive in poor countries, while being negative in rich ones. The estimated model predicts cross-country income differences extremely well, also out-of-sample. Finally, we perform a number of counterfactuals and compute optimal tax rates...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} on hauling <b>productivities</b> and hauling costs of {{three types of}} log hauling trucks was carried out at three logging companies in West Kalimantan in 1988. Three types of logging trucks, i. e. Nissan with semi trailer, Berliet with semi trailer and Nissan truck, were observed. The <b>productivities</b> of trucks were gathered through time study while the hauling costs were calculated based on secondary data. The purpose of the investigation is to find hauling <b>productivities,</b> operating costs of trucks and hauling costs. The {{results of the investigation}} are as follows :The average hauling <b>productivities</b> of Nissan with semi trailer, Berliet with semi trailer and Nissan trucks are 484, 99 m 3 km/hour, 492, 02 m 3 km/hour and 292, 07 m 3 km/hour, respectively. The average hauling costs of Nissan with semi trailer, Berliet with semi trailer and Nissan Trucks are Rp. 63, 08 /m 3 km, Rp. 64, 66 /m 3 km and Rp. 84, 39 /m 3 km, respectively. The differences in both the hauling <b>productivities</b> and hauling costs either between Nissan logging truck with semi trailer and Nissan loging truck or between Berliet logging truck with semi-trailer and Nissan logging truck were highlysignificant because of the differences in logging truck capacities, transport distances and driver skills.

If <b>productivities</b> are drawn from a Pareto-Levy distribution then the distribution of patent values also falls within this class. The theory is then applied to data on US patent citations.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest in cultivation of green microalgae (Chlorophyta) {{as a source}} of lipid that can alternatively be converted to biodiesel. However, almost all mass cultures of algae are carbon-limited. Therefore, to reach a high biomass and oil <b>productivities,</b> the ideal selected microalgae will most likely need a source of inorganic carbon. Here, growth and lipid <b>productivities</b> of Tetraselmis suecica CS- 187 and Chlorella sp were tested under various ranges of pH and different sources of inorganic carbon (untreated flue gas from coal-fired power plant, pure industrial CO 2, pH-adjusted using HCl and sodium bicarbonate). Biomass and lipid <b>productivities</b> were highest at pH 7. 5 (320 Â± 29. 9 mg biomass L- 1 day- 1 and 92 Â± 13. 1 mg lipid L- 1 day- 1) and pH 7 (407 Â± 5. 5 mg biomass L- 1 day- 1 and 99 Â± 17. 2 mg lipid L- 1 day- 1) for T. suecica CS- 187 and Chlorella sp, respectively. In general, biomass and lipid <b>productivities</b> were pH 7. 5 & pH 7 & pH 8 & pH 6. 5 and pH 7 & pH 7. 5 = pH 8 & pH 6. 5 & pH 6 & pH 5. 5 for T. suecica CS- 187 and Chlorella sp, respectively. The effect of various inorganic carbon on growth and <b>productivities</b> of T. suecica (regulated at pH = 7. 5) and Chlorella sp (regulated at pH = 7) grown in bag photobioreactors was also examined outdoor at the International Power Hazelwood, Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. The highest biomass and lipid <b>productivities</b> of T. suecica (51. 45 Â± 2. 67 mg biomass L- 1 day- 1 and 14. 8 Â± 2. 46 mg lipid L- 1 day- 1) and Chlorella sp (60. 00 Â± 2. 4 mg biomass L- 1 day- 1 and 13. 70 Â± 1. 35 mg lipid L- 1 day- 1) were achieved when grown using CO 2 as inorganic carbon source. No {{significant differences were found between}} CO 2 and flue gas biomass and lipid <b>productivities.</b> While grown using CO 2 and flue gas, biomass <b>productivities</b> were 10, 13 and 18 %, and 7, 14 and 19 % higher than NaHCO 3, HCl and unregulated pH for T. suecica and Chlorella sp, respectively. Addition of inorganic carbon increased specific growth rate and lipid content but reduced biomass yield and cell weight of T. suecica. Addition of inorganic carbon increased yield but did not change specific growth rate, cell weight or content of the cell weight of Chlorella sp. Both strains showed significantly higher maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) when grown under optimum pH...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the optimal endowments of public investment in Spanish regions. Starting from the standard dynamic neoclassical model, augmented with the public capital stock, the optimal condition for the provision of public capital would be that, in the steady state, the marginal <b>productivities</b> of both public and private capital should be equal. In the empirical application we will estimate a growth equation derived from a simple Cobb-Douglas production function, where the coefficients on the rates of investment in private and public capital would be their respective marginal <b>productivities.</b> The econometric estimation of such an equation with data for the Spanish regions would provide us estimates of the marginal <b>productivities</b> of both factors, which would allow us to infer whether public capital stock in the Spanish regions would be insufficient or otherwise excessive. ...|$|R
25|$|Experiments {{on human}} {{behavior}} have special concerns. The famous Hawthorne study examined {{changes to the}} working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company.

However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness. The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker <b>productivity)</b> changed due to observation itself.
