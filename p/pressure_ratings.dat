40|$|Objective: Work stress {{contributes}} to risk of {{coronary heart disease}} and hypertension. This study tested the influence of job control on ambulatory blood <b>pressure,</b> and <b>ratings</b> of perceived stress and happiness in men and women systematically sampled by socio-economic status from the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort. Participants: A total of 227 men and women aged 47 - 59 years sampled from higher, intermediate and lower employment grades. Outcome measures: Ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> and <b>ratings</b> of stress, perceived control and happiness. Methods: Participants completed standard measures of job demands and job control, and undertook ambulatory monitoring with measures of blood pressure and subjective state every 20 min from early in the working day until going to bed. Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were greater in participants reporting low rather than high job control (means 125. 7 / 81. 5 versus 122. 4 / 78. 6 mmHg, P < 0. 05), independently of gender, employment grade, body mass index, age, smoking status, and physical activity. Differences persisted into the evening after work. Job demands and job strain (high demand/low control) were not associated with blood pressure. Participants reporting low job control experienced stress more frequently over the working day than did those with high job control. Higher socio-economic status participants and women were more stressed by low job control than were men and people of lower socio-economic status. Conclusions: Job control {{plays an important role}} in modulating cardiovascular and affective responses over the working day, and these responses may contribute to increased cardiovascular disease risk. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the antinociceptive effects of smoking in nine habitual smokers under deprived (12 h) and minimally-deprived (< 30 min) conditions. Pain threshold for thermal stimuli, heart rate, blood <b>pressure</b> and <b>ratings</b> of mood, arousal, dominance and well-being were assessed before and after smoking a cigarette. Overall, smoking affected all measured variables in the expected direction, leading to increased physiological activity, elevated pain threshold and improved mood. However, most of these effects depended on the deprivation status of the subjects, such that smoking after deprivation increased pain threshold whereas smoking after minimal deprivation did not. Pain threshold before smoking was the same for both groups. Deprived subjects had lower pre-smoke diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and arousal levels, which rose to equal minimally-deprived subjects scores after smoking...|$|R

However, little is known regarding the effect of aging on exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH). The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine age differences in EIH after submaximal isometric exercise and moderate and vigorous aerobic exercise. Healthy older and younger adults completed 1 training session and 4 testing sessions consisting of a submaximal isometric handgrip exercise, vigorous or moderate intensity stationary cycling, or quiet rest (control). The following measures were taken before and after exercise/quiet rest: 1) pressure pain thresholds, 2) suprathreshold <b>pressure</b> pain <b>ratings,</b> 3) pain ratings during 30 seconds of prolonged noxious heat stimulation, and 4) temporal summation of heat pain. The results revealed age differences in EIH after isometric and aerobic exercise, with younger adults experiencing greater EIH compared with older adults.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of physical activity in water from the perspective of blood pressure responses in middle-aged and elderly women for whom water exercise is recommended. Subjects comprised 22 middle-aged and elderly women who regularly go swimming or participate in water exercise in a sports club. A flowmill was used as the exercise stress device and water depth was adjusted to the height of the xiphoid process for each subject. Water temperature was controlled to 30 ℃. After resting by sitting on a chair for 5 min, each subject performed 4 sessions of walking in water. Each session lasted 4 min at different levels of difficulty (20, 30, 40 and 50 m/min), with a 1 -min rest between each session. Oxygen uptake, ventilation and heart rate were monitored during walking and blood lactate concentration, blood <b>pressure,</b> and <b>Ratings</b> of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Feeling Scores (FS) were measured immediately after exertion. Although no subject was receiving treatment for blood pressure-related problems, increased systolic or diastolic pressures were observed in 18 subjects (81. 8 %).

40|$|Taste is a {{property}} that {{is thought to}} potentially modulate swallowing behavior. Whether such effects depend on taste, intensity remains unclear. This study explored differences in the amplitudes of tongue-palate pressures in swallowing {{as a function of}} taste stimulus concentration. Tongue-palate pressures were collected in 80 healthy women, in two age groups (under 40, over 60), stratified by genetic taste status (nontasters, supertasters). Liquids with different taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) were presented in high and low concentrations. General labeled magnitude scale ratings captured perceived taste intensity and liking/disliking of the test liquids. Path analysis explored whether factors of taste, concentration, age group, and/or genetic taste status impacted: (1) perceived intensity; (2) palatability; and (3) swallowing <b>pressures.</b> Higher <b>ratings</b> of perceived intensity were found in supertasters and with higher concentrations, which were more liked/disliked than lower concentrations. Sweet stimuli were more palatable than sour, salty, or bitter stimuli. Higher concentrations elicited stronger tongue-palate pressures independently and in association with intensity ratings. The perceived intensity of a taste stimulus varies as a function of stimulus concentration, taste quality, participant age, and genetic taste status and influences swallowing pressure amplitudes. High-concentration salty and sour stimuli elicit the greatest tongue-palate pressures...|$|R

40|$|Conditioned pain {{modulation}} (CPM) {{refers to}} the diminution of perceived pain intensity for a test stimulus following application of a conditioning stimulus to a remote area of the body, and is thought to reflect the descending inhibition of nociceptive signals. Studying CPM in children may inform interventions to enhance central pain inhibition within a developmental framework. We assessed CPM in 133 healthy children (mean age =  13 years; 52. 6 % girls) and tested the effects of sex and age. Participants were exposed to 4 trials of a pressure test stimulus before, during, and after {{the application of a}} cold water conditioning stimulus. CPM was documented by a reduction in <b>pressure</b> pain <b>ratings</b> during cold water administration. Older children (12 - 17 years) exhibited greater CPM than younger children (8 - 11 years). No sex differences in CPM were found. Lower heart rate variability at baseline and after pain induction was associated with less CPM, controlling for child age. The findings of greater CPM in the older age cohort suggest a developmental improvement in central pain inhibitory mechanisms. The results highlight the need to examine developmental and contributory factors in central pain inhibitory mechanisms in children to guide effective, age appropriate pain interventions. PERSPECTIVE: In this healthy sample, younger children exhibited less CPM than did older adolescents, suggesting a developmental improvement in CPM. Cardiac vagal tone was associated with CPM across age. The current findings may inform the development of targeted, developmentally appropriate pain interventions for children...|$|R

With {{the proliferation of}} social networks embedded in online rating platforms, users participate in opinion sharing activities in a socially enriched manner. This study unpacks social influences in online rating behaviors. We differentiate between the influences from two types of online social relationships: informant relationship and friend relationship. Each relationship triggers different social mechanisms and results in different impacts on rating decisions. Based on a twostage model, we investigate the social relationship-specific influences in rating posting and evaluation stage. The model is empirically estimated using data from a popular Chinese social-networking website. Our findings suggest the social influences from informant and friend relationship are distinctive and interdependent. Online friends' <b>ratings</b> exert conformity <b>pressure</b> while informants' <b>ratings</b> crowd out new ratings.
