5|$|Corrupt <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> already {{beginning}} to speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Several {{writers and}} <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with Fleet Street, either as residents or regulars {{to the various}} taverns, including Ben Jonson, John Milton, Izaak Walton, John Dryden, Edmund Burke, Oliver Goldsmith and Charles Lamb. The lexicographer Samuel Johnson lived at Gough Square off Fleet Street between 1748 and 1759; the building has survived into the 21st century. The cartographer John Senex owned a map store, The Sign of the Globe, on Fleet Street between 1725 and his death in 1736. Wynkyn de Worde was buried in St. Bride's Church in 1535, as was poet Richard Lovelace in 1657, while Samuel Pepys was baptised there in 1633.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{negotiations}} from succeeding, Price rigs the Summit {{hotel with}} explosives. To prevent Pakistani President Mudasser (Nicholas Khan) and Home Secretary Andrew Lawrence (Tobias Menzies) from escaping, he paralyses both of them. Learning Price {{is in the}} hotel, Lucas and Ros arrive and capture him. Since disarming the bomb is impossible, Ros threatens to leave Price behind when the bomb explodes unless he divulges the room both <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> held. Although Price eventually discloses the room number, Ros leaves him {{in the room where}} the bomb is anyway. Lucas is able to carry Mudasser safely out of the hotel, where he recovers and orders the release of the Indian submarine, preventing the war. However, Ros is still in the hotel, struggling to pull Lawrence to safety. As Lucas runs back to aid her, the hotel explodes, killing Lawrence, Price and Ros.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, Iceland re-emerged as {{a fishing}} power {{and entered the}} Cod Wars. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, fishing off the European and American coasts {{severely}} depleted stocks and become a major political issue. The necessity of restricting catches to allow stocks to recover upset the fishing industry and <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> reluctant to hurt employment.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} and continuity {{of a state}} is only a factual issue, not a legal question. Declarations and recognition by other states can't have any impact on their existence. According to the declaratory theory of recognition, the recognition of third states are not a requirement for being a state. Most of the cited declarations by American or British <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> not legal statements but solely political intents.|$|E

25|$|Several {{economists and}} {{political}} scientists {{have argued that}} economic inequality translates into political inequality, particularly in situations where politicians have financial incentives to respond to special interest groups and lobbyists. Researchers such as Larry Bartels of Vanderbilt University have shown that <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> significantly more responsive to the political opinions of the wealthy, even when controlling {{for a range of}} variables including educational attainment and political knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Egypt {{are among the}} lowest in the world. Despite their affordability, almost half the bills are not paid and <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> {{reluctant}} to increase tariffs, especially since the Arab Spring. Thus only a fraction of costs is recovered through revenues from tariffs. The shortfall in revenues is partly made up by government subsidies for investment and operations at the tune of USD 2.5bn per year, of which only about 10 percent is financed by external donors.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005 Boyce {{was among}} the several retired Chiefs of Defence Staff who spoke in the House of Lords about the risk to {{servicemen}} facing liability for their actions – for which he claims <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> ultimately responsible – before the International Criminal Court. He gave evidence to The Iraq Inquiry on 3 December 2009. He was created a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in April 2011 and is currently {{a member of the}} Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Corsi's Atomic Iran: How the Terrorist Regime Bought the Bomb and American Politicians was {{published}} by WND Books with an introduction by Craig R. Smith. In the book he claims Democratic <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> corrupted by Iranian money and are helping the mullahs, who seek nuclear weapons, in Tehran. Corsi accused an aide for John Kerry of helping the mullahs, who strongly rejected the claim. To promote the book, Corsi appeared in conservative venues such as on Hannity & Colmes on April 8, 2005, at the Heritage Foundation, and on WEJEW Radio.|$|E

25|$|Nakagawa's {{views were}} close to those of Abe. In particular, both support {{nationalism}} in history education, a hard-line stance regarding North Korea and constitutional amendments. Abe has made efforts to relink ties with neighbouring China, while Nakagawa officially voiced his concern over the country's growing military expenditure, claiming that, were the situation in Taiwan to deteriorate, Japan would become, by 2020, a Chinese colony. Despite {{that most of the}} mainstream conservative LDP <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> usually known for their persistent pro-Americanism, Nakagawa was especially known for his pro-Taiwanism in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Tri-Rail {{service on}} the FEC line would bring {{stations}} to Downtown Miami's transit hub, Government Center Station via the new MiamiCentral station under construction for All Aboard Florida's Brightline service, as well as service in Midtown Miami/Miami Design District, Upper East Side/Miami Shores, North Miami, North Miami Beach/Aventura, Downtown Hollywood, and Downtown Fort Lauderdale, putting it {{within walking distance of}} thousands of potential riders. Getting to and from the current stations has always been a major detractor of Tri-Rail's convenience since opening. Miami's Downtown Development Authority along with Miami-area <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> actively lobbying to bring Tri-Rail to the city core.|$|E
25|$|In the 'lower house' <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> {{elected to}} {{represent}} smaller constituencies. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent {{states in a}} federal system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a house of review. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that {{the upper and lower}} houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of such {{government}} power over religion, <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> sometimes accused of playing vote bank politics, i.e. of giving political support to issues {{for the sole purpose of}} gaining the votes of members of a particular community, including religious communities. Both the Indian National Congress party and the Bharitiya Janata Party (BJP) have been accused of exploiting the people by indulging in vote bank politics. The Shah Bano case, a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the Supreme Court's decision. After the 2002 Gujarat violence, there were allegations of political parties indulging in vote bank politics.|$|E
25|$|McKenna {{was born}} in Apohaqui, New Brunswick, Canada. He {{was raised in the}} home of his grandparents, who lived {{adjacent}} to his parents, because his large family could not be wholly housed in his parents' home. After completing high school in Sussex, New Brunswick, he completed a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Economics at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He began graduate studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, but after working for a stint with Allan MacEachen he took MacEachen's advice that most <b>politicians</b> <b>are</b> lawyers and enrolled in law school at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. After he obtained a law degree, he moved to Chatham, New Brunswick, and began the practice of law. He became famous and something of a folk hero, particularly among Acadians, as the defence lawyer in the high-profile murder case of famous New Brunswick boxing champion, Yvon Durelle, in what was a widely publicized case.|$|E
