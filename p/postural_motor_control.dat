40|$|We {{address the}} {{hypothesis}} that postures adopted during grammatical pauses in speech production are more "mechanically advantageous" than absolute rest positions for facilitating efficient <b>postural</b> <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> of vocal tract articulators. We quantify vocal tract posture corresponding to inter-speech pauses, absolute rest intervals as well as vowel and consonant intervals using automated analysis of video captured with real-time magnetic resonance imaging during production of read and spontaneous speech by 5 healthy speakers of American English. We then use locally-weighted linear regression to estimate the articulatory forward map from low-level articulator variables to high-level task/goal variables for these postures. We quantify the overall magnitude of the first derivative of the forward map {{as a measure of}} mechanical advantage. We find that postures assumed during grammatical pauses in speech as well as speech-ready postures are significantly more mechanically advantageous than postures assumed during absolute rest. Further, these postures represent empirical extremes of mechanical advantage, between which lie the postures assumed during various vowels and consonants. Relative mechanical advantage of different postures might be an important physical constraint influencing planning and control of speech production...|$|E

40|$|A well-characterized {{neural network}} is {{associated}} with motor learning, involving several brain regions known to have functional and structural deficits in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, {{it is not known}} how MS affects postural motor learning or the neural networks involved. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain a better understanding of the neural networks underlying adaptation of postural responses within PwMS. Participants stood on a hydraulically driven, servo-controlled platform that translated horizontally forward and backward in a continuous sinusoidal pattern across multiple trials over two consecutive days. Our results show similar postural adaptation between PwMS and age-matched control participants despite overall deficits in <b>postural</b> <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> in PwMS. Moreover, PwMS demonstrated better retention the following day. PwMS had significantly reduced functional connectivity within both the cortico-cerebellar and cortico-striatal motor loops; neural networks that subserve implicit motor learning. In PwMS, greater connectivity strength within the cortico-cerebellar circuit was strongly related to better baseline postural control, but not to postural adaptation as it was in control participants. Further, anti-correlated cortico-striatal connectivity within the right hemisphere was related to improved postural adaptation in both groups. Taken together with previous studies showing a reduced reliance on cerebellar- and proprioceptive-related feedback control in PwMS, we suggest that PwMS may rely on cortico-striatal circuitry to a greater extent than cortico-cerebellar circuitry for the acquisition and retention of motor skills...|$|E

40|$|Mammals adopt {{a limited}} number of postures during their day-to-day activities. These stereotyped {{skeletal}} configurations are functionally adequate and limit the number of degrees of freedom to be controlled by the central nervous system. The temporal pattern of emergence of these configurations in altricial mammals is unknown. We therefore carried out an X-ray study in unrestrained rats from birth (P 0) until postnatal day 23 (P 23). The X-rays showed that many of the skeletal configurations described in adult rodents were already present at birth. By contrast, limb placement changed abruptly at around P 10. These skeletal configurations, observed in anesthetized pups, required the maintenance of precise <b>motor</b> <b>control.</b> On the other hand, <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> continued to mature, as shown by progressive changes in resting posture and head movements from P 0 to P 23. We suggest that a few innate skeletal configurations provide the necessary frames of reference for the gradual construction of an adult motor repertoire in altricial mammals, such as the rat. The apparent absence of a requirement for external sensorial cues in the maturation of this repertoire may account for the maturation of <b>postural</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> in utero in precocial mammals (Muir et al., 2000 for a review on the locomotor behavior of altricial and precocial animals) ...|$|R

40|$|Study Design. A {{cross-sectional}} study between subgroups of nonspecific chronic {{low back pain}} (NSCLBP) and asymptomatic controls. Objective. To investigate NSCLBP subgroup differences in spinal position sense and trunk muscle activity when repositioning thoracic and lumbar spine into neutral (midrange) spinal position during sitting and standing. Summary of Background Data. Patients with NSCLBP report aggravation of symptoms during sitting and standing. Impaired <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> in NSCLBP, associated with sitting and standing postures nearer the end range of spinal motion, may be a contributing factor. Rehabilitation improving neutral (midrange) spinal position control is advocated. <b>Postural</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> alterations vary in different NSCLBP subgroups, potentially requiring specific postural interventions. There is limited evidence on whether subgroup differences exist when performing neutral spine position tasks. Methods. Ninety patients with NSCLBP and 35 asymptomatic controls were recruited. Two blinded practitioners classified NSCLBP into subgroups of active extension pattern and flexion pattern. Participants were assisted into neutral spine position and asked to reproduce this position 4 times. Absolute, variable, and constant errors were calculated. Three-dimensional thoracic and lumbar kinematics quantified the repositioning accuracy and surface electromyography assessed back and abdominal muscles activity bilaterally. Results. Irrespective of subclassification, patients with NSCLBP produced significantly greater error magnitude and variability than the asymptomatic controls, but subgroup differences were detected in the error direction. Subgroup differences in the trunk muscle activity were not consistently identified. Although both subgroups produced significantly higher abdominal activity, subclassification revealed difference in superficial multifidus activity during standing, with flexion pattern producing significantly greater activity than the asymptomatic controls. Conclusion. Subgroups of NSCLBP had similar neutral spinal position deficits regarding error magnitude and variability, but subclassification revealed clear subgroup differences {{in the direction of}} the deficit. The trunk muscle activation was shown to be largely nondiscriminatory between subgroups, with the exception of superficial lumbar multifidus...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral palsy {{represents}} {{a complex and}} extremely varied group of developmental conditions or syndromes and cer-tainly cannot be considered a single disorder. 1 By definition, these conditions begin very early in a child’s formation, whether during the intrauterine period or {{in the months after}} an infant’s birth. What the cerebral palsies have in common are impairments in the developing central nervous system that affect the development of <b>postural</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>control.</b> The impact on the child is therefore to influence both what they can and cannot accomplish in motor activities, the quality of <b>motor</b> <b>control,</b> and, as a consequence, the expe-riences they have as children growing up. 2 Obviously, any condition that affects the development of the central ner-vous system is likely to impact on other central nervous sys-tem–related functions and increase the prevalence of issues such as learning difficulties, impaired sensory function, behavioral problems, and epilepsy. 3 When we speak of “treatment ” or “therapy ” for a con-dition, what exactly do we mean? In many areas of acute care medicine treatment is based on a specific diagnosis, arrived at by a deductive process that rules out possible explana-tions for the signs and symptoms until the correct diagno-sis is reached. At that point, a treatment program can be offered that is more or less specific to that disorder and at times may represent a curative intervention. The prototype examples would be infectious diseases, for which the accu-rate identification of the infectious agent enables clinicians to provide therapy based on the sensitivity of the agent to the possible antimicrobial agents. For protean conditions such as the cerebral palsies, no such specific treatments are available. It is certainly true that an increasing number of medical therapies (such as intrathe-cal bacolfen 4 and botulinum toxin 5) and surgical interventions (selective dorsal rhizotomy 6) have been shown to moderate spasticity, an almost universal finding in people with cere...|$|R

Two surgeons performed the same procedure of R-Lap and C-Lap low anterior resection, and real-time surface electromyography was recorded in bilateral cervical erector spinae, upper trapezius (UT) and anterior deltoid muscles for over 60  min in each procedure. In one surgeon, forearm muscle activities were also recorded during robotic surgery. Similar levels of cervical muscle activity were demonstrated in both types of surgery. One surgeon showed much higher activity in the left UT muscle during robotic surgery. In the second surgeon, C-Lap was associated with much higher levels of muscle activity in both UT muscles. This {{may be related to}} the bilateral abducted arm posture required in maneuvering the laparoscopic instruments. In the forearm region, the "ulnaris" muscles for wrist flexion and extension bilaterally showed high amplitudes during robotic-assisted surgery. Robotic-assisted surgery seemed to demand a higher level of muscle work in the forearm region while greater efforts of shoulder muscles were involved during laparoscopic surgery. There are also individual variations in <b>postural</b> habits and <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> that can affect the muscle activation patterns.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} {{capacity}} for acquisition and retention of practice-related improvements in compensatory posture control and the nature of <b>postural</b> <b>motor</b> learning among healthy young and older adults repeatedly exposed to continuous surface motion via a translating platform. Although much research has been conducted to examine the strategies adopted by the central nervous system to control posture in response to external perturbations, the learning capabilities of this system have remained relatively unexplored. Many of the studies that have explored practice-related changes in balance performance have focused on short-term adaptations to highly predictable stimuli. Borrowing from implicit sequence learning paradigms, we developed two experimental protocols to examine <b>postural</b> <b>motor</b> learning for a compensatory balance task in an environment with limited predictability. Applying key principles of motor learning to our experimental design including retention intervals and a transfer task enabled us to draw conclusions about the permanency and specificity of the observed changes. Our investigations revealed practice-related changes in the motor organization of posture control. In young adults, a shift in the complexity of the control strategy occurred which lead to improvements in spatial and temporal control of the COM. In contrast, a majority of older adults persisted with a simplified control strategy which restricted improvements in COM control. Importantly, despite control strategy differences, the two groups showed comparable rates of improvement in almost all outcome measures including measures of trunk stability and temporal COM control. Longer-term retention of behavioural changes provided evidence for learning in young adults. Similar maintenance of improvements was observed for some outcome measures in older adults. Where significant losses in performance occurred in this group, retention was evident in the rapid reacquisition of performance to the level of proficiency achieved in original practice. Based on these results, we concluded that age affected the adapted control strategy but not the capacity for <b>postural</b> <b>motor</b> learning. Further, regardless of age or protocol, the pattern of postural perturbations did not influence acquisition of a strategy of stability and thus, we concluded that <b>postural</b> <b>motor</b> learning under the current conditions was non-specific, that is, it did not involve sequence-specific learning. These results provide important insight into the generalized nature of compensatory <b>postural</b> <b>motor</b> learning and subsequently, into the potential for positive transfer of balance skill to other balance tasks...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} how the brainstem reticular formation controls and coordinates trunk and hindlimb muscle activity, we used optical recording to characterize the functional connections between medullary reticulospinal neurons and lumbar motoneurons of the L 2 segment in the neonatal mouse. In an isolated brainstem–spinal cord preparation, synaptically induced calcium transients were visualized in individual MNs of the ipsilateral and contralateral medial and lateral motor columns (MMC, LMC) following focal electrical stimulation of the medullary reticular formation (MRF). Stimulation of the MRF elicited differential responses in MMC and LMC, according to a specific spatial organization. Stimulation of the medial MRF elicited responses predominantly in the LMC whereas stimulation of the lateral MRF elicited responses predominantly in the MMC. This reciprocal response pattern was observed on both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the spinal cord. To ascertain whether the regions stimulated contained reticulospinal neurons, we retrogradely labelled MRF neurons with axons coursing in different spinal funiculi, and compared the distributions of the labelled neurons to the stimulation sites. We found {{a large number of}} retrogradely labelled neurons within regions of the gigantocellularis reticular nucleus (including its pars ventralis and alpha) where most stimulation sites were located. The existence of a mediolateral organization within the MRF, whereby distinct populations of reticulospinal neurons predominantly influence medial or lateral motoneurons, provides an anatomical substrate for the differential control of trunk and hindlimb muscles. Such an organization introduces flexibility in the initiation and coordination of activity in the two sets of muscles that would satisfy many of the functional requirements that arise during <b>postural</b> and non-postural <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> in mammals...|$|R

Management strategies help to support and enhance the CWCP’s upper extremity function {{so that they may}} engage with the activities of daily living. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review previous literature on the influence of postural control towards upper extremity function. Literature searches were conducted in various electronic databases, including ProQuest, Science Direct, Springer Link, Sage, Wiley Online Library, and Google Scholar using specific key terms. Search terms included children with cerebral palsy; postural control; postural adjustments; upper extremity function; reaching and sitting and from references of retrieved articles. Nineteen journal articles published between 2000 and May 2015 were found. Most search results consisted of experimental studies, while others are reviews, case studies, and cross-sectional studies. Findings show that, postural control has a major influence on upper extremity function. In conclusion, it is necessary to highlight the importance of both factors to the CWCP parents or caregivers, as understanding and awareness on this matter is still inadequate in the community. Hence, a study is needed on the awareness of the postural control influence on upper extremity function among caregivers, as well as examining the implementation of management strategies in community settings...|$|R

Plan-based control (i. e., direction of the CoP displacement {{in the first part of}} the target-directed movement) improved by anticipating the sequence order in the implicit condition but not in the explicit dual task condition. Only the young participants were able to use the explicit knowledge of the sequence structure to improve the directional error as indicated by a significant decrease in directional error over practice and an increase in directional error with sequence removal in the explicit single task condition. Time spent in the second part of the movement trajectory to stabilize the cursor on the target location improved over training in both the implicit and explicit sequence learning conditions, for both age groups.
