5|$|Eastern Air Lines {{operated}} {{the first commercial}} 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route. On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets. Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year. Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners. Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose. Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater <b>payload</b> <b>capability</b> than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn {{and the use of}} a two-crew member flight deck. Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{requests}} from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater <b>payload</b> <b>capability.</b> With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E

40|$|The present {{stable of}} launch {{vehicles}} represents the state-of-the-art {{of the sixties}} or seventies and are exendable vehicles {{with the exception of}} the Space Shuttle which is partly reusable. <b>Payload</b> <b>capabilities</b> reach from a few hundred kilograms to about twenty tons to low Earth orbit. The cost per launch are about 50 M$ for a DELTA vehicle up to 550 M$ for a crewed SPACE SHUTTLE. The cost effectiveness is on the order of 10, 000 $/kg for low Earth orbits. To expand space activities in the next century fully reusable vehicles with larger <b>payload</b> <b>capabilities</b> are needed. This paper analyses some of the most attractive options of launch vehicles such as the single-stage-to-orbit vehicle and heavy lift launchers for near Earth and lunar missions. Government type operations as well as commercial enterprises are analysed. It is shown that the <b>payload</b> <b>capabilities</b> can be increased by an order of magnitude and the specific transportation cost can be decresed by an order of magnitude. Commerical operations will most likely more than double the space transportation cost. This report comprises 39 pages, 43 tables, 8 figures and 14 references. (orig.)

25|$|Brill's work in {{satellite}} {{propulsion systems}} {{resulted in a}} number of significant developments. She developed the concept for a new rocket engine, the hydrazine resistojet, and she proposed the use of a single propellant because of the value and simplicity that it would provide.

500|$|The 757 was {{intended}} to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727.

Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency. The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) was set at , which was [...] more than the 727. The 757's higher power-to-weight ratio allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in hot and high climates, offering better takeoff performance than that offered by competing aircraft.
