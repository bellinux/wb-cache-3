25|$|Tuna {{purse seiners}} are large purse seiners, {{normally}} over 45 metres, {{equipped to handle}} large and heavy purse seines for tuna. They have the same general arrangement as the American seiner, with the bridge and accommodation placed forward. A crows nest or tuna tower is positioned {{at the top of}} the mast, outfitted with the control and manoeuvre devices. A very heavy boom which carries the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> is fitted at the mast. They often carry a helicopter to search for tuna schools. On the deck are three drum purse seine winches and a <b>power</b> <b>block,</b> with other specific winches to handle the heavy boom and net. They are usually equipped with a skiff.|$|E

40|$|The theory {{presented}} in this paper, unlike the classical theory of voting power, makes a distinction between <b>blocking</b> <b>power</b> and winning power and relates the <b>blocking</b> <b>power</b> of a voter {{to the number of}} small-size blocking coalitions the voter can form with other voters. The theory of <b>blocking</b> <b>power</b> sheds light on the practice of designing voting systems for EU Council of Ministers from the beginning to the recent dispute over the Nice and Lisbon voting systems and alternative systems based on square root weights. The paper also offers a method for analyzing blocking opportunities the members of an assembly have in their bilateral relations. The method is illustrated by the change in Franco-German balance of <b>blocking</b> <b>power</b> that would follow the replacement of Nice voting rules with the Lisbon system.

50|$|The Puretic <b>power</b> <b>block</b> {{line was}} {{introduced}} in the 1950s and was the key factor in the mechanization of purse seining. The combination of these blocks with advances in fluid hydraulics and the new large synthetic nets changed the character of purse seine fishing. The original Puretic <b>power</b> <b>block</b> was driven by an endless rope from the warping head of a winch. Nowadays, power blocks are usually driven by hydraulic pumps powered by the main or auxiliary engine. Their rpm, pull and direction can be controlled remotely.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of power}} blocks {{was found to have}} further advantages. It is {{possible}} to fish in rougher weather with the <b>power</b> <b>block,</b> because the steady force exerted by the net stabilizes the vessel. When deployments are made which miss the schooling fish, the net can be rapidly retrieved and redeployed on the same school. The <b>power</b> <b>block</b> also makes it easy to get nets aboard in emergencies, such as a sudden shift in tides or winds, or shark attacks on the catch and net.|$|E
