25|$|One {{avenue of}} {{individual}} appeal from government action {{which continues to}} be important is the custom of xìnfǎng or petitions by citizens to the individuals officials for change. The continuing wide use of xìnfǎng {{reflects the fact that}} many officials are still able to avoid legal sanctions and the underlying avoidance of the legal system, as well as the <b>personal</b> <b>ability</b> of officials to personally intervene to change unjust results. Recently xìnfǎng has been institutionalized to some extent with the central government mandating that every level of administration establish a xìnfǎng office to handle petitions and report them up to high levels. This solution by exertion of personal power clearly goes against the idea of rule of law, and worse, some scholars have noted that xìnfǎng today functions more as an informational collection system for the government than an effective review mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reign of}} Kulothunga Chola III {{is a story}} of the triumph of the <b>personal</b> <b>ability</b> of the monarch against the forces of {{disruption}} that were steadily increasing in their number and in the intensity of their action. Kulothunga Chola III brought order to the besieged kingdom and reversed the weakness in the Chola administration that had set in during the rule of his predecessors Rajaraja Chola II and Rajadhiraja Chola II. During the rule of his predecessors Rajaraja Chola II and his successor Rajadhiraja Chola II between 11461178 CE, [...] "the hold of the central administration over the outlying parts of the empire was becoming less firm; and even at the centre, the administrative system was beginning to betray signs of weakness. Everywhere feudatory chieftains were becoming more and more assertive." [...] "The growing independence of the central power on the part of feudatories noticed in the reign of Rajaraja Chola II became more pronounced under Rajadhiraja Chola II. The Sambuvaraya, Kadavaraya, Malaiyaman chieftains and the Telugu-Chodas of Nellore were making wars and alliances in the northern half of the Chola kingdom without any reference to the ruling monarch." ...|$|E

Although he had never offered to undertake such a task, he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sent to him, with one exception, and that exception he proved conclusively was only an imposture, for which no solution was possible.|$|E

60|$|This cabal has, {{with great}} success, {{propagated}} a doctrine which serves for a color to those acts of treachery; and whilst it receives {{any degree of}} countenance it will be utterly senseless {{to look for a}} vigorous opposition to the court party. The doctrine is this: That all political connections are in their nature factious, and as such ought to be dissipated and destroyed; and that the rule for forming administrations is more <b>personal</b> <b>ability,</b> rated by the judgment of this cabal upon it, and taken by draughts from every division and denomination of public men. This decree was solemnly promulgated by the head of the court corps, the Earl of Bute himself, in a speech which he made, in the year 1766, against the then administration, the only administration which he has ever been known directly and publicly to oppose.|$|E
6000|$|Things {{always bring}} their own {{philosophy}} with them, that is, prudence. No man acquires property without acquiring with it a little arithmetic, also. In England, the richest country that ever existed, property stands for more, compared with <b>personal</b> <b>ability,</b> than in any other. After dinner, a man believes less, denies more; verities have lost some charm. After dinner, arithmetic is the only science; ideas are disturbing, incendiary, follies of young men, repudiated by the solid portion of society; and a man comes to be valued by his athletic and animal qualities. Spence relates, that Mr. Pope was with Sir Godfrey Kneller one day, when his nephew, a Guinea trader, came in. [...] "Nephew," [...] said Sir Godfrey, [...] "you have the honor of seeing the two greatest men in the world." [...] "I don't know how great men you may be," [...] said the Guinea man, [...] "but I don't like your looks. I have often bought a man much better than both of you, all muscles and bones, for ten guineas. Thus, {{the men of the}} senses revenge themselves on the professors, and repay scorn for scorn. The first had leaped to conclusions not yet ripe, and say more than is true; the others make themselves merry with the philosopher, and weigh man by the pound.--They believe that mustard bites the tongue, that pepper is hot, friction-matches are incendiary, revolvers to be avoided, and suspenders hold up pantaloons; that there is much sentiment in a chest of tea; and a man will be eloquent, if you give him good wine.
