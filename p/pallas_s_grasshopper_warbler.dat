50|$|In the {{breeding}} season, the common <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is found in}} damp or dry places with rough grass and bushes such as the edges of fens, clearings, neglected hedgerows, heaths, upland moors, gorse-covered areas, young plantations and felled woodland. In the winter, it is usually found in similar locations but information is scarce on its behaviour and habitat at this time.|$|R
50|$|This site {{comprises}} swamp, mire and grassland habitats {{which are}} now rare in Britain. It is the largest known example of its type in Somerset and the communities present are near the western limit of their geographical range. The flora includes corky-fruited water-dropwort (Oenanthe pimpinelloides) which is a nationally scarce species.

The range {{includes}} Spain, France, central Italy, Romania, Yugoslavia, the British Isles, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, southern Sweden, southern Finland, the Baltic States and western parts of Russia. Further east it is replaced by related species. In late summer, it migrates to north west Africa, India and Sri Lanka where it overwinters.|$|R
50|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} known to use the viaduct as a vantage point, and kestrels and buzzards are regular visitors. The reserve’s {{habitats}} of wildflower meadows benefit from regular grazing by Longhorn cattle, and the ponds have had their fish removed to allow aquatic wildlife to flourish. The scrub along the reserve fringe supports several summer migrants including whitethroats, sedge warblers, and the <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
