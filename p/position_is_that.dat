5|$|The {{consequence}} of this <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the thugs win and people have more incentive to be thugs. There {{are lots of people}} out there who would very much like to get certain kind of material removed, whether religious or political. The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.|$|E
5|$|Tähtinen {{concludes that}} Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, {{and that a}} king in {{particular}} is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if {{they happen to be}} his own brothers and sons.|$|E
5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E

50|$|Copps' <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Valeri {{should have}} sought the {{nomination}} in Niagara West-Glanbrook, where he resided {{and in which}} there was a regional airport that would complement his transport portfolio. Valeri's <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the majority of his former Stoney Creek constituents lived in the new Hamilton East—Stoney Creek riding, Copps no longer lived in Hamilton and he resided less than 100 metres from the riding boundary.|$|R
50|$|The dilemma thus, {{was whether}} Malays should accept this {{governmental}} aid—and Mahathir's <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they should.|$|R
5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{in which the}} most powerful executive <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of direct democracy. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E
5|$|Companies {{object to}} being blamed for shark bite incidents, {{pointing}} out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> further {{research needs to be}} done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior. One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.|$|E
25|$|The flying of two ensigns of two {{different}} countries, one above the other, on the same staff {{is a sign that}} the vessel concerned has been captured or has surrendered during wartime. The ensign flying in the inferior, or lower, <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the country the ship has been captured from: conversely, the ensign flying in the superior, or upper <b>position,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the country that has captured the ship.|$|E

50|$|For {{contingent}} reasons {{having to}} do with the Inquisition, Descartes spoke of motion as both absolute and relative. However, his real <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> motion <b>is</b> absolute.|$|R
50|$|The Warsaw pact {{response}} to NATO's <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each side should reduce its forces proportionally rather than absolutely, and that equipment {{as well as}} troop numbers should be reduced.|$|R
25|$|Therefore, the Calvinist <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jesus {{did not die}} for everyone, {{but only}} for those whom the Father purposed to save.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{maritime}} boundary should follow the land boundary. The American <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the maritime}} boundary should extend along a path equidistant from {{the coasts of}} the two nations. The disputed area may hold significant hydrocarbon reserves. The US has already leased eight plots of terrain below the water to search for and possibly bring to market oil reserves that may exist there. Canada has protested diplomatically in response.|$|E

50|$|Having {{returned}} to Finland, Liljebald {{worked as a}} pastor in Kirvu in 1920-1922 and in Simpele in 1922-1924. His last <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of vicar of Ruskeala, near Sortavala, in 1924-1937.|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinction}} between the two <b>positions</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copywriting or art directing positions. Design directors, on the other hand, are promoted from senior designer positions.|$|R
50|$|In Roman law, the <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> in an exchange, one cannot {{distinguish}} {{which party}} is buyer (lessee) {{and which the}} seller (lessor). This presents a problem, as their duties are very different.|$|R
25|$|The longstanding {{traditional}} Jewish <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated {{among the}} Jewish people, as their {{first and most}} sacred institution. The origins of Shabbat and a seven-day week are not clear to scholars; the Mosaic tradition claims an origin from the Biblical creation.|$|E
25|$|Tähtinen {{concludes that}} Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, {{and that a}} king in {{particular}} is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if {{they happen to be}} his own brothers and sons.|$|E
25|$|The Bank of Canada {{currently}} has no specific target {{value for the}} Canadian dollar and has not intervened in foreign exchange markets since 1998.

25|$|Clark {{held that}} the Scriptures {{constituted}} the axioms of Christian thought, {{which could not be}} questioned, though their consistency could be discussed. A consequence of this <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> God's existence can never be demonstrated, either by empirical means or by philosophical argument. In The Justification of Knowledge, the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not even attempt such proofs.|$|E
25|$|The Government of the People's Republic of China {{has argued}} that its concept of 'Asian values' {{requires}} that {{the welfare of the}} collective should always be put ahead of the rights of any individual whenever conflicts between these arise. Its <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the government has the responsibility to design, implement and enforce a 'harmonious socialist society' and a 'people's democratic dictatorship'.|$|E
25|$|The August 2, 2010 rocket {{attack on}} Eilat and Aqaba sparked rage in Egypt at Hamas and Iran. The Egyptian press {{stated that the}} firing of the rockets from Egyptian {{territory}} by Hamas or by organizations cooperating with it constituted the crossing of a red line. The Egyptian <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Iran is employing local proxies, such as Hamas, to escalate violence in the Middle East and to sabotage the Palestinian reconciliation efforts, as well as efforts to renew Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.|$|E

25|$|Beyond {{criticisms of}} Human rights in Cuba, the United States holds $6 {{billion worth of}} {{financial}} claims against the Cuban government. The pro-embargo <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. embargo is, in part, an appropriate response to these unaddressed claims. The Latin America Working Group argues that pro-embargo Cuban-American exiles, whose votes are crucial in Florida, have swayed many politicians to also adopt similar views. The Cuban-American views have been opposed by some business leaders who argue that trading freely {{would be good for}} Cuba and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Tõnismägi hill (the former {{site of the}} {{monument}} and of the now-empty burial site) being city property, the government's <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it is the responsibility}} of Tallinn municipal government to decide what to do next with it. On May 9, it was reported that, as agreed with the City Park Office, the Ministry of Defence was planting an enormous flower garden on the site, as a part of the post-exhumation restoration work mandated by the War Graves Act. On June 8, 2007, the Ministry of Defence announced a plan to replace the flowerbed with a permanent park complete with small trees.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the Japanese government's <b>position</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the proper}} avenues for further claims are {{the governments of}} the {{respective}} claimants. As a result, every individual compensation claim brought to Japanese court has failed. Such was the case in regard to a British POW who was unsuccessful in an attempt to sue the Japanese government for additional money for compensation. As a result, the British Government later paid additional compensation to all British POWs. There were complaints in Japan that the international media simply stated that the former POW was demanding compensation and failed to clarify that he was seeking further compensation, in addition to that paid previously by the Japanese government.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom European Union {{membership}} referendum {{took place}} on 23 June 2016. The following <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Scottish government {{would be involved in}} the development of the UK government's position before the trigging of Article 50.|$|R

Jinnah told him that Kashmir could hope to get far better terms if it acceded immediately rather than later. But Kak's <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the State's decision on non-accession was final. Jinnah is reported to have said that he did not mind the State not acceding to Pakistan as long as it did not accede to India.|$|R
50|$|At {{its height}} more than 100 detainees {{participated in this}} hunger strike in 2005. The Department of Defense's <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> detainees {{did not have the}} right to refuse medical {{treatment}} and had the guards force feed them.|$|R
