40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method for obtaining pulp {{which is used}} for production of <b>cardboard,</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>package</b> while using carbon dioxide and hydrazine hydrate and neutral-sulfite  shive cooking. Output increase of  the desired product {{can be explained by}} reduction in destruction of plant raw material carbohydrates during its cooking process. Quality improvement of the desired product (improvement in bleaching and output) is attributed to the fact that usage of carbon dioxide and hydrazine contributes to provision of polysaccharide chain resistance to destruction due to the presence of  end links having structure of metasaccharinic and aldonic acids. The author has developed a new method for pulp obtaining {{on the basis of the}} executed investigations  and literature data.   СО 2 and hydrazine hydrate have been used for obtaining pulp. Method invention concerns pulp obtaining and it can be used for <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>package</b> manufacturing in pulp <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> industry. The method is to be carried in the following way: pulp-containing plant raw material is loaded into an autoclave and then aqua solution of sodium monosulfite containing hydrazine hydrate that constitutes 4 – 5 % of absolute dry pulp-containing raw material mass with liquid module 1 : 6 – 1 : 8 is supplied into the autoclave. The autoclave is closed for operation under pressure and the solution is carbonated under pressure which constitutes 5 – 8 % of absolute dry plant raw material (shover). Temperature is subsequently raised up to 180 °С in the space of 2 hours and cooking is carried out in the course of 4 hours. Usage of  the proposed method for shover cooking makes it possible to reduce monosulfite cooking process and improve qualitative characteristics and output of the desired product.   In addition to above mentioned fact there is a possibility to improve bleaching and final product output.  </p...|$|R

The segregated waste collection systems were practically the same in both communities. The collected waste was sorted into five basic fractions (plastic, metal, <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> composite <b>packaging,</b> <b>and</b> glass) and divided into 17 sub-fractions. In total, over 400 Mg of waste was analysed in terms of its morphological composition. The process of separating the selected fractions was performed by manually sorting the packaging waste. The study was conducted in the course of four months of the summer of 2015 and aimed at examining the composition of waste {{depending on the type of}} municipality. 	The presented analyses showed no significant differences in the morphological composition of waste in both municipalities, and revealed mixed waste paper as the dominant fraction.

30|$|When {{coming into}} contact with foods, <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>packaging</b> are {{protected}} from softening by treatment with, among other things, water- and oil-resistant perfluoro chemicals. Fluorotelomer alcohols [FTOH] may be present as contaminants in the coatings. About 1 % of the FTOH {{can be converted to}} PFOA in the body [31, 32]. Furthermore, PFOA is used in the production of polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] nonstick surface coatings for cooking utensils or paper coatings and may therefore be present in residual amounts [33]. A migration of < 6 μg/kg (< 1 μg/dm 2) FTOH into food has been calculated as the sum of 6 : 2 FTOH, 8 : 2 FTOH, and 10 : 2 FTOH in an acetone extract of treated paper under the assumption of complete migration [15, 33]. Powley et al. [34], using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were unable to detect a migration of PFOA from PFTE-coated cooking utensils (LOD 0.1 ng/cm 2).|$|E
40|$|Optimized {{logistic}} structures offer great avoidance potentials {{and allow}} for a packaging reduced good distribution. In general, the view of packaging problems is black-and-white. This is an obtacle to an efficient packaging design and can easily result in political solutions which only consider partial aspects concerning environmental pollution. Logistical optimizations are not based on trivial solutions such as: returnable packaging is better than non-returnable packaging or <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>packaging</b> is favourable to plastic; but their whole task is the secure goods distribution with minimal packaging. 'ne development of circular systems is the basic requirement for the solution of this problem. According to the product and distribution requirements the combination of systems for returnable and non- returnable materials, i. e. of different circular processes, is the prerequisit for closed material circuits. The rules and regulations by the legislation, with the Federal Republic obvi ously playing a leading role, show that the recycling of the packing material {{is a first step}} towards an extensive product liability. Material recycling means that secondary raw materials have to be the result which can be used for products of highquality - comparable to the very first products...|$|E
40|$|Mineral oil {{migration}} from cardboard packaging into foodstuffs {{is recognized as}} a serious problem for the consumers. Within this study, a fast automated method for the determination of mineral oil permeation through barrier films was developed. The method is using 15 defined standard substances representing mineral oil chemistry instead of complex mineral oil mixtures. The developed method {{can be used for}} the evaluation of the barrier properties for polymer films regarding mineral oil components from <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>packaging</b> materials. For all investigated permeants and polymer films, the logarithm of the permeation rates and the logarithm of the vapour pressure result in a linear correlation. The correlation can be used to compare the permeation properties of different barrier films. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that 12 m oriented polyethylene terephthalate or 15 m oriented polyamide are effective barriers towards mineral oil components. The b arrier effect of pure polyolefin films is negligibly poor because the permeation is too fast and the lag time is in the range of a few hours at 40 °C. As a consequence, the migration of mineral oil components from cardboard can be significantly reduced if inner layers of good barrier materials such as polyethylene terephthalate or polyamide are used...|$|E
40|$|The {{substance}} anthraquinone {{is used in}} {{the production}} of <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> including food <b>packaging.</b> Anthraquinone contained in the packaging can contaminate food. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) took the publication of an expert opinion of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) published in 2012 as an opportunity to reassess the use of anthraquinone in the manufacture of paper intended for food contact. In its opinion on anthraquinone as an active pesticide ingredient, the EFSA concludes that carcinogenic effects cannot be ruled out for anthraquinone and that the hazard potential for mammals cannot be determined unequivocally. Animal experiments show that anthraquinone can have a carcinogenic effect on the kidneys and liver. The International Association for Research and Cancer (IARC) classifies the substance as a possible carcinogen for humans (“Group 2 B”). For the presence of anthraquinone in food, a maximum residue level of 0. 01 mg per kilogramme of food has been defined for Europe, irrespective of whether the residue originated from a pesticide or some other source. The BfR has estimated that anthraquinone contamination from <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> can exceed the permitted residue limit of 0. 01 mg per kilogramme of food. In addition, the BfR has information on cases where the permitted residue limit value for anthraquinone was exceeded in tea which {{can be attributed to the}} anthraquinone levels contained in the <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> used as <b>packaging</b> materials. In consequence, the BfR withdraws its recommendation for the use of anthraquinone in the manufacture of paper intended for food contact. In addition, the institute will lobby for a harmonised categorisation of the health hazard posed by the substance as part of the European chemicals legislation (REACH regulation) ...|$|R

A data overview of the differences in recycling policies between different countries in the European Union is presented. The application of twelve different polymeric materials by five different application sectors in Europe shows the predominated usage areas of selected polymeric materials. A detailed insight into the German Dual System (DSD) for plastic recycling is presented, with the reference to the famous label the "Green Dot". The evolution of the recovery rates of packaging in Germany from 1991 to 2014 is presented for glass, aluminium, tinplate, polymers, <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>and</b> liquid <b>packaging</b> board.

The three major cities considered were Naples (978, 399 inhabitants), Bari (327, 361) and Palermo (678, 492). The maximum supposed total quantity of paper and cardboard in MSW was 20 %. A total economic saving of 250 Euro/t of paper and cardboard potentially present in the unsorted residual waste was assumed (as sum of the Extended Producer Responsibility contribution and the avoided disposal in landfill). The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations were performed with the software SimaPro 8, using the Ecoinvent v. 3 database. LCA was used for the calculation of environmental benefits (in term of avoided impacts) that could be obtained if paper and cardboard potentially present in the unsorted residual waste was collected separately. Six were the main indicators calculated and {{that can be used for}} the environmental campaign: maximum quantity of paper and cardboard recoverable from unsorted residual waste; maximum potential economic saving for the city; maximum potential economic saving for each citizen; maximum number of young environmental communicators; maximum per capita saving of carbon dioxide equivalent; maximum per capita saving of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) ...|$|E
