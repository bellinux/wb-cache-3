5|$|The {{elements}} generally {{classified as}} nonmetals include one element in group 1 (hydrogen); one in group 14 (carbon); two in group 15 (nitrogen and phosphorus); three in group 16 (oxygen, sulfur and selenium); most of group 17 (fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine); {{and all of}} group 18 (with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> oganesson).|$|E
5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last {{decade and a}} half under a {{communist}} regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E
5000|$|Next, we {{add more}} {{reductions}} (that is, rewriting rules) to eliminate <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> confluence. Suppose that [...] and , where , overlap.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the hotel}} {{that night the}} main topic of conversation, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> {{politics}} and prohibition, was the demise of Major Caswell. I heard one man say {{to a group of}} listeners: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Golly! that 'd be great!" [...] cried Carl, who, {{like every}} human being since Eden, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> Calvin and Richard Mansfield, had a secret belief {{that he could be}} a {{powerful}} actor.|$|R
5|$|During {{the later}} epoch, the Chinese lost their secret to the Koreans, the Japanese, and, later, the Indians, as these {{cultures}} discovered {{how to make}} silk. Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament show that it was known in western Asia in biblical times. Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E
5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E
50|$|Moore's novels {{typically}} involve conflicted everyman characters struggling through supernatural or extraordinary circumstances. With the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> Fool, The Serpent of Venice, and Sacré Bleu, all {{his books}} {{take place in}} the same universe and some characters recur from novel to novel.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} molluscs, all {{cephalopods}} are active predators (with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> the bigfin squid and vampire squid). Their need {{to locate and}} capture their prey has likely been a {{driving force behind the}} development of their intelligence, uniquely advanced among molluscs.|$|R
5000|$|Tehillim may strike {{listeners}} {{familiar with}} much of Reich's other work {{as something of a}} departure from his earlier pieces. In contrast to his entire oeuvre, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> The Cave (1993) and Proverb (1995), Tehillim is less [...] "radical" [...] musically.|$|R
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> syphilis.|$|E
5|$|Valence 3 is {{dominant}} in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, {{along with a}} valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, more stable than that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.|$|E
5|$|Before 28 October 2011, the {{succession}} {{order in the}} American Commonwealth realms, {{as well as those}} American territories under the British crown, adhered to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, by which succession passed first to an individual's sons, in order of birth, and subsequently to daughters, again in order of birth. However, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Canada, following the legislative changes giving effect to the Perth Agreement, succession is by absolute primogeniture for those born after 28 October 2011, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of gender. As these states share the person of their monarch with other countries, all with legislative independence, the change was implemented only once the necessary legal processes were completed in each realm. Those possessions under the Danish and Dutch crowns already adhere to absolute primogeniture.|$|E
5000|$|Note, {{a common}} type of architecture, [...] "load-store", is a synonym for [...] "Register Register" [...] below, meaning no {{instructions}} access memory except special - load to register(s) - and store from register(s) - with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> atomic memory operations for locking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{younger people}} are equally reprehensible, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> Rosanna and Gray. [...] "We're all unspeakably corrupt," [...] admits Vint. Vint and his lover Cissy Foy are {{reminiscent}} of Amerigo and Charlotte in The Golden Bowl in their love of wealth and pleasure.|$|R
50|$|In {{all major}} forms of English, {{question}} marks, exclamation marks, semicolons, {{and any other}} punctuation (with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> periods and commas, as explained in the sections below) are placed inside or outside the closing quotation mark depending on whether {{they are part of}} the quoted material.|$|R
5|$|For {{surface water}} {{sources such as}} lakes and reservoirs, the volume {{available}} for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO4) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> fluorine. The elements iron, manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{sperm whales}} differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count {{and the shape}} of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Aulophyseter, had teeth in their upper jaws. Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving {{mandible}} (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modern Orca (Killer Whale). Other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer sperm whales.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of what they {{suspected}} would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action {{on the far right}} Austrian flank.|$|E
5000|$|With the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> Pandaemonium and Bedlam, Brookmyre's {{books are}} all {{set in the}} same [...] "universe" [...] and contain a number of {{recurring}} characters, especially the appearance or mention of major characters (such as Parlabane) in incidental roles in other stories. Some of the recurring characters are listed below: ...|$|R
2500|$|Legend is {{the last}} {{surviving}} member of T. Rex's best known lineup and indeed of any lineup of T.Rex or Tyrannosaurus Rex prior to its mid 1973 commercial decline [...] (with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> July 1967 debut gig musicians Cartland and the unknown bassist, neither of whom has been traced and {{both of whom were}} reportedly considerably older than Bolan or Took.) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{show that}} the horofunction {{boundary}} of Teichmüller space with Thurston's Lipschitz metric {{is the same as}} the Thurston boundary. We use this to determine the isometry group of the Lipschitz metric, apart from in some exceptional cases. We also {{show that the}} Teichmüller spaces of different surfaces, when endowed with this metric, are not isometric, again with some <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> low genus...|$|R
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E
5|$|Specter {{died from}} {{complications}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, aged 82, on October 14, 2012, {{at his home}} in Philadelphia. Statements of condolence were issued by President and Mrs. Obama, Vice President and Mrs. Biden, the Office of the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by many of his colleagues and former opponents in the U.S. Congress, the Pennsylvania legislature, and the city of Philadelphia, among many others. Senator Specter, while he had been accused of alienating both parties due to certain positions he took and due to the two times he switched parties, among other issues, was nonetheless respected by many as a principled statesman who did much for his state and country, including by those in politics and the legislature, both in Pennsylvania and his home state, Kansas, as well as across the U.S. and beyond. He was the longest-serving of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators, and it was said that he had done more for the state than anyone else, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Benjamin Franklin himself. As a sign of this respect and out of mourning, President Obama ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff at public institutions and military bases in Washington, D.C. {{and the rest of the}} country on his day of interment.|$|E
5|$|Hilary {{held the}} office of Sheriff of Sussex in 1155, and then again in 1160 through 1162. It was very unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff, and was {{a measure of the}} trust that King Henry II had in Hilary. Hilary was the only bishop to hold {{the office of}} sheriff during Henry's reign, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln. An English church council in 1143 had {{forbidden}} clergy to hold office as stewards or tax gatherers for non-clergy. As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county farm, or income from the county, and the payment of those revenues into the Exchequer, clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council. Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer, and was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome, and then sent back to the country of origin for trial. He also assisted other papal judges, including Theobald of Bec. Hilary served in England as a royal justice in 1156, and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157. Hilary acted as judge-delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric. He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions, and Hilary's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king.|$|E
2500|$|Medieval {{philosophy}} is characteristically theological. With the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> Avicenna and Averroes, medieval thinkers {{did not consider}} themselves philosophers at all: for them, the philosophers were the ancient pagan writers such as Plato and Aristotle. [...] However, their theology used the methods and logical techniques of the ancient philosophers to address difficult theological questions and points of doctrine. Thomas Aquinas, following Peter Damian, argued that {{philosophy is}} the handmaiden of theology (ancilla theologiae).|$|R
50|$|In 2262 Lyta {{revealed}} that the Vorlons had modified {{her to be a}} living telepathic superweapon - a doomsday machine to be used against the Shadows if the Vorlons lost the war. They made her into the most powerful human telepath in existence, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> Jason Ironheart, who had already transformed into something similar to a First One; and Kevin Vacit, former Director of Psi Corps who had carried a Vorlon fragment inside himself.|$|R
50|$|YurView California {{now serves}} as a locally {{originated}} entertainment channel, with many of its programs airing several times each week. Shows broadcast on the channel include Sam the Cooking Guy, BackBeat (a program about local musicians), California Life with Heather Dawson, Forefront and Cox California Edition. Although the channel still carries some sports programs (including Raceline and The Tim McCarver Show), 4SD no longer airs live sports events, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> high school football and basketball.|$|R

50|$|Two major isoforms of {{phospholipase}} D {{has been}} identified in mammalian cells: PLD1 and PLD2 (53% sequence homology), each encoded by distinct genes. PLD activity appears {{to be present in}} most cell types, with the <b>possible</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>of</b> peripheral leukocytes and other lymphocytes. Both PLD isoforms require PIP2 as a cofactor for activity. PLD1 and PLD2 exhibit different subcellular localizations that dynamically change in the course of signal transduction. PLD activity has been observed within the plasma membrane, cytosol, ER, and Golgi complex.|$|R
