40|$|Access <b>and</b> use of <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> by {{adolescents}} with hearing loss {{is important to}} assure their academic success. Learners with hearing loss experience problems regarding communication, literacy, and information literacy, which {{has an impact on}} their ability to access and use various types of <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> sources. This leads to problems in achieving tertiary education and employment in later life. In order for learners to develop their abilities and skills to access <b>and</b> use <b>academic</b> <b>information,</b> they need to learn to work independently, be familiar with all the types of <b>academic</b> <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> utilize the media centre. An urgent need existed to determine the abilities of {{adolescents with}} hearing loss to access <b>and</b> use <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> in order to make suggestions for an information literacy programme to be implemented for learners with hearing loss. The suggestions could be highly relevant for teachers and media teachers. The research design was a descriptive design comprising of a questionnaire survey followed by an assignment survey. A set of questionnaires was a quantitative tool implemented for systematic and objective gathering of information from a representative sample. The survey assignment employed qualitative methods to investigate characteristics of a group of adolescents with hearing loss with regard to their ability to access <b>and</b> use <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> in the media centre. The questionnaires were distributed to 326 learners with hearing loss, 19 teachers, and 6 media teachers; and the quantitative survey assignment involved 48 learners with hearing loss. The research was done in order to develop an information education programme based upon scientific findings, for use within the planned educational system in South Africa. The results from the study indicated {{that the majority of the}} participants always found <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> difficult to access and use, except where information was readily available in the classroom setting. Sub-goal 1 indicated that the majority of the participants always found <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> difficult to access and use except where information was available in schoolbooks. They mainly accessed <b>and</b> used <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> during <b>and</b> after school. There was not much consensus as to the purpose for which they accessed <b>and</b> used <b>academic</b> <b>information.</b> The participants regarded themselves as unsuccessful and relied on role players to help them to understand, find, <b>and</b> access <b>academic</b> material. They also preferred visual (graphical) information above printed information. The participants indicated they found OBE material difficult to access and use. It became clear that they did not visit the media centre regularly and did not have adequate computer and Internet facilities. Sub-goal 2 indicated that the teachers displayed the perception that the adolescents experienced problems when accessing <b>and</b> using <b>academic</b> <b>information.</b> They indicated that the adolescents occasionally accessed and used information, but needed them as role players to assist them. The teachers and media teachers also suggested lack of motivation, lack of funds, insufficient training, and degree of hearing loss as possible constraining factors. They indicated that hearing loss has an impact on language and communication skills and consequently has an effect on literacy and information literacy skills. They also considered low literacy and information literacy skills and underdeveloped cognitive skills to have an effect on the adolescents’ ability to access <b>and</b> use <b>academic</b> <b>information.</b> This has impact on learners’ ability to access, apply, and analyse information. It is important to note that teachers seemed to be of more assistance to learners than media teachers and research is needed to determine the reasons for this. The teachers indicated that sign language influenced the subjects’ ability to access information as the subjects seem to think in pictures rather than using words. This also calls for further research. Sub-goal 3 indicated that the media teachers’ perception was similar to that of the teachers. They indicated that the subjects found English as a second language difficult to understand. Sub-goal 4 indicated that the subjects were not able to complete the assignment in the media center with ease. The subjects also had poor knowledge of catalogue use and no knowledge of the Dewey classification scheme which is used to locate books on the shelves. These findings were utilized to propose an information literacy programme at school media centres, to be implemented in the context of content-based courses and assignments. It is clear that adolescents with hearing loss are a heterogeneous group and due to the differences in the degree and type of hearing loss, they have varying frames of reference, language bases, and cognitive skills. Adolescents who have a language delay due to hearing loss, experience problems with access to formal as well as informal education. Thesis (DPhil) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{the ability of a}} specific group of adolescents with hearing loss to access <b>and</b> use <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> in order to establish the kind of support that might be required for adolescents with hearing loss. Adolescents with hearing loss who have a language delay because of this loss experience problems with access to formal as well as informal academic material. Children with severe hearing loss need special education and the teacher should receive in-service training. This is necessary because children with this degree of hearing loss have a serious language delay, and need special help in all language skills, language-based academic subjects, vocabulary, grammar, pragmatism, reading and writing (HMIE 2007 : 16). They also have a lack of prior knowledge to assist them in all their language skills (HMIE 2007 : 26). The participants of this study were adolescents with hearing loss, and teachers and media teachers at special schools that cater for adolescents with hearing loss. Questionnaires were distributed to 326 adolescents with hearing loss, 19 teachers, and six media teachers. In addition, the researcher observed 48 adolescents with hearing loss while they completed an assignment in a media centre. The results indicated that these young people found it difficult to access <b>and</b> use <b>academic</b> <b>information.</b> They used <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> mainly during class and after school when they needed to, and there was not much consensus as to the purpose for which they used it. Over 50 % of the participants were not able to trace other sources. Various factors were identified which influenced their ability to access <b>and</b> to use <b>academic</b> <b>information,</b> such as degree of hearing loss, literacy skills and information literacy skills, communication and poor cognitive skills. In the media centre the adolescents were not able to execute an assignment on <b>academic</b> <b>information</b> with ease. This was because they had difficulties with bibliographical details and a lack of knowledge about finding and accessing information (HMIE 2007 : 26). Suggestions are made for an information literacy programme for adolescents with hearing loss so that they could develop the relevant skills to access <b>and</b> use <b>academic</b> <b>information.</b> [URL]...|$|R
