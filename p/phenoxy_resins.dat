50|$|Important {{epoxy resins}} are {{produced}} from combining epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A to give bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers.Increasing {{the ratio of}} bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves {{more and more like}} a thermoplastic. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 - 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and isocyanates.|$|E
40|$|Ethynyl-containing <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> have {{excellent}} shelf life in solution or in bulk. Cured ethynyl-containing <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> offer lower moisture absorption, higher use temperatures, and better thermal stability over stateof-the-art cross-linked <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> Depending upon cross-link density, cured ethynyl-modified <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> are solvent resistant but still thermoformable and relatively tough. Modified resins show potential {{for use as}} adhesives, composite matrices, solvent-resistant coatings, membranes, insulators, and films...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> {{containing}} pendent ethynyl groups, {{the process}} for preparing the same, and the cured resin products obtained therefrom are disclosed. Upon the application of heat, the ethynyl groups react to provide branching and crosslinking with the cure temperature being lowered by using a catalyst if desired but not required. The cured <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> containing pendent ethynyl groups have improved solvent resistance and higher use temperature than linear uncrosslinked <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and are applicable for use as coatings, films, adhesives, composited matrices and molding compounds...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} approaches {{improved the}} solvent resistance {{and raised the}} Tg of thermoplastics: end-capping aligomers with ethynyl groups; incorporating ethynyl groups pendent along the polymer chain; and correcting polymers containing pendent ethynyl groups with a low molecular weight diethynyl compound. The following conclusions were reached: (1) film and composite properties off an ethynyl-terminated sulfone were better than those of UDEL (trademark); (2) fracture energy of an ethynyl-terminated sulfone was {{lower than that of}} UDEL (trademark); (3) residual palladium in the cured ethynyl-terminated sulfone lower the thermooxidative stability of the cured resin; (4) the properties of a <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resin</b> were altered considerably by placing pendent ethynyl groups along the polymer chain; and (5) property trade-offs must be considered when thermoplastics are modified via reactant groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} activities in this subdivision cover structural studies and molecular motion analyses of polymers and related {{low molecular weight}} compounds in the crystalline, glassy, liquid crystalline, solution, and frozen solution states by high-resolution solid-state NMR, dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and so on, {{in order to obtain}} basic theories for the development of high-performance polymer materials. The processes of biosynthesis, crystallization, and higher-ordered structure formation are also studied for bacterial cellulose. Poly(2 -hydroxypropyl ether of bisphenol-A), known as <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resin</b> (PHR), is an amorphous linear polymer and the structure and dynamics have been studied by X-ray diffraction [1], mechanical relaxation [2], and solid-state NMR [3]. Although three relaxations are observed between – 100 and – 40 ºC, between 20 and 40 ºC, and between 70 and 100 ºC on mechanical relaxation experi-ments, the molecular origins have not been well under-stood. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of PHR by analyzing one- and two-dimensional CP/MAS 13...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve solvent {{resistance}} of aromatic thermoplastic polymers, ethynyl-terminated aromatic sulfone polymers (ETS), sulfone/ester polymers (SEPE) containing pendent ethynyl groups, and phenoxy resin containing pendent ethynyl groups are synthesized. Cured polysulfones and <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> containing ethynyl groups on the ends or pendent on the molecules exhibited systematic behavior in solvent resistance, film flexibility, and toughness {{as a function of}} crosslink density. The film and composite properties of a cured solvent-resistant ETS were better than those of a commercially available solvent sensitive polysulfone. The study was part of a NASA program to better understand the trade-offs between solvent resistance, processability and mechanical properties which may be useful in designing composite structures for aerospace vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption and {{desorption}} of Aroclor 1254 (a {{mixture of}} polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]) from 0. 25 % (wt/vol) aqueous solutions of Triton X- 100 on polymeric materials common in laboratories (red vacuum rubber, latex, Tygon, Norprene, manosil, polyethylene, polypropylene, phenoxy resin, nylon, and Teflon) is described. Teflon, nylon, and <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resins</b> showed the lowest adsorptions, with efficiencies of 3. 4, 22. 9, and 33. 0 %, respectively. The other polymers adsorbed more than 90 % of Aroclor 1254 under similar conditions. Adsorption of PCBs {{was found to}} increase with the lipophilicity of the polymer and to be irreversible on soft polymers. The variation in the adsorption efficiencies of these polymers toward PCBs is apparently related to variations in the chemical composition, electronic properties, and degree of softness of these polymers. The present study showed that Teflon, with less than 4 % adsorption and more than 99 % desorption of Aroclor 1254, is the best candidate for use in biological laboratory work...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to a {{comprehensive}} study of the photo-oxidation of polymeric materials {{with the goal of}} correlating modifications of the polymer properties at the molecular and macroscopic levels. Several techniques were used to characterise the modifications of the chemical properties and mechanical behaviour over time under UV light. The methodology was developed on materials used as organic coatings; initially, a well-characterised <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resin</b> (PKHJ) was chosen as a model and then the approach was applied to an acrylate-melamine thermoset currently used as a topcoat in the automotive industry. Analysis of degraded samples by IR spectroscopy allowed us to propose a photooxidation mechanism. This mechanism suggested that chain scission occurred under photo-oxidation. To entirely understand the degradation of the polymers, gel fraction, thermoporosimetry, DMA, AFM nanoindentation and micro-hardness determinations were performed. The results showed that crosslinking reactions occurred in competition with chain scission and explained for the first time why crosslinking reactions were quite prevalent. Based on the obtained results, quantitative correlations were made between the various criteria of degradation, thus relating the chemical structure changes to the mechanical property modifications...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy, (ESCA), {{has been}} used to investigate the changes in surface chemistry of some aromatic polymers during natural and artificial weathering. Particular emphasis has been placed on the photodegradation (λ> 290 nm) of Bisphenol A polycarbonate. Model studies to investigate the changes in surface chemistry as functions of irradiation time, photon flux, temperature and the partial pressure: of oxygen and water at the solid/gas interface have been carried out in conjunction with natural exposures. The results show that photooxidation (involving the gem dimethyl and phenyl groups) and not a photo-Fries type rearrangement is the predominant process in the surface regions. Calculations at the non- and semi-empirical levels on model polycarbonate systems suggest that the first excited singlet state of polycarbonate arises from a II→II⃰ transition. The changes in surface chemistry of polycarbonate exposed to reactive oxygen species have been studied and indicate that singlet oxygen does not react with this polymer. The photoaging studies for polycarbonate have been extended to polystyrene, Bisphenol A polysulphone, polyethersulphone, polyphenylene oxide <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resin</b> and polyetherketone and similar trends to those observed for polycarbonate are shown to occur in these systems, i. e. extensive oxygen uptake in the surface regions with the mechanism involving the aromatic groups of the various systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of black pigments used in thickness-sensitive solar-selective absorbing paints for solar thermal collectors {{depends on the}} optical properties of the pigments. Knowledge of the intrinsic optical properties of most paint pigments is very limited. Pellets made from either FeMnCuOx or black carbon dispersed in KBr matrix {{have been used to}} determine the effective optical coefficients of the pigments. Scattering and absorption cross-sections were derived from reflectance and transmittance measurements at near normal angle of incidence in the wavelength range 0. 3 to 2. 5 μm. Volume concentrations of the pigments that gave linear dependencies for the coefficients were found to be between 0. 053 and 0. 53 % (FeMnCuOx) and 0. 076 and 0. 31 % (black carbon). Subsequently, a four-flux model has been used for calculation of reflectance for thickness-sensitive spectrally-selective paints. The paints were obtained from the FeMnCuOx and black carbon pigments embedded in silicone and <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resin,</b> respectively. We have used the experimentally determined scattering and absorption cross-sections of the pigments as input to the four-flux theory and the calculations have been performed for different thicknesses and/or pigment volume fraction of the paints. The calculated reflectances were compared with experiments and the results for thick films fit well...|$|R

40|$|Zinc-rich organic {{coatings}} protect steel from {{corrosion by}} blocking corrosive reactants from the steel and by galvanically protecting the steel {{where it is}} exposed to corrosive reactants at defects in the coating. Zincrometal(2 ̆ 7 R) is a zinc-rich-organic-coated steel product used in the automotive industry. The Zincrometal coating consists of: (1) a pretreatment layer, called Dacromet(2 ̆ 7 R), comprised primarily of zinc dust and chromic acid; and, (2) a zinc- rich organic primer, called Zincromet(2 ̆ 7 R), comprised of approximately 50 v/o zinc dust in a <b>phenoxy</b> <b>resin</b> binder. ^ In this thesis, the protective mechanisms of the Zincrometal coating were studied as a function of: (1) the pigment volume concentration of zinc in the primer, (2) the Dacromet pretreatment layer, and (3) electrical post-treatment by corona discharge. Electrochemical corrosion experiments were conducted in non-deaerated solutions of 0. 5 N NaCl in distilled water at pH = 6. ^ DC and AC electrochemical experiments showed that a 50 v/o zinc-rich primer on Dacromet (i. e., the laboratory version of the Zincrometal coating) was an effective barrier for steel, but the coating was not galvanically active. However, the 50 v/o primer applied directly to steel, with no Dacromet layer, was galvanically active. Auger electron spectroscopy showed that the Dacromet layer consists of zinc particles randomly distributed on the steel, with a thin ((DBLTURN) 1000 (ANGSTROM)) chromium oxide film covering the entire surface. The chromium oxide film is non-conducting, {{and it is a}} good barrier. However, the film electronically insulates zinc particles in the primer from the steel which limits the galvanic activity. ^ Corona discharge treatment of the 50 v/o primer on Dacromet formed electronic paths between zinc in the primer and the steel, which made zinc in the primer electrochemically active. The paths were formed by dielectric breakdown of insulating barriers in the coating. However, the effectiveness of the barrier protection provided by the coating to steel was decreased by corona discharge^ treatment. Corrosion of the steel initiated where breakdown of the chromium oxide film of the Dacromet layer had occurred. ^ (2 ̆ 7 R) Zincrometal, Zincromet and Dacromet are registered trademarks of Metal Coatings International, Inc. ...|$|R
