When both a and x are large, and a x, the uniform asymptotic expansion of Temme (1987) is employed for greater efficiency – specifically, this expansion is used when a ≥ 20 and 0. 7 a ≤ x ≤ 1. 4 a. Once either of P or Q is computed, the other is obtained by subtraction from 1. In order to avoid loss of relative precision in this subtraction, the smaller of P and Q is computed first.

40|$|We {{investigate}} two iterative {{methods for}} solving nonsingular linear systems <b>P</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>x</b> = b; () where P (A) = P p i= 0 fl i A i denotes a matrix polynomial and A is hermitian. The key {{idea of the}} methods is to choose the approximate solutions x j from the Krylov subspaces {{with respect to the}} matrix A instead of P (A). Thus, only one matrix vector multiplication (Gemv) is necessary to extend the current Krylov space, whereas classical methods for solving (), like MINRES or CG, require p Gemvs in each step. Our algorithms are based on short recurrences, and the iterates minimize an appropriate residual norm. The methods are analyzed theoretically, and their efficiency is illustrated for linear systems from lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (lattice QCD) and Tikhonov-Phillips regularization. Key words.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{implementable}} proximal quasi-Newton {{method for}} minimizing a nondifferentiable convex function f in ! n. The method {{is based on}} Rockafellar's proximal point algorithm and a cutting-plane technique. At each step, we use an approximate proximal point <b>p</b> <b>a</b> (<b>x</b> k) of x k to define a v k 2 @ ffl k f(p a (x k)) with ffl k ffkv k k; where ff is a constant. The method monitors {{the reduction in the}} value of kv k k to identify when a line search on f should be used. The quasi-Newton step is used to reduce the value of kv k k. Without the differentiability of f, the method converges globally and the rate of convergence is Q-linear. Superlinear convergence is also discussed to extend the characterization result of Dennis and Mor'e. Numerical results show the good performance of the method.
