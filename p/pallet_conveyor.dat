5000|$|Making port at the Naval Air Station, Alameda, on 6 April, Vega later served from 13 to 17 May as host ship at San Francisco for HMCS Terra Nova. Vega then entered Triple [...] "A" [...] Shipyard, San Francisco, on 27 May for a {{restricted}} availability which increased the ship's transfer capabilities. Completing these modifications on 23 July, the ship conducted {{a program of}} type training off the California coast from the 26th through the 30th, before she sailed north to call at the annual Sea Fair at Seattle, Washington. During a subsequent refit, again carried out at San Francisco's Triple [...] "A" [...] Shipyard {{in the summer and}} again in the fall of 1971, Vega received modifications that further improved her cargo-handling capacities. Specifically, number 3 hold was modified to handle pre-palletized cargo; and existing helicopter facilities were upgraded. In addition, a 4,000-pound <b>pallet</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt was added, as well as battery-charging facilities and a new forklift garage.

40|$|Handling and {{locating}} pallet {{system is}} one of the most important subsystems in a ﬂexible production plant. The impact of pallet systems parameters on process and energy efﬁciency of production plants has been veriﬁed and examined by a number of studies in the literature. In this paper, introducing novel design constraints for pallets and buffers, a new optimization algorithm under linear constraint models is developed. It generates the precise optimal values for the most challenging variables in a decoupled multiple-loop pallet system. The design variables are number of <b>pallets,</b> <b>conveyor</b> velocity, scheduling of parts, and buffer capacities. In a case study, the optimization algorithm is compared with a more detailed simulation model. The differences between the solutions are minor, although the optimization algorithm only uses partial information, and the computation time is much lower compared to the simulation approach...|$|R

50|$|Automatic {{loading of}} {{trailers}} {{is a relatively}} new application for automated guided vehicles and becoming increasingly popular. AGVs are used to transport and load pallets of finished goods directly into standard, over-the-road trailers without any special dock equipment.

40|$|A proper {{control of}} a system to get a desired {{function}} and increase the system lifetime is a crucial step towards the sustainable paradigm. In this paper, such a control is designed for a cyclic pallet system to achieve a minimal force on its drive unit, meet safety conditions on the system chain tension force and the momentum of pallets, and fulfill the desired production rate. The optimal values of the control parameters, namely number of <b>pallets</b> and <b>conveyor</b> velocity, are obtained through solving a linear optimization model. The objective function in the model defines the average force on the drive unit in a cycle production. In addition, the related constraints characterize the pallet system properties such as cyclic and dynamic behavior, buffer size, constant work in process, and safety specifications. The robustness of the optimal control is analyzed, using a worst but safe control strategy. The optimal control and the robustness analysis are applied to some case studies, {{and the results are}} evaluated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Entire Body Risk Assessment (ENBORA) {{method is}} a new {{observational}} method used to evaluate risk factors linked to Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs). Hence, this study aims to verify the inter-rater reliability of the ENBORA method. 16 raters {{were involved in a}} one day ENBORA training session. All of the participants needed to assess three different tasks using the ENBORA paper checklist. The tasks involved were; lifting from <b>pallet</b> to <b>conveyor</b> for Task A, creels of wire onto spindles for Task B, and bottling line inspection for Task C. The Cohen’s Kappa (K) coefficient and percentage of agreement were calculated. As a result, the inter-rater reliability for Task A has a Cohen’s Kappa value (K) of 0. 88, while Task B and Task C achieved K= 0. 91 which indicated very good agreement.

40|$|Reduction {{of energy}} {{consumed}} by a manufacturing system to turn raw parts to finished products {{is a big}} step towards the green and lean production. In this study the energy efficiency of a one-loop pallet system, a main tool to handle and locate various part types in a cyclic production line, is investigated. The main goal is to obtain the minimal energy consumption in the pallet system drive unit through an optimally controlled and coordinated motion of pallets. To achieve the mentioned goal, first the mean value of the pallet system energy consumption is mathematically modeled. Later, this energy model is utilized as an objective function within an optimization model including constraints on system crucial properties such as cyclic and dynamic behavior, queueing policy, and buffer size. The solution of the optimization problem gives the optimal values of the system control variables, namely, number of <b>pallets</b> and <b>conveyor</b> velocity. To demonstrate the application of this optimization model in practice, three case studies are introduced. The results of these studies show that {{a significant amount of}} the energy consumption may be saved by applying the suggested green control...|$|R

40|$|Company XYZ {{is in the}} {{beverage}} industry producing, bottling, and distributing a variety of products. The starting point of the bottling process begins at the de-palletizing workstation where employees manually unload new cases of bottles from a <b>pallet</b> onto a <b>conveyor.</b> Workers at this station were complaining of discomfort in the shoulders/neck, elbows, hands, wrists, and lower back from excessive overhead reaching {{at the beginning of}} a new pallet and forward bending toward the end of the unloading process.
