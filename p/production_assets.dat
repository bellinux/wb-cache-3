25|$|On June 21, 2013, New Flyer Industries {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} North American Bus Industries, Inc from Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (Cerberus) for $79 million. The deal was completed later that day. However, New Flyer continued the NABI name for its existing bus products, which continued in production for the time being. This made NABI a subsidiary of New Flyer, using the legal name of NABI Bus, LLC. The Blue Bird school bus <b>production</b> <b>assets</b> {{were not included in}} the sale to New Flyer; they remain owned by Cerberus. As of late 2013, all of New Flyer's metal-structured bus production (with the exception of the MiDi, a product of the New Flyer–Alexander Dennis joint venture) is now under the NABI brand.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the then Airbus CEO Jean Pierson {{argued that the}} GIE should be {{abandoned}} and Airbus established as a conventional company. However, the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative. In December 1998, when {{it was reported that}} British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging, Aérospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion; the French company feared the combined BAe/DASA, which would own 57.9% of Airbus, would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50/50 split. However, the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with Marconi Electronic Systems to become BAE Systems. Then in 2000 three of the four partner companies (DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, successor to Deutsche Airbus; Aérospatiale-Matra, successor to Sud-Aviation; and CASA) merged to form EADS, simplifying the process. EADS now owned Airbus France, Airbus Deutschland and Airbus España, and thus 80% of Airbus Industrie. BAE Systems and EADS transferred their <b>production</b> <b>assets</b> to the new company, Airbus SAS, in return for shareholdings in that company.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{equilibrium}} {{model of a}} moral-hazard economy with a very large firm and financial markets, where a stock and bonds are traded. We show that optimal contracts necessitate the principal to forbid the agent to trade the stock, and that moral hazard problems can result in low interest rates and sometimes in high equity premium. We also obtain a number of striking results: the second best cost of capital for a risky <b>production</b> <b>asset</b> can be {{lower than that of}} the first best; and the market price of risk depends on agent’s productivity as well as the risk aversion of both the principal and agent, and the volatility of the <b>production</b> <b>asset.</b> Moreover, comparative statics for both the first- and second-best cases suggest that the larger the social wealth, the lower the interest rate and the higher the market price of risk; and that low interest rates can also be resulted from low agent’s effort efficiency, low-profit production opportunities, and high production risk...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a team production problem where two parties sequentially invest {{to generate a}} joint surplus. In this framework, {{it is possible to}} implement the first best even if the investment return is highly uncertain. The optimal contract entails a basic dichotomy: it is a simple option contract if the investments of both parties are substitutive, and a linear incentive contract if they are complementary. These schemes can be interpreted in terms of asset ownership: for the case of substitutive investments, a conditional ownership structure is optimal while for complementary investments shared equity in combination with a bonus component renders efficiency feasible. In either case, the parties renegotiate the initial arrangement after the first party invested. Team <b>Production,</b> <b>Asset</b> Ownership, Sequential Investments...|$|R

50|$|Evaluation of {{alternative}} policies. In 1993 Jorgenson and Peter J. Wilcoxen surveyed this evaluation of energy, environmental, trade, and tax policies, {{based on the}} econometric general equilibrium models Jorgenson developed with Ho and Wilcoxen. The concept of an intertemporal price system provides the unifying framework. This system balances current demands and supplies for products and factors of <b>production.</b> <b>Asset</b> prices {{are linked to the}} present values of future capital services through rational expectations equilibrium. The long-run dynamics of economic growth are captured through linkages among capital services, capital stocks, and past investments. Alternative policies are compared in terms of the impact of changes in policy on individual and social welfare. This approach was incorporated into the official guidelines for preparing economic analyses by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2000.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} role of broad liquidity—the supply and demand for bank deposits—in the {{transmission}} of monetary policy. The model integrates deposit demand, loan <b>production,</b> <b>asset</b> pricing, and arbitrage between banking and asset markets. Broad liquidity conditions {{must be taken into}} account in the pursuit of interest rate policy for two reasons: (1) they influence the link between the interbank rate and market rates through their effect on the external finance premium, and (2) they affect the behavior of market rates that the central bank must target in order to maintain price stability. The paper shows how the production and use of broad liquidity influences the “neutral ” interbank rate consistent with balanced growth and stable inflation. It shows how and why interbank rate policy actions must be modified in light of broad liquidity considerations to stabilize inflation in response to shocks. ...|$|R
