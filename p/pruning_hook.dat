25|$|The topmost {{portion of}} the {{memorial}} consists of a larger-than-life figure of a woman representing the South. The orientation of the figure and its face is toward the south, in part to honor the Confederacy but also so that the sun may shine {{on the face of}} the figure at all times (which is symbolic of being favored). The figure's head is crowned with an olive wreath, which is both sacred to Minerva (Roman goddess of war and wisdom) and a symbol of peace. The figure's left hand extends a laurel wreath toward the south in acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by the South's men in arms and as a symbol of the past. The figure holds a <b>pruning</b> <b>hook</b> in its right hand, which in turn rests on a plow. This represents peace and reconciliation as well as the hope that the labor of the South will lead to new glory.|$|E
60|$|Our {{gardener}} {{was a very}} sublime sort of man,--an Englishman, and, of course, used to {{laying out}} noblemen's places,--and we became as grasshoppers in our own eyes when he talked of lord this and that's estate, and began to question us about our carriage drive and conservatory; and we could with difficulty bring the gentleman down to any understanding of the humble limits of our expectations: merely to dress out the walks, and lay out a kitchen garden, and plant potatoes, turnips, beets, and carrots, was quite a descent for him. In fact, so strong were his æsthetic preferences, that he persuaded my wife to let him dig all the turf off from a green square opposite the bay window, and to lay it out into divers little triangles, resembling small pieces of pie, together with circles, mounds, and various other geometrical ornaments, the planning and planting of which soon engrossed my wife's whole soul. The planting of the potatoes, beets, carrots, etc.., was intrusted to a raw Irishman; for, as to me, to confess the truth, I began to fear that digging {{did not agree with}} me. It is true that I was exceedingly vigorous at first, and actually planted with my own hands two or three long rows of potatoes; after which I got a turn of rheumatism in my shoulder, which lasted me a week. Stooping down to plant beets and radishes gave me a vertigo, so that I was obliged to content myself with a general superintendence of the garden; that is to say, I charged my Englishman to see that my Irishman did his duty properly, and then got on to my horse and rode to the city. But about one part of the matter, I must say, I was not remiss; and that is, in the purchase of seed and garden utensils. Not a day passed that I did not come home with my pockets stuffed with, choice seeds, roots, etc..; and the variety of my garden utensils was unequalled. There was not a <b>pruning</b> <b>hook,</b> of any pattern, not a hoe, rake, or spade, great or small, that I did not have specimens of; and flower seeds and bulbs were also forthcoming in liberal proportions. In fact, I had opened an account at a thriving seed store; for, when a man is driving business on a large scale, it is not always convenient to hand out the change for every little matter, and buying things on account is as neat and agreeable a mode of acquisition as paying bills with one's notes.|$|E
5000|$|Pole arms {{developed}} from relatively few early tools (axe, scythe/wide-bladed knife, and the <b>pruning</b> <b>hook)</b> and the spear. Thus naming, particularly of early forms is difficult. Fauchard, {{as a term}} is from early French {{and may have been}} used to describe various arms. The sovnya may have been a localized term for the same medieval weapon. In later historical text, the terms glaive (possibly Welsh) and fauchard are used to describe the same weapons. Over time, the form evolved and elements from other pole-arms were included in the fauchard, such as prongs to parry weapons and hook armor, complicating naming further. Some historians use only the classification glaive or fauchard and ignore the other entirely.|$|E

50|$|The current town seal began {{appearing}} on town reference {{documents in the}} 18th century, but was replaced in 1901 with a split design of a cogwheel (symbolizing industry in general) {{on one side and}} a glass beaker (for the local glassworks industry) on the other. In 1938, the emblem was changed again, this time with the Gaggenau Sester on top and a <b>pruning</b> <b>hook</b> below, in order to reflect the inclusion of the town of Ottenau. It was changed again in 1958 with the images rotated to be equally represented on the shield. Finally, as part of the municipal reform and additional village annexations of the 1970s, the emblem was restored to its original pre-20th-century design by the Interior Ministry of Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
5000|$|... 1) Like most polearms the guisarme was {{developed}} by peasants by combining hand tools with long poles: in this case by putting a <b>pruning</b> <b>hook</b> onto a spear shaft. According to Sir Guy Francis Laking, no other pole arm but the spear had greater importance for the medieval soldier class. In fact, it was so effective by the XIIIth century there was active support for its banishment from the battlefield. [...] While early designs were simply a hook {{on the end of}} a long pole, later designs implemented a small reverse spike on the back of the blade. Eventually weapon makers incorporated the usefulness of the hook in a variety of different polearms, and guisarme became a catch-all for any weapon that included a hook on the blade. This is exemplified by the terms bill-guisarmes, voulge-guisarmes, and glaive-guisarmes.|$|E
50|$|A guisarme (sometimes gisarme, giserne or bisarme) was a pole weapon used in Europe {{primarily}} between 1000-1400. It was used primarily to dismount knights and horsemen. Like most polearms {{it was developed}} by peasants by combining hand tools with long poles, in this case by putting a <b>pruning</b> <b>hook</b> onto a spear shaft. While hooks are fine for dismounting horsemen from mounts, they lack the stopping power of a spear especially when dealing with static opponents. While early designs were simply a hook {{on the end of}} a long pole, later designs implemented a small reverse spike on the back of the blade. Eventually weapon makers incorporated the usefulness of the hook in a variety of different polearms and guisarme became a catch-all for any weapon that included a hook on the blade. Ewart Oakeshott has proposed an alternative description of the weapon as a crescent shaped socketed axe.|$|E

Fr. Kabat also has re-styled Independence Day as “Interdependence Day” in honor of the interconnection of all nature.|$|R

5000|$|The Gandhi Peace Award was {{conceived}} by Promoting Enduring Peace’s founder, Yale Professor Jerome Davis. Davis first proposed the award {{to the board}} of Promoting Enduring Peace on 13 March 1959, with the name intended to pay tribute to the modern era's foremost advocate of nonviolent resistance, and partly to help rectify the failure of the Nobel Committee to award its Peace Prize to Gandhi before his death in 1948. The Award has been issued since 1960, when it was first presented to Eleanor Roosevelt, and consists of a certificate, a ceremony, and the presentation of a bronze medallion inscribed with a quotation by Gandhi, [...] "Love Ever Suffers / Never Revenges Itself." [...] A prominent New York sculptor, Don Benaron/Katz, was commissioned to create a work of art to serve as the symbol of the Award. He researched Gandhi at the library of the India House in New York City and by 1960 had carved a striking bas-relief portrait in wood of the founder of the century’s international movement for nonviolent change. He wrote of the medallion he also created, “I carved the Gujarati word for peace on one side, and on the other a symbolic plowshare and <b>pruning</b> <b>hook</b> inspired by Isaiah 2:4...″ ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{have been}} several more such actions in the new millennium.

We cannot be certain that all the labour spent on vanity has been diverted from reality, and that for every bad thing produced, a precious thing has been lost. In great measure, the vain things represent the results of roused indolence; they have been carved, as toys, in extra time; and, {{if they had not}} been made, nothing else would have been made. Even to munitions of war this principle applies; they partly represent the work of men who, if they had not made spears, would never have made <b>pruning</b> <b>hooks,</b> and who are incapable of any activities but those of contest.|$|R

He warns Ralph {{that the next time}} he sees him, he will try to kill him. The two armed men hunt each other through the empty streets.

And their spears into <b>pruning</b> <b>hooks.</b> Nation shall not lift up sword against nation. Neither shall they learn war any more", from the Book of Isaiah 2:4. He throws down his rifle and goes unarmed to confront Ben, who in turn finds himself unable to shoot his foe. Defeated, he starts walking away. Sarah appears. When Ralph starts to turn away from her, she makes him take her hand; then she calls to Ben and gives him her other hand. Together, the three walk down the street to build a new future together. The film ends not with [...] "The End" [...] but with [...] "The Beginning".|$|R
25|$|Project Plowshare “was named {{directly}} from the Bible itself, specifically Micah 4:3, which states that God will beat swords into ploughshares, and spears into <b>pruning</b> <b>hooks,</b> so that no country could lift up weapons against another”. Proposed uses included widening the Panama Canal, constructing a new sea-level waterway through Nicaragua nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems. Other proposals involved blasting underground caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage. It was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to extract shale oil in eastern Utah and western Colorado. Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations. One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground aquifers in Arizona. Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of California's Sacramento Valley for a water transport project. However, there were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions. Consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, {{due in large part}} to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.|$|R
