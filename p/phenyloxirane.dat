40|$|The enantiomers of styrene- 7, 8 -oxide (<b>phenyloxirane,</b> SO) were {{determined}} using a method based on {{base catalysed hydrolysis}} with sodium methoxide. The oxirane ring opening resulted in formation, without racemisation, of the enantiomeric pairs of the two regional isomers, 2 -methoxy- 1 -phenylethanol and 2 -methoxy- 2 -phenylethanol. The structure of these regional isomers was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR). To improve sensitivity of determination, the formed methoxy alcohols were subsequently derivatised with pentafluoropropionic anhydride enabling electron capture detection. This derivatization proceeded also without racemisation and the formed pentafluoropropionyl derivatives were separated on two serially coupled columns, a non-chiral AT 1705 and a chiral CP Chirasil-Dex-CB. As internal standard 2 S, 3 S-(-) - 2 -methyl- 3 -phenyloxirane was used. The limit of quantitation of the method was 0. 2 microM. The repeatability of the method was assessed at two concentration levels (2. 5 and 25 microM) and ranged from 6 to 9 % for both enantiomers. The method {{was applied to the}} determination of the rate and enantioselectivity of the cytochrome P- 450 dependent oxidation of styrene to SO enantiomers in human liver microsome...|$|E
40|$|We here {{present a}} {{combined}} VA, VCD, Raman and ROA vibrational study of <b>phenyloxirane.</b> We have simulated the vibrational absorption (VA), also called IR, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), Raman scattering and Ra-man optical activity (ROA) intensities utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) B 3 LYP hybrid exchange correlation functional and other exchange-correlation functionals (PBE, PW 91, PBE 1) with the 6 - 31 G(d,p), 6 - 31 ++G(d,p), cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ and augmented correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis sets. Previously authors {{have focused on}} either the VA and VCD spectra or the Raman and ROA spectra of molecules, since the experimental and theoretical instruments and methods for calculating these quantities are quite distinct. Here we show that the combined analysis gives more information, especially {{with respect to the}} electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric dipole – electric dipole polarizability, electric dipole – electric quadrupole polarizability and electric dipole – magnetic dipole polarizability changes during the various induced transitions. The coupling of vibrational and electronic excitations may be used to aid in understanding the photo induced chemical reactivity observed in many systems. This work is a continuation of our goal to in-terpret the results of experimental studies on the basis of theoretical results, which can help to understand the structure and function of proteins, other biomolecules and ligands in their native environments.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of the aromatic thioketone 4, 4 '-dimethoxythiobenzophenone (1) with three monosubstituted oxiranes 3 a - c {{in the presence of}} BF 3. Et 2 O or SnCl 4 in dry CH 2 Cl 2 led to the corresponding 1 : 1 adducts, i. e., 1, 3 - oxathiolanes 4 a-b with R at C(5) and 8 c with Ph at C(4). In addition, 1, 3 -dioxolanes 7 a and 7 c, and the unexpected 1 : 2 adducts 6 a - b were obtained (Scheme 2 and Table 1). In the case of the aliphatic, nonenolizable thioketone 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethylindane- 2 -thione (2) and 3 a - c with BF 3. Et 2 O as catalyst, only 1 : 1 adducts, i. e. 1, 3 -oxathiolanes 10 a - b with R at C(5) and 11 a - c with R or Ph at C(4), were formed (Scheme 6 and Table 2). In control experiments, the 1 : 1 adducts 4 a and 4 b were treated with 2 -methyloxirane (3 a) in the presence of BF 3. Et 2 O to yield the 1 : 2 adduct 6 a and 1 : 1 : 1 adduct 9, respectively (Scheme 5). The structures of 6 a, 8 c, 10 a, 11 a, and 11 c were confirmed by X-ray crystallography (Figs. 1 - 5). The results described in the present paper show that alkyl and aryl substituents have significant influence upon the regioselectivity in the process of the ring opening of the complexed oxirane by the nucleophilic attack of the thiocarbonyl S-atom: the preferred nucleophilic attack occurs at C(3) of alkyl-substituted oxiranes (O-C(3) cleavage) but at C(2) of <b>phenyloxirane</b> (O-C(2) cleavage) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{rates of}} {{reaction}} of 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) oxirane (4 -methoxystyrene oxide), trans- 3 -deutereo- 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) oxirane and 3, 3 -dideutereo- 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) oxirane in water solutions were measured as functions of pH. Kinetic deuterium isotope effects for {{the reactions of}} the mono- and di-deuterated (4 -methoxyphenyl) oxiranes were determined for both the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to diols and the pH-independent reactions leading mostly to rearranged aldehyde and involving a 1, 2 -hydrogen migration. The inverse kinetic deuterium isotopes for acid-catalyzed hydrolyses of the deuterated (4 -methoxyphenyl) oxiranes to diols are consistent with rate-limiting epoxide ring opening. The magnitudes of the normal kinetic deuterium isotope effects on the pH-independent reactions of deuterated 4 -methoxyphenyloxiranes are significantly smaller than the deuterium isotope effect on the aldehyde-forming step, and are rationalized by a reversible epoxide ring opening step that is partially rate-limiting. The magnitude of the partitioning isotope effect on the hydrogen migration step is consistent with isotope effects determined by Professor Coxon’s laboratory on the Lewis acid-catalyzed rearrangements of deuterated <b>phenyloxiranes</b> in organic solvents...|$|R

O melhor resultado foi obtido com o fungo Trichoderma sp Gc 1, pois forneceu o (R) -(-) - 2 -(benziloximetil) oxirano (2) com excesso enantiomérico de 60 % e rendimento isolado de 39 %; o diol (S) -(+) - 1, 2 -propanodiol- 3 -fenilmetóxi (2 a) com excesso enantiomérico de 32 % e rendimento de 19 %. Posteriormente otimizou-se as condições experimentais com o epóxido 2 e o fungo Trichoderma sp Gc 1, variando-se a massa de biocatalisador, o meio de cultura e o tempo de reação. Os melhores resultados sob essas condições foram aplicadas para os epóxidos 3 - 5 fornecendo o (S) -(+) - 2 -[4 -metoxifenoxi) metil]oxirano (3 a), (S) -(+) - 2 -(propeniloxi) oriano (4), (R) -(+) - 1 -alilóxi- 2, 3 -propanodiol (4 a) e o (-) - 9 -deceno- 1, 2 -diol (5 a). Nesses estudos embora ocorreu a abertura seletiva dos epóxidos com as células totais do fungo Trichoderma sp Gc 1, não obteve-se altas purezas enantioméricas dos produtos. Ainda nesse trabalho realizou-se a síntese das cloroidrinas racêmicas, a (RS) - 1 -cloro- 2 -propanol- 3 -fenilmetóxi (2 b), (RS) - 1 -cloro- 2 -propanol- 3 -(4 -metoxifenóxi) (3 b) e (RS) - 1 -alilóxi- 3 -cloro- 2 -propanol (4 b) em bons rendimentos e uma metodologia sintética ambientalmente apropriada, pois os compostos foram preparados em meio aquoso na presença de íons cloreto. Em seguida realizou-se uma resolução enzimática da (RS) - 1 -alilóxi- 3 -cloro- 2 -propanol (4 b) com a lipase de Candida {{antarctica}} onde obteve-se a clorodrina 4 a (e. e. 72 %) e o seu correspondente produto acetilado 4 c (e. e. 82 %) em bons excessos enantioméricos. Conclui-se que os fungos de origem marinha utilizados neste trabalho são potenciais fontes de epóxido-hidrolases para promover a abertura seletiva de epóxidos. In {{this work}} carried out itself {{the first study}} biocatalytic involving reactions of reduction of cetonas with fungi of marine origin. They were utilized 7 cetonas commercial as substratos and 8 fungi derived little seas like biocatalisadores. The fungi were isolated of the sponges little seas Geodia corticostylifera (Trichoderma sp Gc 1, Penicillium miczynskii Gc 5, Aspergillus sydowii Gc 12) and Chelonaplysylla erect (Bionectria sp Ce 5, Aspergillus sydowii Ce 15, Penicillium raistrickii Ce 16 and Aspergillus sydowii Ce 19). The reduction 2 -chloro- 1 -phenylethanone (1) was studied under several conditions of reaction (changes of pH, addition or absence of glucose) and the best result was with fungus P. miczynskii Gc 5, therefore itself obteve an isolated performance of 60 % and excess enantiomeric of 50 % for the (S) - 2 -chloro- 1 - phenylethanol (1 a). The interesting one in these studies was {{that all of the}} fungi utilized in the selection with the 2 -chloro- 1 -phenylethanone (1) presented selectivity anti- Prelog. In the literature is common obtain reduction enzymatic with selectivity Prelog. To 2 -bromo- 1 -phenylethanone (2) was biotransformaded by the fungus A. sydowii Ce 19 you correspond composed: (S) - 2 -bromo- 1 -phenylethanol (2 a), (S) - 2 -cloro- 1 - phenylethanol (1 a), whereas to (2 c), 2 -chloro- 1 -phenylethanone (1) and the 2 - <b>phenyloxirane</b> (2 b) were obtained by reactions not enzymatic. To 2 -bromo- 1 -(4 - bromophenyl) ethanone (3) and to 2 -bromo- 1 -(4 -nitrophenyl) ethanone (4) were entirely biodegradadas by the fungus A. sydowii Ce 19. The reduction biocatalytic of the 1 -(2 - iodophenyl) ethanol (5) and 1 -(3 -iodophenyl) ethanol (6) with the fungus Trichoderma sp Gc 1 supplied the 1 -(2 -iodophenyl) ethanol (5 a) and the 1 -(3 -iodophenyl) ethanol (6 a) with excellent excesses enantiomeric (e. e. > 99 %).
