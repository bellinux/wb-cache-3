50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut <b>plate,</b> <b>anchor</b> nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded <b>plate</b> <b>anchor</b> (DEPLA) is {{a rocket}} or dart shaped anchor that comprises a removable central shaft {{and a set}} of four flukes. Similar to other dynamically installed anchors, the DEPLA penetrates to a target depth in soft seabed sediments by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall in water and the self-weight of the anchor. In this paper DEPLA performance was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests conducted at 200 times earth?s gravity. The results show that the DEPLA exhibits similar behaviour to other dynamically installed anchors during installation, with tip embedments of 1. 6 – 2. 8 times the anchor length. After anchor installation the central shaft of the DEPLA, termed a follower, is retrieved and reused for the next installation, leaving the DEPLA flukes vertically embedded in the soil. The load–displacement response during follower retrieval is of interest, with mobilisation of frictional and bearing resistance occurring at different rates. The load required to extract the DEPLA follower is typically less than three times its dry weight. The vertically embedded DEPLA flukes constitute the load bearing element as a circular or square plate. The keying and pullout response of this anchor plate is similar to other vertically embedded plate anchors, with an initial stiff response as the anchor begins to rotate, followed by a softer response as the rotation angle increases, and a final stiff response as the effective eccentricity of the padeye reduces and anchor capacity is fully mobilised. For the padeye eccentricity ratios considered (0. 38 – 0. 63 times the plate breadth or diameter), the loss in <b>plate</b> <b>anchor</b> embedment is between 0. 50 and 0. 66 times the corresponding plate breadth or diameter. Finally, the bearing capacity factors determined experimentally are typically in the range 14. 2 – 15. 8 and are higher than numerical solutions for flat circular and square plates. This is considered to be due to the cruciform fluke arrangement which ensures that the failure surface extends {{to the edge of the}} orthogonal flukes and mobilises more soil in the failure mechanism...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{oil and gas}} mining has moved into {{increasingly}} deeper water in search of undeveloped fields. As water depths approach and exceed 3000 m conventional offshore foundation systems become inefficient and ineffective in stabilising platforms and floating production storage units. The trend of supporting structure design in deep water has been to install catenary and taut leg mooring systems. Consequently, many types of anchoring systems are being developed and used in order to withstand large mooring forces. The SEPLA (Suction Embedded <b>Plate</b> <b>Anchor)</b> is ideal for use in this situation. This project has employed advanced numerical techniques and centrifuge testing to study pullout behaviour of <b>plate</b> <b>anchor</b> foundations in different soil profiles and suction caisson installation effect {{with the aim of}} generating a robust framework for design. The behaviour of strip and circular plate anchors during vertical pullout in uniform and normally consolidated clays has been studied by means of small strain and large deformation finite element analyses. Both fully bonded (attached), and ‘vented’ (no suction on rear face), anchors have been considered. The current numerical results were compared with existing laboratory test data, finite element results and analytical solutions. This study showed that the ultimate pullout capacity factors (Nc) for deep embedment were 11. 6 and 11. 7 for smooth and rough strip anchors and 13. 1 and 13. 7 for smooth and rough circular anchors respectively. When the anchor base was vented, the soil stayed attached to the anchor base for deep embedment, and the pullout capacity was therefore the same as for the attached anchor. The separation depth ratio, Hs/B or Hs/D was found to increase linearly with the normalised strength ratio, su/γ'B or su/γ'D. Numerical simulation has been conducted to assess the bearing capacity for inclined pullout plate anchors. This bearing capacity analysis was performed by embedding the anchors in clay with different initial inclinations and different embedment ratios. Both the attached anchor base and vented base were evaluated. The results showed that the bearing capacities of the inclined plate anchors were associated with the inclination angles and base conditions. The separation depth of the plate anchors can be assessed by a simple equation from vertically pulled out plate anchors. Large deformation finite element analyses of <b>plate</b> <b>anchor</b> keying in clay has been performed. The effects of anchor thickness, anchor padeye eccentricity, anchor-soil interface roughness, soil shear strength, anchor submerged weight and soil disturbance have been studied with anchors in uniform or normally consolidated clays. The numerical results were compared with transparent soil test and existing centrifuge test data. The study showed that the RITSS method works well in simulating the anchor keying process. Anchor padeye eccentricity {{played an important role in}} anchor keying. A normalised anchor geometry ratio was used to estimate the loss in embedment during plate anchor’s keying. Both finite element analysis and centrifuge tests have been conducted to study the suction caisson installation effect. In finite element analysis, the soil disturbed zone varied from 3 times the caisson wall thickness to a full area inside a caisson. Centrifuge tests of suction embedded plate anchors were conducted in normally consolidated kaolin clay and transparent uniform soil. It can be concluded that the reduction in anchor capacity due to soil disturbance after suction caisson installation depends on re-consolidation time and soil sensitivity. The soil disturbance also reduced the loss of embedment during the anchor keying process...|$|E
