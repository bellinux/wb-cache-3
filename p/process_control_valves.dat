This applies first of all to <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> loops. The selection of the different control loop components can become a bit complicated because there are several design options and at least two different signal-response actions per component. This is especially true for split-range control loops with exclusively sequenced <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> that operate in different <b>control</b> ranges. These <b>valves</b> will never be open simultaneously and their fail-safe position under loss of signal and loss of motive utility requires special design attention. If the design was flawed or was compromised during maintenance then the system can respond in an unexpected manner during certain operating modes. Such an unexpected response was a contributing factor to a recent incident in a heavy oil processing facility.

40|$|A {{product line}} of {{improved}} electrohydraulic linear actuators has been developed. These actuators are designed especially {{for use in}} actuating valves in rocket-engine test facilities. They are also adaptable to many industrial uses, such as steam turbines, <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> dampers, motion control, etc. The advantageous features of the improved electrohydraulic linear actuators are best described with respect to shortcomings of prior electrohydraulic linear actuators that the improved ones are intended to supplant. The flow of hydraulic fluid to the two ports of the actuator cylinder is controlled by a servo valve that is controlled by a signal from a servo amplifier that, in turn, receives an analog position-command signal (a current having a value between 4 and 20 mA) from a supervisory control system of the facility. As the position command changes, the servo valve shifts, causing a greater flow of hydraulic fluid {{to one side of}} the cylinder and thereby causing the actuator piston to move to extend or retract a piston rod from the actuator body. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) directly linked to the piston provides a position-feedback signal, which is compared with the position-command signal in the servo amplifier. When the position-feedback and position-command signals match, the servo valve moves to its null position, in which it holds the actuator piston at a steady position...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for quantifying <b>valve</b> stiction in <b>control</b> loops based on ant colony optimization has been proposed. Pneumatic <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely used}} in the <b>process</b> industry. The <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> contains non-linearities such as stiction, backlash, and deadband that in turn cause oscillations in the process output. Stiction {{is one of the}} long-standing problems and it is the most severe problem in the <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Thus the measurement data from an oscillating control loop {{can be used as a}} possible diagnostic signal to provide an estimate of the stiction magnitude. Quantification of <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> stiction is still a challenging issue. Prior to doing stiction detection and quantification, it is necessary to choose a suitable model structure to describe control-valve stiction. To understand the stiction phenomenon, the Stenman model is used. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), an intelligent swarm algorithm, proves effective in various fields. The ACO algorithm is inspired from the natural trail following behaviour of ants. The parameters of the Stenman model are estimated using ant colony optimization, from the input-output data by minimizing the error between the actual stiction model output and the simulated stiction model output. Using ant colony optimization, Stenman model with known nonlinear structure and unknown parameters can be estimated...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of <b>process</b> <b>control,</b> <b>process</b> {{indicators}} and <b>control</b> elements such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows. As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the <b>process</b> and <b>controlled</b> the <b>valves.</b> This reduced the amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process. Later years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed. These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board. The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard pneumatic signal level used during these years was 3-15 psig.|$|R
40|$|In {{industry}} {{almost all}} the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> are nonlinear. There are lot of nonlinearities such as stiction, deadzone, backlash, hysteresis etc. If a pressure {{is applied to the}} <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> there will be an oscillation in the movement of <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> stem which is unsatisfactory in <b>process</b> <b>control.</b> This is termed as static friction or stiction, present in <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> cause oscillations which will cause loose of quality and expense of raw materials.

The basic idea is to separate the ascent and descent paths of the input hysteresis nonlinearity subject to oscillatory excitations. Some identifiability analysis is performed: the proposed extended Hammerstein model structure is identifiable, and given the true input nonlinearity, the oscillatory signals in feedback control loops are shown to be informative by exploiting the cyclo-stationarity of these oscillatory signals. Industrial examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed identification algorithm in characterizing complicated characteristics of <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> stiction in practice...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{processes}} found in process industries exhibit undesirable nonlinearity due to backlash, saturation, hysteresis, stiction (friction), dead-zone and stuck-fault existing in <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is the actuator for most <b>process</b> <b>control</b> loops and, as the only moving part in the loop, its function is to implement the control action. If the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> malfunctions, {{the performance of the}} control loop is likely to deteriorate, no matter how good the controller is. Commonly encountered <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> problems include nonlinear responses to the demand signal caused by effects such as stiction, dead-band or saturation.

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R
