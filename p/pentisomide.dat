40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} <b>pentisomide</b> upon the intact human heart were evaluated using programmed stimulation and recording of intracardiac monophasic action potentials (MAP) in 17 patients with various ventricular arrhythmias. After i. v. administration of <b>pentisomide,</b> 85 - 135 mg, the atrial-His interval increased by 8 +/- 12 ms (p less than 0. 05) during sinus rhythm and by 13 +/- 21 ms (p less than 0. 05) at atrial pacing of 600 ms cycle length (600 ms pacing). The His-ventricular interval also increased by 6 +/- 10 ms during sinus rhythm (p less than 0. 05) and by 5 +/- 9 ms at 600 ms pacing (NS). The QRS duration prolonged by 9 +/- 10 ms (p less than 0. 01) and 6 +/- 8 ms (p less than 0. 01) during 600 and 500 ms ventricular pacing, respectively. The right ventricular MAP duration to 90 % repolarization was significantly shortened, by 20 +/- 21 ms (p less than 0. 01) during sinus rhythm, by 16 +/- 17 ms (p less than 0. 01) at 600 ms ventricular pacing, and by 11 +/- 16 ms (p less than 0. 01) at 500 ms ventricular pacing. The corrected QT interval was shortened by 21 +/- 28 ms (p less than 0. 01). The present study supports that <b>pentisomide</b> is a class-I antiarrhythmic agent with a marked effect on depolarization (action of class Ia and Ic) and on repolarization (action of class Ib). This unique combination of cellular electrophysiological properties {{indicates that the}} clinical antiarrhythmic efficacy of <b>pentisomide</b> may differ from that of hitherto available antiarrhythmic drugs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to clarify the cardioprotective effects of various class I antiarrhythmic drugs, i. e., aprindine, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, <b>pentisomide</b> and propafenone, on the ischemic heart. Sixty-one adult mongrel dogs were classified into eight groups according to premedication: 1) control group, physiologic saline solution was administered intravenously 25 min before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation; 2) aprindine group, 3 mg/kg body weight of aprindine intravenously; 3) disopyramide group, 2 mg/kg of disopyramide intravenously; 4) flecainide group, 2 mg/kg of flecainide intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 μg/kg per min; 5) lidocaine group, 2 mg/kg of lidocaine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 gmg/kg per min; 6) mexiletine group, 3 mg/kg per min of mexiletine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 15 μ/kg per min; 7) <b>pentisomide</b> group, 5 mg/kg intravenously; and 8) propafenone group, 2 mg/kg intravenously. Arterial blood pressure and electrocardiogram were monitored throughout the experiment. Two hours after coronary occlusion, the heart was excised. Myocardial mitochondria were prepared and mitochondrial function (the respiratory control index and the rate of oxygen consumption in state 111) was measured polarographically. Fractionation of myocardial tissues was performed and the lysosomal enzyme (N-acetyl-β-glucos-aminidase and β-glucuronidase) activities among fractions were measured. No significant hemodynamic changes were observed compared with the control group except for those in the disopyramide and flecainide groups; that is, decrease in heart rate without changes in blood pressure compared with the control group was observed. All antiarrhythmic drugs effectively prevented the development of ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischemia. Two hours of coronary occlusion induced mitochondrial dysfunction and leakage of lysosomal enzymes. In contrast, each antiarrhythmic drug without exception lessened mitochondrial dysfunction and prevented the leakage of lysosomal enzymes concomitantly. These results indicate that class I antiarrhythmic drugs have cardioprotective effects on ischemic myocardium...|$|E
