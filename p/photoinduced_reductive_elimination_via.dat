The hypervalent iodine(III) reagent IPh(CCSiMe 3) (OTf) (OTf- = CF 3 SO 3 -) oxidizes the Pt(II) complexes PtR 1 R 2 (dmpe) to Pt(IV) complexes that are stable at low temperatures.

The mixtures of dimethylplatinum(IV) species (1 a and 1 c) and of methyl(p-tolyl) platinum(IV) species (4 a and 4 c) react with sodium iodide, acetonitrile, and pyridine to form the cis-configured isomers of the complexes PtIR 1 R 2 (CCSiMe 3) (dmpe) (1 b, 4 b) and [PtR 1 R 2 (CCSiMe 3) (dmpe) (L) ](OTf) (L) NCMe: 1 d, 4 d; L) py: 1 e, 4 e).

The trans-isomers of diaryl(triflato) platinum(IV) complexes do not take part in ligand substitution reactions with sodium iodide, acetonitrile, or pyridine, but minor Pt(IV) complexes in equilibrium with 2 a and 3 a do react with iodide to form PtIAr 2 (CtCSiMe 3) (dmpe) (2 b, 3 b). Structural studies of PtPh 2 (dmpe) (3) and PtIMe(p-Tol) (CCSiMe 3) (dmpe) (4 b) reveal square-planar and octahedral geometries, respectively.

40|$|Copper-mediated allylic {{substitution}} {{reactions are}} widely used in organic synthesis, whereas the analogous reactions for silver and gold are essentially unknown. To unravel why this is the case, the gas-phase reactions of allyl iodide with the coinage metal dimethylmetallates, [CH 3 MCH 3] − (M = Cu, Ag and Au), were examined under the near thermal conditions of an ion trap mass spectrometer and via electronic structure calculations. [CH 3 CuCH 3] − reacted with allyl iodide with a reaction efficiency of 6. 6 % of the collision rate to yield: I – (75 %); the cross-coupling product, [CH 3 CuI] − (24 %); and the homo-coupling product, [C 3 H 5 CuI] − (1 %). [CH 3 AgCH 3] − and [CH 3 AuCH 3] − reacted substantially slower (reaction efficiencies of 0. 028 % and 0. 072 %). [CH 3 AgCH 3] − forms I – (19 %) and [CH 3 AgI] − (81 %), while only I – is formed from [CH 3 AuCH 3] −. Because the experiments do not detect the neutral product(s) formed, which might otherwise help identify the mechanisms of reaction, and to rationalize the observed ionic products and reactivity order, calculations at the B 3 LYP/def 2 -QZVP//B 3 LYP/SDD 6 - 31 +G(d) level were conducted on four different mechanisms: (i) S N 2; (ii) S N 2 ′; (iii) oxidative-addition/reductive <b>elimination</b> (OA/RE) <b>via</b> an M(III) η 3 -allyl intermediate; and (iv) OA/RE via an M(III) η 1 -allyl intermediate. For copper, mechanisms (iii) and (iv) are predicted to be competitive. Only the Cu(III) η 3 -allyl intermediate undergoes <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>via</b> two different transition states to yield either the cross-coupling or the homo-coupling products. Their relative barriers are consistent with homo-coupling being a minor pathway. For silver, the kinetically most probable pathway is the S N 2 reaction, consistent with no homo-coupling product, [C 3 H 5 AgI] −, being observed. For gold, no C–C coupling reaction is kinetically viable. Instead, I – is predicted to be formed along with a stable Au(III) η 3 -allyl complex.

40|$|The <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> {{reactions}} {{detailed in}} this dissertation provide experimental {{insight into the}} mechanism of <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> to form the C(sp 3) -N bond of benzylamines and the C(sp 3) -O bond of benzyl ethers. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction indicates an ionic pathway, but the process lacks many {{of the effects of}} electronic and solvent perturbations that typically signal an ionic intermediate. We propose that <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from benzylpalladium(II) amido and aryloxide complexes occurs by dissociation of the amido or aryloxide ligand, followed by nucleophilic attack on the benzyl ligand. The proposed ionic mechanism is more akin to the <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> reactions that occur from high-valent Pt(IV) and Ni(III) complexes than <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> reactions that occur from other Pd(II) complexes. Our data indicate that substantial differences exist between <b>reductive</b> <b>eliminations</b> to form the C(sp 3) bonds in ethers and amines from palladium(II). We prepared alkylpalladium(II) amido complexes to study the C(sp 3) -N <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> reaction from complexes containing a non-benzylic hydrocarbyl ligand. We investigated a series of alkylpalladium amido complexes and observed <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> occurs from bisphosphine-ligated neopentylpalladium amido complexes in low yield. <b>Reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from neopentylpalladium amido complexes occurs most likely by a concerted <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> reaction, and is favored by the increased steric bulk of the neopentyl ligand. We also investigated azametallacyclic palladium complexes with a norbornyl hydrocarbyl ligand, and observed <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> occurs to form a norbornyl indoline product. We found that the yield was slightly improved over neopentylpalladium complexes, but that the yield of <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> was low. Finally we investigated non-metallacyclic complexes containing a norbornyl hydrocarbyl ligand. We discovered that <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> occurs in moderate yield, and the <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> product ratio indicates a balance between a concerted and an ionic mechanism. 	 The data presented in this dissertation demonstrate that C(sp 3) -N <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from benzylpalladium(II) and alkylpalladium(II) complexes can occur. We propose an ionic mechanism for the formation of benzylamines and benzyl ethers by <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from benzylpalladium(II) complexes. <b>Reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from neopentyl and metallacyclicpalladium(II) complexes likely occurs by a concerted mechanism, demonstrating the importance of steric bulk and metal geometry, respectively. Finally, <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from non-metallacyclic norbornylpalladium(II) complexes indicates that a concerted and ionic mechanism may occur simultaneously. Although the yield of the alkylamine products is low, the observation that C(sp 3) -N <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> occurs from the alkylpalladium complexes provides the first step toward developing a synthetically useful reaction for the formation of C(sp 3) -heteroatom bonds from low-valent group 10 complexes without the addition of an oxidant...|$|R

Despite the implication of Pd(IV) intermediates prior to bond-forming C–X <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> in these catalytic reactions, the reported organometallic Pd(IV) complexes in the literature primarily underwent C–C bond-forming <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination.</b> The goal of this dissertation was to design systems to study C–X <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from observable Pd(IV) complexes. In addition to <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> reactions from Pd(IV), we sought to explore other organometallic reactions at Pd(IV) centers such as C–H activation. The first data chapter presents a detailed mechanistic study of C–O and C–C bond-formation from isolable PdIV complexes. A variety of complexes were synthesized to explore how electronic factors, activation parameters, solvent effects and additive effects are involved in/influence C–O <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from a PdIV center. Additionally, we identified a system that yielded competing C–O and C–C <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from PdIV. Therefore, we conducted mechanistic studies to probe C–C bond formation from PdIV; {{we were able to}} propose a mechanism for this transformation as well. Chapter 3 investigates sp 2 versus sp 3 -C–X bond formation from PdIV complexes. Interestingly, in all of the systems that were studied, sp 3 -C–X bond formation out competes sp 2 <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination.</b> This chapter presents novel examples of sp 3 -C–F, C–N and C–O <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from PdIV in addition to sp 3 -C–Cl bond-formation. These reactions represent the first examples of high yielding sp 3 -C–X <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from PdIV. Lastly, the mechanistic insights gained from these studies lead us to examine systems for sp 3 -C–X bond-formation that do not use the oxidant to deliver the desired functionality. Next, Chapter 4 of this thesis describes the development a ligand system to explore C–H activation directly at a PdIV center. We designed a complex where <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> is slow and C–H activation is observed.
