5|$|Vanadinite {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized zone of lead-bearing deposits, the vanadium is leached from wall-rock silicates. Associated minerals include mimetite, <b>pyromorphite,</b> descloizite, mottramite, wulfenite, cerussite, anglesite, calcite, barite, and various iron oxide minerals.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals <b>pyromorphite</b> (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E

40|$|Metals {{are very}} common {{contaminants}} at `Superfund' sites in US, and similarly contaminated sites worldwide. Long-term deposition of metals in soils {{can lead to}} accumulation, transport and biotoxicity/zootoxicity caused by mobility and bioavailability of significant fraction of the metals. Because of their immutable nature strict natural remediation processes alone may not be successful in mitigating the risks from metals at these sites. However, accelerating these processes, i. e., accelerated natural remediation that ultimately immobilizes the metals might be a viable option. Applications to soils of certain soil amendments that enhance key biogeochemical processes in soils that eventually immobilize metals have already been demonstrated in Europe and North America on a field scale. Case studies using lime, phosphate and biosolid materials have demonstrated, under field conditions, accelerated natural remediation, resulting in substantially improved vegetation growth, enhanced microbial population and diversity, and reduced off site metal transport. Depending on soil/hydrogeochemical properties, source term and metal form/species, and land use, the immobilization efficacy induced by such accelerated natural remediation may be enduring. While long-term stability of certain metal complexes such as metal <b>pyromorphites</b> {{has been shown in}} model systems, the influence of plant roots and its microbial and mycorrhizal association on such stability is unknown. A suite of chemical and biological tests is available to monitor the efficacy of accelerated natural remediation...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metals {{including}} lead (Pb) {{are released}} continually {{into the environment}} {{as a result of}} industrial, recreational, and military activities. Lead ranked number two on the CERCLA Priority List of Hazardous Substances and was identified as a major hazardous chemical found on 47 % of USEPA's National Priorities List sites (Hettiarachchi and Pierzynski 2004). In-situ remediation of lead (Pb) contaminated soils may be accomplished by changing the soil chemistry and structure with the application of microbial and phosphate amendments. Soil contaminated with lead bullets was collected {{from the surface of the}} berm at Savannah River Site (SRS) Small Arms Training Academy (SATA) in Aiken, SC. While uncontaminated soils typically have Pb levels ranging from 2 to 200 mg/kg (Berti et al. 1998), previous analysis show Pb levels of the SATA berm to reach 8, 673 mg/kg. Biosurfactants are surface-active compounds naturally produced by soil bacteria that can bind metals. Biosurfactants have a wide variety of chemical structures that reduce interfacial surface tensions (Jennings and Tanner 2000) and have demonstrated efficient metal complexion (Lin 1996). Biosurfactants also have the potential to change the availability of natural organic matter (Strong-Gunderson 1995). Two types of bacteria, Alcaligenes piechaudii and Pseudomonas putida, were employed as amendments based on their ability to produce biosurfactants and survive in metal-contaminated soils. Apatites (calcium phosphate compounds) are important in the formation of Pb phosphates. Pb phosphates form rapidly when phosphate is available and are the most stable environmental form of lead in soil (Ruby et al. 1998). <b>Pyromorphites</b> in particular remain insoluble under a wide range of environmental conditions (Zhang et al. 1998). The three apatites evaluated in the current study were North Carolina apatite (NCA), Florida apatite (FA), and biological apatite (BA). BA is ground fish bone that has few impurities such as As, Cr, or U and contains about 27 % total phosphate, most of which is available. FA and NCA are two types of rock phosphates that release small amounts of phosphate over time. Total phosphate is around 30 % with only 1 - 2 % phosphate available (Knox et al. 2005). In this study, we describe the influence of combining the two microbial and three phosphate amendments on reducing lead bioavailability in shooting range soil...|$|R
