5000|$|There were {{especially}} two terms used in {{claims in the}} 642 patents that required clarification. In both the district and circuit court, potential infringement centered on the definition of “synchronous”. In Fujitsu’s patent, {{the function of the}} alert beacon signal is described as “an intermittent power-on type mobile station for shift to a <b>power-on</b> <b>state</b> synchronously with a received timing of a beacon signal, with a fixed period of time after the beacon signal has been received being defined as a data receive-ready period”. [...] The district court construed the phrase [...] "shifting to a power on state synchronously with a received timing of a beacon signal" [...] to mean [...] "shifting to a <b>power-on</b> <b>state</b> {{at the same time a}} beacon signal is to be received.|$|E
5000|$|Commodore BASIC {{versions}} 4.0 {{and later}} provide a pseudo-variable {{referred to as}} [...] {{that may be used}} to retrieve drive status in lieu of the above code. This reserved variable is not available on earlier versions of BASIC, so the command channel must be manually read as demonstrated above. Note that immediately after power-on or reset, the DOS revision will be returned. For example, a 1541 will return 73,CBM DOS V2.6 1541,00,00. Error code 73 is common to all drive models and may be used to determine if the drive has been reset to its <b>power-on</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During the appeal, Fujitsu claimed [...] "synchronously" [...] {{does not}} mean “at the same time”. Instead, Fujitsu stated [...] "synchronously" [...] means: “the {{shifting}} to a <b>power-on</b> <b>state</b> has a temporal relationship with the beacon signal so that the beacon signal can be received.” In addition, Fujitsu argued that the district court's definition of [...] "synchronous" [...] would require two events to occur at precisely the same time which they stated is a physical impossibility. Netgear argued the district court’s interpretation was correct. The circuit court defined synchronous to mean “just before or at the same time” and thereby slightly relax the limitation. Given the evidence from the district court’s experiment, however, the circuit court affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement without modification.|$|E
50|$|Utilization of raster {{interrupts}} is {{an essential}} part of C64 game programming. In the computer's <b>power-on</b> default <b>state,</b> the first CIA chip generates an interrupt 60 times per second which sends the CPU to the kernel IRQ handler at $EA31. This acknowledges the CIA interrupt, updates the clock, scans the keyboard, and blinks the cursor in BASIC. Games normally disable this and instead set up the VIC-II to generate interrupts when a specific scanline is reached, which is necessary for split-screen scrolling and playing music. The game remaps the IRQ vector at $0314/$0315 to its raster handler which performs these functions and then optionally executes a JMP $EA31 instruction to return control to the kernel, provided that the game does not take over the machine and therefore doesn't want to apply kernel's interrupt routine.|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} has been {{developed}} for the Space Interferometer Mission (SIM) piezo stepping actuator. Piezo stepping actuators are novel because they offer extreme dynamic range (centimeter stroke with nanometer resolution) with power, thermal, mass, and volume advantages over existing motorized actuation technology. These advantages come with {{the added benefit of}} greatly reduced complexity in the support electronics. The piezo stepping actuator consists of three fully redundant sets of piezoelectric transducers (PZTs), two sets of brake PZTs, and one set of extension PZTs. These PZTs are used to grasp and move a runner attached to the optic to be moved. By proper cycling of the two brake and extension PZTs, both forward and backward moves of the runner can be achieved. Each brake can be configured for either a <b>power-on</b> or power-off <b>state.</b> For SIM, the brakes and gate of the mechanism are configured in such a manner that, {{at the end of the}} step, the actuator is in a parked or power-off state. The control software uses asynchronous sampling of an optical encoder to monitor the position of the runner. These samples are timed to coincide with the end of the previous move, which may consist of a variable number of steps. This sampling technique linearizes the device by avoiding input saturation of the actuator and makes latencies of the plant vanish. The software also estimates, in real time, the scale factor of the device and a disturbance caused by cycling of the brakes. These estimates are used to actively cancel the brake disturbance. The control system also includes feedback and feedforward elements that regulate the position of the runner to a given reference position. Convergence time for smalland medium-sized reference positions (less than 200 microns) to within 10 nanometers can be achieved in under 10 seconds. Convergence times for large moves (greater than 1 millimeter) are limited by the step rate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent work}} at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (MDA) {{to develop and}} validate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of under expanded rocket plume external flowfields for multibody expendable launch vehicles (ELVs). Multi engine reacting gas flowfield predictions of ELV base pressures are needed to define vehicle base drag and base heating rates for sizing external nozzle and base region insulation thicknesses. Previous ELV design programs used expensive multibody power-on wind tunnel tests that employed chamber/nozzle injected high pressure cold or hot-air. Base heating and pressure measurements were belatedly made during the first flights of past ELV's to correct estimates from semi-empirical engineering models or scale model tests. Presently, CFD methods for use in ELV design are being jointly developed at the Space Transportation Division (MDA-STD) and New Aircraft Missiles Division (MDA-NAMD). An explicit three dimensional, zonal, finite-volume, full Navier-Stokes (FNS) solver with finite rate hydrocarbon/air and aluminum combustion kinetics was developed to accurately compute ELV <b>power-on</b> flowfields. Mississippi <b>State</b> University's GENIE++ general purpose interactive grid generation code was chosen to create zonal, finite volume viscous grids. Axisymmetric, time dependent, turbulent CFD simulations of a Delta DSV- 2 A vehicle with a MB- 3 liquid main engine burning RJ- 1 /LOX were first completed. Hydrocarbon chemical kinetics and a k-epsilon turbulence model were employed and predictions were validated with flight measurements of base pressure and temperature. Zonal internal/external grids were created for a Delta DSV- 2 C vehicle with a MB- 3 and three Castor- 1 solid motors burning and a Delta- 2 with an RS- 27 main engine (LOX/RP- 1) and 9 GEM's attached/ 6 burning. Cold air, time dependent FNS calculations were performed for DSV- 2 C during 1992. Single phase simulations that employ finite rate hydrocarbon and aluminum (solid fuel) combustion chemistry are currently in progress. Reliable and efficient Eulerian algorithms are needed to model two phase (solid-gas) momentum and energy transfer mechanisms for solid motor fuel combustion products...|$|R

To {{solve the}} problem of {{repeated}} loss of low voltage power cables, this paper designed a project in preventing the cables from stealing. The design of the system is based on the Impedance Characteristics method which is used in <b>power-on</b> <b>state</b> and the Parallel Resonance which is used in power-off state. The paper describes the principle of the method and how to combine the two methods. The simulation and test for it show that the method is correct. The system makes it possible to protect the cable from stealing without affecting the electricity system. In addition, it can calculate the fault location. The system has better accurateness and stableness than the common cable anti-theft system...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the energy}} {{consumption}} of PCs is becom-ing increasingly important with rising energy costs and environmental concerns. Sleep {{states such as}} S 3 (sus-pend to RAM) save energy but prevent the PC from re-sponding to network traffic, for example remote desktop logins, file transfer requests, or content distribution pro-tocols such as bittorrent. We conducted a background survey showing that having these applications running {{is the reason why}} many users leave PCs on even when idle. We present Somniloquy, an architecture that augments network interfaces to allow PCs in S 3 to be responsive to network traffic, transparently to remote applications and to the network itself. We show that many applications can be supported without application-specific code in the augmented network interface, including file sharing, re-mote desktop and VOIP. We show that a further class of applications can be supported with modest process-ing and memory resources in the network interface, in-cluding instant messaging presence and file sharing, for example downloading using bittorrent while the PC is asleep. Our prototype implementation of Somniloquy using a USB peripheral showed significant energy saving poten-tial in experiments, with 24 x less power draw for desk-tops and 11 x for laptops compared to an idle <b>power-on</b> <b>state.</b> ...|$|E
