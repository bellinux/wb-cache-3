5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution <b>prevention</b> <b>measure.</b> The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

40|$|Due to its rapid {{spread and}} {{the delay in}} the {{discovery}} of drugs or vaccines to treat it, the epidemic can cause millions of deaths worldwide. <b>Prevention</b> <b>measures</b> are therefore an explicit objective of public health policy. We develop a questionnaire {{that allows us to}} analyze people's preferences for different <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> classified by epidemic severity. Failure to comply with the recommended <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> is both dangerous {{to the health of the}} population and economically costly to society. We see that part of our panel is willing to comply voluntarily with the recommended <b>prevention</b> <b>measures.</b> We show that the revelation of peo-ple's preferences allows us to determine the individual intangible (psychological) cost for <b>prevention</b> <b>measures.</b> This cost causes the individual not to voluntarily comply with <b>prevention</b> <b>measures.</b> We then propose government interventions to reduce intangible costs and motivate the individual to implement the recommended <b>prevention</b> <b>measures.</b> However, where these incentives fail, mandatory measures are an alternative...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Otic {{barotrauma}} {{is common}} among air travellers {{and can cause}} severe otalgia, perforation of the tympanic membrane and hearing loss. Many <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> exist, with varying evidence to support their use. There are no data to establish if air travellers are aware of them or indeed use them. We aimed to establish air travellers' knowledge of such <b>prevention</b> <b>measures.</b> METHODS: We surveyed air travellers at two UK airports {{by means of a}} questionnaire. Answers to the questionnaire were collected over a two-week period. RESULTS: Overall, 179 air travellers {{with a mean age of}} 28 years (range: 15 - 72 years) completed the questionnaire. There were 66 female and 113 male air travellers. The majority (84 per cent) complained of symptoms while flying and 30 per cent were not aware of any <b>prevention</b> <b>measures.</b> Barotrauma-related symptoms were reported in 25 per cent of air travellers who were unaware of any <b>prevention</b> <b>measures.</b> Nearly all air travellers (86 per cent) indicated that more information regarding <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> would be useful. CONCLUSION: Air travellers are often not aware of <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> to avoid otic barotrauma, and the majority suffer as a result. Increasing public awareness of simple <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> would have a significant impact on air travellers...|$|R
50|$|<b>Prevention</b> <b>measures</b> will {{decrease}} {{the costs of}} the damage, related to environmental pollution (e.g. damage costs related to human health problems in terms of DALYs). The savings which are a result of the <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> are of the same order of magnitude as the costs of prevention. So the total effect of <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> on our society is that it results in a better environment at virtually no extra costs, since costs of prevention and costs of savings will level out.|$|R
25|$|Needle {{exchange}} programmes are not {{a strategy}} officially sanctioned by the Ministry of Public Security since such strategies {{give the appearance of}} condoning drug use. Thus, when this strategy was first introduced, it was called needle social marketing – increasing the commercial availability and accessibility of needles in combination with health education about safe injecting practices and, in some cases, provision of free needles. Since 2001, the State Council has officially advocated needle social marketing as an HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>measure.</b> Evidence from research and study tours to countries such as Australia, which runs successful needle exchange programmes, prompted the Ministry of Health to support the first such programme in Yunnan province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1999. In 2000–02, a larger intervention trial of needle exchange programmes was done in four counties of Guangdong province and Guangxi, funded by the World AIDS Foundation. Cross-sectional data gathered at follow-up indicated that participants in intervention communities were almost three times less likely to have shared needles in the past month than those in control communities (odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.25–0.52). Furthermore, rates of infection with hepatitis C virus were significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the control arm (51.1% vs 83.6%, p=0.001) and HIV rates were lower in the intervention arm; however, this was significant only in Guangdong (p=0.011) and not in Guangxi (p=0.2) nor overall (18.1% vs 23.6%, p=0.391).|$|E
