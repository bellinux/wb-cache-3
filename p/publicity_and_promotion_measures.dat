40|$|A {{structural}} and categorical model for Portuguese tourists This paper addresses the decision-making processes observed in Portuguese tourists who have travelled to exotic places {{by developing a}} conceptual framework that focuses on information sources, motivations, perceptions, satisfaction and behavioural intentions. Determinants such as <b>publicity</b> <b>and</b> <b>promotion</b> are {{used to measure the}} role of information sources on activating motivations and on the learning process that leads to these perceptions. Such a decision process could be assessed in two phases: pre-purchase and post-purchase. The pre-purchase phase presupposes a set of motivations, which are combined according to the intrinsic needs of the individual, through the influence of the <b>publicity</b> <b>and</b> <b>promotion.</b> From the external and internal stimuli, the individual conceives their perceptions about the considered destinations, which leads to the choice of destination. Upon return, these perceptions and motivations are either confirmed or refuted. This construct, designated by satisfaction, will influence future purchase behaviour. This conceptual framework, defined around the main constructs {{that it is possible to}} measure, was used and tested by means of a survey carried out with Portugues...|$|R
