500|$|The Duke of Northumberland's mode of {{operation}} {{was very different from}} Somerset's. Careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors, he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimatise his authority. Lacking Somerset's blood-relationship with the king, he added members to the Council from his own faction in order to control it. He also added members of his family to the royal household. He saw that to achieve personal dominance, he needed total <b>procedural</b> <b>control</b> of the Council. In the words of historian John Guy, [...] "Like Somerset, he became quasi-king; the difference was that he managed the bureaucracy on the pretence that Edward had assumed full sovereignty, whereas Somerset had asserted the right to near-sovereignty as Protector".|$|E

I use data on the regulatory process under the Clinton and Bush Administrations to assess the differences between these presidents with distinct ideological regulatory agendas.

50|$|<b>Procedural</b> <b>control</b> is used {{in areas}} (oceanic or land) which do not have radar. The FANS concept was {{developed}} to improve the safety and efficiency of airplanes operating under <b>procedural</b> <b>control.</b> This method uses time-based procedures to keep aircraft separated. The separation standard {{is determined by the}} accuracy of the reported positions, frequency of position reports, and timeliness of communication with respect to intervention. Non-FANS procedural separation uses Inertial Navigation Systems for position, flight crew voice reports of position (and time of next waypoint), and High Frequency radio for communication. The INS systems have error introduced by drifting after initial alignment. This error can approach 10 nmi km.|$|E

40|$|NASA's Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging (NGSLR) {{station is}} the {{prototype}} for NASA's Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) systems {{which will be}} deployed {{around the world in}} the coming decade. The NGSLR system will be an autonomous, photon-counting SLR station with an expected absolute range accuracy of better than one centimeter and a normal point (time-averaged) range precision better than one millimeter. The system provides continuous (weather permitting), 24 hour tracking coverage to an existing constellation of approximately two dozen artificial satellites equipped with passive retroreflector arrays, using pulsed, 532 nm, class IV laser systems. Current details on the approved laser systems {{can be found in the}} Appendix 1 of this document. This safety plan addresses the potential hazards to emitted laser radiation, which can occur both inside and outside the shelter. Hazards within the shelter are mitigated through posted warning signs, activated warning lights, <b>procedural</b> <b>controls,</b> personal protective equipment (PPE), laser curtains, beam blocking systems, interlock controls, pre-configured laser control settings, and other controls discussed in this document. Since the NGSLR is a satellite tracking system, laser hazards exist outside the shelter to personnel on the shelter roof and to passing aircraft. Potential exposure to personnel outside the system is mitigated through the use of posted warning signs, access <b>control,</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>controls,</b> a stairwell interlock, beam attenuation/blocking devices, and a radar based aircraft detection system...|$|R
40|$|Plott and Zeiler (2005) {{suggest that}} the WTA-WTP gap arises from subject misconceptions rather than {{asymmetric}} valuation of gains and losses relative to the reference state because the gap disappeared when they adopted all known <b>procedural</b> <b>controls</b> for misconceptions. We modified subtle details of their procedures to make the reference state of possession more salient to sellers, vice versa for buyers, keeping all necessary controls for misconceptions. These changes resulted in a highly statistically significant gap. Thus, the gap’s on-off results for different procedures {{are more likely to}} be due to procedurally induced saliency of the reference states than misconceptions...|$|R

50|$|After the Bhopal {{disaster}} in 1984, the US state of New Jersey adopted the Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act(TCPA) from 1985. In 2003 its rules were revised to include inherently safer technologies (IST). In 2005, the New Jersey Domestic Security Preparedness Task Force established a new “Best Practices Standards” program, {{in which it}} required chemical facilities to conduct inherently safer technologies (IST) reviews. In 2008, the TCPA program was expanded to require all TCPA facilities toconduct IST reviews on both new and existing processes. The State of New Jersey created its own definition of IST for regulatory purposes and stretched the definition of IST to include passive, active, and <b>procedural</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R

The goal of a good cryptographic design is to reduce more complex problems to the proper management and safe-keeping of a small number of cryptographic keys, ultimately secured through trust in hardware or software by physical isolation or <b>procedural</b> <b>controls.</b> Reliance on physical and procedural security (e. g., secured rooms with isolated equipment), tamper-resistant hardware, and trust in a large number of individuals is minimized by concentrating trust in a small number of easily monitored, controlled, and trustworthy element...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{tests and}} RASTs are {{important}} tools {{but do not}} by themselves make or exclude the diagnosis of allergy. Positive results require a confirmatory medical history, whereas negative results exclude IgE-mediated allergy {{with a high degree}} of reliability. Skins tests are preferred for routine use, because with appropriate <b>procedural</b> <b>controls</b> they are simpler, give rapid results and are cost-effective. RASTs are an excellent alternative when skin tests are precluded. Disorders such as asthma and allergic rhinitis may be provoked by irritants (e. g., cigarette smoke), physical factors (e. g., cold, dry air) and chemical substances (e. g., acetylsalicylic acid) and metabisulfite), none of which involve an IgE-antibody-mediated mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|Bureaucratic {{drift in}} American {{political}} science {{is a theory}} that seeks to explain the tendency for bureaucratic agencies to create policy that deviates from the original mandate. [...] The difference between a bureaucracy's enactment of a law and the legislature's intent is called bureaucratic drift. Legislation is produced by elected officials, but is implemented by unelected bureaucrats, who sometimes act under their own preferences or interests. Bureaucratic drift is often treated as a principal-agent problem, with the House, Senate and Presidency acting as principals and bureaucracy acting as the agent. The government seeks to control bureaucratic drift {{in a number of}} ways, most notably congressional oversight and <b>procedural</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Administrative <b>controls</b> (also called <b>procedural</b> <b>controls)</b> {{consist of}} {{approved}} written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. Administrative controls form {{the framework for}} running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed - the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.|$|R
