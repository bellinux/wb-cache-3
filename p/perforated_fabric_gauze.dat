The open weave design of gauze sponges assists with the removal of dead tissue from the skin surface as well as vertically wick fluid from the wound onto any secondary dressing to assist with preventing maceration of skin tissue. In order to avoid leaving gauze sponges in bodies, some kinds of gauze sponge are woven with X-ray detectable thread.|$|R

25|$|The {{shielding}} material used – wire <b>gauze,</b> <b>fabric</b> or foam – {{is designed}} {{to have a significant}} acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft <b>fabrics</b> and <b>gauzes</b> require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{evaluated}} the surface, thermal, friction, drape and moisture properties of surgical cotton weaved and knitted <b>fabric</b> <b>gauzes</b> coated with chitosan nanocapsules containing essential oil of Copaifera multijuga Hayne. The result {{indicates that the}} biofunctionalized medical textiles induce low capillarity, allowing a good degree of moisture and absorption capacity of wound exudates. The gauzes coated with chitosan (CH) at the optimized mass fractions of 0. 125 wt% demonstrate good thermal, friction and draping properties, thus promoting the best conditions for maintenance of the wound healing microenvironment. The knitted fabric shows the best thermal, friction and capillarity proprieties compared to weaved gauze. This gauze allows {{the development of a}} knitted biofunctionalized medical device especially designed for burn wounds treatment. Jefferson M.

40|$|Abstract: Tissue {{engineering}} is a multidisciplinary field focused on in vitro reconstruction of mammalian tissues. In {{order to allow}} a similar three-dimensional organization of in vitro cultured cells, biocompatible scaffolds are needed. This need has provided immense momentum for research on “smart scaffolds ” for use in cell culture. One {{of the most promising}} materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is a hyaluronan derivative: a benzyl ester of hyaluronan (HYAFF ®). HYAFF ® can be processed to obtain several types of devices such as tubes, membranes, non-woven <b>fabrics,</b> <b>gauzes,</b> and sponges. All these scaffolds are highly biocompatible. In the human body they do not elicit any adverse reactions and are resorbed by the host tissues. Human hepatocytes, dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, chondrocytes, Schwann cells, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells have been successfully cultured in these meshes. The same scaffolds, in tube meshes, has been applied for vascular tissue engineering that has emerged as a promising technology for the design of an ideal, responsive, living conduit with properties similar to that of native tissue...|$|R

Red-brownish tint appears because of the formation of protoxide and oxide of copper. The production of bactericidal fabrics by the ironed wet materials with the metal ions at a temperature near 200 – 220  °С does not require the use of chemical reductant and prolonged warming up; the surface of press is not painted and not corroded, allowing to save time and facilities at the production of material.|$|R

40|$|The {{collection}} of human odor volatiles {{is of interest}} to forensic applications as a path to investigate canine scent discriminations in legal investigations. A study using a selected array of previously identified human odor compounds has been conducted to determine the retention and release capabilities of five (5) natural and synthetic fabric types, cotton (mercerized <b>fabric</b> and <b>gauze</b> matrix), polyester, rayon and wool. A direct spike approach as well {{the use of a}} dynamic airflow device were the two approaches used for the {{collection of}} the selected volatile organic mix. The direct spike experiment showed how natural, cellulosic fibers such as viscose rayon showed an enhanced ability to release a reproducible volatile odor profile. Rayon demonstrated to be the fabric type with the highest recovered scent mass amounts, followed by wool and polyester. As was expected cotton showed the lowest recovered amounts, possibly due to its complex fiber morphology which enhances the possibility of chemicals to be retained in higher rates within the structure of the cotton fiber. Samples collected on the same fabric substrate showed a reproducible odor profile as measured via hierarchical clustering which corroborates previous live human odor studies and which can be pivotal in forensic biometric measurements. The introduction of an airflow variable to volatile collection decreased the amounts recovered for all fiber types. The reproducibility for each fabric type between replicate sampling was also reduced and a statistical significant difference (P< 0. 001) was observed in the interaction between airflow speed and fabric type. The cotton fabric was the material which showed enhance collection at the low airflow speed as observed by the recovered mass amount. In conclusion, these findings d...|$|R

40|$|Cotton <b>gauze</b> <b>fabric</b> was {{functionalized}} with 2 -(dimethylamino) {{ethyl methacrylate}} (DMAEMA) {{with the aim}} of developing wound dressings with antibiofilm activity and tunable debriding activity. Cotton-g-DMAEMA gauzes were prepared via one-step grafting (direct method) using Co- 60 gamma-rays as source to initiate the polymerization process. The effects of absorbed dose, dose rate, and monomer concentration on the degree of grafting were evaluated in detail. Some cotton-g-DMAEMA gauzes were subsequently quaternized with methyl iodide. Grafting of DMAEMA and sequential quaternization were confirmed by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy; thermal properties were analyzed using TGA, and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. Grafting of DMAEMA gauzes enhanced blood absorption and collagenase activity, while further quaternization led to a remarkable inhibition of the proteinase activity. Their antimicrobial features were analyzed by evaluating their biofilm inhibiting and biofilm eradicating properties in an in vitro chronic wound model. Although the non-quaternized gauzes only displayed moderate biofilm inhibitory properties at best, the quaternized cotton-g-DMAEMA bearing the highest content of DMAEMA displayed strong biofilm inhibiting and biofilm eradicating properties. This indicates that quaternized cotton-g-DMAEMA gauzes are less prone to be colonized by bacteria and can notably reduce the number of colonies in an infected wound...|$|R
40|$|Wound {{healing is}} a {{complicated}} process with haemostasis, neovascularisation and re-epithelisation. To accelerate the process, moisture, sterile condition without microbial intervention and plant metabolites to influence the wound healing related metabolic functions are needed. The 40 s Ne yarn was used to prepare the wound dressing cotton gauze. The physical properties such as areal density, air permeability and stiffness of gauze were analysed. Mixed polymer formulations like chitosan-sodium alginate, sodium alginate-calcium alginate and chitosan-sodium alginate-calcium alginate were prepared and coated separately on cotton gauze surface using pad-dry-cure method. The herbal extract of Bletilla striata was immobilized on the polymer coated fabrics to increase the rate of wound healing. The qualitative and quantitative antibacterial assays of coated cotton gauze was evaluated against the bacteria S. aureus ATCC 6538 and E. coli ATCC 10229 using the standard EN ISO 20654 : 2004 and AATCC testing methods. Animal model was used to reveal the wound closure effect of the prepared specimens. A novel design of various polymer coated cotton <b>gauze</b> <b>fabric</b> for wound healing with antimicrobial activity was developed using 40 s Ne yarn.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we ask how a {{shrinking}} city responds {{when faced with}} a <b>perforated</b> urban <b>fabric.</b> Drawing on Manchester’s response to its perforated eastern flank - and informed by a parallel study of Leipzig - we use the city’s current approach to critique urban regeneration policy in England. Urban renaissance holds out the promise of delivering more sustainable - that is more compact, more inclusive and more equitable - cities. However, the Manchester study demonstrated that the attempt to stem population loss from the city is at best fragile, despite a raft of policies now in place to support urban renaissance in England. It is argued here that Manchester like Leipzig is likely to face an ongoing battle to attract residents back from their suburban hinterlands. This is especially true of the family market that we identify as being an important element for long-term sustainable population growth in both cities. We use the case of New East Manchester to consider how discourses linked to urban renaissance – particularly those that link urbanism with greater densities - rule out some of the options available to Leipzig, namely, managing the long-term perforation of the city. We demonstrate that while Manchester is inevitably committed to the urban renaissance agenda, in practice New East Manchester demonstrates a far more pragmatic – but equally unavoidable – approach. This we attribute to the gap between renaissance and regeneration described by Amin et al (2000) who define the former as urbanism for the middle class and the latter as urbanism for the working class. While this opportunistic approach may ultimately succeed in producing development on the ground, it will not address the fundamental, and chronic, problem; the combination of push and pull that sees families relocating to suburban areas. Thus, if existing communities in East Manchester are to have their area buoyed up – or sustained - by incomers, and especially families, with greater levels of social capital and higher incomes urban policy in England will have to be challenged...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of ongoing {{research}} examining the interconnections between human geography and urban planning; simultaneously, it {{is part of}} a wider research agenda aiming to address gaps between Western and Non-Western literatures. Under the broader theme of spatial justice, understood as the manifestation of social justice in space, this thesis looks at two urban phenomena in the Middle Eastern context of Amman, Jordan: derelict and underutilised spaces known as brownfields, and; the practice aiming to revitalise vacant spaces in urban areas known as temporary urbanism. Over the past few decades, these two urban phenomena have been extensively investigated in Western contexts using methods and tools designed in and for those contexts and using Western-centric theoretical frames. As highlighted by this study, in the Middle Eastern context, there is little or no work investigating brownfields, temporary urbanism or spatial justice; as a result planning practices and frameworks fail to address them. Accordingly, this thesis seeks to establish the debate on these three central themes and the links between them in Arabic literature and Middle Eastern planning frameworks. By examining both the brownfield sites and temporary uses that <b>perforate</b> Amman’s urban <b>fabric,</b> a Lefebvrian and Lefebvrian-influenced critical spatial perspective is adopted that emphasises the social production of space and the right to the city. This thesis thereby argues that the reclamation of brownfield sites through temporary urbanism may enhance spatial justice within a wider global quest for just cities and just communities...|$|R

The nationalistic turmoil of the First World War incited a series of destructive events resulting in a schism within the flourishing industrial community and pitting ethnic Germans against the loyalist British.

Over the next century, Kitchener’s downtown succumbed {{to a series of}} massive urban fires <b>perforating</b> the dense <b>fabric</b> of the city with echoing voids of collective amnesia. The historic fires of Berlin/Kitchener are the backdrop of the thesis, with two sites (the Foundation & Schneider’s Creek) forming the stage upon which a shamanic transformation is enacted through an intuitive assembly of historical narrative, photography, archival film, newspaper articles and psychogeographical research, illuminating the liminal space between personal and collective memories. Poetically inspired by the late Andrei Tarkovsky’s cinematic masterpiece, STALKER, the likenesses of the film’s primary characters have been composited into a series of montage images, standing in for the authors perspective and describing a mythic journey through the investigated sites, further blurring the boundary between history and memory, fact and fiction.
