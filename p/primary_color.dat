5|$|The {{beginning}} of June was heralded by {{the debut of}} United's third kit, which debuted in the opening match of the month. The new third kit, which featured a <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> of red, with black accents debuted in the 3 June away fixture at Los Angeles Galaxy. June also saw a wave of controversy arrive involving Charlie Davies and deceiving match officials during the run of play, causing Davies to be fined by MLS. As the international transfer window neared, United made an unanticipated, blockbuster trade with their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls on 27 June. On the pitch, however, United failed to win any matches during the month, tallying three draws and a loss during the month.|$|E

5000|$|Hue {{is a term}} {{describing}} a pure color, that is, a color not modified by tinting or shading (see below).

The uniforms debuted on October 31 in a road game against the Chicago Bulls, and were used in the first five weekend home games, but after going 0–6 in the orange uniforms, they were discontinued permanently.|$|E
25|$|Other {{projection}} technologies involving mirrors include LCoS. Like a DLP chip, LCoS is a microchip {{of similar}} size, {{but rather than}} millions of individual mirrors, {{there is a single}} mirror that is actively shielded by a liquid crystal matrix with up to millions of pixels. The picture, formed as light, is either reflected toward the projection surface (pixel on), or absorbed by the activated LCD pixels (pixel off). LCoS-based televisions and projectors often use 3 chips, one for each <b>primary</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some {{configurations}} {{information about}} several specimen properties is gathered per pixel, usually {{by the use}} of multiple detectors. In SEM, the attributes of topography and material contrast can be obtained by a pair of backscattered electron detectors and such attributes can be superimposed in a single color image by assigning a different <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> to each attribute. Similarly, a combination of backscattered and secondary electron signals can be assigned to different colors and superimposed on a single color micrograph displaying simultaneously the properties of the specimen.|$|E

The most valuable grades have three or more <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> or 1–2 bright and even colors, with the lowest grades having one comparatively dull color predominant.|$|R

25|$|The team's {{traditional}} {{colors are}} yellow and black, {{with the home}} kit being all yellow since the mid-1950s. Prior to that, the teams used to play {{in black and white}} kits. For a period early in their history, the team used a kit similar to FC Barcelona's, but after a series of losses in that uniform, the team president swore never to wear those colors again. In the 1940s, yellow was introduced, and would eventually become the team's <b>primary</b> <b>color,</b> replacing white altogether; black would become the secondary color, used in their alternate kit.|$|E

25|$|In {{television}} sets and computer monitors, the entire front {{area of the}} tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster.

In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of electronic test instrument.|$|E

25|$|When {{one of the}} {{components}} has the strongest intensity, the color is a hue near this <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> (reddish, greenish or bluish), and when two components have the same strongest intensity, then the color is a hue of a secondary color (a shade of cyan, magenta or yellow). A secondary color is formed by the sum of two primary colors of equal intensity: cyan is green+blue, magenta is red+blue, and yellow is red+green. Every secondary color is the complement of one primary color; when a primary and its complementary secondary color are added together, the result is white: cyan complements red, magenta complements green, and yellow complements blue.|$|E
