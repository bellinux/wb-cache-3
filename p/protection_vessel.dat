In March 1865, the reserve formation to which Comet had been assigned was disbanded, and Comet, her sister ship , and Loreley were sent to the North Sea for additional surveying. Comet returned to Dänholm on 8 December, where she was decommissioned. At some point during the year, the boat's 24-pounder was replaced with a rifled [...] 68-pounder gun. She was not mobilized during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and instead next saw active service in 1868 in what was now the navy of the North German Confederation, being reactivated on 21 April for fishery protection duty. At the time, British fishermen routinely fished in German territorial waters in the North Sea illegally, and Comet was sent there to prevent these activities. She left Dänholm on 1 May and arrived on station four days later, the first German fishery <b>protection</b> <b>vessel</b> in the North Sea.
