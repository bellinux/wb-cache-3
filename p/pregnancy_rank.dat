30|$|In sheep, we have {{preliminary}} evidence (Pacheco et al. 2010) that concentrations of specific intracellular AA in skeletal muscle (e.g. arginine and glutamine), differ between single and twin fetuses in late gestation in nutritionally-restricted ewes. The {{purpose of this}} study was to further explore the potential relationship between skeletal muscle mass and intracellular free AA concentration in twins compared to singletons, by testing two hypotheses. Our first hypothesis is that reduced skeletal muscle weight in twin, compared to single fetuses in late gestation, is associated with reduced concentration of specific free AA in muscle, such as glutamine and arginine. Our second hypothesis is, that dam nutrition and body size influence the relationship between skeletal muscle AA and fetal muscle weight, between <b>pregnancy</b> <b>ranks</b> (single vs. twin). To test these hypotheses, the concentration of free AA from the semitendinosus (ST) muscle collected from twin and singleton fetuses at 140  days of gestation from heavy and light ewes fed two differing planes of nutrition were compared.|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the potential relationship between skeletal muscle weight and intracellular FAA concentration in single compared to twin fetuses in late gestation sheep. An additional {{objective of}} this study was to establish the effect of maternal size and nutrition on fetal muscle FAA concentration, as an approach to understand some of the possible mechanisms explaining the lower muscle mass normally observed in twin fetuses (McCoard et al. 2001). Reduced ST mass in twins compared to singleton fetuses at 140  days gestation was associated with changes in the concentration of specific but not total intracellular FAA concentration. Notably, the concentrations of arginine, leucine, valine, and glutamine, known to influence pathways which regulate protein synthesis (Wu 2009), were lower in muscle of twin compared to single fetuses. While other AA were affected by <b>pregnancy</b> <b>rank,</b> maternal size or nutrition, their role in fetal muscle growth, beyond being the building blocks for protein synthesis, is unclear. Arginine concentration, irrespectively of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>rank,</b> maternal size and maternal nutrition, was the only AA positively correlated with fetal skeletal muscle mass. These results suggest that arginine may be important for skeletal muscle growth in the late-gestation ovine fetus.|$|E
30|$|Twin sheep fetuses {{have reduced}} {{skeletal}} muscle weight near birth relative to singles {{as a result}} of restricted muscle hypertrophy. Intracellular free amino acids (FAA) are reported to regulate metabolic pathways which control muscle protein accretion, whereby reduced intracellular content of specific FAA may reduce their activation and therefore, muscle hypertrophy. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether differences in muscle weight between singleton and twin fetuses, under different maternal conditions is associated with reduced concentration of specific FAA. The FAA content in the semitendinosus muscle (ST) in singleton and twin fetuses (rank) at 140  days of gestation from heavy (H) or light (L) ewes fed ad libitum (A) or maintenance (M) level of nutrition was measured. Muscle weight was reduced in twin fetuses compared to singletons in all groups. Reduced concentrations of leucine, threonine and valine, but higher concentrations of methionine, ornithine, lysine and serine were found in twin fetuses compared to singletons. Maternal size and nutrition interaction with rank resulted in reduced glutamine in twins from HM-ewes (H-ewes under M nutrition) compared to their singleton counterparts. Maternal weight interaction with <b>pregnancy</b> <b>rank</b> reduced the concentration of arginine in twins, with a larger effect on H-ewes compared with L-ewes. Maternal size interaction with <b>pregnancy</b> <b>rank</b> resulted in twins from M-ewes to have lower alanine, while twins from A-ewes had lower aspartic acid concentration compared to singletons. The ST muscle weight was positively correlated only with arginine concentration after taking into account rank, size and nutrition. The present results indicate that reduced concentrations of specific intracellular FAA, such as arginine, leucine, valine, glutamine, which are known to play a role in muscle growth, could be acting as limiting factors for muscle hypertrophy in twin fetuses during late gestation. Ewe size and nutrition can influence the concentration of specific FAA in muscle and should be considered in any intervention plan to improve twin fetal muscle growth.|$|E

To examine whether fetal ST weight was proportional to fetal weight, fetal weight was used as covariate in a separate analyses. Both adjusted and unadjusted values are presented for comparison. Sex of fetus had no effect on any traits of interest and was removed from the ST muscle and FAA models. Means are presented as least square means with least significant differences (LSD, 5 %). Isoleucine, asparagine and cystine were detected in only some animals, therefore these FAA were omitted from analysis. The results for the effect of maternal size, maternal nutrition and maternal nutrition by size interaction were not included and will be presented elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that increased maternal nutrition during early and mid-pregnancy could affect placental and fetal development at mid-gestation and fetal weight at term. Mixed-aged Romney ewes (n= 136) were mated at a synchronised oestrus and then randomly allocated to a M ("maintenance", average live weight 54. 5 ± 1. 5 kg) or H ("high", equal to 1. 5 M, average live weight 55. 3 ± 1. 5 kg) feeding level from day 19 of pregnancy (P 19). At P 47, the M group was {{divided into two groups}} and each group was allocated to either a M or H feeding level until P 102. Thirty ewes (10 per group) were slaughtered at P 102 - 104. The remaining ewes from each group were further subdivided into either a M or H feeding level from P 102 to P 136. These ewes were slaughtered at P 136 - 140. Maintenance requirements for a 55 kg ewe were assumed to be 11 MJ ME/day at an energy concentration of 10 MJ ME/kg DM. Over the period from P 19 to P 102, mean herbage dry matter (DM) intake ranged from 0. 98 to 1. 24 kg ewe- 1 day- 1 resulting in ewe live weight changes of 3. 1, 4. 8 and 5. 9 kg for the MM, MH and HH groups (P< 0. 05) respectively. From P 102 to P 131, mean herbage DM intake ranged from 0. 97 to 1. 66 kg ewe- 1 day- 1 resulting in ewe live weight changes of 5. 2, 9. 0, 8. 4, 14. 0, 9. 2 and 14. 8 kg for the MMM, MMH, MHM, MHH, HHM and HHH groups (P< 0. 05) respectively. Feeding level had no significant effect on placental and fetal weights at either of the two slaughter periods (P 102 - 104 and P 136 - 140). Placental weights at P 102 - 104 were 658. 0 ± 49. 5, 612. 1 ± 49. 5 and 676. 7 ± 50. 6 g, and fetal weights were 1281. 7 ± 50. 4, 1296. 0 ± 50. 8 and 1258. 2 ± 53. 4 g for the MM, MH, and HH groups, respectively. At P 136 - 140 placental weights were 583. 2 ± 81. 9, 545. 8 ± 72. 8, 602. 3 ± 77. 4, 551. 5 ± 72. 8, 622. 5 ± 84. 6 and 547. 3 ± 86. 7 g, and fetal weights were 4535. 9 ± 175. 4, 4640. 5 ± 162. 7, 4836. 6 ± 166. 3, 4651. 5 ± 159. 3, 4408. 5 ± 186. 1 and 4389. 2 ± 189. 1 g for the MMM, MMH, MHM, MHH, HHM and HHH groups, respectively. Pelt weights were significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by <b>pregnancy</b> <b>rank</b> at P 102 but final ewe live weights and carcass weights were not. Other components (i. e., total placentome and total cotyledon) were significantly (P< 0. 05) heavier in twins than in singles but were not affected by feeding level. Ewes carrying twin fetuses had significantly (P< 0. 05) more placentomes and tended to have more caruncles than single-bearing ewes. Caruncle occupancy was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in twins than in singles (87 % vs 80 %, respectively). Pre-partum nutritional treatments from P 102 to P 136 affected final ewe live weights, carcass weights and pelts weights (P< 0. 05). <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>rank</b> had no effects on final ewe live weights or pelt weights but did affect carcass weights at P 136.

Briefly, the study design utilised two different maternal sizes, according to their weight and corresponding to the heaviest (H; 60.8 [*]±[*] 0.18  kg, condition score 3.02 [*]±[*] 0.03 (1 - 5 scale (Jefferies 1961)) and lightest (L; 42.5 [*]±[*] 0.17  kg, condition score 1.97 [*]±[*] 0.03) Romney ewes, selected from a commercial flock. The ewes were randomly allocated to either a maintenance (M) or ad libitum (A) nutritional plane on pasture from day 21 after insemination until 140  days of gestation. Maintenance nutrition was designed to ensure that total ewe live weight increased in pregnancy at a level similar to that of the expected conceptus mass (Rattray 1986; Rattray et al. 1974). The maternal weight change in the maintenance group was coincident with the conceptus mass, which suggest ewes were close to maintenance (Blair et al. 2011; Kenyon et al. 2011). The ad libitum plane was designed to provide unrestricted herbage intake under grazing conditions. To achieve these nutritional regimens, ewes were grazed using a rotational system, as described by (Kenyon et al. 2009).

40|$|Night {{blindness}} is {{the most}} common ocular condition representing moderate-to-severe vitamin A deficiency in children. Very little, however, is known about maternal night blindness, which has recently been reported to occur frequently during pregnancy in parts of south-east Asia. In Nepal, the prevalence of night blindness is reported to be 16 %. We carried out an ethnographic study of night blindness during pregnancy in the south-eastern, rural plains of Nepal as preliminary research for a case-control study of the determinants of this condition. The purpose of the research was to identify local terms and concepts of night blindness and to examine women's perceptions of its causes, symptoms, severity, and consequences during pregnancy. Data collection involved in-depth interviews, case studies, unstructured observations and structured anthropologic methods, such as free listing and quick sort ranking. Women considered night blindness to be an important illness of <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>ranking</b> it second (to vaginal bleeding) in perceived severity from a list of 15 "women's illnesses". Local terms for night blindness were identified in three different languages from the region. Informants described a complex ethnomedical model of night blindness that included causes, symptomatology, and treatment alternatives. However, there was no perceived link between food intake and the occurrence of night blindness. The major causes of night blindness were attributed to pregnancy, weakness, or "hotness". Some women sought treatment for the condition but most women chose not to treat it since they believed that it was a transient condition of pregnancy. Interviews with women who had previously experienced night blindness and home-based observations of women exhibiting concurrent night blindness showed that it adversely affected their activity patterns, especially those related to child care and food preparation. Night blindness increased reliance on family members to perform various domestic chores and was also associated with personal injury and accidents. The findings of this study have relevance for women's reproductive health and nutrition throughout the Indian sub-continent. A simple history of night blindness may be a practical tool to identify women with nutritional and health risks. Maternal night blindness should be more routinely investigated in vitamin A deficient areas of the world, both to define the magnitude of the problem, and to develop programs/interventions that specifically target this population. night blindness ethnography pregnancy women's work Nepal...|$|R

30|$|Free AA plays a {{major role}} not only as {{building}} blocks for protein synthesis, but they also regulate key metabolic pathways which are necessary for cell maintenance and growth (Wu 2009). The function of FAA as signalling molecules is associated with changes in the intracellular concentration of specific FAA (Beugnet et al. 2003; Christie et al. 2002; Sancak et al. 2008). Intracellular pools are therefore critical to accomplish the signalling function of FAA (Nobukuni et al. 2005). The size and composition of the intracellular FAA pool depends on different processes, including availability of circulating FAA, and an increased AA influx or efflux between muscle and the plasma resulting from utilization, (e.g., by protein synthesis) or catabolism (protein turnover) (Hundal and Taylor 2009; Proud 2004). In this study it is unclear what the contribution is of each of these processes to the observed differences in intracellular FAA profiles. Unfortunately, fetal plasma was not available in the present study to relate the plasma FAA profile with intracellular muscle FAA profile in single and twin fetuses. However, we have previously shown that twins from ad libitum-fed ewes have lower plasma concentration of glutamine, arginine and leucine compared with singletons at day 140 of pregnancy (van der Linden et al. 2012). Others have also reported a decreased concentration of arginine family members and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in fetal plasma when restricting maternal nutrition to 50 % of their requirement (Kwon et al. 2004). It has also been proposed that reduced muscle mass in sheep fetuses exposed to maternal nutrient restriction may be associated with reduced plasma FAA, particularly serine, arginine-family AA, and BCAA (Zhu et al. 2006). Therefore, it is feasible that changes in specific FAA concentration in twins muscle were related to changes in circulating AA availability. The possible association between <b>pregnancy</b> <b>rank</b> and maternal nutrition on fetal plasma AA concentration and how this affects intracellular muscle FAA concentrations and muscle mass, is yet to be established.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reproductive traits play a {{key role}} in pig {{production}} in order to reduce costs and increase economic returns. Among others, gene expression analyses represent a useful approach to study genetic mechanisms underlying reproductive traits in pigs. The application of reverse-transcription quantitative PCR requires the selection of appropriate reference genes, whose expression levels should not be affected by the experimental conditions, especially when comparing gene expression across different physiological stages. RESULTS: The gene expression stability of ten potential reference genes was studied by three different methods (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) in ovary and uterus collected at five different physiological time points (heat, and 15, 30, 45 and 60 days of <b>pregnancy).</b> Although final <b>ranking</b> differed, the three algorithms gave very similar results. Thus, the most stable genes across time were TBP and UBC in uterus and TBP and HPRT 1 in ovary, while HMBS and ACTB showed the less stable expression in uterus and ovary, respectively. When studied as a systematic effect, the reproductive stage did not significantly affect the expression of the candidate reference genes except at 30 d and 60 d of pregnancy, when a general drop in expression was observed in ovary. CONCLUSIONS: Based in our results, we propose the use of TBP, UBC and SDHA in uterus and TBP, GNB 2 L 1 and HPRT 1 in ovary for normalization of longitudinal expression studies using quantitative PCR in sows...|$|R

Findings of the study showed that, generally mothers seemed to have some knowledge on reproductive health issues, but there were serious problems on what they know about the specific aspects of reproductive health. For example, only 35 percent of the respondents knew correct time during a normal menstrual cycle when a woman is likely to conceive.

The majority of women had knowledge on mode of transmission for HIV, but 10 percent of mothers still believe that HIV could be acquired by sharing clothes and utensils with infected person. Only a half of the mothers in this study knew that use of condoms is a preventive measure against HIV. Only a quarter (26 percent) of respondents knew a mother with HIV infection should avoid breast-feeding, as one of the mode of prevention against vertical transmission of the virus. The majority (98 percent) of the interviewed mothers <b>ranked</b> <b>pregnancy</b> as number one problem, followed by HIVI AIDS, (88. 5 percent) when they suspected their adolescent girls were sexually active. xi Over 70 percent of the mothers were willing to communicate with adolescent girls on mY/AIDS, followed by STDs.
