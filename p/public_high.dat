40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} specific relationship of federal economic {{policies of the}} Reagan administration, known as Reaganomics, to <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education. In conducting this study three questions are asked: what were the economic policies of the Reagan administration; what was the impact on state finances of these policies; {{and what was the}} effect on access to <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education of this impact on state finances?^ To answer these questions this dissertation studies the federal economic policies of the Reagan administration known as Reaganomics and their impact on state financing of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education during the period 1981 - 1992. ^ This study makes clear that Reaganomics was developed and implemented based on the faulty assumption that taxes could be cut, the needy protected, military spending increased and the budget balanced. The impact of these economic policies on state government finances was significant in two major ways: the substantial reduction in federal aid to state governments during the initial phase of the implementation of Reaganomics; and the transferring of responsibility for certain social services from the federal government to state governments, particularly in the Medicaid program. These changes in state finances {{had a significant impact on}} state funding of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education and access to these institutions. ^ The findings of this study have significant implications for the understanding of future state financing and accessibility of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education because they clearly establish the relationship between federal economic policies, state finances, state financing of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education, and access to <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education. Because of these relationships it becomes clear that the future levels of state financing of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education and access to these institutions will depend greatly on the economic policies of the federal government. The dissertation concludes with an examination of the potential impact of the choices facing the Clinton administration on state financing of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the need for}} leaders in <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education to possess a general knowledge of how new initiatives in <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education gain support from state legislators to advance and implement their initiatives. This study's research question is: What is {{the process by which}} <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education institutions receive legislative support for new initiatives? This question was explored through a qualitative, historical case study investigating the evolution of the School of Dental Medicine (SoDM) at East Carolina University (ECU) {{as an example of a}} new initiative in <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education (four-year level institutions) that was successful during the Great Recession and a period with limited resources in the University of North Carolina System.   Through a combination of semi-structured interviews and archival documents, information was coded in an effort to analyze the evolution of the events leading to the successful creation and funding of the SoDM at ECU through the lens of Kingdon's (2003) Multiple Streams Model and Primeval Soup Concept. Analysis of the findings extracted from primary and secondary coding of informants' responses revealed data that guided recommendations of strategies/approaches for <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education leaders to consider utilizing in order to advance new initiatives at their institutions of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education that rely on support from state legislative approvals and appropriations for establishment.   	While Kingdon has focused on the federal level of decision making, in areas such as healthcare and transportation, this study applied his concepts to the state level of decision making in the arena of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education. This study went beyond establishing which streams were most influential on the overall process of political decision making in <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education by exploring deeper into the realms of where events of change occurred and the themes of influences that were most active with respect to advancing and challenging the initiative throughout its evolution. Strategies/approaches to advancing new initiatives of <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education, based on this study's results, are included in the discussion of this study's results.   Ed. D...|$|R

In addition, a 2 SLS model was specified, where <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education spending had an indirect effect on economic growth through educational attainment. The results suggest that the relationship between <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education spending and economic growth is only positive in those states with the smallest markets for private higher education. Also, results indicated that <b>public</b> <b>higher</b> education spending has a negative relationship with educational attainment.
