25|$|Incandescent lamps {{are nearly}} pure {{resistive}} loads {{with a power}} factor of 1. This means the actual <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> (in watts) and the apparent power (in volt-amperes) are equal. Incandescent light bulbs are usually marketed according to the electrical <b>power</b> <b>consumed.</b> This is measured in watts and depends mainly on {{the resistance of the}} filament, which in turn depends mainly on the filament's length, thickness, and material. For two bulbs of the same voltage, type, color, and clarity, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.|$|E
25|$|Both {{of these}} X-ray {{production}} processes are inefficient, with a production efficiency {{of only about}} one percent, and thus most of the electric <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> by the tube is released as waste heat. When producing a usable flux of X-rays, the X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate the excess heat.|$|E

25|$|The forces {{required}} for a tool to cut through a material {{is directly related to}} the <b>power</b> <b>consumed.</b> Therefore, tool forces are often given in units of specific energy. This leads to a rating method where higher specific energies equal lower machinability. The advantage of this method is that outside factors have little effect on the rating.|$|E
25|$|Current sensors which {{monitor the}} <b>power</b> <b>consumed,</b> and {{maintain}} the connection only if the demand is within a predetermined range. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail and are possibly less expensive to design and implement. Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can readily provide an option for suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.|$|E
25|$|The 122PW of {{sunlight}} reaching the Earth's surface is plentiful—almost 10,000 {{times more than}} the 13TW equivalent of average <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> in 2005 by humans. This abundance leads to the suggestion that it will not be long before solar energy will become the world's primary energy source. Additionally, solar electric generation has the highest power density (global mean of 170W/m2) among renewable energies.|$|E

25|$|As {{hard drive}} prices have fallen, storage farms {{have tended to}} {{increase}} in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} used to {{transfer}} heat because less high-grade energy is required than is released as heat. Most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment, {{only a fraction of}} which comes from electricity (or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor). In electrically-powered heat pumps, the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical <b>power</b> <b>consumed,</b> giving the system a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 or 4, as opposed to a COP of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater, in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy.|$|E

Mitsubishi estimates that the i-MiEV total battery capacity is enough to provide power for between 5 and 6 hours, equivalent to one day of <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> by an average Japanese home.
