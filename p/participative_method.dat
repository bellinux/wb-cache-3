40|$|International audienceKnowledge {{absorption}} capacity, {{known as}} {{the ability of a}} firm to identify, ussimilate, transform and exploit external knowledge, {{plays an important role in}} explaining and fostering innovation in companies. In particular, this capacity is crucial for small and medium-sized companies relying on collaborative networks to develop their innovation projects. The problem is how such companies can absorb maximum knowledge through collaboration with their partners. This can help them to overcome resource scarcity and enhance competitiveness. In this study we aim to provide a <b>participative</b> <b>method</b> for modelling the knowledge absorption process in innovative project processes. This method, conducted with participatory techniques, will help us to identify organisational routines related to knowledge absorption. These routines provide the means to improve knowledge absorption in organisations...|$|E

In particular, {{we focus on the}} temporal evolution of the roles and importance of countries and of disciplines, on the structure of ‘scientific families’ and on the impact of genealogy on the development of scientific paradigms. As it is often the case when performing a data-driven analysis of historical facts [17, 18], the data set is expected to be incomplete and to present biases, mainly for the more ancient data. In the present case, the website collects the data in two ways: a <b>participative</b> <b>method,</b> based on the spontaneous registration of scholars (who can also register their students and their mentors), and a curated method, based on historical facts and performed by the creators of the web site.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{collaborative}} innovation projects, interactions between actors and knowledge exchange among {{them have a}} crucial role to foster innovation. External knowledge can {{be integrated into the}} project through different practices. Thereby, to help companies to identify their best practices, it is necessary to find out where and how external knowledge is acquired, transformed and applied in order to better understand the organisational mechanisms by which firms acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge. To this end, we propose a new <b>participative</b> <b>method</b> called ISEACAP (Identification, Simulation, Evaluation of Absorptive CAPacity) in order to elicit exchanged knowledge during each part of an innovative project and map the knowledge journey from its integration to its application. Theoutcome of the method will first help the participants (actors of the innovative project) to better understand and improve their practices for integrating external knowledge. Further, it will help us to reach the way organisational routines will be implemented...|$|E

40|$|In {{fragile and}} often complex supply chains, PSM {{failures}} {{continue to be}} reported in the media, often with severe economic, social and environmental consequences. To encourage organisations to engage in responsible PSM, we need engaged research. In this paper we argue that Action Research (AR) is an influential, <b>participative</b> <b>method</b> to challenge the more dominant versions of PSM impacts, which tend to focus only on the positive, and often only monetised elements of what is valued. AR places change {{at the core of}} the research process, requiring critical reflexive practice of the impact of assumptions, values and actions on others. We argue that PSM research has more potential for influence if it starts from a ‘real’ problem anchored in practice, and that crucially, the problem itself should be challenged dialogically by scholars, practitioners and diverse stakeholders. Critical AR can reframe performance from a technical, company-centric notion to explore broader relationships between inputs and outputs over a longer time frame. We explore the risks and rewards of Critical AR for PSM scholars and draw conclusions on our role as engaged advocates of change...|$|E

The <b>participative</b> <b>method</b> we are implementing in Sori village (Benin) on cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L) is consistant with such expectations. Basing the estimation of landrace richness on their local names, the participative approach {{used in this study}} made it possible to inventory 14 landraces in Sori. Ten mega-practices contributing to maintaining and/or enhancing the pool of landraces were inventoried, described and evaluated according to criteria such as the diversity of use, the optimization of farm resources and anti-risk strategies. For each practice, an aptitude value for conservation was calculated. These approaches revealed that botanic treatments, seed multiplication and cultural association are the most important practices according to value markers of agricultural practices. This study made it possible to test the use of particular a methodology in evaluating peasant management practices of agrobiodiversity.

40|$|Central {{administrative}} services have recently received increasing attention from practitioners and academics {{due to the}} challenging need to both manage scarce resources and provide high-quality services. In this context, performance measurement systems (PMSs) may assume a central role, although an unresolved debate remains on the claimed benefits of accountability and the difficulties that have emerged in defining and managing proper measures. This paper contributes to this debate by presenting {{the results of a}} study in which a PMS for central {{administrative services}} has been developed and tested through an action research approach drawing on actor network theory. The experiment was carried out in 15 Italian universities and five areas of services were dealt with: student support, research support, accounting, human resources, and logistics and procurement. The highly <b>participative</b> <b>method</b> resulted in a comparable system with a complete set of cost and quality indicators across the participating universities. These data proved to be useful at managerial and policy level, providing insights on the presence of scale effects and on the relative importance of quality dimensions for users of services.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Participatory {{approaches}} to qualitative research practice constantly change {{in response to}} evolving research environments. Researchers are increasingly encouraged to undertake secondary analysis of qualitative data, despite epistemological and ethical challenges. Interpretive focus groups {{can be described as}} a more <b>participative</b> <b>method</b> for groups to analyse qualitative data. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate interpretive focus groups with women in Papua New Guinea to extend analysis of existing qualitative data and co-create new primary data. The purpose of this was to inform a transformational grounded theory and subsequent health promoting action. DESIGN: A two-step approach was used in a grounded theory study about how women experience male circumcision in Papua New Guinea. Participants analysed portions or &# 039;chunks&# 039; of existing qualitative data in story circles and built upon this analysis by using the visual research method of storyboarding. RESULTS: New understandings of the data were evoked when women in interpretive focus groups analysed the data &# 039;chunks&# 039;. Interpretive focus groups encouraged women to share their personal experiences about male circumcision. The visual method of storyboarding enabled women to draw pictures to represent their experiences. This provided an additional focus for whole-of-group discussions about the research topic. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretive focus groups offer opportunity to enhance trustworthiness of findings when researchers undertake secondary analysis of qualitative data. The co-analysis of existing data and co-generation of new data between research participants and researchers informed an emergent transformational grounded theory and subsequent health promoting action...|$|E
