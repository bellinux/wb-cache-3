5000|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> link {{deflection}} {{systems in}} the vertical level can be realized by receiving the signal with a parabolic antenna and leading it through a waveguide to a second parabolic antenna, where it is radiated. For passive microwave radio relay link deflections in the horizontal plane, flat surfaces of metallic material are used, arranged so that the angle of incoming beam corresponds to {{the angle of the}} outcoming signal. The resulting structure resembles a billboard.|$|E

50|$|Radio {{stations}} that cannot communicate directly due to distance, terrain or other difficulties sometimes use an intermediate <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> station to relay the signals. Examples include airborne <b>radio</b> <b>relay,</b> microwave <b>radio</b> <b>relay,</b> and communications satellite. The American <b>Radio</b> <b>Relay</b> League was founded {{for this purpose}} but did not change its name when this became a less important part of its work.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper propounds a novel {{scheme of}} {{mitigation}} for reducing co-channel interference between HAPGS (High Altitude Platform Ground Station) and <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> stations. Firstly, {{in terms of}} the deployment parameters such as distance between HAPGS, elevation angle of the HAPGS as well as that the azimuth angles of the <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> station. Then, the effects on <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> station are due to the rainy conditions between HAPGS and <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> stations. All calculations are done by using Matlab following the ITU-R recommendations. The results show the interference to noise ratio caused at <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> station from HAPGS decrease, when distance between HAPGS and <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> stations increases. The minimum separation distance required to obtain an optimum interference is shown for various azimuth angles in clear sky and rainy conditions...|$|R
