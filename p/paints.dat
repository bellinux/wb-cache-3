5|$|If possible, {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many varnishes and <b>paints</b> are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and <b>paints</b> are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E

5|$|Known {{since the}} Middle Ages {{by the name}} plumb dulcis, the {{production}} of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small-scale, for direct use in making other lead compounds.

Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead <b>paints,</b> but such <b>paints</b> have been superseded by less toxic <b>paints</b> based on titanium dioxide.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Paint</b> {{is used as}} {{top coat}} in Automobile Refinishing that is divided into 1 K <b>paint</b> of base type and 2 K <b>paint</b> of {{urethane}} type. after using 1 K <b>paint,</b> it can be reusable. However 2 K <b>paint</b> is not available that is mixed {{a certain amount of}} base with hardner, so 2 K <b>paint</b> has to be used all at a time or discarded the rest. This study covered that colored Urethane <b>paint</b> and colorless urethane <b>paint</b> in top coating process of AR. Top coat urethane <b>paint</b> is divided into colored urethane <b>paint</b> and transparent urethane <b>paint</b> like clear coat. Colored urethane <b>paint</b> is used for <b>paint</b> that contains resin, pigment, solvent and additives. It is color such as black and white. While transparent urethane <b>paint</b> is used for <b>paint</b> that contains resin, solvent and additives. Urethane <b>paint</b> has a <b>paint</b> system that cur after several hours of mixing base and hardner. By a <b>paint</b> technician of a field and empirical data, we can also recognize that according to worker's <b>paint</b> style and experience, although he or she <b>paint</b> same car model and area, <b>paint</b> use of one's is different. There aren't guidelines workers refer to about <b>paint</b> use by car models and work scope because ARP works various car models that are in different color, size and area. After using urethane <b>paint,</b> the rest of <b>paint</b> has come, and there are highs and lows in <b>paint</b> use each time he or she works. Therefore, this study suggest a basic guideline to use <b>paint</b> efficiently and regularly by understanding area, the type of work, and <b>paint</b> use that are appropriate for each car model and regardless of workers and work scopes in AR...|$|R
