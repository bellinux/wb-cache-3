We will discuss the notion <b>of</b> <b>connexity</b> through three different words. The etymology of border, frontier and limit leads to attach to them different models of let's say ''separation'' : respectively the boundary belongs to only one object, is shared by both or belongs to none (hence is an object by itself). We compare this approach to several axiomatic (mereological) definitions <b>of</b> <b>connexity</b> : weak connexity, fiat and bona fide boundaries. The target application is a study on urban development and metropolisation shapes observed through remote sensing.

This is a purpose-oriented and text-based study of the clause grammar of Chinese from a systemic functional perspective. Using data from the Chinese translation of an Englishlanguage novel, I have explored the non-arbitrary relationship between the semantic and grammatical system networks of the three modes of meaning, namely ideational, interpersonal and textual, by taking an inductive, top-down approach. The ideational meaning construes our experience of the world around us and inside us as a structural configuration; the interpersonal meaning enacts our social and intersubjective roles through the selection of speech functions; and finally the textual meaning enables the ideational and interpersonal meanings to proceed as a flow of information, i. e. as text in context. [...] This is a study of text, an attempt to extend the clause grammar towards discourse semantics. Texts are studied as an unfolding process, and hence instead of modeling text as a generic structure, system networks which indicate the meaning potential that a language user can utilise are constructed. The ways in which the interactants take turns to make a conversation move on have been examined; the systems which control the flow of information as a text unfolds have been constructed; and finally, the issue <b>of</b> textual <b>connexity</b> has been explored. The issue <b>of</b> <b>connexity</b> in the present study embodies three concepts: the <b>connexity</b> <b>of</b> information chunks, which is concerned with the property <b>of</b> cohesion; the <b>connexity</b> <b>of</b> messages, which is closely related to the property of coherence; and the <b>connexity</b> <b>of</b> text, which includes methods of thematic progression and thematic selection. [...] This thesis is also a contrastive study of Chinese and English, hoping to shed some light on translation between the two languages and on teaching Chinese to English speakers. The grammatical systems of the three modes of meaning in the two languages have been compared from three angles: from around, i. e. concerning the options available in the systems; from above, i. e. concerning the syntactic structural differences of the options; and from below, i. e. concerning the syntactic structural differences of the options, as well as the relative frequencies of the various options in the systems.

It is, however, crucial to conduct a discussion on the subject, especially in view of the latest disasters that have made the headlines (notably in New York and Toulouse in September 2001, in Madrid in March 2004). On the one hand, it is widely understood that the consequences of risk tend to be more severe in urban environments; on the other, the categorization of different risks (industrial, social, environmental risks, etc.) within a space reinforces the probability of all kinds of disaster occurring. This line of reasoning will be questioned through a case study.

Moreover, the power to regulate fiscal affairs is mostly {{in the hands of}} the central government. Municipalities do not possess satisfactory development planning perspectives. In particular municipalities in the North-East region and South Estonia have experienced considerable fiscal stress.

The couple "structure — morphism " studied by Bourbaki, as well as the couple "category — covariant functor " (of S. Eilenberg and S.

These couples seem appropriate for the generalization and unification of apparently different classical results, e. g. for the following couples: "topological space — continuous function", "uniform space — uniformly continuous function", "ring — homomorphism", etc [...] So, an abstract theorem for functional structures [2] contains as particular cases: l) the well-known Bolzano's theorem on the preservation <b>of</b> <b>connexity</b> by continuous surjections, 2) an obvious result for uniform spaces and 3) the theorem o...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law may fall into all three categories of sources <b>of</b> law. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the European Union law {{are an integral part of}} the positive EU legislation, which clearly differentiates them from similar sets of general goals, objectives, values, agenda postulates, and the like. The general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are have their origins in the Founding Treaties, the legal systems of the Member States and the case law of the EU Court of Justice. Considering their content and legal nature, the general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are divided into: compulsory or axiomatic principles, regulatory or structural principles (which all national laws of the Member States have in common), and the general principles inherent to the EU legal order. Some of the most important general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> supremacy of EU law over the national law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> direct effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> autonomy of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> full effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> State liability for damage, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legal certainty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith and fair dealing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> fair hearing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> subsidiarity, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> proportionality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> non-discrimination, etc...|$|R
