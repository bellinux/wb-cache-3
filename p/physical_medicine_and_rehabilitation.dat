40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years the term “Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) ” has been {{increasingly}} applied in all areas of <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> is often used for decision-making in the medical and public health sector. It is also used to verify the significance and/or the effectiveness of different therapies. The original definition of EBM rests on the following three pillars: the physician’s individual expertise, the patient’s needs and the best external evidence. Today, however, the term EBM is often wrongly used as a synonym for best external evidence, without taking into consideration the other two pillars of the model which was created by Gordon Guyatt, David Sackett and Archibald Cochrane. This problem becomes even greater the more social insurance institutions and politicians use external evidence alone as the main guideline for financing therapies and therapy guidelines in <b>physical</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> general <b>rehabilitation</b> without taking into account the physician’s expertise and the patient’s needs. The wrong interpretation of EBM can lead to the following problems: well established clinical therapies are either questioned or not granted and are therefore withheld from patients (for example physical pain management). An absence of evidence for individual therapy methods does not prove their ineffectiveness! In this short statement the significance of EBM in <b>Physical</b> <b>Medicine</b> <b>and</b> general <b>rehabilitation</b> will be analysed and discussed...|$|R

25|$|In most medical programs, {{the first}} two years deal with basic {{scientific}} courses (cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics), and the core medical sciences (anatomy, embryology, histology, physiology, and biochemistry). The following year may change in how it is organized in different schools, but is usually organ system-based pathophysiology and therapeutics (general and systems pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, parasitology, immunology, and medical genetics are also taught in this block). In {{the first two}} years, the programs also usually begin the courses in the epidemiology track (which may or may not include biostatistics), a clinical skills track (semiology and the clinical examination), a social medicine/public health track, and a medical ethics and communication skills track. Modes of training vary, but are usually based on lectures, simulations, standardized-patient sessions, problem-based learning sessions, seminars, and observational clinical experiences. By year three, most schools have begun the non-elective, clinical-rotation block with accompanying academic courses (these include {{but are not limited to}} internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology and obstetrics, emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, urology, <b>physical</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology). Elective rotations are usually introduced in the fourth or fifth year, though as in the case of the non-elective rotations, the hospitals the medical students may be placed in or apply to for a given rotation depend entirely on the medical schools. This is important in terms of the medical training, given the particular distinction of patients, pathologies, procedures, and skills seen and learned in private vs. public hospitals in Colombia. Most schools, however, have placements in both types of hospitals for many specialties.|$|E

ResultsThe mean age of our patients was 43. 8 years; sex ratio was 5 / 4. The spine involvement of tuberculosis was dorsal in seven cases, dorso-lumbar in one patient, and multiple (cervical, dorsal and lumbar) in one case. All patients were paraplegic with a neurological involvement of the bladder. They had prior antituberculosis chemotherapy for at least 8 months. Decompression surgery was performed in six cases. Two female patients presented disorders of spinal posture during treatment requiring surgical revision with osteosynthesis. All patients received additional rehabilitation care. Following a mean duration of hospitalisation in the Rehabilitation department of 47 days with twice-daily sessions of tailored physiotherapy, three patients remained in complete paraplegia, autonomous in wheel-chair and with vesical and sphincter incontinence.

Patients and methods The study included 100 patients with RA diagnosed according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria. The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of <b>Physical</b> <b>Medicine,</b> Rheumatology <b>and</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> Department in Alexandria Faculty of Medicine. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) of the forefeet under the standardized EULAR guidance was done for all patients, and accordingly, the studied patients were further classified as those with US-detectable FFB (group I) and those without US-detectable FFB (group II). For group I patients, foot impact scale (FIS), foot anatomical changes assessment, and gait analysis were done. Results US-detectable FFB was found in 92 % of the 100 patients with RA. The most frequent intermetatarsal bursa was the fourth one, and the most frequent submetatarsal bursa was the first one. There was a statistically significant relation between the total number of FFB on one side and its two subscales, meta-tarsophalangeal synovial hypertrophy, serum C-reactive protein level, visual analogue scale of foot pain, and step length on the other side. No statistically significant correlation was found between the total number of FFB and BMI, clinical disease activity index, or the foot deformities.

All patients underwent nerve conduction studies of both upper and lower limbs. They were divided into two groups: group I with confirmed DPN (n= 60) and group II with DM but no peripheral neuropathy (n= 30). Serum TNF-α level was measured in all previous DM patients (90 patients) in addition to 48 healthy age-matched controls. Results A statistically significant difference was detected between serum TNF-α level in controls and diabetic patients. Similarly, a significant difference was detected between its level in non-DPN patients and confirmed DPN patients, being higher in the latter. A positive significant correlation has been detected between TNF-α level and patients’ age, as well as blood cholesterol level.

40|$|Hypertrophic {{scars and}} keloids {{resulting}} from surgery, burns, trauma and infection can {{be associated with}} substantial physical and psychological distress. Various non-invasive and invasive options are currently available for the prevention and treatment of these scars. Recently, an international multidisciplinary group of 24 experts on scar management (dermatologists; plastic and reconstructive surgeons; general surgeons; <b>physical</b> <b>medicine,</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>and</b> burns specialists; psychosocial and behavioural researchers; epidemiologists; beauticians) convened to update a set of practical guidelines for the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic and keloid scars {{on the basis of the}} latest published clinical evidence on existing scar management options. Silicone-based products such as sheets and gels are recommended as the gold standard, firstline, non-invasive option for both the prevention and treatment of scars. Other general scar preventative measures include avoiding sun exposure, compression therapy, taping and the use of moisturisers. Invasive treatment options include intralesional injections of corticosteroids and/or 5 -fluorouracil, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, laser therapy and surgical excision. All of these options may be used alone or as part of combination therapy. Of utmost importance is the regular re-evaluation of patients every four to eight weeks to evaluate whether additional treatment is warranted. The amount of scar management measures that are applied to each wound depends on the patient’s risk of developing a scar and their level of concern about the scar’s appearance.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} constantly deteriorating disease of unpredictable clinical course, with exacerbations, remissions and damaged joints. It {{leads to the}} loss of self-sufficiency, independence in performing many daily activities, decrease of working ability and invalidity. Beside physical factors, which are regarded as most responsible for the poorer quality of life of RA patients, psychological changes are also significant, such as the feeling of helplessness, hopelessness and depression. The goal of the treatment of patients with RA is to decrease illness symptoms, slow down the development of illness progression, improvement of physical functioning and provision of expert help to the RA patients to adapt to life. OBJECTIVE The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the influence of spa therapy on the functional condition and life quality of RA patients. METHODS The study involved 69 patients with RA (51 female and 18 male, on average aged 55. 2 ± 11. 4 years, with illness duration 12. 5 ± 7. 5 years), and were a part of a cohort from Norway, suffering of inflammatory rheumatism.

The RA patients underwent treatment with mud compresses, mud, mineral and pearl baths, as well as with underwater shower massage (balneotherapy) kinesitherapy and certain forms of electrotherapy with analgesic effects. The evaluation was done on admission and after completed physical therapy when we assessed RA patients' functional condition and quality of life. The functional condition was determined using the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ), and the quality of life using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 -item Questionnaire (SF- 36), which encompassed eight life domains. RESULTS After completion of 28 -dayspa therapy, RA patients showed a significant improvement in functional condition. Their quality of life was significantly improved in all dimensions of SF- 36 Questionnaire (p< 0. 01), and the functional status (MHAQ score) was also significantly better (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION Balneotherapy, together with climatic factors in Igalo, leads to a significant improvement of functional status and quality of life in patients suffering from RA...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: At the Institute for <b>Physical</b> <b>Medicine,</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>and</b> Rheumatology “Dr Simo Milosevic” in Igalo for 40 {{years the}} State {{program of the}} Government of Norway has been {{implemented}}. Th e program has been implemented from April to mid-October. In this paper {{we are going to}} show the results of the application of physiotherapy skills in maintaining and increasing the mobility of the spine in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Th e paper will show the mobility of the trunk using the standardized measurement method of lateral fl exion fully applied by the physiotherapist. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-fi ve (25) physiotherapists employed in exercise therapy in {{the second phase of the}} Institute Igalo have been applying the method of measuring centimeter tape movement lateral fl exion of the trunk in 57 patients (32 men or 56. 1 % and women and 25 or 43. 9 %) before the start of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>and</b> aft er application of therapeutic procedures. In the fi rst group, from April 25 to May 23, 2016 there were 21 participants (13 men and 8 women), while in the second group from May 23, to June 20, 2016 there were 36 participants (19 men and 17 women). Th e average age of the fi rst group was 60. 80 years, while the average age of the second group was 53. 36 years. Th e average age in both groups was 58 years. RESULTS: Aft er therapeutic procedures the average increase mobility lateral fl exion of the trunk to the right amounted to 4. 72 cm, while the average increase mobility lateral fl exion of the trunk to the left amounted to 4. 94 cm. Th e results of the application of the T-test for paired samples showed that rehabilitation led to a signifi cant improvement in mobility in lateral angle (p = 0. 006 for the lateral right, p = 0. 002 for the lateral left). Wilcoxon signed rank test also showed a signifi cant change in measures of mobility in lateral fl exion of the trunk aft er rehabilitation in relation to the measures before rehabilitation: for the lateral right Z = - 2. 791, p = 0. 005; for the lateral left Z = - 3, 136, p = 0. 002. CONCLUSION: Results from this study indicate that for maintenance and especially for the increased mobility of the spine in the area of the body in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, the successfully applied various techniques and skills by physiotherapists of the Institute Igalo are important. Th e long tradition of successful treatment of various forms of rheumatoid arthritis puts Institute Igalo in distinctive multi-disciplinary rehabilitation centers in Europe...|$|R
