40|$|Wildfire plays a {{contradictory}} role as both {{a hazard}} and a necessary ecological process in certain ecosystems. A variety of factors influence wildfire, including fuel type and quantity, land management policies, and patterns of human activity. Climate, however, can often play a dominant role. Wildfires are often thought to occur only in the western United States; however, fires are common on the southeastern U. S. landscape. Despite the abundance of fires, limited fire climatology work has been performed in this region. This dissertation addresses a knowledge gap in Southeast fire climatology by examining how gradients in precipitation regimes, in particular precipitation variability, influence spatial patterns of wildfire. In addition, modern synoptic climatology techniques are {{used to examine the}} relationships between atmospheric circulation patterns and wildfire ignitions in the central Gulf Coast sub-region of the Southeast. Chapter II characterizes precipitation regimes in Southeast national forests and associates mean annual ignition density and mean annual area burned with various precipitation metrics. Weak positive correlations were observed between daily precipitation variability and mean annual ignition density. Chapter III employs the Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) scheme to examine weather types associated with wildfire ignitions in the central Gulf Coast. Results show that dry tropical (DT) days occurred more often during years with higher numbers of ignitions in central Gulf Coast national forests, {{as well as in the}} 180, 90, and 30 -day periods prior to a fire. DT weather types occurred most commonly in the fall and spring corresponding with <b>peak</b> <b>fire</b> <b>seasons</b> in much of the region. Particularly in the spring, DT variability was influenced by positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), presumably increasing westerly flow and driving DT weather types farther east from their general source region. Finally, chapter IV developed eleven synoptic types using the Synoptic Typer Tool (STT). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to daily (18 z) 500 mb geopotential height grids. Synoptic types were then linked with wildfire ignitions in the central Gulf Coast. Results suggested that troughs were associated with wildfire activity, as well as zonal flow and high pressure systems...|$|R

If the majority of unauthorized fires are set {{with the intent to}} maximize damage to timber, firesetters remain remarkably ignorant with regard to key factors such as fire weather and forest ecology. Indeed, unauthorized firesetting may have an overall protective effect on forest resources by preempting more severe fires ignited in the growing season.|$|E

40|$|Background Forest area, stand {{quality and}} growth of Siberian larch in Mongolia have {{decreased}} significantly over recent decades. This forest decline is frequently attributed to factors such as unregulated logging, increased ecological disturbances (primarily fire) and climate change. In this study, we analyzed climate-growth response and pointer years for Siberian larch observed in the Altansumber forest research area in the Mongolian mountain forest steppe zone. We compare our results with previously published results of white birch from the same area. Methods We built a reference chronology from wood core samples taken from 30 trees in three neighboring larch stands. Climate-growth relationships were analyzed monthly and seasonally over the period 1962 – 2009 using climate data from the Eroo weather station. Pointer year analysis covered the same time frame. Results Our analysis of the larch chronology showed that precipitation during autumn {{of the previous year}} and directly before the growing season of the current year was the most decisive factor determining tree-ring growth. Regional pointer year analysis further indicated that a humid summer and autumn followed by a warm spring support current-year tree-ring growth in these larch stands.

30|$|Seasonality. In {{order to}} compare {{differences}} in seasonality of incendiary fires, I took sub-samples of fire incidents based on location {{with reference to}} the RL and HD sampling units and further divided these data by land cover and ownership. I identified fire seasons by peaks in the number of unauthorized fires set where the number of fires per month exceeded the monthly average. I then evaluated the inter-annual variability in the ratio of number of fires to area burned through a linear regression {{of the total number of}} fires (independent variable) and total burned area (dependent variable) per fire season by year. So, for example, if a particular sample unit’s <b>peak</b> <b>fire</b> <b>season</b> were composed of the months February and March, I summed the number of fires for those two months for each year and tested these data against the total February–March burned area for the corresponding year. The strength and significance of correlations between number of fires and area burned per season can be interpreted as a measure of the spatiotemporal regularity of the emergent fire season across years.|$|E
30|$|Fuel moisture. I {{used the}} Palmer drought {{severity}} index (PDSI) {{as a proxy}} for fuel moisture conditions at the monthly and seasonal scale as these data provide an index of available moisture relative to historical conditions. Monthly PDSI data were downloaded from the National Climatic Data Center (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2010) for all Georgia climate divisions for the years 1987 – 2010. The PDSI uses a combination of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture data to develop a standardized water balance model (Alley 1984). For higher resolution analysis, I used the Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI), which references daily estimated soil and ground cover moistures at a local level and is commonly used in fire management in the US Southeast (Keetch and Byram 1968, Roncoli et al. 2006). In order to assess the relationship between relative moisture availability and unauthorized firesetting for each sample unit, I modeled the linear regressions between (1) monthly PDSI and the number of unauthorized fires per month by year and, (2) daily KBDI normalized by fire season specific distributions and the frequency of fire occurrence for each score. Lastly, I examined changes in the relationship between KBDI and unauthorized fire using a 4 yr moving window for the distribution of KBDI values for fires occurring during <b>peak</b> <b>fire</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

Three unrestrained rats consumed water from a reservoir at the center of a circular platform while passively subjected to sinusoidal rotatory oscillations at fast (153 +/- 27 degrees/s, sd) and slow (38 +/- 15 degrees/s) peak velocities. In 14 anterodorsal thalamic head direction cells, the preferred directions, angular response ranges and baseline firing rates remained stable, but the <b>peak</b> <b>firing</b> rates were, on average, 36 % higher during the fast rotations (Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, p < 0. 001; variation range: + 11 % to approximately + 100 %).

Here, we use 30 years of fire mapping from four subregions of the Sydney region to compare the annual extent of unplanned fire with previous planned and unplanned fire. Using linear mixed modelling, we were able to discriminate the relative influence of previous fire, seasonal rainfall and weather during the <b>peak</b> <b>fire</b> <b>season.</b> The mean annual area burnt over the period was 4. 11 %, comprising 0. 53 % planned and 3. 58 % unplanned. We found that weather during the fire season was the most influential factor. Annual rainfall had a modest negative relationship with unplanned fire area. Past fire had some influence, but the relationship implied that approximately three units of planned fire are required to reduce the unplanned fire area by one unit. Managers would need to burn 5. 4 % per year to halve unplanned fire extent, a ten-fold increase on recent levels.

40|$|Measurement of fire {{radiative}} energy (FRE) release rate {{or power}} (FRP) from satellite provides a vital mechanism for distinguishing different strengths of fires. Analysis of 1 -km resolution fire data, acquired globally by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites from 2000 to 2006, showed instantaneous FRP values ranging between 0. 02 MW and 1866 MW, to which simple thresholds {{can be applied}} to categorize fires by strength, in a similar fashion as the strengths of earthquakes and hurricanes. Analysis of regional mean FRP per unit area of land (FRP flux) shows that at <b>peak</b> <b>fire</b> <b>season</b> in certain regions, fires can be responsible for up to 0. 2 W/m 2 at peak time of day. When considered as the active fire contribution to the direct surface radiative forcing (RF) in the different fire regions, this order of magnitude of FRF fluxes is non negligible. It has been determined experimentally that the amount of FRE released by a fire over the course of its duration is directly proportional to the amount of biomass consumed by it. Furthermore, at the satellite observation scale, the rate of release of FRE (i. e. FRP) is proportional to the rate of biomass consumption, and that of emission of smoke particulates and eventually also other smoke constituents. Therefore, current research efforts are geared toward deriving simple parameterizations that will facilitate direct input of FRP measurements in models, not only to improve the accuracy of burned-biomass and smoke emissions estimations, but also to reduce the hitherto practiced heavy reliance on multiple indirect parameters with indeterminate uncertainties...|$|E
