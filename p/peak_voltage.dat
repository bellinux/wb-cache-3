25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} film capacitors is {{their ability to}} withstand high <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> or peak current surge pulses.

25|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxide forming processes {{take place}} when voltage in correct polarity is applied and generates an additional oxide when transients arise. This formation is accompanied with heat and hydrogen gas generation. This is tolerable if the energy {{content of the}} transient is low. However, when a transient <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> causes an electric field strength that is too high for the dielectric, it can directly cause a short circuit. An unambiguous and general specification of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has to be carefully approved.|$|E

Tight capacitance tolerances are required for timing applications in signal lights or pulse width generators to control the speed of motors, PP film capacitors are also well-suited because of their very low leakage current.|$|E

[...] The circuit works by following a Villard cell stage with what is in essence a peak detector or envelope detector stage. [...] The peak detector cell has the effect of removing most of the ripple while preserving the <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> at the output. The Greinacher circuit is also commonly known as the half-wave voltage doubler.|$|E

40|$|Responsible professor: Prof. ir. L. van der Sluis The {{analysis}} of transient overvoltages in transformer windings {{is of great}} importance because the windings can suffer huge <b>peak</b> <b>voltages</b> during {{a short period of}} time. Especially transient voltages that have a very steep front, such as a lightning surge, can be dangerous for transformers and they are important for the design of the insulation. This thesis work is about computation of inter-turn voltage distributions in primary transformer windings when a high frequency surge appears at the terminal of the transformer. The objective of the study is to determine the ratio of the <b>peak</b> inter-turn <b>voltage</b> and the <b>peak</b> input <b>voltage</b> surge. This is important for transformer insulation coordination. Computations are performed using the Hybrid Model [1]. The inter-turn voltages are calculated for a single phase layer type distribution transformer exposed to a step voltage and a sinusoidal <b>voltage</b> respectively. The <b>peak</b> inter-turn <b>voltage</b> in case of a step voltage is about 0. 13 % of the peak value of the input voltage. For a sinusoidal voltage this value is about 0. 11 %. In the secon...|$|R

SFAP amplitudes were calculated with a volume conduction model of skeletal muscle.

2500|$|To {{illustrate}} these concepts, {{consider a}} 230V AC mains supply {{used in many}} countries around the world. It is so called because its {{root mean square value}} is 230V. This means that the time-averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a DC voltage of 230V. To determine the <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> (amplitude), we can rearrange the above equation to: ...|$|E
2500|$|Briefly, {{the basic}} pulse {{compression}} properties {{can be related}} as follows. [...] For a chirp waveform that sweeps over a frequency range F1 to F2 in a time period T, the nominal bandwidth of the pulse is B, where B = F2 – F1, and the pulse has a time-bandwidth product of T×B [...] [...] Following pulse compression, a narrow pulse of duration τ is obtained, where τ ≈ 1/B, together with a <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> amplification of √(T×B).|$|E
2500|$|The above <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> is only {{achieved}} in coils in which air discharges do not occur; in coils which produce sparks, like entertainment coils, the <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> on the terminal {{is limited to}} the voltage at which the air breaks down and becomes conductive. [...] As the output voltage increases during each voltage pulse, it reaches the point where the air next to the high voltage terminal ionizes and coronas, brush discharges and streamer arcs, break out from the terminal. This happens when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, about 30kV per centimeter. [...] Since the electric field is greatest at sharp points and edges, air discharges start at these points on the high voltage terminal. [...] The voltage on the high voltage terminal cannot increase above the air breakdown voltage, because additional electric charge pumped into the terminal from the secondary winding just escapes into the air. [...] The output voltage of open-air Tesla coils is limited to around several million volts by air breakdown, but higher voltages can be achieved by coils immersed in pressurized tanks of insulating oil.|$|E
50|$|For {{rectifier}} applications, <b>peak</b> inverse <b>voltage</b> (PIV) or <b>peak</b> reverse <b>voltage</b> (PRV) is {{the maximum}} value of reverse voltage which {{occurs at the}} peak of the input cycle when the diode is reverse-biased. The portion of the sinusoidal waveform which repeats or duplicates itself is known as the cycle. The part of the cycle above the horizontal axis is called the positive half-cycle, or alternation; the part of the cycle below the horizontal axis is called the negative alternation. With reference to the amplitude of the cycle, the <b>peak</b> inverse <b>voltage</b> is specified as the maximum negative value of the sine-wave within a cycle's negative alternation.|$|R

2500|$|Most Tesla coil designs have {{a smooth}} spherical or {{toroidal}} shaped metal electrode {{on the high}} voltage terminal. [...] The electrode serves as one plate of a capacitor, with the Earth as the other plate, forming the tuned circuit with the secondary winding. [...] Although the [...] "toroid" [...] increases the secondary capacitance, which tends to reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>voltage,</b> its main effect is that its large diameter curved surface reduces the potential gradient (electric field) at the high voltage terminal, increasing the voltage threshold at which corona and streamer arcs form. Suppressing premature air breakdown and energy loss allows the voltage to build to higher values on the peaks of the waveform, creating longer, more spectacular streamers.|$|E
2500|$|An {{aspect of}} most {{rectification}} {{is a loss}} from the peak input voltage to the peak output voltage, caused by the built-in voltage drop across the diodes (around 0.7 V for ordinary silicon p–n junction diodes and 0.3 V for Schottky diodes). Half-wave rectification and full-wave rectification using a center-tapped secondary produces a <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> loss of one diode drop. Bridge rectification has a loss of two diode drops. This reduces output voltage, and limits the available output voltage if a very low alternating voltage must be rectified. As the diodes do not conduct below this voltage, the circuit only passes current through {{for a portion of}} each half-cycle, causing short segments of zero voltage (where instantaneous input voltage is below one or two diode drops) to appear between each [...] "hump".|$|E
2500|$|Moving coil {{instruments}} {{can respond}} {{only to the}} average value of the current through them. [...] To measure alternating current, which changes up and down repeatedly, a rectifier is inserted in the circuit so that each negative half cycle is inverted; [...] {{the result is a}} varying and non-zero DC voltage whose maximum value will be half the AC peak to <b>peak</b> <b>voltage,</b> assuming a symmetrical waveform. [...] Since the rectified average value and the root-mean-square value of a waveform are only the same for a square wave, simple rectifier-type circuits can only be calibrated for sinusoidal waveforms. [...] Other wave shapes require a different calibration factor to relate RMS and average value. This type of circuit usually has fairly limited frequency range. Since practical rectifiers have non-zero voltage drop, accuracy and sensitivity is poor at low AC voltage values.|$|E

2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to put the rectified waveform into a choke-input filter. [...] The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother: current is drawn over the entire cycle, instead of being drawn in pulses at the peaks of AC voltage each half-cycle as in a capacitor input filter. [...] The disadvantage is that the voltage output is much lower – the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak; this is about 90% of the RMS voltage versus [...] times the RMS voltage (unloaded) for a capacitor input filter. [...] Offsetting this is superior voltage regulation and higher available current, which reduce <b>peak</b> <b>voltage</b> and ripple current demands on power supply components. [...] Inductors require cores of iron or other magnetic materials, and add weight and size. [...] Their use in power supplies for electronic equipment has therefore dwindled in favour of semiconductor circuits such as voltage regulators.|$|E
