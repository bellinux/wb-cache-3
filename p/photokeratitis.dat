50|$|Any intense {{exposure}} to UV light {{can lead to}} <b>photokeratitis.</b> Common causes include welders who have failed to use adequate eye protection such as an appropriate welding helmet or welding goggles. This is termed arc eye, while <b>photokeratitis</b> caused by {{exposure to}} sunlight reflected from ice and snow, particularly at elevation, is commonly called snow blindness. It can also occur due to using tanning beds without proper eyewear. Natural sources include bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice or, less commonly, from sea or sand. Fresh snow reflects about 80% of the UV radiation compared to a dry, sandy beach (15%) or sea foam (25%). This is especially a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes, as with every thousand feet (approximately 305 meters) of elevation (above sea level), the intensity of UV rays increases by four percent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photokeratitis</b> can be {{prevented}} by using sunglasses or eye protection that transmits 5-10% of visible light and absorbs almost all UV rays.

40|$|Results. UVR at {{subthreshold}} doses did {{not produce}} any corneal damage that could be detected in the light microscope. Apoptosis was detected to be one important mechanism leading to corneal cell damage after UVR exposure at <b>photokeratitis</b> doses. <b>Photokeratitis</b> doses at 270, 280, and 290 inn led to a superficial corneal damage. Apoptotic cells were found only in the epithelial layer and superficial keratocytes. UVR exposure at <b>photokeratitis</b> doses at 310 inn resulted in severe corneal damage, where apoptosis {{was seen in the}} epithelium, the keratocytes through the whole corneal stromal thickness, and the endothelium. During the first seventy- six hours after exposure to 310 nm UVR at <b>photokeratitis</b> doses, keratocytes underwent apoptosis and disappeared. Keratocytes bordering this damaged cell-free area started to produce hyaluronan during the repopulation phase. The production of hyaluronan peaked at 7 days after UVR exposure. Fourteen days after exposure the corneas were completely restored, and only trace amounts of hyaluronan was detected close to the Descemet's membrane. Repeated exposures of the corneas to <b>photokeratitis</b> doses at 310 nm at 1 week intervals resulted in hyaluronan deposits in the corneal stroma, and reduction of the keratocyte apoptosis level. Fas ligand protein in the normal rabbit corneas was expressed only in epithelial and endothelial cells. UVR exposure of the corneas at <b>photokeratitis</b> doses resulted in Fas ligand protein expression also in keratocytes, suggesting the Fas/Fas ligand system activation leading to apoptosis. Biglycan gene was not expressed in the normal rabbit corneas. However, UVR exposure at <b>photokeratitis</b> doses activated a distinct biglycan gene expression at 7 days after exposure. Biglycan gene expression decreased 28 days after exposure. Conclusion. A <b>photokeratitis</b> dose of 310 rim UVR is needed to cause a significant keratocyte damage. A <b>photokeratitis</b> dose of the shorter wavelengths causes damage to epithelial cells and superficial keratocytes only, due to a very high absorption of these wavelengths in the epithelium. The keratocyte production of HA appears to be a sign of cell readiness to repopulate the damaged stroma devoid of keratocytes. Apoptosis, initiated by Fas/Fas ligand system activation, is a mechanism leading to the corneal cell death after UVR exposure. Repeated UVR exposures lead to increased production and accumulation of HA in the corneal stroma. The repopulated keratocytes are much more resistant to apoptosis than the native ones. HA accumulation may be a sign of long term changes in the cornea, leading to corneal degeneration. There is no expression of biglycan gene in the normal rabbit cornea. The UVR exposure leads to a strong expression of biglycan gene in the rabbit cornea that decreases 4 weeks after exposure indicating the biglycan involvement in the corneal repair process. Biglycan appears to be a novel marker of the corneal wound healing...|$|E

C 57 BL/ 6 mice were administered twice with either nano-AST, AST oil, lutein, or bilberry extracts 3 hours before and shortly before UV irradiation (dose: 400 [*]mJ/cm 2). The corneas were collected 24 hours after irradiation and stained with H&E and TUNEL. NF-κB, dihydroethidium (DHE), COX- 2, p-IκB-α, TNFα, and CD 45 expression were evaluated through immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and qPCR. Results. Corneal epithelium was significantly thicker in mice orally administered with nano-AST than in the others (p< 0. 01), with significantly less NF-κB nucleus translocation (p< 0. 001), and significantly fewer TUNEL cells (p< 0. 01). Weaker DHE signals were detected in the nano-AST group (p< 0. 05) relative to the others. Furthermore, reduced inflammation and decreased cell death in corneal tissue were observed in the nano-AST group, as indicated by a reduction in the expression of COX- 2, p-IκB-α, TNFα, and CD 45.

In order to quantify the ocular biologically effective UV (UVBE) irradiance exposure of different wavelengths and assess the risk of eye damage, UV exposure values were measured at Sanya, China (18. 4 ° N, 109. 7 °E, altitude 18 m), using a manikin and a dual-detector spectrometer to measure simultaneously the ocular exposure and ambient UV spectral irradiance data and solar elevation angle (SEA) range (approximately 7 °- 85 °). The present study uses the ocular UV spectral irradiance exposure weighted with the action spectra for <b>photokeratitis,</b> photoconjunctivitis and cataracts to calculate the ocular UVBE irradiance exposure for <b>photokeratitis</b> (UVBE(pker)), photoconjunctivitis (UVBE(pcon)) and cataracts (UVBE(cat)). We found that the ocular exposure to UV irradiance is strongest in the 30 °- 60 ° SEA range when ∼ 50 % of ocular exposure to UV irradiance on a summer's day is received. In the 7 °- 30 ° SEA range, all the biologically highly effective wavelengths of UVBE(pker), UVBE(pcon) and UVBE(cat) irradiances are at 300 nm.

Avoiding Sun exposure leads to vitamin D deficiency which is associated not only with rickets and osteomalacia, but also with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, influenza, many types of cancer and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Solar radiation induces nitric oxide release in tissue and immediate pigment darkening which certainly play important roles, although these are still unknown.

40|$|Introduction]: A common {{misconception}} is that shade {{protects the}} human body against ultraviolet radiation. While direct UV from the Sun is generally reflected or absorbed by the shade structure, the diffuse component is still present in the shade. Atmospheric scattering is {{the main cause of}} the diffuse UV, although other factors impact on the amount of UV radiation that exists in the shade. Over exposure to this diffuse radiation may cause a number of conditions mainly erythema and <b>photokeratitis.</b> This paper describes the research conducted using a scanning UV spectroradiometer, for different shade environments, and the possible resulting damaging effects on the skin and eyes. METHODS: The protective nature of specific shade environments was investigated by measuring the spectral UV in 1 nm increments with a calibrated spectroradiometer in the shade for the three planes of horizontal, 45 o and vertical and comparing this to that on a horizontal plane in full sun. The spectral UV irradiance measurements were made under clear sky conditions at a sub-tropical Southern Hemisphere site. The solar UV {{in the shade of a}} shade umbrella, covered veranda, covered sand pit and covered walkway were measured for an increasing solar zenith angle, between March and August of 2001, for the times of 11 : 30 am to 12 : 30 pm and 2 : 30 pm to 3 : 30 pm. RESULTS: The Ultraviolet Protection Factors (UPFs) of the shade structures ranged from 1. 4 to 10 with a general decrease from noon to afternoon. For a shade umbrella placed on dry grass with no surrounding vegetation, UV levels in the shade reached approximately 81 % and 84 % of that in the full sun for erythema and <b>photokeratitis</b> respectively. For a covered sand pit with trees and shrubs in close proximity, damaging UV levels were less than half that of the shade umbrella. Observations also showed that the diffuse UV levels in the shade increased as the solar zenith angle increased, amplifying the damaging effects. CONCLUSION: This research shows that there is sufficient UV in the shade to cause sunburn and increase the risk of sun-related eye disorders in a short period of time. Shade structures must be given careful consideration when construction occurs. Even though the UV transmission through the materials may be very low, it is the construction of the entire shade setting that determines the exposure beneath the shade structure...|$|E

This was undertaken for summer through to winter for SZA of 5 to 60 o employing an integrated automatic cloud and spectral UV measurement system that recorded the solar UV spectra and the sky images at five minute intervals. The UVBE calculated with action spectra with higher relative effectiveness in the UVA produced the lower percentage of cloud enhanced cases.
