By combining the high variation of mutagenised populations with novel screening methods, traits that are almost impossible to identify by conventional breeding are now being developed and characterised at the molecular level. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various techniques and workflows available to researchers today in the field of molecular breeding, and how these tools complement the ones already used in traditional breeding. Both genetic (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes; TILLING) and phenotypic screens are evaluated. Finally, different ways of bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is {{a reverse}} genetic method that {{combines}} chemical mutagenesis with high-throughput genome-wide screening for point mutation detection in genes of interest. However, this mutation discovery approach faces {{a particular problem}} which is how to obtain a mutant population with a sufficiently high mutation density. Furthermore, <b>plant</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> protocols require two successive generations (M 1, M 2) for mutation fixation to occur before {{the analysis of the}} genotype can begin. Results: Here, we describe a new TILLING approach for rice based on ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of mature seed-derived calli and direct screening of in vitro regenerated plants. A high mutagenesis rate was obtained (i. e. one mutation in every 451 Kb) when plants were screened for two senescence-related genes. Screening was carried out in 2400 individuals from a mutant population of 6912. Seven sense change mutations out of 15 point mutations were identified. Conclusions: This new strategy represents a significant advantage in terms of time-savings (i. e. more than eight months), greenhouse space and work during the generation of mutant plant populations. Furthermore, this effective chemical mutagenesis protocol ensures high mutagenesis rates thereby saving in waste removal costs and the total amount of mutagen needed thanks to the mutagenesis volume reduction...|$|E

Its favorable cytological features create a unique foundation for a convenient system in mutagenesis, thereby potentially enabling the 'hot spots' and 'cold spots' of DNA damage in its genome to be analyzed. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the involvement of 5 S rDNA, 25 S rDNA, the Arabidopsis-type (TTTAGGG) n telomeric sequence and the Brachypodium-originated centromeric BAC clone CB 33 J 12 in the micronuclei formation in Brachypodium root tip cells that were subjected to the chemical clastogenic agent maleic hydrazide (MH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) with four different DNA probes being used simultaneously to study <b>plant</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> A quantitative analysis allowed ten types of micronuclei, which were characterized by the presence or absence of specific FISH signal(s), to be distinguished, thus enabling some specific rules governing the composition of the MH-induced micronuclei with the majority of them originating from the terminal regions of chromosomes, to be identified. The application of rDNA sequences as probes showed that 5 S rDNA-bearing chromosomes are involved in micronuclei formation more frequently than the 25 S rDNA-bearing chromosomes. These findings demonstrate the promising potential of Brachypodium to be a useful model organism to analyze the effects of various genotoxic agents on the plant nuclear genome stability, especially when the complex FISH-based and chromosome-specific approaches such as chromosome barcoding and chromosome painting will be applied in future studies...|$|E

40|$|Retrotransposons are genomic parasites {{activated}} by stress conditions {{that can be}} seriously detrimental for their host. In this work I demonstrate that Tto 1, a typical plant LTR retrotransposon with insertion preference into genes {{can be turned into}} a synthetic molecular tool for gene tagging in plants and can be used to predict models for its replication steps. Although retrotransposons have been already used in <b>plant</b> <b>mutagenesis,</b> such application always required establishing protocols for tissue cultures and regeneration in vitro. Here, I show that sequence engineering of Tto 1 provides the possibility to obtain transposition in vivo, with a simple screening method based on PCR and with the advantage to skip all in vitro manipulations. An artificial -estradiol inducible promoter has been used to obtain transposition “on demand” in Arabidopsis plants, which generates stable unlinked insertions that follow mendelian segregation in the progeny. Comparing serial deletions of 3 ’ LTR of the engineered inducible Tto 1 (iTto 1), I have mapped its two natural terminators and identified the “minimal” R (redundant) region required to achieve the complete reverse transcription of the genomic mRNA into a new cDNA copy. Interestingly, the transcripts ending at the major “early” terminator cannot support reverse transcription, suggesting a mechanism of natural control on the expression. Transcripts with a more extended termination point contain 100 essential nucleotides that define the active nucleus of the R region. This sequence promotes the formation of a stable hairpin structure that “kisses” a complementary identical hairpin on the cDNA and determines the formation of the characteristic cDNA/mRNA heteroduplex. Since the LTR is a repeated sequence the definition of a minimal redundant region has also the important implication to reduce the only possible target for sequence-based gene silencing, which should lead to an increase of the mutagenic efficiency of iTto 1. Additional investigations have been carried out in attempt to identify points of improvement of iTto 1 performances. By sequence alignment I identified different versions of the integrase that might have influence on insertion efficiency. Furthermore I tested the pOp 6 /LhGR-N system that will provide higher expression levels in different host plants. The final goal of my work is to extend the application of iTto 1 to crop mutagenesis, therefore a big part of my work has been spent to develop Tto 1 constructs with activity in barley. Transgenic plants have been obtained, however the constructs still need further experimentation. ...|$|E

OsMTK 1, an MTR kinase from rice (Oryza sativa), is 48. 6 kD in size and shows cooperative kinetics with a Vmax of 4. 9 pmol/min and a K 0. 5 of 16. 8 μm.

In rice, OsMTK genes were strongly up-regulated in shoots and roots when plants were exposed to sulfur starvation. Gene expression was largely unaffected by lack of nitrogen or iron in the nutrient solution, indicating that OsMTK regulation was linked specifically to sulfur metabolism...|$|R

To investigate whether blockage of a Golgi SNARE in the ER have consequences for plant growth, we produced tobacco plants stably overexpressing either the wild type MELAD or the mutant gagag form of SYP 31. Whereas tobacco plants overexpressing the wild-type SYP 31 developed to set seed, tobacco plants overexpressing the mutant form gagag rapidly became chlorotic, ceased their growth and invariably died after several weeks. This indicated that retention of overexpressed SYP 31 in the ER is likely toxic for the secretory pathway and, therefore, plant development. Putative explanations for this observation are discussed taking into account SNARE properties and possible interactions...|$|R

In addition, yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that AtGRIPaa 711 – 753, AtGRIPaa 711 – 766 and AtGRIPaa 711 – 776 did not interact with themselves, but the intact GRIP domain with the AtGRIP C-terminus did.

40|$|AbstractAmong various {{functional}} genomics tools used to characterize genes in <b>plants,</b> transposon-based <b>mutagenesis</b> approaches offer great potential, especially in barley and wheat, which possess large genomes {{and in which}} genetic transformation is not routine. Two Ds transposon flanking sequences (TNPs), TNP- 29 (27. 4 cM (centiMorgan)) and TNP- 79 (70. 3 cM), were mapped {{in the vicinity of}} a malting quality QTL located on chromosome 4 H of barley. Reactivation of the Ds transposon sequence from these TNP lines led to the identification of genes in the malting QTL regions. Several Ds (dissociation) lines were generated by crossing TNP- 29 and TNP- 79 with an AcTPase (activator) expressing line (25 -B), and F 2 progenies were subsequently screened for Ds insertions at new locations. To further characterize these Ds mutants, we mapped the new Ds flanking sequences on a barley genetic map and found that 29 % of Ds were located in regions associated with the malting QTL located on chromosome 4 H and in close proximity to other important malting-associated QTL across the barley chromosome. Using a sequence based approach, a linkage map was generated that confirmed the position of Ds loci in the barley genome map. Locating these Ds loci on the barley map opens avenues to dissect important malting QTL for facilitating identification of candidate malting genes...|$|R

Immunogold labeling and cell fractionation studies showed that the chimeric protein was transported into microbodies and subsequently was processed. The chimeric protein was transported to functionally different microbodies, such as glyoxysomes, leaf peroxisomes, and unspecialized microbodies. These observations indicated that the transport of glyoxysomal citrate synthase is mediated by its N-terminal presequence and that the transport system is functional in all <b>plant</b> microbodies.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} is an innate characteristic of crop plants. It {{enables them to}} survive and propagate even {{in the presence of}} lethal doses of herbicides in the surroundings. Genetic tolerance in crops towards herbicides may have several benefits. It may increases safety margins between weed and crop sensitivity and also expands applicability of a particular herbicide. Besides, it can also lower the operating cost for weed control as compared to manual weeding and crop rotation which is normally prohibited by herbicide persistence. Herbicide resistant crops are developed through transformation of a plant with either native or mutant resistant genes, seed <b>mutagenesis,</b> <b>plant</b> cell or tissue culture and through other traditional plant breeding techniques. Seed mutagenesis is a non-transgenic approach, which is found to be most economical and perfect approach.

40|$|Disease {{resistance}} proteins {{containing a}} nucleotide binding site (NBS) and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region compose the largest class of disease resistance proteins. These so-called NBS-LRR proteins confer resistance against {{a wide variety}} of phytopathogens. To help elucidate the mechanism by which NBS-LRR proteins recognize and transmit pathogen-derived signals, we analyzed mutant versions of the Arabidopsis NBS-LRR protein RPS 2. The RPS 2 gene confers resistance against Pseudomonas syringae strains carrying the avirulence gene avrRpt 2. The activity of RPS 2 derivatives in response to AvrRpt 2 was measured by using a functional transient expression assay or by expressing the mutant proteins in transgenic <b>plants.</b> Directed <b>mutagenesis</b> revealed that the NBS and an N-terminal leucine zipper (LZ) motif were critical for RPS 2 function. Mutations near the N terminus, including an LZ mutation, resulted in proteins that exhibited a dominant negative effect on wild-type RPS 2. Scanning the RPS 2 molecule with a small in-frame internal deletion demonstrated that RPS 2 does not have a large dispensable region. Overexpression of RPS 2 in the transient assay in the absence of avrRpt 2 ! also led to an apparent resistant response, presumably a consequence of a low basal activity of RPS 2. The NBS and LZ were essential for this overdose effect, whereas the entire LRR was dispensable. RPSP interaction with a 75 -kD protein (p 75) required an N-terminal portion of RPSP that is smaller than the region required for the overdose effect. These findings illuminate the pathogen recognition mechanisms common among NBS-LRR proteins...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is an evolutionarily conserved sequence-specific gene-inactivation {{system that}} also functions as an antiviral mechanism in higher plants and insects. To overcome antiviral RNA silencing, viruses express silencing-suppressor proteins. These viral proteins can target {{one or more}} key points in the silencing machinery. Here we show that in Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV, type member of the Ipomovirus genus, family Potyviridae), the role of silencing suppressor is played by the P 1 protein (the largest serine protease among all known potyvirids) despite the presence in its genome of an HC-Pro protein, which, in potyviruses, acts as the suppressor. Using in vivo studies we have demonstrated that SPMMV P 1 inhibits si/miRNA-programmed RISC activity. Inhibition of RISC activity occurs by binding P 1 to mature high molecular weight RISC, as we have shown by immunoprecipitation. Our results revealed that P 1 targets Argonaute 1 (AGO 1), the catalytic unit of RISC, and that suppressor/binding activities are localized at the N-terminal half of P 1. In this region three WG/GW motifs were found resembling the AGO-binding linear peptide motif conserved in metazoans and <b>plants.</b> Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> proved that these three motifs are absolutely required for both binding and suppression of AGO 1 function. In contrast to other viral silencing suppressors analyzed so far P 1 inhibits both existing and de novo formed AGO 1 containing RISC complexes.

40|$|Xanthomonas translucens is {{the causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} leaf streak, {{the most common}} bacterial disease of wheat and barley. To cause disease, most xanthomonads depend on a highly conserved type III secretion system, which translocates type III effectors into host <b>plant</b> cells. <b>Mutagenesis</b> of the conserved type III secretion gene hrcT confirmed that the X. translucens type III secretion system is required to cause disease on the host plant barley and to trigger a non-host hypersensitive response (HR) in pepper leaves. Type III effectors are delivered to the host cell by a surface appendage, the Hrp pilus, and a translocon protein complex that inserts into the plant cell plasma membrane. Homologs of the Xanthomonas HrpF protein, including PopF from Ralstonia solanacearum and NolX from rhizobia, are thought {{to act as a}} translocon protein. Comparative genomics revealed that X. translucens strains harbor a noncanonical hrp gene cluster, which rather shares features with type III secretion systems from Ralstonia solanacearum, Paraburkholderia andropogonis, Collimonas fungivorans, and Uliginosibacterium gangwonense than other Xanthomonas spp. Surprisingly, none of these bacteria, except R. solanacearum, encode a homolog of the HrpF translocon. Here, we aimed at identifying a candidate translocon from X. translucens. Notably, genomes from strains that lacked hrpF/popF/nolX instead encode another gene, called hpaT, adjacent to and co-regulated with the type III secretion system gene cluster. An insertional mutant in the X. translucens hpaT gene, which is the first gene of a twogene operon, hpaT-hpaH, was non-pathogenic on barley and did not cause the HR or programmed cell death in non-host pepper similar to the hrcT mutant. The hpaT mutant phenotypes were partially complemented by either hpaT or the downstream gene, hpaH, which {{has been described as a}} facilitator of translocation in Xanthomonas oryzae.

Most of the deletions occurred within the T-DNA region, but two cases showed the loss of 72 kilobase pairs (kb) and 79 kb of rice genomic DNA flanking the transgene. In addition to deletions, we obtained chromosomal inversions ranging in size from less than 10 kb (within the transgene DNA) to over 1 million base pairs (Mb). For 11 inversions, we cloned and sequenced both inversion breakpoints; in all 11 cases, the inversion junctions contained the typical 8 base pairs (bp) Ac/Ds target site duplications, confirming their origin as transposition products.

To test this hypothesis about the corresponding <b>plant</b> enzyme, site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> was carried out on the recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana threonine deaminase. Kinetic and binding experiments demonstrated {{for the first time}} that each regulatory domain of the monomers of A. thaliana threonine deaminase possesses two different effector-binding sites constituted in part by Y 449 and Y 543. Our results demonstrate that Y 449 belongs to a high-affinity binding site whose interaction with a first isoleucine induces conformational modifications yielding a conformer displaying a higher activity and with enhanced ability to bind a second isoleucine on a lower-affinity binding site containing Y 543. Isoleucine interaction with this latter binding site is responsible for conformational modifications leading to final inhibition of the enzyme. Y 449 interacts with both regulators, isoleucine and valine. However, interaction of valine with the high-affinity binding site induces different conformational modifications leading to reversal of isoleucine binding and reversal of inhibition...|$|R
40|$|HpaG {{is a type}} III-secreted {{elicitor}} protein of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines. We {{have determined}} the critical amino acid residues important for hypersensitive response (HR) elicitation by random and site-directed mutagenesis of HpaG and its homolog XopA. A plasmid clone carrying hpaG was mutagenized by site-directed mutagenesis, hydroxylamine mutagenesis, and error-prone PCR. A total of 52 mutants were obtained, including 51 single missense mutants and 1 double missense mutant. The HR elicitation activity was abolished in the two missense mutants [HpaG(L 50 P) and HpaG(L 43 P/L 50 P) ]. Seven single missense mutants showed reduced activity, and the HR elicitation activity {{of the rest of}} the mutants was similar to that of wild-type HpaG. Mutational and deletion analyses narrowed the region essential for elicitor activity to the 23 -amino-acid peptide (H 2 N-NQGISEKQLDQLLTQLIMALLQQ-COOH). A synthetic peptide of this sequence possessed HR elicitor activity at the same concentration as the HpaG protein. This region has 78 and 74 % homology with 23 - and 27 -amino-acid regions of the HrpW harpin domains, respectively, from Pseudomonas and Erwinia spp. The secondary structure of the peptide is predicted to be an α-helix, as is the HrpW region that is homologous to HpaG. The predicted α-helix of HpaG is probably critical for the elicitation of the HR in tobacco <b>plants.</b> In addition, <b>mutagenesis</b> of a xopA gene yielded two gain-of-function mutants: XopA(F 48 L) and XopA(F 48 L/M 52 L). These results indicate that the 12 amino acid residues between L 39 and L 50 of HpaG have critical roles in HR elicitation in tobacco plants...|$|R
40|$|Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) {{control cell}} cycle {{progression}} through timely coordinated phosphorylation events. Two kinesin-like proteins that interact with CDKA; 1 {{were identified and}} designated KCA 1 and KCA 2. They are 81 % identical and have a similar three-partite domain organization. The N-terminal domain contains an ATP and microtubule-binding site typical for kinesin motors. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of the N-terminal domain of KCA 1 decorated microtubules in Bright Yellow- 2 cells, demonstrating microtubule-binding activity. During cytokinesis the full-length GFP-fusion protein accumulated at the midline of young and mature expanding phragmoplasts. Two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that coiled-coil structures of the central stalk were responsible for homo- and heterodimerization of KCA 1 and KCA 2. By western-blot analysis, high molecular mass KCA molecules were detected in extracts from Bright Yellow- 2 cells overproducing the full-length GFP fusion. Treatment of these cultures with the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate caused an accumulation of these KCA molecules. In addition to dimerization, interactions within the C-terminally located tail domain were revealed, indicating that the tail could fold onto itself. The tail domains of KCA 1 and KCA 2 contained two adjacent putative CDKA; 1 phosphorylation sites, {{one of which is}} conserved in KCA homologs from other <b>plant</b> species. Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> of the conserved phosphorylation sites in KCA 1 resulted in a reduced binding with CDKA; 1 and abolished intramolecular tail interactions. The data show that phosphorylation of the CDKA; 1 site provokes a conformational change in the structure of KCA with implications in folding and dimerization...|$|R
40|$|The coding {{sequence}} of the mature cyanogenic beta-glucosidase (beta-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 21; linamarase) was cloned into the vector pYX 243 modified to contain the SUC 2 yeast secretion signal sequence and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The recombinant enzyme is active, glycosylated and showed similar stability to the plant protein. Michaelis constants for hydrolysis of the natural substrate, linamarin (K(m) = 1. 06 mM) and the synthetic p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (PNP-Glc; K(m) = 0. 36 mM), as well as apparent pK(a) values of the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complexes (pK(E) (1) = 4. 4 - 4. 8, pK(E) (2) = 6. 7 - 7. 2, pK(ES) (1) = 3. 9 - 4. 4, pK(ES) (2) = 8. 3) were {{very similar to those}} of the <b>plant</b> enzyme. Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> was carried out to study the function of active-site residues based on a homology model generated for the enzyme using the MODELLER program. Changing Glu- 413 to Gly destroyed enzyme activity, consistent with it being the catalytic nucleophile. The Gln- 339 Glu mutation also abolished activity, confirming a function in positioning the catalytic diad. The Ala- 201 Val mutation shifted the pK(a) of the acid/base catalyst Glu- 198 from 7. 22 to 7. 44, reflecting a change in its hydrophobic environment. A Phe- 269 Asn change increased K(m) for linamarin hydrolysis 16 -fold (16. 1 mM) and that for PNP-Glc only 2. 5 -fold (0. 84 mM), demonstrating that Phe- 269 contributes to the cyanogenic specificity of the cassava beta-glucosidase...|$|R
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita. Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 27 - 01 - 2014 The {{addition of}} residues of N-acetylglucosamine through O linkages (O-GlcNAc) to target proteins is a post-translational modification widely distributed in eukaryotic cells. A {{large number of}} O-GlcNAc modification sites have been mapped in mammalian proteins and the functions of these proteins have been thoroughly studied. However in plants, targets of OGlcNAcylation are largely uncharacterized. Arabidopsis thaliana has two O-GlcNAc transferases (OGTs), Spindly (SPY) and Secret Agent (SEC), and previous results of the laboratory where this PhD thesis was carried out demonstrated that the coat protein (CP) of the potyvirus Plum pox virus (PPV) is O-GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated. In this work, we identified that SEC, and not SPY, is the OGT responsible of the PPV CP O-GlcNAcylation. In null sec- mutants of A. thaliana and in Nicotiana benthamiana transgenic plants in which the SEC-like genes where silenced by RNAi, O-GlcNAcylation of PPV CP was abolished or drastically disturbed, respectively. Virus accumulation was reduced at early times of infection in these plants compared to wild type <b>plants.</b> Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> and mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that threonines 19, 24, 41, 50, 53, 54 and 58 could be modified by O-GlcNAc or influenced the modification of other residues. Further mapping by ETD MS/MS confirmed that Thr- 19, Thr- 24, Thr- 41, Thr- 53 and Thr- 54 and/or Thr- 58, {{as well as the}} serine 65 are O-GlcNAcylation targets. CP O-GlcNAcylation appeared to be completely abolished in a PPV multiple mutant (PPV CP 7 -T/A) in which the seven threonines involved in O-GlcNAc modification were replaced by alanines. The O-GlcNAcylation-deficient PPV mutant infected N. clevelandii, N. benthamiana, and P. persica without noticeable defects. In contrast, this mutant infected poorly A. thaliana. The host-specific relevance of O-GlcNAcylation of PPV CP is further supported by the result of mixed infections in different host plants. O-GlcNAcylation seems to enhance PPV CP stability in a host-specific way. Thus, CP of PPV CP 7 T/A was much more unstable than that of wild type PPV in extracts of A. thaliana, whereas differences in stability of the two CPs was less noticeable in extracts of N. clevelandii and P. persica. The stabilities of wild type and CP 7 T/A CPs were quite similar in extracts of A. thaliana sec-, suggesting that the instability of the CP 7 T/A CP {{is the result of the}} O-GlcNAcylation deficiency rather than of the amino acid substitutions. All these results are in agreement with a fine-tuning effect of CP O-GlcNAcylation on PPV infection, probably facilitating its adaptation to different hosts and environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Small, {{secreted}} proteins {{have been}} found to play crucial roles in interactions between biotrophic/hemi-biotrophic pathogens and plants. However, {{little is known about the}} roles of these proteins produced by broad host-range necrotrophic phytopathogens during infection. Here, we report that a cysteine-rich, small protein SsSSVP 1 in the necrotrophic phytopathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was experimentally confirmed to be a secreted protein, and the secretion of SsSSVP 1 from hyphae was followed by internalization and cell-to-cell movement independent of a pathogen in host cells. SsSSVP 1 ∆SP could induce significant plant cell death and targeted silencing of SsSSVP 1 resulted in a significant reduction in virulence. Through yeast two-hybrid (Y 2 H), coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, we demonstrated that SsSSVP 1 ∆SP interacted with QCR 8, a subunit of the cytochrome b-c 1 complex of mitochondrial respiratory chain in <b>plants.</b> Double site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> of two cysteine residues (C 38 and C 44) in SsSSVP 1 ∆SP had significant effects on its homo-dimer formation, SsSSVP 1 ∆SP-QCR 8 interaction and plant cell death induction, indicating that partial cysteine residues surely play crucial roles in maintaining the structure and function of SsSSVP 1. Co-localization and BiFC assays showed that SsSSVP 1 ∆SP might hijack QCR 8 to cytoplasm before QCR 8 targeting into mitochondria, thereby disturbing its subcellular localization in plant cells. Furthermore, virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) of QCR 8 in tobacco caused plant abnormal development and cell death, indicating the cell death induced by SsSSVP 1 ∆SP might be caused by the SsSSVP 1 ∆SP-QCR 8 interaction, which had disturbed the QCR 8 subcellular localization and hence disabled its biological functions. These results suggest that SsSSVP 1 is a potential effector which may manipulate plant energy metabolism to facilitate the infection of S. sclerotiorum. Our findings indicate novel roles of small secreted proteins in the interactions between host-non-specific necrotrophic fungi and plants, and highlight the significance to illuminate the pathogenic mechanisms of this type of interaction...|$|R
40|$|For {{proteins}} in solution {{the validity of}} certain crystallographic parameters can be ascertained {{by a combination of}} molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations and NMR spectroscopy. Using the laser photoCIDNP (chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization) technique as a measure for surface accessibility of histidine, tyrosine and tryptophan, the spectra of bovine galectin- 1 and Erythrina corallodendron lectin (EcorL) are readily reconcilable with the crystallographic data for these two proteins. The results emphasise the role of Trp 68 /Trp 69 for carbohydrate binding in bovine galectin- 1 /chicken galectins and of Trpl 94 in murine galectin- 3. This feature derived from the crystal structure of bovine galectin- 1 is maintained in solution for the prototype human homologue, two avian galectins and the chimeratype murine galectin- 3, as the spectra corroborate the CIDNP-inferable spatial parameters of the four calculated models for binding-site architecture. In EcorL, Tyr 106 /Tyr 108 are constituents of the extended combining pocket, which can be shielded in solution by ligand presence. Discrepancies between results from modelling and CIDNP measurements concern primarily the lack of reactivity of histidine residues for human and avian prototype galectins and of Tyr 82 /Tyr 229 of the <b>plant</b> lectin. Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> of EcorL is assumed to provide information on the role of a certain residue for functional aspects. When single-site mutants of EcorL ([Ala 106]EcorL, [Ala 108]EcorL, [Ala 229]EcorL) were subjected to moleculardynamics (MD) simulations, the apparent surface accessibilities even of spatially separated amino acid side chains could non-uniformly be affected. This conclusion is supported by the assessment of the spectra for the mutant proteins. On the basis of these CIDNP-results modelling of the binding-site architecture of the lectin indicates the occurrence of notable alterations in the orientation of Tyr 106 /Tyr 108 phenyl rings. The implied potential effect of single-site mutations on conformational features of a protein will deserve attention for the interpretation of studies comparing wild-type and mutant proteins...|$|R
