These adjust with <b>premium</b> increases to limit after-subsidy <b>premium</b> payments by ACA enrollees to a fixed percentage of income.

40|$|The report compares ecolabeled seafood <b>premiums</b> {{observed}} in the market with consumers’ stated willingness to pay <b>premiums.</b> Also ecolabeled <b>premiums</b> in the agricultural sector were examined.

Empirical findings showed that all things being equal, consumers stated willingness to pay reflects in their actual market behavior though they may pay less than stated. <b>Premiums</b> {{observed in}} the aquaculture (24 - 38 %) appear to be generally higher than the fisheries (10 - 13 %). Stated <b>premiums</b> for environmentally sound seafood production however ranged from 15 - 50 %.

Fresh and perishable organic food products tend to attract higher <b>premiums.</b> Stated <b>premiums</b> were conditioned on a number of factors but most evident was consumer’s level of knowledge about ecolabel programs and the aesthetic quality comparable to conventional products.

40|$|Abstract We examine {{high-volume}} <b>premiums</b> {{based on}} weekly risk-adjusted returns. Significant average weekly abnormal high-volume <b>premiums</b> up to 0. 50 % per week are documented for 1962 - 2005. Most <b>premiums</b> are {{generated in the}} first two weeks and monotonically decline as holding periods are extended. Evidence of reversal is found as the holding periods are extended. <b>Premiums</b> depend on realized turnover in the holding period. The last finding supports the theories of Miller and Merton. Finally, we test whether <b>premiums</b> are compensation for taking additional risk. Negative skewness, idiosyncratic risk, and liquidity risk do not explain the high-volume <b>premiums.</b> Copyright (c) 2010 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employed}} eleven data series which {{consist of}} stocks, bonds, bills, equity <b>premiums,</b> term <b>premiums,</b> and various default <b>premiums</b> {{to investigate whether}} January seasonality reported in existing literature is robust across different states of the economy as this has important trading implications. For the periods 1926 - 1990, small stocks, small stock <b>premiums,</b> low grade bonds, and default <b>premiums</b> (spread between high grade, low grade and government bonds) reveal January seasonality and that the seasonality is robust across different states of the economy except for low grade bond returns and default <b>premiums.</b> January seasonality for low grade bond returns and low grade bond default <b>premiums</b> are primarily driven by results found during periods of economic expansion. Overall, January seasonality is more evident during the economic expansion periods although the magnitude of default <b>premiums</b> is larger during periods of economic contraction. Furthermore, prior findings of strong summer equity returns are primarily driven by the results found during the periods of economic contraction. It is also found that equity returns are generally higher during periods of economic expansion. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1997. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis study {{examines}} whether the {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) performance of the target firms influences the acquisition <b>premiums</b> paid by the acquirers. Using U. S. public merger and acquisition (M&A) deals, I found that acquisition <b>premiums</b> increase in the targets' perceived CSR quality, an effect incremental to previously documented drivers of such <b>premiums.</b> These findings are robust to (1) using four proxies for CSR measures, and (2) using three proxies for acquisition <b>premiums.</b> Greater value-enhancing and synergistic capabilities of targets with superior quality CSR, acquirers' environmental, social and reputational risk protection needs, and market imperfections- related incorrect valuation of CSR activities are possible explanations for this observed positive association between targets' CSR and acquisition <b>premiums.</b> Analysis specific to each CSR attribute reveals that targets' environmental performance has positive and the strongest effects on acquisition <b>premiums.</b> In addition, superior-quality community and diversity influence acquisition <b>premiums</b> significantly and positively. However, this analysis does not indicate any consistent association between target firms' product attributes and acquisition <b>premiums.</b> Additionally and perhaps more strikingly, this investigation reports a significant negative association between targets' employee relations and acquisition <b>premiums.</b> Additional tests document that the positive association between target firms' perceived CSR quality and acquisition <b>premiums</b> is stronger for acquirers with high quality CSR and large targets. Overall, in this study, I combine the CSR and M&A literature by demonstrating that superior quality CSR performance affects acquisition <b>premiums</b> positively. Thus, this study expands {{our understanding of the}} value-enhancing role of CSR by studying the M&A market...|$|R
