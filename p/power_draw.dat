5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates <b>power</b> <b>draw</b> with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E
25|$|The type of battery a {{specific}} hearing aid utilizes {{depends on the}} physical size allowable and the desired lifetime of the battery, which is in turn determined by the <b>power</b> <b>draw</b> of the hearing aid device.

25|$|The 60 and 66MHz 0.8 µm {{versions}} of the P5 Pentium processors also had (for the time) high heat production due to their 5 V operation. The P54C used 3.3 V and had significantly lower <b>power</b> <b>draw</b> by about 51% (a quadratic relationship). P5 Pentiums used Socket 4, while P54C started out on Socket 5 before moving to Socket 7 in later revisions. All desktop Pentiums from P54CS onwards used Socket 7.|$|E

25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional <b>power</b> <b>draw,</b> as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E
25|$|Power {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity {{as well as the}} design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called on-grid power systems and may supply the grid with additional <b>power,</b> <b>draw</b> power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called off-grid power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.|$|E

50|$|When {{lighting}} loads are in {{use for a}} {{high proportion}} of the time, energy savings on lighting equipment are extremely valuable. When voltage is reduced, incandescent lighting will see a large decrease in <b>power</b> <b>drawn,</b> a large decrease in light output and an increase in lifetime, as the previous extracts from the Electricians Guide illustrate. Since the decrease in light output will exceed the decrease in <b>power</b> <b>drawn,</b> the energy efficiency - luminous efficacy - of the lighting will drop.|$|R

6000|$|But at that instant, another {{sensation}} {{swept through}} me {{as quick as}} lightning. I was conscious {{of the presence of}} the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant's <b>power</b> <b>draw</b> it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires. The thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back. It was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring in the room he said, ...|$|E
50|$|NILM {{systems can}} also {{identify}} appliances {{with a series}} of individual changes in <b>power</b> <b>draw.</b> These appliances are modeled as finite state machines.

These will be identified as clusters, and <b>power</b> <b>draw</b> for the entire cluster will be recorded. Hence “dishwasher” <b>power</b> <b>draw</b> can be identified as opposed to “resistor heating unit” and “electric motor”.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is worth}} noting that a {{high-end}} graphics card will also use more electricity, or have a higher <b>power</b> <b>draw,</b> than a lower-end cards. This <b>power</b> <b>draw</b> only increases as the number of graphics cards increases, adding another cost to a high-end [...] "rig". Enthusiasts also tend to overclock their graphics cards which does add <b>power</b> <b>draw.</b> However, as the number of graphics cards increases, the performance gains by adding another graphics card decreases significantly due to the complexity of more than two GPU's communicating to each other in an efficient way. This is another example of depreciating returns.|$|E
