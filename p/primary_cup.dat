40|$|International audienceCancer {{of unknown}} <b>primary</b> origin (<b>CUP)</b> defines metastatic disease of unknown origin, {{accounting}} for 3 - 5 % of all cancers. Growing evidence demonstrates that inappropriate {{execution of a}} genetic program named 'invasive growth', driven by the MET oncogene, is implicated in the metastatic process. MET activation in cancers is mainly consequent to overexpression, while mutations are rarely found. We reasoned that the occurrence of MET somatic mutations might sustain premature occult dissemination of cancer cells, such as that observed in CUPs. We sequenced MET in genomic DNA obtained from 47 early metastatic cancers. By extensive immunohistochemical analysis a primary site was afterward postulated in 24 patients, whereas 23 cases remained of unknown <b>primary</b> (<b>CUPs).</b> MET somatic mutations were found in 7 cases, all belonging to the CUP cohort. Mutational incidence (30 %) was thus {{significantly higher than the}} expected one (4 %), in the absence of high mutational background. Several nucleotide changes were novel and clustered either in the kinase domain or in the extracellular semaphorin domain. Mutated receptors were functional and sustained the transformed phenotype, suggesting that MET activating mutations are genetic markers associated with the CUP syndrome...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of site-specific cancer therapy, identifying the primary origin allows the oncologist to personalise therapy for patients with the cancer of unknown <b>primaries</b> (<b>CUPs).</b> At present, immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening is the standard method used to postulate the <b>primary</b> site in <b>CUP.</b> In this retrospective study, we evaluated the prognostic benefit of identifying the <b>primary</b> site in <b>CUP.</b> All 84 patients who presented with suspected CUP to the Royal Stoke University Hospital between 2011 and 2012 were included in our study. Forty-eight percent (40 / 84) of these patients were unable to undergo necessary investigations to identify primary sites because of poor performance status. IHC screening was able to postulate the primary site in 59 % (26 / 44) of the remaining patients with confirmed <b>CUP.</b> Therefore, the <b>primary</b> site was not identified in {{a significant proportion of}} patients with CUP. The median survival of confirmed <b>CUP</b> with probable <b>primary</b> site was 2. 0 months (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 2 to 2. 9 months), whereas the median survival of confirmed CUP with no probable primary site was 4. 1 months (95 % CI: 1. 5 to 9. 7 months). This difference in survival time was statistically significant. In addition, using the Cox regression model, we found that patients with confirmed <b>CUP</b> with <b>primary</b> sites had prognostically unfavourable diseases with a shorter median survival, regardless of the age of disease onset, gender, sites of metastases or number of metastases. One approach to improve the survival would be to start systemic therapy at the earliest possible opportunity rather than waiting for all investigation results, such as IHC...|$|R

40|$|In {{revision}} surgery of the acetabulum bone defects can {{be filled}} with impacted human morsellized bone grafts. Because of a worldwide limited availability of human bone, alternatives are being considered. In this study we compared the initial stability of acetabular cups after reconstructing a cavitary defect with various compositions of impacted tricalciumphosphate-hydroxyapatite (TCP/HA) particles and mixes of TCP/HA particles and human grafts in a realistic acetabulum model. <b>Primary</b> cemented <b>cups</b> and reconstructions with impacted human cancellous grafts were used as reference. A dynamic load displaced the acetabular <b>cups</b> superomedially. The <b>primary</b> cemented <b>cups</b> showed the highest stability. The cups with impacted human grafts produced the most displacement. All reconstructions with the TCP/HA particles showed a high stability of the cups. However, especially when using large TCP/HA particles this was probably due to {{a large amount of}} cement penetration. Mixing TCP/HA particles with human grafts seemed to decrease cement penetration. although still a high stability was obtained.

Methods: Thirty-seven patients with CUP were enrolled between January 2001 and September 2003 at Korea Cancer Center Hospital. The patients received 21 -day cycles of pacli-taxel (175 mg/m 2 i. v.) with cisplatin (60 mg/m 2 i. v.) given on the first day. Results: Of the 37 patients, 31 had adenocarcinoma subtypes. The overall response rate of 26 patients with measurable lesions was 42 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 23 – 61 %]. Stable diseasewas seen in six patients and progressive disease in nine. Median time to progressionwas 4 months (95 %CI 1. 3 – 6. 8). Median overall survival was 11 months (95 %CI 8. 3 – 13. 5). Themajor toxicities were neuropathy and neutropenia.
