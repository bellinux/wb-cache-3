5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics and based on <b>positive</b> <b>law.</b> However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E
5|$|The {{canon law}} of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal {{principles}} made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission. In the Catholic Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely <b>positive</b> <b>law,</b> derive formal authority and promulgation {{from the office of}} pope who, as Supreme Pontiff, possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code, principles of legal interpretation and coercive penalties that are limited to moral coercion.|$|E

5|$|The most {{powerful}} British jurist of the century, his decisions reflected the Age of Enlightenment and moved England {{on the path}} to abolishing slavery and the slave trade. He advanced commercial law in ways that helped establish the nation as the world leader in industry, finance and trade. He modernised both English law and the English courts system; he sped up the system for submitting motions and reformed the way judgments were given to reduce time and expense for the parties. For his work in Carter v Boehm and Pillans v Van Mierop, he has been called the founder of English commercial law. He is perhaps best known for his judgment in Somersett's Case (1772), where he held that slavery had no basis in common law and had never been established by <b>positive</b> <b>law</b> (legislation) in England, and therefore was not binding law (although this did not end slave trafficking altogether).|$|E

25|$|He {{held that}} slavery could be {{consistent}} with natural law if it is imposed by <b>positive</b> <b>law</b> as punishment for crimes, and if such slavery did not violate the slave's rights to food, sleep, marriage (or celibacy), raising of their children, and religious worship (and anything else that pertains to natural law). Aquinas asserted that the children of a slave mother were rightly enslaved even though they themselves had not committed personal sin. He further argued that anyone who persuades a slave to escape is guilty of theft, because, while the slave is not himself property (a person cannot be property), his master {{has a right to}} the labor of that slave.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{equity in the}} Chinese law. In the {{classical}} Chinese literature, it {{was referred to as}} qingli, which means 'social obligations' to balance the rigidity of <b>positive</b> <b>laws.</b> Like its Western counterpart, this equity entails a twofold meaning: (1) the moral principles that have been into the <b>positive</b> <b>laws</b> (which Huang referred to as 'official representation') and (2) in judicial practice, the correction of hardship that arises out of the deficiency as inherent in <b>positive</b> <b>laws.</b> As far as its historical evolution is concerned, this thesis examines three consecutive periods, namely imperial China (221 BC to 1911), revolutionary period (1911 - 76) and reformist era (1978 -present). In imperial China, equity followed a path similar to its Roman counterpart in that there was a harsh law first, into which equity was gradually incorporated, until it reached its maturity in the Tang Code of 653 AD. This imperial construct was swept ruthlessly away by the revolutionary thunderstorm in the early 1910 s. In the midst of this tempest, the communist effort to seek an alternative to both traditional and imported models culminated in creating a legal system called People's Justice. Equity in this period was reinterpreted as mass participation and mobilisation. However, Mao's idealism not only turned the whole nation into chaos but also devoured its own devoted followers. This was partly the reason why in 1978 the Deng-led government unanimously held that China should relink with the outside world. In this state-led integration to global capitalism, equity underwent its second turn, now defined as local contextualisation of the rapidly formalised and westernised laws. The conclusion duly analyses both predicaments and opportunities for further development of equity in China. It calls for as much a reinvention of traditions as an attention for local contexts to construct a modern equity in China...|$|R
5000|$|In 1617, Althusius {{published}} his principal judicial work, Dicaeologicae. In this work, he categorized laws into types main types: natural <b>laws</b> and <b>positive</b> <b>laws,</b> {{and argued that}} natural law is [...] "the will of God for men." [...] Althusius contended that terms such as [...] "common law" [...] and [...] "moral law" [...] were other names for natural law. In order to know the true dictates of natural law, he argued, we must carefully study Scripture and tradition, as well as revelation and reason.|$|R
25|$|Although {{natural law}} is often {{confused}} with common law, {{the two are}} distinct. Even though natural law theories have exercised a profound influence {{on the development of}} English common law, the latter is not based on inherent rights, but is the legal tradition whereby certain rights or values are legally recognized by virtue of already having judicial recognition or articulation. Natural law is often contrasted with the human-made laws (<b>positive</b> <b>law)</b> of a given state, political entity or society. In legal theory, the interpretation of a human-made law requires some reference to natural law. On this understanding of natural law, natural law can be invoked to criticize judicial decisions about what the law says, but not to criticize the best interpretation of the law itself.|$|E
25|$|Sociology {{of law is}} {{a diverse}} field of study that {{examines}} the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as criminology. The institutions of social construction, social norms, dispute processing and legal culture are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called law and society studies; in Europe it is more {{often referred to as}} socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, Eugen Ehrlich, who sought to make clear the differences and connections between <b>positive</b> <b>law,</b> which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts. Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.|$|E
25|$|Although {{access to}} {{judicial}} review is restricted for ordinary questions of law, the Court of Justice has gradually developed {{a more open}} approach to standing for human rights. Human rights have also become essential in the proper interpretation and construction of all EU law. If there are two or more plausible interpretations of a rule, the one which is most consistent with human rights should be chosen. The Treaty of Lisbon 2007 made rights underpin the Court of Justice's competence, and required the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, overseen by the external Strasbourg Court. Initially, reflecting its primitive economic nature, the treaties made no reference to rights. However, in 1969 particularly after concern from Germany, the Court of Justice declared in Stauder v City of Ulm that 'fundamental human rights' were 'enshrined in the general principles of Community law'. This meant that Mr Stauder, who received subsidised butter under an EU welfare scheme only by showing a coupon with his name and address, was entitled to claim that this violated his dignity: he was entitled {{not to have to}} go through the humiliation of proving his identity to get food. While those 'general principles' were not written down in EU law, and simply declared to exist by the court, it accords with a majority philosophical view that 'black letter' rules, or <b>positive</b> <b>law,</b> necessarily exist for reasons that the society which made them wants: these give rise to principles, which inform the law's purpose. Moreover, the Court of Justice has clarified that its recognition of rights was 'inspired' by member states' own 'constitutional traditions', and international treaties. These include rights found in member state constitutions, bills of rights, foundational Acts of Parliament, landmark court cases, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Social Charter 1961, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, or the International Labour Organization's Conventions. The EU itself must accede to the ECHR, although in '’Opinion 2/13'’ the Court of Justice delayed, because of perceived difficulties in retaining an appropriate balance of competences.|$|E
