5|$|The {{royal family}} {{had already left}} Vienna for the summer, but Kalākaua got to inspect the troops during {{military}} maneuvers at the Schmelz parade grounds. He later had an audience with Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen. In the evening, {{he returned to the}} opera house for a performance of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. The next two days were spent sightseeing, including the Schönbrunn Palace, St. Stephen's Cathedral, the Votive Church, and the Neue Freie <b>Presse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{publication date}} for the book was October 14, 2008.

5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La <b>Presse</b> which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E
5|$|Québec comics have {{alternately}} flourished and languished, seeing several brief {{periods of}} intense activity followed by {{long periods of}} inundation with foreign content. Comics {{first appeared in the}} humour pages of newspapers in the 19th century, following the trends coming from Europe. In the late 19th Century, Henri Julien published two books of political caricatures, L’album drolatique du journal Le Farceur, after which the number of cartoonists began to increase in newspapers in Québec City and Montreal. 1904 saw, in the newspaper La Patrie, the publication of Les Aventures de Timothée (The Adventures of Timothée) by Albéric Bourgeois. This {{is said to be the}} first French-language comic to feature speech balloons. Joseph Charlebois's comic-strip adaptation of Le Père Ladébauche (Father Debauchery) also debuted in 1904, in La <b>Presse,</b> a popular strip that would last until 1957.|$|E

25|$|Gautier {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his career as a journalist at La <b>Presse</b> and later on at Le Moniteur universel. He saw journalistic criticism as a means to a middle-class standard of living. The income was adequate and he had ample opportunities to travel. Gautier began contributing art criticism to obscure journals as early as 1831. It was not until 1836 that he experienced a jump in his career when he was hired by Émile de Girardin as an art and theatre columnist for La <b>Presse.</b> During his time at La <b>Presse,</b> however, Gautier also contributed nearly 70 articles to Le Figaro. After leaving La <b>Presse</b> to work for Le Moniteur universel, the official newspaper of the Second Empire, Gautier wrote both to inform the public and to influence its choices. His role at the newspaper was equivalent to the modern book or theatre reviewer. He also reviewed music, without technical terminology but with intelligence and insight, for instance into the work of his friend Berlioz, who set six of his poems (c. 1840) as 'Les Nuits d'été'.|$|E

25|$|Tradition in Pomerol {{has been}} to {{separate}} the free-run wine and blend back in a proportion of the vin de <b>presse</b> as needed depending on the vintage. The rest of the press wine would often {{be used in the}} estate's second wine or sold to négociants. The timing of the blending (such as during or after fermentation) will vary by estate with some houses such as Château Pétrus adding the vin de <b>presse</b> during fermentation in order to allow the wine components to mature together and, theoretically, reduce the harshness of the typically more tannic and phenolic press wine.|$|E
25|$|In another {{review of}} the 1910 Salon d'Automne, {{published}} in La <b>Presse,</b> art critique Edmond Epardaud writes of the 'geometric follies' of Metzinger, and describes both Gleizes and Le Fauconnier as 'specious architects' (architectes fallacieux).|$|E

25|$|Wine {{made from}} the Chenin blanc grape can be dated to the 9th century in {{vineyards}} belonging to the Glanfeuil Abbey located just south of Angers {{in what is now}} Le Thoureil. Angevin wines have been held in high esteem since the Middle Ages but were mostly limited to local French markets. Unusual for the time Anjou was known for its unique winemaking technique of blending vin de <b>presse,</b> the wine extracted from pressing the grapes, with the vin de goutte or free run juice that came from the weight of gravity pressing the grape. This vin de <b>presse</b> added extra tannins and color to the wine but could limit the wine's appeal for being consumed young.|$|E
25|$|In October 2015, around 100 people brandishing JDL flags, and Israeli {{flags and}} letting off flares {{attacked}} the Agence France <b>Presse</b> building in Paris.

He also served as editor of the official organ of the Bricklayers Union, Grundstein, and as editor of the radical Berliner Freie <b>Presse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mulroney's {{professional}} {{reputation was}} further enhanced when he ended a strike {{that was considered}} impossible to resolve at the Montreal newspaper La <b>Presse.</b> In doing so, Mulroney and the paper's owner, Canadian business mogul Paul Desmarais, became friends. After his initial difficulties, Mulroney's reputation in his firm steadily increased, and he was made a partner in 1971.|$|E
25|$|Millat of Millat Ibrahim (faith of Abraham) {{is a word}} used to {{describe}} the Muslim faith. Due to the block on Facebook in Pakistan, a spinoff version of the site, MillatFacebook, was created to cater primarily to Muslims.

25|$|In the September 17, 2009 La <b>Presse</b> newspaper, Air Canada {{president}} and CEO Calin Rovinescu {{was quoted as}} saying that the term of exclusivity for Porter at the airport ends in 2010 and that Air Canada is considering a return to the airport in 2010, if acceptable terms can be arranged. Later in September, Jazz chief executive officer Joseph Randell reiterated the comments stating that they intended to restore service as early as April 2010.|$|E
25|$|Fein {{was born}} in Vienna to a Jewish family that {{reportedly}} at some point converted to Catholicism.

25|$|On 27 March 2010, the Moroccan {{magazine}} TelQuel {{stated that}} thousands of Moroccans had converted to Christianity. Pointing out the absence of official data, Service de <b>presse</b> Common Ground, cites unspecified sources that stated that about 5,000 Moroccans became Christians between 2005 and 2010. According to the International Religious Freedom Report for 2014 estimate {{that there may be}} as many as 8,000 Christian citizens throughout the country, but many reportedly do not meet regularly due to fear of government surveillance and social persecution.|$|E
25|$|The Pierre Pflimlin {{building}} (IPE 3), a heart-shaped, comparatively {{low building}} built {{on behalf of}} the SERS at the crossing of Avenue du Président Robert Schuman and Allée Spach, inaugurated in 1991 as a press and media center (Centre de <b>presse</b> et d'information) at a cost of 38million euros, has been given the name of the former President of European Parliament on 6 July 2007. The smallest of the buildings (21,000 m²), it is also the only one not to be next to the river or the canal. It now houses among other things the translation staff.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May, Olaf Brockmann of Austrian {{newspaper}} Die <b>Presse,</b> citing Alexander Ushakov, head trainer of the Soviet decathlon team, said Eastern Bloc {{countries were}} hastily arranging {{a series of}} sports events. Brockmann named five competitions: two track and field athletics meets, one {{to be held in}} Prague, Czechoslovakia, and the other in East Berlin and Potsdam, East Germany; plus fencing, modern pentathlon and boxing events to be held in Poland. Ushakov reportedly said the events would be held either before or after the Olympics, to avoid conflicts with the IOC, which would ban any form of counter-Olympic Games.|$|E
25|$|The trampled and de-stemmed {{harvest is}} then pressed. The {{type of wine}} press also affects the {{potential}} quality of the wine. Since the 1980s, pneumatic presses have improved the work involved by working in airtight conditions and allowing a fine control of the pressure to extract the juice without damaging the grapes. The juice or moût de goutte (Must of Drops) is the juice that flows naturally from the berries crushed under their own weight prior to pressing (on {{the way to the}} press). Trampling increases its proportion and makes the material profitable by processing a higher tonnage of grapes in the same time. The moût de <b>presse</b> (Must of the Press) is the juice flowing from the press from the pressure on the grapes. It concentrates the qualities or the defects of the grape: it is rich in aromas, colloids, or phenolic compounds. However, it can also be marked by olfactory defects, such as the smell of fungus on spoiled grapes or the vegetable smell of a harvest with insufficient maturity. The blending or not of the moût de goutte and the moût de <b>presse</b> musts and release depends on the health of the grapes, the method of pressing, and the style of wine intended. Manipulation of the grape before pressing increases the amount of lees and complicates pressing. For the development of a quality wine, their use is excluded or very limited.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1820s {{numerous}} {{newspapers were}} established in Indianapolis to report local, state, and national events. The town's earliest newspapers included the Indianapolis Gazette (1822); the Western Censor and Emigrant's Guide (1823), which became the Indianapolis Journal (1825); the Indiana Democrat (1830); the Daily Sentinel (1841), Indianapolis's first daily newspaper; the Indiana Freeman (1844), an antislavery newspaper; and The Locomotive (1845). Over {{the next few decades}} some of these publications merged, others discontinued operations, and new ones arrived on the scene. A few local newspapers served the city's German-speaking population, including Das Indiana Volksblatt (Indiana Volksblatt), which began publication in 1848, and the Freie <b>Presse</b> von Indiana, a weekly German-language newspaper that began publication in 1853.|$|E
