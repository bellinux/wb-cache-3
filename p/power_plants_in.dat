5|$|Under President Obama the Department of Energy (DOE) was {{reviewing}} options {{other than}} Yucca Mountain for a high-level waste repository and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, {{established by the}} Secretary of Energy, released its final report in January 2012. It expressed urgency to find a consolidated, geological repository, and said that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with {{direct access to the}} Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as is the cabinet department of the Department of Energy. In the meantime, most nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems (including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater), 7 planned for dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.|$|E

5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>In</b> the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E
