5000|$|The Red Road Flats were a mid-twentieth-century {{high-rise}} {{housing complex}} located between {{the districts of}} Balornock and Barmulloch in the northeast {{of the city of}} Glasgow, Scotland. The estate originally consisted of eight multi-storey blocks of steel frame construction. Two were [...] "slabs", much wider in cross-section than they are deep. Six were [...] "points" [...] , more of a traditional tower block shape. The slabs had 28 floors (26 occupiable + 2 mechanical), the <b>point</b> <b>blocks</b> 31 (30 occupiable + 1 mechanical), and taken together, they were designed for a population of 4,700 people. The <b>point</b> <b>blocks</b> were among the tallest buildings in Glasgow at 89 m, second in overall height behind the former Bluevale and Whitevale Towers in Camlachie. The 30th floor of the <b>point</b> <b>blocks</b> were the highest inhabitable floor level of any building in Glasgow.|$|R

They are 13 storeys high and contain 56 flats, all except {{those on the}} top floor accessible by a lift and stairs, the top floor only by stairs.

The block is 28m x 20m and 39m to the 13th floor, floor plate [...] They are the form of an H, there are two flats on the each of the long (28m) walls connected by a narrow central service area where one finds the lifts and stairs and a disused drying room.

His most notable works here include The Lawn, Britain's first modern-style <b>point</b> <b>block,</b> consisting of nine storeys arranged in a butterfly design on an area of open ground surrounded by oak trees; a tromp-l'oeil pair of curved terraces facing a cricket green at Orchard Croft, which won a British Housing Award in 1951; the pioneering broken-silhouette flats in Morley Grove; and much of the housing in Mark Hall neighbourhood, which is in its entirety a conservation area. The Harvey Centre lacks architectural distinction, but is notable as an early British example of a large purpose-built indoor shopping mall. His similarly pioneering Sports Centre has been demolished, as has the original town hall. The Water Gardens, although listed by English Heritage, have been spoilt by the abutment of a car park and shopping centre. The garden of his personal home at Marsh Lane (Gibberd Garden), on the outskirts of Harlow, a mixture of formal and informal design, contains architectural elements salvaged from his reconstruction of Coutt's Bank in London.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA semisymmetric {{design is}} a {{connected}} incidence structure satisfying; two <b>points</b> (<b>blocks)</b> are on 0 or λ <b>blocks</b> (<b>points).</b> Every <b>block</b> (<b>point)</b> is incident with k <b>points</b> (<b>blocks).</b> Properties of the incidence graph of these structures are investigated, leading to bounds on its diameter (d⩽k if λ = 2, d⩽[2 k/(λ + 1) ]+ 1 if λ > 2), {{and the number}} of points of these structures (υ⩽ 2 k- 1 if λ = 2, υ⩽k 2 [2 k/(λ + 1) ] if λ > 2). Bounds are also found for semisymmetric designs containing a subdesign. We give characterizations of semisymmetric designs with λ = 2 (semibiplanes) which contain a subdesign and achieve the bounds. This leads to a construction for a semibiplane with parameters υ = 2 r- 1 (q 2 − 1), k = q+q 1 +⋯+qr, where qr is aprime power, qi = q 2 i+ 1 and q=q 21...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{previous}} studies of finite difference approaches, the 4 Point-Modified Explicit Group (MEG) iterative method {{with or without a}} weighted parameter, ω, has been pointed out to be much faster as compared to the existing four <b>point</b> <b>block</b> iterative methods. The main characteristic of the MEG iterative method is to reduce computational complexity compared to the full-sweep or half-sweep methods. Due to the effectiveness of this method, the primary goal {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the use of the 4 Point- Modified Explicit Group (MEG) iterative method together with a weighted parameter, namely 4 Point-MEGSOR. The effectiveness of this method has been shown via results of numerical experiments, which are recorded and analyzed, show that that the 4 Point-MEGSOR iterative scheme is superior as compared with the existing four <b>point</b> <b>block</b> schemes...|$|E

40|$|By growing {{cells in}} {{alternating}} periods {{of light and}} darkness, {{we have found that}} the synchronization of phototrophically grown Chlamydomonas populations is regulated at two specific points in the cell cycle: the primary arrest (A) point, located in early G 1, and the transition (T) point, located in mid-G 1. At the A point, cell cycle progression becomes light dependent. At the T point, completion of the cycle becomes independent of light. Cells transferred from light to dark at cell cycle position between the two regulatory points enter a reversible resting state in which they remain viable and metabolically active, but do not progress through their cycles. The photosystem II inhibitor dichlorophenyldimethylurea (DCMU) mimics the A <b>point</b> <b>block</b> induced by darkness. This finding indicates that the A <b>point</b> <b>block</b> is mediated by a signal that operates through photosynthetic electron transport. Cells short of the T point will arrest in darkness although they contain considerable carbohydrate reserves. After the T point, a sharp increase occurs in starch degradation and in the endogenous respiration rate, indicating that some internal block to the availability of stored energy reserves has now been released, permitting cell cycle progression...|$|E
