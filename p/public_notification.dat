500|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{all three}} films was conducted concurrently in many locations within New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks. Filming took place between 11 October 1999 and 22 December 2000, a period of [...] days. Pick-up shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2003. The series was shot at over 150 different locations, with seven different units shooting, as well as soundstages around Wellington and Queenstown. Along with Jackson directing the whole production, other unit directors included John Mahaffie, Geoff Murphy, Fran Walsh, Barrie Osbourne, Rick Porras, and any other assistant director, producer, or writer available. Jackson monitored these units with live satellite feeds, and with the added pressure of constant script re-writes and the multiple units interpreting his envisioned result, he only got around four hours of sleep a night. Due to the remoteness {{of some of the}} locations, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters could not reach the location to bring them home in time. The New Zealand Department of Conservation was criticised for approving the filming within national parks without adequate consideration of the adverse environmental effects and without <b>public</b> <b>notification.</b> The adverse effects of filming battle scenes in Tongariro National Park meant that the park later required restoration work.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in 1970, many {{of these}} laws were {{modified}} or abolished {{in favor of more}} traditional responses such as imprisonment due to criticism of the [...] "sexual psychopath" [...] concept as lacking scientific evidence, the treatment being ineffective, and predictions of future offending being dubious. There were also a series of cases where persons treated and released committed new sexual offenses. Starting in the 1990s, several states have passed sexually dangerous person laws, including registration, housing restrictions, <b>public</b> <b>notification,</b> mandatory reporting by health care professionals, and civil commitment, which permits indefinite confinement after a sentence has been completed.

2500|$|For {{its first}} 16 years, Greenwich was Dutch property. Within weeks of his arrival, one of Dutch Director Peter Stuyvesant's first actions was to {{strengthen}} {{his claim to}} the area to prevent large English colonies from establishing themselves closer to the Dutch on Manhattan. [...] He purchased and received title from the Munsee named Seyseychimmus, to all the land between {{the west bank of}} the Mianus River and Stamford's Mill River, (natively called the Seweyruc), and confiscated the Feake/Patrick property in the process. [...] Angered by this, Stamford men, who answered to the New Haven Colony, demanded renegotiation of the border between New Netherland and New England. In 1650, [...] The Treaty of Hartford terms weakened Dutch control. Treaty terms, negotiated by Peter Stuyvesant and men from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, dictated that while the Dutch would continue to own the land of Groenwits, they would treat inhabitants there as jurisdictional neutrals. (This language was related to the plight of Elizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake Hallett, a niece, daughter-in-law and ward of Gov. John Winthrop, and her legal, matrimonial, political and land title disputes. She was a politically charged figure in English inter-colony squabbling). Further, this treaty prevented the Dutch from establishing any more homesteads within 6 miles of {{the west bank of the}} Mianus River. (This river was natively called the [...] "Kechkawes" [...] and called [...] "Greenwich Bay" [...] by the English). [...] Eroding jurisdictional oversight of Greenwich inhabitants resulted in early Greenwich farmers who [...] "live in a disorderly and riotous manner, sell intoxicating liquors to the Indians, receive and harbor servants who have fled their masters, and join persons unlawfully in marriage." [...] There were also cases of runaway Dutch Manhattan teenagers coming to Greenwich to be wed by a farmer there, (likely Andrew Crabb), who dispensed with the publication of pre-wedding banns, or advance <b>public</b> <b>notification.</b> In 1656, when Dutch power had significantly declined, the New Haven Colony did exert jurisdiction over Greenwich and considered it a part of Stamford. With the fall of New Netherland to the English in 1664, the General Assembly in Hartford declared Greenwich a separate township from Stamford.|$|E

60|$|During the {{parliament}} that sat from 1847 to 1852, Mr. Gladstone's political {{life was in}} partial abeyance. The whole burden of conducting {{the affairs of the}} Hawarden estate fell upon him. For five years, he said, 'it constituted my daily and continuing care, while parliamentary action was only occasional. It supplied in fact my education for the office of finance minister.' The demands of church matters were anxious and at times absorbing. He warmly favoured and spoke copiously for the repeal of the navigation laws. He desired, however, to accept a recent overture from America which offered everything, even their vast coasting trade, upon a footing of absolute reciprocity. 'I gave notice,' he says, 'of a motion to that effect. But the government declined to accept it. I accordingly withdrew it. At this the tories were much put about. I, who had thought of things only and not taken persons into view, was surprised at their surprise. It did not occur to me that by my <b>public</b> <b>notification</b> I had given to the opposition generally something like a vested interest in my proposal. I certainly should have done better never to have given my notice. This is one of the cases illustrating the extreme slowness of my political education.' The sentence about thinking of things only and leaving persons out, indicates a turn of mind that partly for great good, partly for some evil, never wholly disappeared.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} the space-time nature of land price {{upheaval}} that Japanese metropolitan areas experienced in the late eighties. Long-term panel data of land prices for two major metropolitan areas were first compiled, based on the <b>Public</b> <b>Notifications.</b> The parameters of the cross-sectional land price functions calculated in the process suggest that the price formations in Osaka are approximately {{two to three years}} behind that in Tokyo. The space-time structure of land price changes within the Tokyo area was studied using one- and two-dimensional diffusion models, where monocentricity of fund supplies to the land market is assumed. It is concluded, regardless of dimensions, that heat conduction provides a good analogy for the space-time behavior of land market: diffusion coefficients suggest that the land price increase has propagated fastest towards north-north-east and south-south-west, and slowest along the orthogonal direction.

5000|$|Following the {{adoption}} of the Act that transferred the government of India from the East India Company to the Crown in 1858, the Governor-General as representing the Crown became known as the Viceroy.

Although the Proclamation of 1858 announcing the assumption of the government of India by the Crown referred to Lord Canning as [...] "first Viceroy and Governor-General", none of the Warrants appointing his successors referred to them as 'viceroys', and the title, which was frequently used in warrants dealing with precedence and in <b>public</b> <b>notifications,</b> was basically one of ceremony used in connection with the state and social functions of the sovereign's representative.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{timeliness}} of nongovernmental and governmental communications of infectious disease outbreaks and evaluate trends for each over time, we investigated the time elapsed {{from the beginning}} of an outbreak to public reporting of the event. We found that governmental sources improved the timeliness of public reporting of infectious disease outbreaks during the study period. Rapid public communication of incipient disease threats, even with incomplete information, might enable quicker response measures, including enhanced disease surveillance and initiation of protective measures, for those at risk (1). Traditionally, <b>public</b> <b>notifications</b> are communicated through a hierarchical infrastructure from which local, provincial or state, and national health authorities obtain information by interacting with health care providers and diagnostic laboratories (2). However, many health authorities now rely on informal outbreakreporting systems, such as ProMED-mail, for timely signals of infectious threats (3, 4), as encouraged by the revised WHO International Health Regulations (5). Research has suggested that globally, informal sources provide outbreak warnings faster than traditional governmental reporting mechanisms (6).
