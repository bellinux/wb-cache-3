40|$|Abstract. Metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> {{is widely}} used in road lamp. The {{structure}} of the metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> {{is more and more}} complex. It needs to open holes on the metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pole.</b> To determine bearing capacity and safety properties of the <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> after opening hole, this paper used ABAQUS software to make finite element analysis of the metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> and accurately got the deformation and stress of metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pole.</b> By means of comparing the stress situation of the metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> with and without holes, it summaries up the influence rules of holes on the mechanical behavior of metal <b>lamp</b> <b>pole.</b> There is an obvious stress concentration phenomenon around holes and the influence degree of different holes location of stress concentration is also different. Through finite element simulation analysis, it meets the project safety and provides reference value for optimization design of <b>lamp</b> <b>pole...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Lamp</b> <b>poles</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} highway and community components in modern cities. Their supporting parts are primarily tapered octagonal cones specifically designed for wind resistance. The geometry and the positions of the <b>lamp</b> <b>poles</b> are important information for various applications. For example, they are important to monitoring deformation of aged <b>lamp</b> <b>poles,</b> maintaining an efficient highway GIS system, and also facilitating possible feature-based calibration of mobile LiDAR systems. In this paper, we present a novel geometric model for octagonal <b>lamp</b> <b>poles.</b> The model consists of seven parameters in which a rotation about the z-axis is included, and points are constrained by the trigonometric property of 2 D octagons after applying the rotations. For the geometric fitting of the <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> point cloud captured by a terrestrial LiDAR, accurate initial parameter values are essential. They can be estimated by first fitting the points to a circular cone model and this is followed by some basic point cloud processing techniques. The model was verified by fitting both simulated and real data. The real data includes several <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> point clouds captured by: (1) Faro Focus 3 D and (2) Velodyne HDL- 32 E. The fitting results using the proposed model are promising, and up to 2. 9 mm improvement in fitting accuracy was realized for the real <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> point clouds compared to using the conventional circular cone model. The overall result suggests that the proposed model is appropriate and rigorous...|$|R

Electrification was still very new and had not reached everywhere in the US. The fair was the first public demonstration of several lighting technologies that would become common in future decades. These technologies included the introduction of the first fluorescent light and fixture. General Electric Corporation held the patent to the fluorescent light bulb at the time. Approximately a year later, the original three major corporations, Lightolier, Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation, and Globe Lighting, located mostly in the New York City region, began wide-scale manufacturing in the US of the fluorescent light fixture.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to explore {{potential}} designs for a table that attaches to poles and street signs outside food trucks. A convenient placement of tables could greatly facilitate and improve the eating experience for food truck customers and simultaneously keep people nearby for repeated business and community development. A table design without legs, that uses existing structures, such as street signs, telephone <b>poles</b> and <b>lamp</b> posts for support, was initially explored. Three goals were identified for the table's functionality. These goals included clamping to signs and poles of various diameters, safely supporting large loads and a simple, quick deployment process. Initial prototypes failed in fulfilling all three goals, largely due to inappropriate clamping mechanisms. In choosing a ratchet tie down strap as the final clamping mechanism, further improvements and designs were explored. Ultimately, an all in one table and brace system, involving an unfolding table surface was settled on. by Bryan A. Macomber. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Generic person {{detection}} is an ill-posed {{problem as}} con-text is widely ignored. Local context {{can be used}} to split the generic detection task into easier sub-problems, which was recently explored by classifier grids. The detection prob-lem gets simplified spatially by training separate classifiers for each possible location in the image. So far, adaptive grid based approaches only focused on exploring the spe-cific background class. In contrast, we propose a method using different types of context in order to collect scene spe-cific samples from both, the background and the object class over time. These samples are used to update the specific object detectors. Due to limiting label noise and avoiding direct feedback loops our system can robustly adapt to the scene without drifting. Results on the PETS 2009 dataset show significantly improved person detections, especially, during static and dynamic occlusions (e. g., <b>lamp</b> <b>poles</b> and crowded scenes). 1...|$|R
