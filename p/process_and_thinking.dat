50|$|The title ‘Bedlam’ {{was decided}} upon both by SLaM, Channel 4 and The Garden Productions. It {{is based on}} the fact that SLaM can trace its roots back to 1247 when the Priory of St Mary of Bethlehem was {{established}} in the City of London. The priory, which became a refuge for the sick and infirm, was known as ‘Bedlam’ and was the earliest form of what is now Bethlem Royal Hospital. The title has generated concern and criticism from some mental health campaigners because of what is seen as the negative, stigmatising associations with the term ‘Bedlam’. In response, the Trust set out the <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> which led to the name being agreed.|$|E

He revealed to Cooper a disdain {{for much of his}} graduate work, which led him to reconsider his image as an artist. “At this point I sort of dropped the idea of making art; it was more about [...] "discovering a beginning." [...] Friedman remarked. During this time period he completely emptied his studio and created an all white isolation chamber in which he would meditate on objects he brought in from his home. Friedman began at this point to move towards self described radical stages of simplification focusing on the process of his work. In pieces like Untitled (1990), eraser shaving formed into a circle, Friedman focused on repetitive actions which became for him [...] "almost like a mantra." [...] This study of object is also evident in his 1990 writing, Ingredients, {{a list of all the}} questions one can ask about and object, organized into three main categories. The object, the location of the object, and the viewer. The questionnaire ended up being twenty pages long.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Uncertainty exists {{widely in}} the {{subjective}} and objective world. In {{all kinds of}} uncertainty, randomness and fuzziness {{are the most important}} and fundamental. In this paper, the relationship between randomness and fuzziness is discussed. Uncertain states and their changes can be measured by entropy and hyper-entropy respectively. Taken advantage of entropy and hyper-entropy, the uncertainty of chaos, fractal and complex networks by their various evolution and differentiation are further studied. A simple and effective way is proposed to simulate the uncertainty by means of knowledge representation which provides a basis for the automation of both logic and image thinking with uncertainty. The AI (artificial intelligence) with uncertainty is a new cross-discipline, which covers computer science, physics, mathematics, brain science, psychology, cognitive science, biology and philosophy, and results in the automation of representation, <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> for uncertain information and knowledge...|$|E

The research has concentrated on {{the ways in which}} loss is expressed through body language – the corporeality of the human condition. The chosen material is clay, built into sculptural forms using coil and slab work. The task has been to find ways in which internal loss might be manifest as a physical expression of the body. The early part of the project has been to investigate loss of life, loss of reason and loss of control which have led to the subject of dualities implicit in the subject of loss: absence and presence, internal and external, secrecy and revelation, darkness and light. The Hare has been used as an Everyman during this series of work. The subject of loss requires a clearly defined palette to achieve a strong visual tension, so the palette has been limited to black and white. Black and white imagine the dualities of absence and presence, light and dark, life and death. The making process has led to an installation that includes found objects; six dining chairs and an iron bed provide a theatrical locale for an installation.

40|$|The initial goal of {{this effort}} {{is to develop a}} {{discussion}} on urban design <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> that acknowledges the needs of places with meaning {{in the design of the}} urban waterfront. The thesis addresses the fact that the problematic of the coastal formulation is intricate, comprising not only aspects related to the spatial organization and design of its domain but also shared properties originated by the presence and movement of the perceiving subject in the area. In this framework, the research attempts to provide an understanding of the main relationships that the subject cultivates inside the coastal space and to offer a broader spatial reading of its narrative function. On the hypothesis that this function is susceptible of interpretation, the thesis develops an interest in examining the effects of the psychospatial nature of meaning on the design and experience of the urban edge, for to interpret a narrative spatial construct is to specify its meaning. To explore the issue of waterfront places that speak of the subject, the research conceives the coastal space as a field of mediated parameters that pertain to three crucial operational premises: the symbolic function of the urban space near the water, the meaning behind the coastal form, and the engagement of the perceiving subject in the conscious or reflexive appropriation of the waterfront setting. These premises, traced as psychophysiological spaces, determine the intermediary, the integrative, and the expressive discourses for the development of places with meaning near the water. Through them, the thesis attempts a reading of the coastal domain based upon the material interpretation of the meanings and messages associated with the immediate experience of the onset of water‐born notions, concepts, and images. Writing about the dialectics between the psychospatial inquiry and the spatial experience of the edge, this thesis suggests that, contrary to the established preconception, the psychology of human‐edge relations submits the perceiving subject to the conception of the coastal form and shape.

40|$|Since its {{inception}} in the late 1970 s, the academic field of design research has lacked significant input from textile design. Textile design inhabits a liminal space that spans art, design, craft; the decorative and functional; from handiwork to industrial manufacture. This PhD by thesis, although recognizing this particularity, asserts textile design as a design discipline and seeks to address key questions that define a design discipline (Archer 1979). Specific factors have prevented the participation of textile design {{in the development of}} design theory: the universalism of the Modernist age decried many of the innate characteristics of textiles {{despite the fact that the}} versatility of textiles has made it one of the most appropriate mediums for its message. This suppression points to the femininely gendered nature of textiles and how this affected the participation of textile designers in the development of design research. Addressing this historical and cultural context necessitated the utilization of feminist qualitative research methods in a methodology that references matrixial theory (Ettinger 2006) and relationality. Encounters, conversations, stories, drawings, metaphor, meshing and restorying are all key research methods used in this study. In its autoethnographic approach, my position as a textile designer and as the researcher is frequently foregrounded, and is also blended with the experiences of other textile designers. The study unfolds and expands in a non-linear way, structure and outcome co-evolving through my contingent thinking and activity. Theory and texts are montaged from anthropology, philosophy, literature, cognitive psychology and psychoanalysis to define key characteristics of textile design and its associated thinking, both tacit and explicit. These characteristics are then placed into the context of the design research agenda, with particular reference to design thinking and problem-solving. This both strengthens the position of textiles as a design discipline and highlights its anomalies. Through analysing the articulation of textile design practice and thinking, this study proposes an alternative perspective on design thinking and problem-solving in design which contrasts with the notions of divergence followed by convergence which are predominant in design research literature. It suggests that textile design thinking is fundamentally dimensionally expansive yet set in tense relation to external forces of folding and rhizomatic breakage (Deleuze 1993 / 1999, Deleuze & Guattari 1987 / 2008). This paradigm of design thinking rests upon the significance of long-established textile metaphors for the embodied and interconnected activities of cognition and action, and is indicative of particular views of post- Postmodernist thought. Based on this, as well as on other key characteristics of textile design <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> that have been defined, pedagogic implications are discussed and specific areas of current design research discourse which would benefit from greater involvement from textile designers and theorists are explored...|$|E

Cognitive radar then exploits this acquired {{knowledge and understanding}} to enhance information extraction, data processing and radar management.
