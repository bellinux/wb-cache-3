50|$|Lattice-based {{cryptographic}} constructions are {{the leading}} candidates for public-key <b>post-quantum</b> <b>cryptography.</b> Indeed, the main alternatives to lattice-based cryptography are schemes based on the hardness factoring and related problems and schemes based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm and related problems. However, both factoring and the discrete logarithm {{are known to be}} solvable in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Furthermore, algorithms for factorization tend to yield algorithms for discrete logarithm, and vice versa. This further motivates the study of constructions based on alternative assumptions, such as the hardness of lattice problems.|$|E
50|$|Lattice-based {{cryptography}} is {{the generic}} term for constructions of cryptographic primitives that involve lattices, {{either in the}} construction itself or in the security proof. Lattice-based constructions are currently important candidates for <b>post-quantum</b> <b>cryptography.</b> Unlike more widely used and known public-key schemes such as the RSA or Diffie-Hellman cryptosystems, which are easily attacked by a quantum computer, some lattice-based constructions appear to be resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers.

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, for 128 bits of {{security}} in a symmetric-key-based system, one can safely use key sizes of 256 bits. The best quantum attack against generic symmetric-key systems is an application of Grover's algorithm, which requires work proportional to the square root {{of the size of}} the key space. To transmit an encrypted key to a device that possesses the symmetric key necessary to decrypt that key requires roughly 256 bits as well. It is clear that symmetric-key systems offer the smallest key sizes for <b>post-quantum</b> <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hash-based {{cryptography}} is {{the generic}} term for constructions of cryptographic primitives {{based on the}} security of hash functions. So far, hash-based cryptography is limited to digital signatures schemes such as the Merkle signature scheme. Hash-based signature schemes combine a one-time signature scheme with a Merkle tree structure. Since a one-time signature scheme key can only sign a single message securely, it is practical to combine many such keys within a single, larger structure. A Merkle tree structure is used to this end. In this hierarchical data structure, a hash function and concatenation are used repeatedly to compute tree nodes. Lamport signatures are {{an example of a}} one-time signature scheme that can be combined with a Merkle tree structure. Hash-based cryptography is a type of <b>post-quantum</b> <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Multivariate {{cryptography}} is {{the generic}} term for asymmetric cryptographic primitives based on multivariate polynomials over a finite field [...] In certain cases those polynomials could be defined over both a ground and an extension field. If the polynomials have the degree two, {{we talk about}} multivariate quadratics. Solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations is proven to be NP-hard or NP-complete. That's why those schemes are often considered to be good candidates for <b>post-quantum</b> <b>cryptography.</b> Multivariate cryptography has been very productive in terms of design and cryptanalysis. Overall, the situation is now more stable and the strongest schemes have withstood the test of time. It is commonly admitted that Multivariate cryptography {{turned out to be}} more successful as an approach to build signature schemes primarily because multivariate schemes provide the shortest signature among post-quantum algorithms.|$|E

50|$|For certain {{classes of}} problems, {{algorithms}} running on quantum computers are naturally capable of achieving lower time complexity than on classical computers. That is, quantum algorithms can solve certain problems {{faster than the}} most efficient algorithm running on a traditional computer. For example, Shor's algorithm can factor an integer N in polynomial time, while the best-known factoring classic algorithm, the general number field sieve, operates in sub-exponential time. This is significant to public key cryptography because the security of RSA {{is dependent on the}} infeasibility of factoring integers, the integer factorization problem. Shor's algorithm can also efficiently solve the discrete logarithm problem, which is the basis for the security of Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curve DSA, Curve25519, ed25519, and ElGamal. Although quantum computers are currently in their infancy, the ongoing development of quantum computers and their theoretical ability to compromise modern cryptographic protocols (such as TLS/SSL) has prompted the development of <b>post-quantum</b> <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Post-quantum</b> <b>cryptography</b> {{refers to}} {{cryptographic}} algorithms (usually public-key algorithms) that {{are thought to}} be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. This is not true for the most popular public-key algorithms, which can be efficiently broken by a sufficiently large quantum computer. The problem with the currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm. Even though current, publicly known, experimental quantum computers are too small to attack any real cryptographic algorithm, many cryptographers are designing new algorithms to prepare for a time when quantum computing becomes a threat.

The first one refers to establishing a consensus in both academia and industry on how to defeat quantum attacks.

The former is based on different computational problems believed to be so hard that not even quantum computers would be able to tackle them. One important benefit of PQC schemes is that they can be implemented and deployed in the computers currently available [73 – 77]. The latter (QC) depends on the existence and deployment of a quantum infrastructure, and is restricted to key-exchange purposes [78].

For a public key cryptosystem, it is important to study the reduction of key size.
