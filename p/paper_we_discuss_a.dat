Furthermore, grammar formalisms should allow for clear expression of linguistic knowledge {{in such a way that}} its formalization is clearly separated from procedural information. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>we</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>an</b> {{efficient and}} robust parser that is used in an large-scale information retrieval project. In Section 1, [...] ...|$|R
