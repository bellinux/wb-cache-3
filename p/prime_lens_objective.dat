50|$|All {{perspective}} control and tilt/shift <b>lenses</b> are manual-focus <b>prime</b> lenses; most are quite expensive compared to regular <b>prime</b> <b>lenses.</b> Some medium format camera makers, such as Mamiya, have addressed {{this problem by}} offering shift adapters that work with the maker’s other <b>prime</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Canon EF 14mm 2.8L USM is an ultra {{wide angle}} <b>prime</b> <b>lens.</b> It is the widest <b>prime</b> <b>lens</b> in the Canon EF series. Because it is {{corrected}} for a rectilinear projection, {{the field of}} view is less than that of the Canon 15mm fisheye.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of full frame manual focus <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> without any electronics is relatively easier and less costly than the {{construction of}} electronic full frame autofocus lenses of any kind. Additionally, the E-mount Sony α7 series are the only full frame mirrorless cameras and have more electronic aids for manual focusing than full-frame DSLRs. Both these facts have encouraged lesser known lens companies to construct full frame <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> with E-mount. Numerous affordable sharp full-format manual <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> with big apertures are available with E-mount.|$|R
5000|$|It is a [...] "pancake" [...] lens, a {{very compact}} <b>prime</b> <b>lens</b> {{designed}} to be easily portable. When released {{on the market in}} 2008, it was one of a very few <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> designed explicitly for digital cameras, and the only one targeted at the entry-level consumer market.|$|R
50|$|These {{are high}} quality (mostly <b>prime)</b> <b>lenses</b> with the lens housing made of metal. They {{usually have a}} wider maximum {{aperture}} compared to zooms but narrower as compared to other <b>prime</b> <b>lenses.</b> This is a compromise as DA Limited lenses are usually made {{to be much more}} compact than other <b>primes</b> <b>lenses.</b> In August 2013 the DA Limited lenses were upgraded with Pentax new HD coating, replacing the previous smc coating. The new HD lenses are also available in both silver and black, as opposed to only black.|$|R
50|$|Zoom lenses may scatter {{more light}} through their more {{complicated}} optical systems than <b>prime</b> <b>lenses,</b> that is, lenses of fixed focal length; for example, an infrared photo {{taken with a}} 50 mm <b>prime</b> <b>lens</b> may look more contrasty than the same image taken at 50 mm with a 28-80 zoom.|$|R

5000|$|An {{alternative}} and apparently somewhat older {{meaning of the}} term <b>prime</b> <b>lens</b> is the main lens in a combination lens system. [...] When the camera lens is used with some other optical device, such as a close-up lens, teleconverter, or teleside converter, the camera lens itself is properly called the <b>prime</b> <b>lens.</b> <b>Prime</b> is here used in the sense of primary, chief, original, first in order, etc.|$|R
50|$|The complex {{internal}} {{movements of}} zoom were also adapted to <b>prime</b> <b>lens</b> designs. Traditionally, <b>prime</b> <b>lenses</b> for rigid cameras were focused closer by physically shifting the entire lens toward {{the object in}} a helical or rack and pinion mount. (Cameras with bellows expanded the bellows to shift the lens forward.) However, element spacing for best aberration correction may be different for near versus far objects.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} a fixed focal length lens (also known as <b>prime</b> <b>lenses)</b> {{presents}} fewer challenges than the {{design of a}} zoom <b>lens.</b> A high-quality <b>prime</b> <b>lens</b> whose focal length is about equal to the diameter of the film frame or sensor may be constructed from as few as four separate lens elements, often as pairs {{on either side of the}} aperture diaphragm.
