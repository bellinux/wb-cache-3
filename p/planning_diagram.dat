40|$|This book aims {{to simplify}} the complex problem of {{planning}} and organising compositions of interior spaces by introducing key issues that interior designers can consider during the design process. Chapter 1, Points of Departure, establishes how, when organising the planning strategies for interior projects, {{the work of the}} contemporary interior designer can start from a variety of different concerns that may include; the qualities of the existing site to be used for the project, the function of the proposed interior or the client’s ethos. Chapter 2, The Use of Precedent Studies, emphasises the importance of learning from examples of previous good practice to inform future design proposals. Chapter 3, Developing Conceptual Ideas, shows how design decisions can be determined by a clear, bold conceptual direction that may establish the form of the interior whilst also establishing a narrative that engages the user’s interest. Chapter 4, Planning Strategies, introduces approaches to the development of interior space planning. Spatial strategies, spatial relationships and circulation strategies are identified and explained with the help of appropriate case studies. Chapter 5, From Brief to Proposal, sets out methods of translating the client’s needs into an organisation of appropriate spaces that reconcile the functional requirements of the brief with the form of the building in which the proposed interior is to be housed. Chapter 6, The Exisiting Building’s Impact, demonstrates how the nature of the existing building {{can be one of the}} major factors that determine the approach taken towards the establishment of the new interior. Strategies for analysing existing buildings are outlined and approaches to the introduction of new elements into existing spaces are explained. Chapter 7, Developing Three Dimensional Spatial Compositions, demonstrates ways in which it is possible to develop a huge variety of three dimensional forms from any given <b>planning</b> <b>diagram.</b> Model making strategies are explained illustrating how the same plan can deliver many contrasting spatial compositions. Chapter 8, Designing in Section, emphasises the importance of the section of an interior as a crucial aspect of its design. How the form of an existing building’s section can be analysed, understood and utilised is considered as well as opportunities for the development of the form of the new interior in section. Chapter 9, Communicating Spatial Organisations, illustrates the ways in which interior designers use a variety of different methods to communicate complex spatial issues to colleagues, clients and members of the design team. Diagrammatic, orthographic and freehand drawing types as well as models are discussed. Chapter 10, What Next?, discusses the ensuing stages of the design process once the spatial composition of a project is established. The chapter outlines the process of developing the plan in more detail to satisfy precise functional needs leading to the detailed design stage and ultimately the built reality. Throughout the book case studies are used to further explain ideas and demonstrate how the issues being discussed are utilised in practice. Where appropriate step-by-step sequences demonstrate practical skills that develop the interior designer’s ability to explore and develop approaches introduced within chapters...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{automated}} optimization of declarative SQL queries is {{a classical}} {{problem that has}} been diligently addressed by the database community {{over the last few}} decades. However, due to its inherent complexities and challenges, this area has largely remained a “black art”, {{and the quality of the}} query optimizer continues to be a key differentiator between competing database products, with large research and development teams involved in their design and implementation. Over the past five years, we have provided a fresh perspective on the behavior of modern query optimizers through the introduction and development of the “plan diagram ” concept. A <b>plan</b> <b>diagram</b> is a visual representation of the plan choices made by the optimizer over a parameter space. In this paper, we provide an overview of <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams,</b> their processing, and their applications. <b>Plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> often appear similar to cubist paintings and provide a variety of interesting insights, including that current optimizers make extremely fine-grained plan choices; that the plan optimality regions may have highly intricate patterns and irregular boundaries, indicating strongly non-linear cost models; that non-monotonic cost behavior exists where increasing result cardinalities decrease the estimated cost; and, that the basic assumptions underlying parametric query optimization often do not hold in practice. Our study also shows that complex <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> can usually be reduced to “anorexic ” equivalents, featuring only a few plans, without materially affecting the query processing quality. Anorexic reduction has important implications for the design and use of next-generation query optimizers, and in particular, can be used to minimize the adverse impact of selectivity estimation errors, a chronic problem in the field...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{database}} systems use a query optimizer {{to identify}} the most efficient strategy, called "plan", to execute declarative SQL queries. Optimization is a mandatory exercise since {{the difference between the}} cost of best plan and a random choice could be in orders of magnitude. The role of query optimization is especially critical for the decision support queries featured in data warehousing and data mining applications. For a query on a given database and system configuration, the optimizer's plan choice is primarily a function of the selectivities of the base relations participating in the query. A pictorial enumeration of the execution plan choices of a database query optimizer over this relational selectivity space is called a "plan diagram". It has been shown recently that these diagrams are often remarkably complex and dense, with a large number of plans covering the space. An interesting research problem that immediately arises is whether complex <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> can be reduced to a significantly smaller number of plans, without materially compromising the query processing quality. The motivation is that reduced <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> provide several benefits, including quantifying the redundancy in the plan search space, enhancing the applicability of parametric query optimization, identifying error-resistant and least-expected-cost plans, and minimizing the overhead of multi-plan approaches. In this thesis, we investigate the <b>plan</b> <b>diagram</b> reduction issue from theoretical, statistical and empirical perspectives. Our analysis shows that optimal <b>plan</b> <b>diagram</b> reduction, w. r. t. minimizing the number of plans in the reduced diagram, is an NP-hard problem, and remains so even for a storage-constrained variation. We then present CostGreedy, a greedy reduction algorithm that has tight and optimal performance guarantees, and whose complexity scales linearly with the number of <b>plans</b> in the <b>diagram.</b> Next, we construct an extremely fast estimator, AmmEst, for identifying the location of the best tradeoff between the reduction in plan cardinality and the impact on query processing quality. Both CostGreedy and AmmEst have been incorporated in the publicly-available Picasso optimizer visualization tool. Through extensive experimentation with benchmark query templates on industrial-strength database optimizers, we demonstrate that with only a marginal increase in query processing costs, CostGreedy reduces even complex <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> running to hundreds of plans to "anorexic" levels (small absolute number of plans). While these results are produced using a highly conservative upper-bounding of plan costs based on a cost monotonicity constraint, when the costing is done on "actuals" using remote plan costing, the reduction obtained is even greater - in fact, often resulting in a single plan in the reduced diagram. We also highlight how anorexic reduction provides enhanced resistance to selectivity estimate errors, a long-standing bane of good plan selection. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that complex <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> can be efficiently converted to anorexic reduced diagrams, a result with useful implications for the design and use of next-generation database query optimizers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{automated}} optimization of declarative user queries is {{a classical}} hallmark of database technology. XML, with {{its support for}} deep data hierarchies and powerful query operators, including regular expressions and sibling axes, renders the query optimization challenge significantly more complex. In this pa-per, we analyze the behavior of industrial-strength XQuery optimizers using the notion of “plan diagrams”, which had hitherto been applied solely to relational engines. <b>Plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> visually characterize the optimizer’s query plan choices on a parametrized query space, and extending them to the XML environment re-quires redesigned definitions of the parameters and the space. Through a compre-hensive set of experiments {{on a variety of}} popular benchmarks, we demonstrate that XQuery <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams</b> can be significantly more dense and complex as com-pared to their relational counterparts. Further, they are more resistant to “anorexic reduction”, requiring substantially larger cost-increase thresholds to achieve this objective. These results suggest that important research challenges remain to be addressed in the development of effective XQuery optimizers. ...|$|R

40|$|Given a {{parametrized}} n-dimensional SQL {{query template}} and {{a choice of}} query optimizer, a <b>plan</b> <b>diagram</b> is a color-coded pictorial enumeration of the execution plan choices of the optimizer over the query parameter space. These diagrams {{have proved to be}} a powerful metaphor for the analysis and redesign of modern optimizers, and are gaining currency in diverse industrial and academic institutions. However, their utility is adversely impacted by the impractically large computational overheads incurred when standard bruteforce exhaustive approaches are used for producing fine-grained diagrams on high-dimensional query templates. In this paper, we investigate strategies for efficiently producing close approximations to complex <b>plan</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Our techniques are customized to the features available in the optimizer’s API, ranging from the generic optimizers that provide only the optimal plan for a query, to those that also support costing of sub-optimal plans and enumerating rank-ordered lists of plans. The techniques collectively feature both random and grid sampling, as well as inference techniques based on nearest-neighbor classifiers, parametric query optimization and plan cost monotonicity. Extensive experimentation with a representative set of TPC-H and TPC-DS-based query templates on industrial-strength optimizers indicates that our techniques are capable of delivering 90 % accurate diagrams while incurring less than 15 % of the computational overheads of the exhaustive approach. In fact, for full-featured optimizers, we can guarantee zero error with less than 10 % overheads. These approximation techniques have been implemented in the publicly available Picasso optimizer visualization tool. 1...|$|R
