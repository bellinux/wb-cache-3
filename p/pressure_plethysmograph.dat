40|$|A <b>pressure</b> <b>plethysmograph</b> for {{measuring}} respiratory volume in mice during exposure to virus aerosols is described. The respiratory frequency and tidal volume were measured, and from these data the minute ventilation was calculated. The mean respiratory frequency of adult, male mice was 255 per min; the mean tidal volume of 0. 18 ml was {{inversely related to}} respiratory frequency. The standardized mean minute ventilation rate was 1. 46 ml per g of body weight. The respiratory frequency and tidal volume of CD- 1 and HA/ICR strains of mice {{of the same age}} were similar. The respiratory retention rate for a 2. 7 -μm aerosol of vesicular stomatitis virus was 41 %, and 58 % of the virus retained was found in the trachea and lung...|$|E

Ig 59. -A broadly applicable method for the quantitative and con-tinuous measurement of airway resistance in man is described. It permits the simultaneous measurement of air flow (breath velocity) and alveolar pressure during any breathing pattern. Alveolar pressure is calculated from body <b>plethysmograph</b> <b>pressure</b> (plethvsmogram) changes coincident with the com-pression {{and expansion of}} lung air during expiration and inspiration, respectively. The plethysmograph interior is maintained at body temperature and complete Hz 0 saturation. This avoids the errors in measurement due to <b>plethysmograph</b> <b>pressure</b> changes produced by temperature and humidity changes in the inspired and expired breath and also obviates the necessity of using only a panting type breathing pattern. Data on three normal subjects at near resting and near maxi-mum breathing efforts are presented and discussed. This improved method, permitting airway {{resistance measurement}}s during anv breathing pattern, should find application in diagnosis and assessment of treatment of pulmonary diseases {{as well as in}} the investigation of several basic pulmonary function problems. S EVERAL YEARS AGO two of us(HS and HB) attempted to measure alveolar pressure during spontaneous un-interrupted breathing. The method consisted of si-multaneous measurement of breath velocity and pressure changes in a body <b>plethysmograph.</b> <b>Plethysmograph</b> <b>pressure</b> changes were produced by compression and expansion of the lung gases during expiration and in-spiration, respectively. The technique was quite well perfected. However, there was much concern over pressure changes as a result of cyclic changes in hu-midity and temperature of the breath. At that time, the method was not considered generally applicable enough to warrant communication. Some time ago, while dis-cussing these past experiments, we decided to construct Received for publication June I 7, 1958. 1 These studies were aided by a contract between the Office o...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine several ways of extracting {{information}} from wearable monitors {{so as to}} help make clinical decisions. Wearable physiological sensors are developing rapidly, and pose a possible {{part of the solution}} to the demands of an aging population and rising health care costs. It is important that the data produced by such sensors be processed into information that is clinically relevant and {{will have an impact on}} the practice of medicine. I collected data in an ambulatory setting from several wearable physiological sensors, including electrocardiogram, arterial blood <b>pressure,</b> pulse <b>plethysmograph,</b> respiration and acceleration. Using this data set, I demonstrated a few approaches - including signal processing, and algorithms based on the application of physiological models - to extract clinically relevant information. These approaches are potentially of interest to both device makers interested in developing wearable monitors, and to clinicians who will be using such monitors in the future. by Bryan Haslam.

40|$|Elevated calf {{compliance}} {{may contribute}} to orthostatic intolerance following space flight and bed rest. Calf venous compliance is measured conventionally with venous occlusion plethysmography in supine subjects. With this well-established technique, subjects undergo inflation of a pressure cuff around the thigh just above the knee, which increases calf venous <b>pressure.</b> A <b>plethysmograph</b> simultaneously measures calf volume elevation. Compliance equals calf volume elevation per mm Hg thigh occlusion (calf venous) pressure in relaxed legs of the supine subjects. Compliance may also be measured during stepwise head-up tilt (HUT) as calf volume elevation per mm Hg gravitational venous pressure elevation produced by HUT. However, during HUT on a tilt table with a footplate, calf muscles activate to counteract gravity: this is an obvious and natural response to gravitational force. Such muscle activation conceivably could reduce calf compliance, yet relatively little calf muscle activation occurs during HUT and orthostasis (less than 10 % of maximal voluntary levels; 4, 8, 10). Also, this activation produces minimal calf volume change (less than 0. 3 %; 3). Therefore, we hypothesized that calf compliance measured with HUT equals that measured with supine venous occlusion...|$|R

We hypothesized that the chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) component of OSA is sufficient to lead to these adverse effects. Methods and Results: Rats were exposed to CIH (nadir O 2 4 - 5 %), 8 H per day, 5 days/ week for 5 weeks. Results were compared with similarly handled controls (HC). Outcomes included blood <b>pressure</b> (tail cuff <b>plethysmograph),</b> echocardiographic and invasive measures of left ventricular (LV) function, and indices of oxidative stress that included levels of myocardial lipid peroxides and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). Blood pressure was greater in CIH (N= 22) than with HC (N= 22) after 2 weeks of exposure (136 + 12 vs 128 + 8 mm Hg; P<. 05). However, the difference disappeared by 5 weeks (127 + 13 vs 127 + 13 mm Hg). LV weight/heart weight was greater with CIH (CIH...|$|R
40|$|The {{instantaneous}} uptake of CO in {{the lungs}} was measured with a water-filled body plethysmograph in normal man. First, control measurements of <b>plethysmograph</b> <b>pressure</b> were made while the subject held his breath for 7 sec after breathing gas mixtures prepared to bring his alveolar PO 2 and PCO 2 close to mixed venous levels. Then, CO uptake measurements were made while he held his breath after inhaling the same gas mixtures with added CO (2. 0 %). The change in lung volume on CO minus the change in lung volume during the control measurement was {{a measure of the}} CO uptake {{in the lungs}}. Cardiopneumatic changes in lung gas volume were subtracted electrically. All of five subjects showed pulsatile CO uptake. The mean CO uptake was 103 ml/min. A peak uptake of 2. 0 (range 1. 6 - 2. 3) times the mean uptake occurred 0. 3 - 0. 4 sec after the R wave of the EKG and a minimum uptake of 0. 4 (range 0. 2 - 0. 5) times the mean uptake occurred during the tenth of a second before the R wave of the EKG. These results suggest that pulmonary capillary blood volume is pulsatile during the cardiac cycle...|$|R
