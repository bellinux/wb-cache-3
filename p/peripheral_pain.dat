[...] But given that sexual dimorphism in the closest relatives of humans is much greater than among humans, the human clade must be considered to be characterized by decreasing sexual dimorphism, probably due to less competitive mating patterns. One proposed explanation is that human sexuality has developed more in common with its close relative the bonobo, which exhibits similar sexual dimorphism, is polygynandrous and uses recreational sex to reinforce social bonds and reduce aggression.|$|E

Our aim was to assess the feasibility of treatment with high-concentration-capsaicin-patches in clinical practice in a variety of refractory <b>peripheral</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> syndromes in non-diabetic patients. Methods: Observational, prospective, single-center study of patients attended to in the Pain Unit of a tertiary hospital, ≥ 18 year-old non-responders to multimodal analgesia of both genders. The feasibility for the application of capsaicin patch in clinical practice was evaluated by means of the number of patients controlled per day when this one was applied and by means of the times used for patch application. Results: Between October 2010 and September 2011, 20 consecutive non-diabetic patients (7 males, 13 females) with different diagnoses of refractory <b>peripheral</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> syndromes, with a median (range) age of 60 (33 – 88) years-old were treated with a single patch application.

Perception of electrical pain stimulation was measured in 20 migraine subjects outside a migraine attack (10 migraine with aura and 10 migraine without aura) and in 20 healthy subjects. We recorded sensory and pain thresholds, pain ratings after suprathreshold stimulation, and pain rating after two trains of repetitive stimulation (i. e., pain facilitation). Migraine subjects showed a signif-icantly higher pain rating after suprathreshold stimulation in the trigeminal region as compared to healthy subjects (4. 8 ± 1. 6 versus 3. 8 ± 2. 2, p 0. 04 after Bonferroni correction) {{but not in the}} peripheral region. Furthermore, migraine subjects showed a pain facilitation after repetitive trigeminal stimulation whereas healthy subjects showed a pain habituation. We observed no significant differences between migraine subjects and healthy subjects for all parameters in the peripheral stimulation. Migraine patients with and without aura did not differ in any parameter. All subjects showed decreased sensory and pain thresholds after trigeminal as compared to peripheral stimulation.

40|$|Abstract Background Fabry {{disease is}} an {{inherited}} metabolic disorder characterized by progressive lysosomal accumulation of lipids {{in a variety}} of cell types, including neural cells. Small, unmyelinated nerve fibers are particularly affected and small fiber peripheral neuropathy often clinically manifests at young age. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>pain</b> can be chronic and/or occur as provoked attacks of excruciating pain. Manifestations of dysfunction of small autonomic fibers may include, among others, impaired sweating, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and abnormal pain perception. Patients with Fabry disease often remain undiagnosed until severe complications involving the kidney, heart, peripheral nerves and/or brain have arisen. Methods An international expert panel convened with the goal to provide guidance to clinicians who may encounter unrecognized patients with Fabry disease on how to diagnose these patients early using simple diagnostic tests. A further aim was to offer recommendations to control neuropathic pain. Results We describe the neuropathy in Fabry disease, focusing on peripheral small fiber dysfunction - the hallmark of early neurologic involvement in this disorder. The clinical course of <b>peripheral</b> <b>pain</b> is summarized, and the importance of medical history-taking, including family history, is highlighted. A thorough physical examination (e. g., angiokeratoma, corneal opacities) and simple non-invasive sensory perception tests could provide clues to the diagnosis of Fabry disease. Reported early clinical benefits of enzyme replacement therapy include reduction of neuropathic pain, and adequate management of residual pain to a tolerable and functional level can substantially {{improve the quality of life}} for patients. Conclusions Our recommendations can assist in diagnosing Fabry small fiber neuropathy early, and offer clinicians guidance in controlling <b>peripheral</b> <b>pain.</b> This is particularly important since management of pain in young patients with Fabry disease appears to be inadequate. </p...|$|E

The health related {{quality of life of}} 126 patients with <b>peripheral</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> was studied, to provide a cross sectional description from this point of view. Two generic health-related quality of life instruments; the SF- 36 and the Nottingham Health Profile were used together with pain assessments, global rating of health and verbal rating scales of pain and other symptoms, as well as patient descriptors. The analgesic effect of ketamine, lidocaine and morphine were assessed in a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study design. Three groups of patients were studied: patients with <b>peripheral</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> of traumatic origin, patients with central post-stroke pain and patients with neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury. Somatosensory function was examined to see if this could predict response to treatment and to investigate if the drugs caused changes in thermal or mechanical sensibility.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of 5 % lidocaine-medicated plaster as add-on therapy in patients with chronic <b>peripheral</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> conditions, including CRPS. Patients and methods: This was a single-center, prospective, observational study set in a specialized pain unit of a tertiary hospital in Spain. A total of 56 patients with long-standing <b>peripheral</b> neuropathic <b>pain,</b> ten of them with CRPS, received 5 % lidocaine-medicated plaster as add-on analgesic therapy for 6  months. Results: After 6  months of treatment, a ≥ 50 % reduction in pain intensity was attained by 75 % of patients, as measured by numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain. The average NRS score was reduced by 61 % (4. 7 points), from a baseline mean score of 7. 8 to an end point mean score of 3. 1. Marked improvements were also observed in the CRPS group: six out of ten patients achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in NRS score, and the average NRS score for patients with CRPS was reduced by 51 % (4. 0 points), from a baseline mean score of 7. 9 to an end point mean score of 3. 9.
