500|$|Critics {{were divided}} with the {{character}} development and the storylines in Tron: Legacy. Writing for The New Yorker, Bruce Jones commented that the audience didn't connect {{with the character}}s, as they were lacking emotion and substance. [...] "Disney may {{be looking for a}} merchandising bonanza with this long-gestating sequel to the groundbreaking 1982 film," [...] remarked Jones, [...] "but someone in the corporate offices forgot to add any human interest to its action-heavy script." [...] Likewise, USA Today journalist Claudia Puig found Tron: Legacy to resonate with [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "unimaginative, even obfuscating" [...] dialogue, and that [...] "most of the story just doesn't scan". As Dana Stevens from Slate summed up, [...] "Tron: Legacy is the kind of sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sleep, the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli. I confess I may have snoozed through one or two climactic battles only to be startled awake by an incoming neon Frisbee." [...] Although he proclaimed the plot of Tron: Legacy and its predecessor to be spotty, Ian Buckwater of NPR was lenient of the latter film due to its youth-friendly nature. In contrast to negative responses, Michelle Alexander of Eclipse adored the plot of Tron: Legacy, a reaction that was paralleled by Rossiter Drake from 7x7, who wrote that it was [...] "buoyed" [...] by its [...] "sometimes convoluted, yet hard to resist" [...] story. Metros Larushka Ivan-Zadeh complained about the underdeveloped plot, saying [...] "In 2010, issues surrounding the immersive nature of gaming and all-consuming power of modern technology are more pertinent than ever, so it's frustrating the script does nothing with them." [...] However, she conceded that [...] "it's the best 3D flick since Avatar and a super-groovy soundtrack by Daft Punk nonetheless makes for an awesome watch".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Amyas! {{every word}} of yours <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> fresh shame! Will you believe that I know as little of her likings as you do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, there," [...] cried Mr Crimble, tilting {{back his}} chair in sudden enthusiasm. [...] "Miss M. {{positively}} <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> shame. And poetry, Miss Bullace; even your wonderful repertory!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend wayfarer," [...] {{replied the}} hermit, [...] "be not importunate; if thou <b>puttest</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, {{it will be}} e'en the worse for you." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the blush {{to think}} that I should be tempted by a worldly reason, and I rose immediately.|$|E
6000|$|In solitary, in Cell One, Warden Atherton and Captain Jamie {{proceeded}} to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the inquisition. As Warden Atherton said to me: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Sire, I did but my duty; {{a soldier}} has but his orders. I didn't expect after forty-seven years of {{faithful}} service that my sovereign {{would think of}} <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a felon's death!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I were a buck, {{you would}} not break mine, I warrant, unless it were tit for tat," [...] said my grandfather; thereby <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> more {{confusion}} than Dolly, who laughed with the rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] quoth he, [...] "I have wronged {{you very}} deeply. And this generous rescue {{of one who}} has so little merited your aid truly <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> so much shame that I know not what thanks to offer you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yea,' said James, 'that is mine own, {{though my}} body be yours, and till England <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ransom {{you would have}} but a useless captive.' ...|$|E

60|$|Then it {{was that}} Harvey <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> shame by {{much the same as}} proving I had not head enough to hold command of the Minute Boys.|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly, my friend, it is," [...] {{replied the}} young man, [...] "and your remark <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> shame. For many a time, through the {{microscope}} {{and the human}} frame and the surrounding world, might I have seen this Master-hand everywhere--if my eyes had been open." ...|$|R
60|$|MAGGIE. Is this Lamb's Hotel? <b>Put</b> <b>me</b> on <b>to</b> the Comtesse de la Briere, please.|$|R
6000|$|... "Myeerah, I am taken again. This {{time there}} has been blood shed. The Delaware chief was killed, and I {{do not know how}} many more Indians. The chiefs are all for <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> death. I am in great danger. Why could you not leave me in peace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Zack, {{acknowledging}} the pudding suggestion, but declining to profit by it. [...] "And, please, when I've had my dinner, will somebody <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> bed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] says William, [...] "thou hast <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> silence, and all I {{had to say}} is overthrown; all my {{projects}} are come to nothing, and gone." ...|$|E

60|$|After all, he {{had written}} to {{announce}} his coming. But he had not calculated on our never getting our letters unless we sent for them. He was the very pink of politeness <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and mourned so much over <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> inconvenience that we could only profess our delight and desire to make him comfortable.|$|R
50|$|Irwin {{is a very}} devoted {{country music}} fan. In her own words, on her public website, she states:I live for country music. If it didn't exist, a huge piece of {{my life would be}} missing.

60|$|Then, my father, I grew cold indeed--yes, I grew cold who soon {{should be}} hot, for I saw {{the purpose of}} Chaka. He would <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the trial by fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{entering}} {{the house of}} the prisoner to arrest him, in obedience to your worshipful commands, when the prisoner lifted a gun and fired at me.
