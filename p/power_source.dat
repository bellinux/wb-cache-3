5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no <b>power</b> <b>source</b> available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} uses a constant current <b>power</b> <b>source,</b> {{meaning that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage <b>power</b> <b>source</b> is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.|$|E
5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} <b>power</b> <b>source</b> instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. This would decrease communication distances that would be important for computer-based societies as those described above.|$|E
30|$|Grid {{connection}} of large-scale intermittent <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> {{is an important}} method for power system restructuring in China. Energy storage systems effectively suppress the fluctuation of intermittent <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> and are therefore an important method to promote the greater use of large-scale intermittent <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 28 March 1961 {{the light}} was electrified, with mains {{electricity}} as the <b>power</b> <b>source,</b> and an intensity of 1,000,000cd. The drive was replaced with a 0.3 amp electric motor. At {{the same time the}} staff was cut from three lightkeepers to two.|$|E
5|$|The Power Delivery Specification defines six fixed power {{profiles}} for {{the power}} sources. PD-aware devices implement a flexible power management scheme by interfacing with the <b>power</b> <b>source</b> through a bidirectional data channel and requesting {{a certain level of}} electrical power, variable up to 5A and 20V depending on supported profile. The power configuration protocol uses a 24MHz BFSK-coded transmission channel on the VBUS line.|$|E
5|$|The twin Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} in 1977, each containing a 500 watt plutonium <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> Over 30 years later, each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft.

5000|$|Occasionally {{ordinary}} <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> {{are referred}} to as [...] "negative resistances" [...] (fig. 3 above). Although the [...] "static" [...] or [...] "absolute" [...] resistance [...] of active devices (<b>power</b> <b>sources)</b> can be considered negative (see Negative static resistance section below) most ordinary <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> (AC or DC), such as batteries, generators, and (non positive feedback) amplifiers, have positive differential resistance (their source resistance). Therefore, these devices cannot function as one-port amplifiers or have the other capabilities of negative differential resistances.|$|R
5|$|Thorium {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a nuclear <b>power</b> <b>source</b> and a possible replacement to the currently used uranium and plutonium.

5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current <b>power</b> <b>source</b> is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} electricity for local homes. The building of a power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available <b>power</b> <b>source</b> and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{article is}} devoted to {{optimization}} of the reactive <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> arrangement in the industrial power grid to reduce the active power losses in transmission lines and select cross-sections of cable of the lines. To reduce the losses installing of additional reactive <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> in junctions of the grid are proposed. Thus, a problem of the optimal arrangement of the reactive <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> is appeared. This problem was solved by two stochastic optimization algorithms such as the Genetic and the Particle Swarm optimization algorithms. The cost-effectiveness of the suggested method is shown...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with power inverters for alternate high voltage <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> The theoretical part describes the topology of inverters {{that can be used}} in alternate <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> A model of voltage transformer is described in details to better understand the parasitic effects that are inevitably present in high voltage <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> and, therefore, have to be taken into consideration at the design of high voltage <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> The work is oriented to problems of alternate high voltage <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> for ozone generators. This is the reason, why the theoretical and, partially, also the experimental part deal with the properties of ozone and its use. The experimental part solves high voltage inverter with capacitive load that is formed by discharge element of an ozone generator. Designed inverter is able to feed the capacitive load with high voltage at very short periods of time from several microseconds up to tens of nanoseconds. In comparison with the length of voltage pulses in common ozone generators, this pulses are more than 100 -time shorter. This has a positive effect to silent discharge characteristics...|$|R
5|$|In human civilization, {{wind has}} {{inspired}} mythology, influenced {{the events of}} history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a <b>power</b> <b>source</b> for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.|$|E
