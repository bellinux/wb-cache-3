The development of chiral anionic catalysists is a more recent research field. In 2000 Llewellyn, Adamson & Arndtsen used a chiral borate anion in olefin aziridination and cyclopropanation. Another regularly encountered scaffold is a chiral phosphate anion together with iminium, carbocationic or oxocarbenium counterions. Chiral anion phase-transfer catalysis was introduced by Toste in 2007.|$|R

The overall objectives are to synthesize the aromatic thioether like bis(4 -chlorobenzyl) sulfide using hydrogen sulfide rich aqueous MDEA solution and 4 -chlorobenzyl chloride (CBC). 4 -chlorobenzyl mercaptan (CBM) was identified from the reaction mixture as a secondary product.

The silane-based copolymer is synthesized by radical polymerization to incorporate polar groups, through phenylmaleimides, and alkoxysilane groups. By way of the alkoxysilane groups, the copolymer can be attached on to silica particles or converted to polymer-silica composite particles using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a sol-gel precursor. Through characterizations in this work, they proved to be stable in high temperatures (400 °C) as well as effective in high water mobile phases. Phenyl moieties of the material provide increased and sometimes excessive retention of analytes with pi-systems occurred {{in many of the}} separations. By manipulating the functional groups add to the maleimide, chemical selectivity can be controlled by the difference in polarity. With the halogen-modified maleimides, peak shape was improved in the basic solutes in the reduction of band fronting and tailing.

Results lead to the conclusion that these polar-embedded stationary phases would be of good use in subcritical water chromatography. ...|$|R

Five to sixteen (median =  12) multilead electrodes were implanted per patient, and, for each patient, a sub-set of between 10 and 32 (median =  22) bipolar derivations was selected for analysis. The leads were classified into the onset leads (OLs), the early propagation leads (EPLs), {{and the rest of the}} leads (RLs).

40|$|The {{development}} of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) {{has been one}} of the hottest areas in the pharmaceutical industry. In this work, submicrometer nonporous particles were used to prepare stationary phases for reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), ion exchange chromatography (IEX) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), targeting at different problems in mAbs characterization. ^ IgG 2 suffers from disulfide scrambling and RPLC is the standard method for disulfide isoforms characterization. Four overlapping peaks are resolved by a standard commercial column, and the chromatograms change with sample concentration. A shallower gradient improves resolution, but the chromatograms are still concentration dependent. A new method is introduced to further improve resolution. The sample is injected at isocratic condition followed by a shallow gradient. Since pre-concentrating sample at the head of the column is avoided, the new method not only greatly improves resolution, but also alleviates nonlinearity of the chromatography, which means the chromatograms at different concentrations are more consistent. The resolution can be further improved by using submicrometer nonporous particles. Compared to the standard commercial column, the 0. 69 μm particles based column exhibits improved resolution and sensitivity. Using the isocratic-gradient elution method, our lab-made RPLC column can resolve different subvariants of IgG 2 disulfide isoforms, which is the first time that these subvariants are separated in chromatography. ^ Charge heterogeneity is very common in mAbs and IEX is most widely used for charge variants separations. A <b>polymer</b> <b>based</b> stationary <b>phase</b> has been developed for anion exchange chromatography. Monomers carrying tertiary amines, together with acrylamide, are grafted to silica surface by polymerization. Compared to a leading commercial ion exchange column, the polymeric stationary phase gives sharper peaks and better resolution. Following a similar procedure, A HILIC stationary phase has been prepared for mAbs glycosylation analysis. In the HILIC stationary, only acrylamide is used as the monomer for polymerization, and the chain length is much longer in order to form a thick polymer layer. Since the N-glycosylation site is on the Fc fragment, mAbs are digested with enzyme to generate fragments. The highly efficient HILIC stationary phase not only separates out non-glycosylated Fc fragments, but also resolves the different glycoforms of Fc fragments. ...|$|R
