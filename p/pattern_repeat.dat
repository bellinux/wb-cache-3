30|$|The great {{progress}} {{of information technology}} makes the real data grow rapidly. Actually, {{there is a large}} amount of knowledge in these data such as graph data, sequence data, transaction data, and so on. Therefore, data mining on pattern discovery has been studied for many decades. To discover the valuable patterns hidden in the real data, a number of mining algorithms are proposed nowadays. In recent studies, the patterns are categorized into several categories, including association patterns, sequential <b>patterns,</b> cyclic <b>patterns,</b> <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns,</b> and so on. Different patterns are useful to different fields of data engineering. For association patterns, they are motivated by applications of market basket analysis to discover relations between products purchased. For sequential patterns, they are somewhat different from the association patterns, because the sequential patterns are with temporal continuities. For cyclic patterns, the starting pattern is also the ending pattern in a sequence, which can be viewed as the extension of sequential <b>patterns.</b> For <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns,</b> a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> contains a set of sequential elements, which can also be viewed as a sequence repeats in a regular form. For example, a string { 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2 } contains a repeating substring { 1, 2 }, which is identified as a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern.</b> The major difference between the cyclic <b>patterns</b> and <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> is that a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> does not need to consider the start and end of a sequence must be the same. In fact, <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> are popular, because they can be regarded as a set of representative patterns facilitating object recognition. Lots of <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> appear in our life, such as musical data and medical data.|$|R

40|$|International audienceRepetition is a {{fundamental}} element in generating and perceiving structure in audio. Especially in music, structures tend to be composed of <b>patterns</b> that <b>repeat</b> through time (e. g., rhythmic elements in a musical accompaniment), and also frequency (e. g., different notes of the same instrument). The auditory system has the remarkable ability to parse such patterns by identifying repetitions within the audio mixture. On this basis, we propose a simple user interface system for recovering <b>patterns</b> <b>repeating</b> in time and frequency in mixtures of sounds. A user selects a region in the log-frequency spectrogram of an audio recording from which she/he wishes to recover a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> masked by an undesired element (e. g., a note masked by a cough). The selected region is then cross-correlated with the spectrogram to identify similar regions where the underlying <b>pattern</b> <b>repeats.</b> The identified regions are finally averaged over their repetitions and the <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> is recovered...|$|R

40|$|A biophysical {{model is}} {{proposed}} for how leaf primordia are positioned on the shoot apical meristem in both spiral and whorl phyllotaxes. Primordia are initiated by signals that propagate in the epidermis in both azimuthal directions {{away from the}} cotyledons or the most recently specified primordia. The signals are linear waves as inferred from the spatial periodicity of the divergence angle and a temporal periodicity. The periods of the waves, which represent actively transported auxin, are {{much smaller than the}} plastochron interval. Where oppositely directed waves meet at one or more angular positions {{on the periphery of the}} generative circle, auxin concentration builds and as in most models this stimulates local movement of auxin to underlying cells, where it promotes polarized cell division and expansion. For higher order spirals the wave model requires asymmetric function of auxin transport; that is, opposite wave speeds differ. An algorithm for determination of the angular positions of leaves in common leaf phyllotaxic configurations is proposed. The number of turns in a <b>pattern</b> <b>repeat,</b> number of leaves per level and per <b>pattern</b> <b>repeat,</b> and divergence angle are related to speed of auxin transport and radius of the generative circle. The rule for composition of Fibonacci or Lucas numbers associated with some phyllotaxes is discussed. A subcellular model suggests how the shoot meristem might specify either symmetric or asymmetric transport of auxin away from the forming primordia that produce it. Biological tests that could make or break the mathematical and molecular hypotheses are proposed...|$|E

Participants also noted that the use of computer programs provided a more accurate representation (as compared to a hand drawing) of how the pattern would look when printed on fabric and allowed designers to easily view patterns in a variety of colorways prior to textile sample manufacturing. Almost all participants utilized technological tools and services during the design process, including the computer software Photoshop for pattern rending and Pantone, the color trend forecasting service for color selection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{selective}} encoding method that reduces test data volume and test application time for scan testing of Intellectual Property (IP) cores. This method encodes the slices of test {{data that are}} fed to the scan chains in every clock cycle. To drive scan chains, we use only tester channels, where = log 2 (+ 1) + 2. In the best case, we can achieve compression {{by a factor of}} using only one tester clock cycle per slice. We derive a sufficient condition on the distribution of care bits that allows us to achieve the best-case compression. We also derive a probabilistic lower bound on the compression for a given care-bit density. Unlike popular compression methods such as Embedded Deterministic Test (EDT), the proposed approach is suitable for IP cores because it does not require structural information for fault simulation, dynamic compaction, or interleaved test generation. The on-chip decoder is small, independent of the circuit under test and the test set, and it can be shared between different circuits. We present compression results for a number of industrial circuits and compare our results to other recent compression methods targeted at IP cores.

40|$|This practice-led textile {{research}} project explores notions of tropical paradise {{from the perspective}} of a European imagination. It critiques colonial myths of tropical paradise that have been perpetuated through visual art including textile design and wallpaper. The design practice is informed by a review of french scenic wallcoverings, tropical prints in popular culture and the paintings of Henri Rousseau and Paul Gauguin and a visual analysis of how colour, <b>pattern</b> <b>repeat,</b> motif, symbolism and embroidery work together to construct an idealised notion of the tropics. The design responses liken colonialism to domestication and extends the same sense of control, domination, structure and regularity to historic textile design, effectively placing traditional processes and practices in textile pattern composition under review. In the creative works, paradise has not been rejected, but instead, it has been inhabited, explored, embellished and highlighted in order to captivate nostalgia and critique prevailing myths fostered by nineteenth century colonial paradigms of paradise. The three design works employ digital embroidery and digital textile print to re-present three selected myths: Arcadia which explores the expectation of tropical abundance informed by a story from James Cook’s voyages, Living in a Fool’s Paradise reframes the palm tree emblem in a bid to purge colonial nostalgia and Embellished Phantasmagoria re-visions the fecundity of the tropical environment.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> {{represent}} temporal {{relations among}} data items, {{which could be}} used for data summarization and data prediction. More and more data of various applications is generated as a data stream. Based on time sensitive concern, mining <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> from the whole history data sequence of a data stream does not extract the current trend of patterns in the stream. Therefore, the traditional strategies for mining <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> on static database are not applicable to data streams. For this reason, an algorithm, named appearing-bit-sequence-based incremental mining algorithm, for efficiently discovering recently <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> from a data stream is proposed in this paper. The appearing bit sequences are used to monitor the occurrences of patterns within a sliding window. Two versions of algorithms are proposed by maintaining the appearing bit sequences of maximum <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> and closed <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns,</b> respectively. Accordingly, the cost of re-mining <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> over a sliding window is reduced to that of monitoring frequency changes of the maintained patterns. The experimental results show that the incremental mining methods perform much better than the re-miming approach...|$|R

The whole Scottish textile industry is under-researched and what little has been done fails to address in any depth the range of variables in the design process and manufacture and how these relate to the wider patterns of marketing and use.

40|$|The 2009 Naples Forum on Service {{was quite}} an {{experience}} for us. It overwhelmed us. It was a new concept, a desire to focus on certain themes which we experienced as the future for service research. But launching a new conference is a gamble. Our target was modest: 60 participants – {{and then we got}} 240 abstracts! What to do? The venue, Anacapri and the Villa Orlando on {{the very top of the}} Isle of Capri, could not handle that. The solution was a big tent in the garden and in that way we could take 150 people. Now that we run the 2011 Naples Forum – we decided to make it biennial – we see the <b>pattern</b> <b>repeat</b> itself. This makes us very happy and proud. But we remain in the same place. Its ambiance is magic; it has personality. The idea of the Naples Forum on Service was born in 2007 on a rainy November afternoon in Stockholm, Sweden. The discussion was about marketing theory and service management, and the need for new concepts, new grand theories, and new paradigms. Intriguing issues such as complexity, networks, viable service systems, and so on were addressed. Cultural and behavioral change of customers, globalization of systems and competition, information and communication technology with the Internet, web sales, social media and other changes – all require novel and more adequate theory. New approaches to service and marketing have been brewing for the past four decades challenging the 1960 s marketing management and marketing mix (which were once a challenge to microeconomic theory focused solely on price). The new approaches included service marketing and management, relationship marketing and CRM (Customer Relationship Management), and relational and network applications in B 2 B (business-to-business) marketing. But we were left with a fragmented and confusing view. Service research had been growing worldwide, but after a few decades of pioneering contributions we felt that it had reached a state of complacency. The focus was on the past with a backpack of intersubjectively approved but often doubtful assumptions. The disciplines of business and management had reached a turning point calling for more systemic and integrative theory with scholars who dare address real world complexity with adequate methodology. In the 2000 s service has become the unifying concept for a new way of perceiving not only business but also the role of governments. The new millennium began well by presenting new approaches: service-dominant (S-D) logic, service science, and the more general theories many-to-many marketing and the Viable Systems Approach (VSA) based on a systemic view and relationships, networks and interaction. These recognize the weaknesses of the mainstream service research and offer new conceptualization. They open up for complexity, context, interdependencies, and theory generation. Some of this was already there but it had been held back in the literature and at conferences. We now refer to the foundation of service theory as the 3 Pillars of Service. How we see them is further explained on our website: www. naplesforumonservice. it A wealth of recent literature is developing these themes (see Bibliography below). The 2009 Forum alone spawned 22 articles in journals‟ Special Issues and several book chapters, and many delegates submitted articles to publications of their own choice. We edited a special issue of The International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, (vol. 2, n. 1, 2010), a new Emerald journal, and the lead article “Transitioning from service management to service-dominant logic: Observations and recommendations”, by Gummesson, Lusch and Vargo (2010) received The Emerald Literati Network Highly Commended Award; moreover we edited a special issue of the journal Service Science (vol. 2, n. 1 / 2, 2010) titled “System Thinking for Service Research Advances” and a special issue of the journal Mercati & Competitività with an The 2009 Naples Forum on Service – Introduction, (vol. 1, 2010) ...|$|E
