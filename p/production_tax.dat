5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in Texan government resulted from the creation of a state oil <b>production</b> <b>tax</b> in 1905. The revenue generated by the tax made funds available for development in the state without the need for income taxes and similar revenue mechanisms adopted in other states. In 1919, tax revenue from oil production surpassed $1 million ($ in today's terms) and in 1929 it reached $6 million ($ in today's terms). By 1940, {{the oil and gas industry}} accounted for approximately half of all taxes paid in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This <b>production</b> <b>tax</b> is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on indirect tax reforms in pollution-ridden economies is quite limited. This paper, using a general {{model of a}} perfectly-competitive small open economy with both production and consumption generated pollution, considers the welfare implications of tax reforms that take the structure of consumption and <b>production</b> <b>taxes</b> toward uniformity. Specifically, both in the presence and absence of a binding government revenue constraint, we derive sufficient conditions for welfare improvement in the case where we implement (i) reforms in either <b>production</b> or consumption <b>taxes,</b> and (ii) reforms in both consumption and <b>production</b> <b>taxes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Netflix {{had ordered}} two seasons of 13 episodes when {{it made its}} {{original}} commitment to the series in 2011. According to Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley, production of the first season brought $140 million {{in the form of}} 2,200 jobs and transactions with 1,800 vendors to the Baltimore metropolitan area economy and the Maryland General Assembly expanded its Film <b>Production</b> <b>Tax</b> Credit so that season two could have similar impact over the course of 150 days of filming. Like the first season, the second season was largely filmed in the Baltimore area. Although production was publicized as being in Baltimore, Season 1 had based production in Harford County, Maryland, and season 2 also had its production office in Edgewood and a Joppa sound stage. The April 27, 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner spoofed House of Cards from the Maryland set prior {{to the beginning of the}} filming of season 2. Filming began on Monday April 29, 2013, which was just a few weeks later in the year than season 1 had started. On May 14, O'Malley visited the set to publicize the success of the tax incentives.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent <b>production</b> <b>tax</b> on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

A spatial price equilibrium model for two regions is constructed, where interactions between these regions can occur via trade, via mutual environmental spillovers {{as a result of}} the externality that arises from production, and via uncoordinated taxes when the regions do not behave cooperatively. The additional complications arising from emissions caused by the endogenous transport flows are also considered explicitly. We consider the performance of <b>production</b> <b>taxes,</b> consumption taxes, and the combination of these two, both with and without optimal policy coordination. ...|$|R

However, many of these projects have faced continued political opposition in spite of renewed arguments for the greenhouse gas benefits of incineration and improved air pollution control and ash recycling.|$|E
40|$|This paper compares {{emission}} taxes {{with other}} taxes {{from the viewpoint}} of emission reduction in an open economy. Using a simple monopoly model, we show that emission taxes may not be very effective to protect environment because of the spillover effects between markets stemming from non-constant marginal costs and transboundary externalities. Other <b>taxes</b> such as <b>production</b> <b>taxes</b> and tariffs are more effective under certain conditions. Thus, an easy application of emission taxes should be discreet in the open economy framework. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the major {{characteristics of the}} Brazilian tax system, after underlining the modifications it went through since 1988, when the country adopted a new and democratic Constitution. One important feature is the marked incidence of indirect consumer and <b>production</b> <b>taxes</b> (49 % of all tax revenues) in place of direct taxes on income, inheritance, and capital gains. This imbalance between indirect and direct taxes explains, in large part, the elevated regressivity of the Brazilian tax system, which both expresses and reproduces the profound inequalities that characterize Brazilian society...|$|R

This incentive, the renewable energy <b>Production</b> <b>Tax</b> Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type.|$|E

500|$|In the US, {{wind power}} {{receives}} a <b>production</b> <b>tax</b> credit (PTC) of 1.5¢/kWh in 1993 dollars for each kW·h produced, {{for the first}} ten years; at 2.2 cents per kW·h in 2012, the credit was renewed on 2 January 2012, to include construction begun in 2013. A 30% tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the PTC. Another tax benefit is accelerated depreciation. Many American states also provide incentives, such as exemption from property tax, mandated purchases, and additional markets for [...] "green credits". The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind, including microturbines. Countries such as Canada and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction, such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation, with assured grid access (sometimes referred to as feed-in tariffs). These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electric power prices. In December 2013 U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander and other Republican senators argued that the [...] "wind energy <b>production</b> <b>tax</b> credit {{should be allowed to}} expire at the end of 2013" [...] and it expired 1 January 2014 for new installations.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} {{produced}} by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Though still set in Boston, the show's production for the second season moved from New York City to Vancouver out of financial necessity, as it lost access to New York's TV <b>production</b> <b>tax</b> incentive program. Fringe consequently got a mostly new writing staff and production team, though co-creators J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, and Alex Kurtzman, and producer Bryan Burk remained involved with the series. Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman returned as executive producers and showrunners. Jeff Vlaming and previous episode director Akiva Goldsman joined the crew as consulting producers. While Abrams had six episode writing credits for the first season he remained much more hands-off for the second, instead focusing on other commitments like the film Star Trek. He explained, [...] "Sometimes we'll talk every day. Then {{there will be a}} period of a couple weeks where we don't speak. But we're emailing a lot. There's a lot of stuff that happens that way." [...] Eden FX and Zoic Studios stayed as vendors for the series' visual effects, effectively giving Fringe a sense of continuity. Jay Worth, the overall visual effects supervisor, commented that having these two companies [...] "helped the show not feel as a big of a bump from one season to the next, particularly with different crews and a different vibe a little bit." [...] Despite his decreased involvement, Abrams was sent all of the visual effects for the series during production, and responded back with notes and tweaks.|$|E
