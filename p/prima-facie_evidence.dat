5000|$|What are the facts? First, though Karajan was {{nominated}} {{for membership in the}} as yet unbanned Party in Salzburg in April 1933, he did not collect his card, sign it, or pay his dues, though the registration itself (no. 1607525) got onto the files and crops up in many memoranda and enquiries thereafter. Secondly, he did not join the Party on 1 May 1933 despite <b>prima-facie</b> <b>evidence</b> to the contrary. In the first place, the membership number 3430914 is too high to belong to that date. The highest number issued before the freeze on membership, which lasted from May 1933 to March 1937, was 3262698. However, during the freeze, various functionaries, diplomats, and others were issued cards bearing an NG, or Nachgereichte, designation. These cards were, by convention, backdated {{to the start of the}} freeze: 1 May 1933. Karajan's Aachen membership was an NG card, and its number accords with batches issued in 1935, the year Karajan had always identified as the one in which he was asked to join the Party.|$|E
5000|$|Ponnapula Sanjeeva Prasad (P. S. Prasad) is an Indian-born businessman. His {{relatives}} and business partners {{are associated with}} the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). In the years prior to BCCI's collapse, he was the owner of Keystone Financial Corporation and P. S. Investments, as well as an investment partner of Bert Lance and Ghaith Pharaon. He stood guarantee for largest borrower of BCCI, {{at the time of its}} collapse, with some $30 million in outstanding loans. Prasad has left the U.S. shortly after BCCI's meltdown; since that time very little information about his whereabouts has been published in the English-language media. The New York Times reported in the July 9, 1993 edition that the Manhattan District Attorney had indicted him as co-accused, and the outstanding warrant for his trail has never been satisfied as there was no <b>prima-facie</b> <b>evidence</b> submitted by the United States to Govt of India. Efforts by the cousin of P.S.Prasad, with whom he had some business disputes, to obtain a copy under the Right to Information Act of the plaint (sic) filed by the Embassy of the United States of America before the courts in New Delhi, who passed an order in this case in 2002, were also unsuccessful. Satyendra Mishra, Chief Information Commissioner dismissed Rao’s request and directed him to go to the concerned court to obtain a copy. The attorney representing P.S.Prasad has stated that [...] "lot of land grabbers who have failed all legal remedies available to them have resorted to bring these unconnected that too decades old issues to silence him so that, they can continue to occupy illegally by maligning his reputation, and he is taking required legal steps including defamation suits against these people. He has also requested people to give information on the persons who are indulging in these unethical activities".|$|E

40|$|Discrimination {{discovery}} {{from data}} consists of designing data mining methods {{for the actual}} discovery of discriminatory situations and practices hidden in {{a large amount of}} historical decision records. Approaches based on classification rule mining consider items at a flat concept level, with no exploitation of background knowledge on the hierarchical and inter-relational structure of domains. On the other hand, ontologies are a widespread and ever increasing means for expressing such a knowledge. In this paper, we propose a framework for discrimination discovery from ontologies, where contexts of <b>prima-facie</b> <b>evidence</b> of discrimination are summarized in the form of generalized classification rules at different levels of abstraction. Throughout the paper, we adopt a motivating and intriguing case study based on discriminatory tariffs applied by the U. S. Harmonized Tariff Schedules on imported goods...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which {{discrimination}} against foreign applicants in the trademark registration process {{can be used as a}} "behind-the-border" barrier to imports. <b>Prima-facie</b> <b>evidence</b> shows that in some developing countries the ratio of trademark registrations to applications is much higher for national than for foreign applicants, which is consistent with the notion of discrimination against foreign firms. A simple model is developed that suggests that incentives to discriminate are stronger when foreign firms manufacture products that are close in quality to the goods produced by domestic firms. This hypothesis is then tested and empirically confirmed in three of the four countries in our sample, suggesting that discretion and discrimination in the trademark registration process can sometimes be used as a protectionist tool.

40|$|The {{nature of}} ice-margin {{conditions}} is a durable problem in paleoecology. In a recent contribution Goldthwait (1958) and Burns (1958) provide a valuable stratigraphic account of wood from Wisconsin and post-Wisconsin age deposits in Ohio. From glacial till they report abundant records of spruce logs, less often of larch and white cedar, that indicate relatively short distance of transport by the Wisconsin glacier near its margin. Seventeen radiocarbon dates of this wood from 27, 500 to 16, 560 years ago bracket the last Wisconsin glacial maximum. Goldthwait (p. 213) concludes that, locally, the ice sheet pushed into extensive patches of living forest climatologically akin {{to those of}} north central Ontario. Burns (p. 223) interprets this as a relatively narrow band of coniferous forest, mainly spruce. To support {{the concept of a}} narrow coniferous zone, he cites Braun's postulate of deciduous forest fifty miles south of the drift border (Braun, 1951). The query raised by my title now emerges.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the regulatory sanctions imposed on independent directors for their firms’ financial frauds in China. These regulatory sanctions are <b>prima-facie</b> <b>evidence</b> of significant lapses in business ethics. During the period 2003 – 2010, 302 -person-time independent directors were penalized by the regulator (the China Securities Regulatory Commission—the CSRC), {{and the two}} stock exchanges. We find that the independent directors with accounting experiences {{are more likely to}} be penalized by the CSRC, though they do not suffer more severe penalties than do the other sanctioned independent directors. We also find that independent directors suffer less severe penalties than do the insider directors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the sanctions on independent directors are tied to their assumed ethical and legal responsibilities. Following a regulatory sanction, penalized independent directors experience a significant decline in the number of other board seats held. However, they can gain board seats in better quality firms. We find that interlocked firms that share penalized independent directors with the fraud firm do not suffer from a valuation decline. Overall, our results suggest that regulatory sanctions have not triggered further sanctions on the penalized directors in the labor market but they have, instead, created a disincentive for these directors to serve on the company boards of high-risk firms...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{looks into}} the {{intersection}} between technical standard development activities and patenting activities {{from the perspective of}} patent prosecution. Specifically, attention is paid to the tendency that the obtainment of patents related to technical standards is often done through the utilization of the systems allowing patent applicants to file new applications (collectively called continuing applications under the US patent system) enjoying the benefit of the filing dates of earlier-filed patent applications. After presenting some empirical evidence to show the tendency (in other words, the relevance of the continuing application system to patenting technical standards), this paper focuses upon the written description requirement as an important factor affecting the patentability of such continuing applications. In this paper, I make concrete proposals for the enhancement of the capacity of the written description requirement to suppress the abusive use of the continuing application system to cover technical standards as well as competitors' products and processes, without prejudice to innovative inventors' opportunities to mine their original disclosure in patent specifications for the exclusive rights they deserve. These proposals of mine include the reduction of burden of proof, to the patent challenger's side, of incompliance of a claim in a continuing application with the written description requirement, when certain conditions are met, and some examples of ways to achieve such reduction of burden of proof. This paper also presents comparative review of the continuing application systems under the European and Japanese patent systems as well as the US patent system. Based upon the review, relevant international harmonization considerations are discussed as well. patent, prosecution, technical standards, continuing application, continuation, division, CIP, priority right, earlier filing date, written description requirement, support, implicit and inherent disclosure, burden of proof, burden of production, <b>prima-facie</b> <b>evidence,</b> functional claim, omission of an element, international harmonization...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master’s thesis was to {{evaluate}} {{the hypothesis that the}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs for Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4 A, TIF 1 and TIF 2, can be individually regulated. This may be an expectation if the retention of the TIF 1 and TIF 2 duplicates arises from the requirement to respond {{to a wide variety of}} cellular needs in S. cerevisiae. These paralogs show an almost identical sequence in their coding region (barring six synonymous changes in the gene sequence) but are substantially different in their 5 ’ and 3 ’ untranslated regions that are the probable sites of regulatory functions. To identify differences in use of the TIF 1 and TIF 2 paralogs, a dual fluorescent reporter strain expressing plasmid borne TIF 1 -RFP, incorporating the endogenous TIF 1 3 ’ and 5 ’ untranslated regions, and chromosomally integrated TIF 2 -GFP was created in order to probe for any differential regulation between TIF 1 and TIF 2. To create the fluorescent reporters it was necessary to learn and execute sophisticated molecular biology and molecular genetics which are described in this thesis. The generated fluorescence reporter strains were shown to be stable over multiple generations and subjected to high throughput and high content automated confocal microscopy. The commercially available LOPAC 1280 Library of Pharmacologically-Active Compounds was used to probe for differential regulation where a “hit” was defined as a significant change in the expression of at least one of TIF 1 -RFP or TIF 2 -GFP four hours after application. For TIF 2 p-GFP, 2 compounds out of the 1280 library showed evidence of regulation under stringent thresholding criteria. For TIF 1 -RFP, 43 compounds were identified as regulators. There was no overlap of compounds. This screen provides <b>prima-facie</b> <b>evidence</b> that the TIF 1 and TIF 2 are differentially regulated, as assessed by the criteria of the experimental system described in this thesis...|$|E
