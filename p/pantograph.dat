5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages {{at each end of}} the train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it is equipped with a <b>pantograph</b> and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a <b>pantograph</b> on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} scan inspection, the <b>pantograph</b> elevates the 3D scanner at the fuselage. A pan-tilt unit moves the scan device to acquire the hull. By comparing the data acquired to the three-dimensional model of the aircraft, algorithms are able to diagnose any faults in the fuselage structure and provide information on their shape, size and depth.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{corporate identity}} across the Metrolink system uses a pale yellow and metallic silver colour scheme, with a logotype {{that consists of}} a diamond motif formed from a pattern of repeating circles and the Metrolink name. The logo, signage and publicity use the <b>Pantograph</b> sans regular typeface. Tram livery features yellow at the vehicle ends with grey sides and black doors, and a pattern of circles.|$|E
5000|$|Single-arm <b>pantographs</b> {{in place}} of {{original}} lozenge <b>pantographs</b> ...|$|R
50|$|From 2005, the {{original}} scissors-type <b>pantographs</b> were replaced with single-arm <b>pantographs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M1 car is {{fitted with}} two single-arm <b>pantographs</b> (originally lozenge-type <b>pantographs).</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to altered dates, electrotypes of the 1804 dollar were created, {{both for the}} purposes of study and fraud. One such coin {{in the collection of the}} San Francisco Mint was described by them as genuine from 1887 to 1927. Electrotypes were also created by Mint employees, and one was used as the basis for the <b>pantograph</b> reproductions which appeared in Eckfeldt and DuBois' 1842 A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{electromagnetism}} are most visibly {{employed in the}} electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a <b>pantograph.</b>|$|E
5|$|These revivals {{could be}} made using <b>pantograph</b> machine {{engraving}} systems, which gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved, and allowed rapid development of a family in a large range of sizes. In addition, the new hot metal typesetting technology of the period created increasing availability and demand for new fonts. Among hot metal typesetting companies, Monotype's branches in Britain and the United States brought out separate versions, and the American branch of Linotype licensed that of ATF.|$|E
50|$|Note: Sets 05-135 to 139 use 3 <b>pantographs</b> (other <b>pantographs</b> are not used).|$|R
50|$|On {{railways}} of {{the former}} USSR, {{the most widely used}} <b>pantographs</b> are those with a double arm ("made of two rhombs"), but since the late 1990s there have been some single-arm <b>pantographs</b> on Russian railways. Some streetcars use double-arm <b>pantographs,</b> among them the Russian KTM-5, KTM-8, LVS-86 and many other Russian-made trams, as well as some Euro-PCC trams in Belgium. American streetcars use either trolley poles or single-arm <b>pantographs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Polycarbonate window protectors {{were added}} in 2002, and the {{original}} <b>pantographs</b> were replaced with single-arm <b>pantographs</b> between 2004 and 2005.|$|R
5|$|In England, the {{scientist}} Francis Galton {{heard of this}} work, {{as well as the}} pioneering weather forecasts of Robert Fitzroy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the <b>pantograph</b> (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E
5|$|When Holmenkolbanen, the {{operator}} of the Holmenkoll Line, was merged into Oslo Sporveier in 1975, plans {{were put in}} place to replace the old teak cars with faster units that could operate from Nationaltheatret to Frognerseteren in 25 minutes—allowing a turn-around time of one hour. At the time there had been two separate pools of trains for the eastern and western networks. On the eastern metro, the T1000 units were in use, while the western network was using older material. During the 1980s, some T1000 stock had been rebuilt with <b>pantograph,</b> and taken into use on the western network.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior <b>pantograph</b> design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E
5000|$|The M and M2 {{cars are}} each fitted with two lozenge-type <b>pantographs.</b> Sets 8804, 8808, 8812, and 8816 have single-arm <b>pantographs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cars 2, 6, and 12 were {{equipped}} with cross-arm <b>pantographs.</b> (The <b>pantographs</b> on cars 4, 10, and 14 were removed in 1995.) ...|$|R
50|$|Cars 3441-3456 were {{originally}} equipped with <b>pantographs</b> {{for use on}} the Yellow Line, which was powered by overhead lines until 2004. The <b>pantographs</b> on 3451-3456 were removed in the late 1990s when they were reassigned to supplement the Brown Line, while the rest lost their <b>pantographs</b> when the Yellow Line was converted to third rail power in 2004.|$|R
5|$|Serial {{production}} of the T1000 started in 1964 by Strømmens Værksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 cars were delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which {{were part of the}} tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only difference from the T1000 was that they had a <b>pantograph</b> that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a <b>pantograph,</b> received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
5|$|Allward chose a {{relatively}} new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now {{on display at the}} Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a <b>pantograph</b> to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave {{was not part of the}} original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pantographs</b> {{may have}} either a single or a double arm. Double-arm <b>pantographs</b> are usually heavier, {{requiring}} {{more power to}} raise and lower, but may also be more fault-tolerant.|$|R
5000|$|August 1995: Sets from J30 onward {{delivered}} with two <b>pantographs</b> {{in place of}} the earlier three. Modifications started on earlier sets to reduce number of <b>pantographs</b> to two.|$|R
50|$|Thirteen 701-100 series {{cars were}} {{delivered}} in 1994, formed as one 3-car set and five 2-car sets. All sets were initially based at Akita Depot, but {{four of the}} 2-car sets were subsequently transferred to Sendai. The Akita-based sets had the original PS104 scissors-type <b>pantographs</b> replaced with PS109 single-arm <b>pantographs</b> between 2007 and 2008. Snowploughs were also added to the front ends at the same time. The Sendai-based sets had the original PS104 scissors-type <b>pantographs</b> replaced with lower-profile PS105 lozenge-type <b>pantographs</b> in 2002 to allow operation through limited-clearance tunnels on the Senzan Line.|$|R
5|$|Most coin {{collectors}} {{became aware}} of the 1804 dollar in 1842, when Jacob R. Eckfeldt (son of Adam Eckfeldt) and William E. Du Bois published a book entitled A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations, Struck Within the Past Century. In the volume, several coins from the Mint's coin cabinet, including an 1804 dollar, were reproduced by tracing a <b>pantograph</b> stylus over an electrotype of the coins. In May 1843, numismatist Matthew A. Stickney was able to obtain an 1804 dollar from the Mint's coin cabinet by trading a rare pre-federal United States gold coin. Due to an increase in the demand for rare coins, Mint officials, including Director Snowden, began minting an increasing number of coin restrikes in the 1850s. Several 1804 dollars were struck, and some were sold for personal profit on the part of Mint officials. When he discovered this, Snowden bought back several of the coins. One such coin, which Snowden later added to the Mint cabinet, was struck over an 1857 shooting thaler and became known as Class II, the only such piece of that type known to exist today. Six pieces with edge lettering applied after striking became known as Class III dollars.|$|E
25|$|The Stone Faiveley AMBR <b>pantograph</b> was {{replaced}} by the industry standard Brecknell Willis high speed <b>pantograph.</b> Units were reclassified as Class 317/6 and were renumbered into the range 317649-672.|$|E
25|$|Power {{cars for}} service into Switzerland are {{equipped}} with a second <b>pantograph</b> matching Swiss specifications and the Swiss Integra-Signum safety system as well as ETCS. The other power cars are prepared for fitting a second <b>pantograph.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cars #3441-3456 were {{originally}} equipped with <b>pantographs</b> {{for use on}} the Yellow Line, due to its use of overhead catenary between the Skokie shops and Dempster Street. The <b>pantographs</b> on 3451-3456 were removed in the late 1990s when they were reassigned to supplement the Brown Line, while the rest lost their <b>pantographs</b> when the Yellow Line was converted to third rail power in 2004.|$|R
25|$|Trams {{or light}} rail cars {{equipped}} with <b>pantographs</b> normally cannot operate on lines with overhead wiring designed for trolley-pole collection. For this reason, these systems {{and a few}} others worldwide retain use of trolley poles, even on new streetcars (except in Riga), {{in order to avoid the}} difficulty and expense of modifying long stretches of existing overhead wires to accept <b>pantographs.</b> However, the Toronto Transit Commission is converting streetcar overhead to be compatible with both trolley poles and <b>pantographs.</b> (The older CLRV and ALRV streetcars use only trolley poles while the newer Flexity Outlook are equipped for both trolley poles and <b>pantographs.)</b> Along Queens Quay West, since September 12, 2017, streetcars for route 510 Spadina use trolley poles while those for 509 Harbourfront use <b>pantographs</b> along the same section of track.|$|R
50|$|Five EF67-100s {{were built}} from former 6th-batch Class EF65-0 {{locomotives}} from 1990 {{to replace the}} ageing EF61-200 banking locomotives. The EF67-100 fleet was refurbished between 2003 and 2004, and repainted into a revised livery with grey and white lines along the lower body side. These locomotives were originally fitted with PS22B scissors-type <b>pantographs,</b> which were replaced with single-arm <b>pantographs</b> on refurbishment, but these were subsequently returned to PS22B scissors-type <b>pantographs.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>pantograph</b> is {{a device}} that {{collects}} electric current from overhead lines for electric trains or trams. The term stems from the resemblance to <b>pantograph</b> devices for copying writing and drawings. In 1904, the diamond-shaped roller <b>pantograph</b> was invented by John Q. Brown of the Key System shops for their commuter trains which ran between San Francisco and the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. A patent was issued on July 5, 1904.|$|E
25|$|L class {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} two pantographs. The VR issued instructions for both pantographs {{to be raised}} in winter months, with the first <b>pantograph</b> serving to knock ice off the overhead catenary and ensure good contact for the second <b>pantograph.</b>|$|E
25|$|Car 3 is {{fitted with}} one PS28 lozenge-type <b>pantograph.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 2000s, similar single-arm type <b>pantographs</b> {{were adopted}} by Spoornet. These <b>pantographs</b> {{gradually}} replaced the older box-frame type <b>pantographs</b> on all electric locomotive types as and when replacement became necessary. Along with Class Experimental AC no. E1600, no. E1525 is still dedicated to testing projects since its different gear ratio and traction effort curves make it unsuitable {{for use in}} multi-unit working with other Class 6E1 locomotives in the fleet.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the {{original}} <b>pantographs</b> were {{replaced with the}} same S-PS58 type <b>pantographs</b> also used on the JR Shikoku 7000 series EMUs to ensure adequate clearance through tunnels on newly electrified sections of the Yosan Line.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1997, the Ge 4/4 I class's old {{diamond-shaped}} <b>pantographs</b> {{were replaced}} by new single-arm <b>pantographs,</b> to enable deployment of the class on the Chur-Arosa line, which {{at that time was}} having its electrification system changed.|$|R
