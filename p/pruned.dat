5|$|Banksia aquilonia adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at {{four to six}} years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown in a pot, with its branches heavily <b>pruned</b> to keep foliage dense.|$|E

When one {{copy of the}} awd(Killer of <b>prune)</b> mutant gene is present in a <b>prune</b> background, the animals die. The cause of prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality remains unknown. The genomic region characterized for the <b>prune</b> locus is transcriptionally active and complex, with multiple and overlapping transcripts. Despite the transcriptional complexity of the genomic region of <b>prune,</b> accumulated {{evidence suggests that the}} <b>prune</b> locus is small and consists of a single transcription unit, since every <b>prune</b> allele to date exhibits both <b>prune</b> eye color and prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality. A functional <b>prune</b> product from a single, full-length cDNA was identified in this study that can rescue both the eye phenotype and prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality. The DNA sequences of several mutant <b>prune</b> alleles along with Western blot analysis of mutant proteins provide convincing evidence that <b>prune</b> mutations are nulls, and that the cDNA identified in this study encodes the only product of the <b>prune</b> locus...|$|R
40|$|This work compares {{mechanical}} <b>pruning</b> {{followed up}} by hand <b>pruning</b> versus manual <b>pruning</b> {{in the case}} of ‘Fortune’ mandarins. Yield and fruit quality were measured over a three-year period. Two mechanical <b>pruning</b> intensities were tested, these intensities being measured as the width of the row middles left free after mechanical <b>pruning.</b> Although there were differences in biomass and diameter of the branches that were cut, no differences were observed between the two mechanical <b>pruning</b> intensities in terms of yield or fruit quality. In all <b>pruning</b> treatments, fruit size reached the highest category. The <b>pruning</b> treatments consisted in: (i) hand <b>pruning</b> every year, (ii) mechanical <b>pruning</b> followed up by hand <b>pruning</b> every year, and (iii) alternating the two previous methods over the years studied. On analysing the accumulated fruit production of the three years, it can be observed that {{there were no significant differences}} in yield when mechanical <b>pruning</b> was alternated with hand <b>pruning</b> over the years. When only mechanical <b>pruning</b> was used for the three years, however, a 22 % reduction in yield was observed with respect to the treatment involving hand <b>pruning</b> alone. From the economic point of view, mechanical <b>pruning</b> shortened the time needed to complete the follow-up hand <b>pruning</b> by 13 % with respect to just hand <b>pruning,</b> but this reduction in labour does not offset the cost of the mechanical equipment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Node <b>pruning</b> {{strategies}} {{based on}} probability distributions are developed for maximum-likelihood (ML) detection for spatial-multiplexing multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Uniform <b>pruning,</b> geometric <b>pruning,</b> threshold <b>pruning,</b> hybrid <b>pruning,</b> and depth-dependent <b>pruning</b> are thus developed in detail. By considering the symbol error probability {{in the high}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, the desirable diversity order of uniform <b>pruning</b> and the threshold level for threshold <b>pruning</b> are derived. Simulation results show that threshold <b>pruning</b> saves complexity compared with popular sphere decoder (SD) algorithms, such as the K-best SD, the fixed-complexity SD (FSD), and the probabilistic tree <b>pruning</b> SD (PTP-SD), particularly for high SNRs and large-antenna MIMO systems.

40|$|Grading is {{important}} to ensure the production of high-quality foods, but It Is usually done with error, distorting market signals and diminishing Incentives to produce high-quality products.

In an application to the California <b>prune</b> Industry, we estimated {{the extent to which}} large <b>prunes</b> are undervalued and small <b>prunes</b> are overvalued. We conclude that grading error means that <b>prunes</b> graded as high-quality may not really be high-quality <b>prunes.</b> The presence of these Incorrectly graded <b>prunes</b> depresses the prices that growers are paid for high-quality <b>prunes</b> and increases the net returns for small <b>prunes.</b> As a result, growers face reduced incentives to produce larger <b>prunes...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{leaves of}} trees are widely {{gathered}} as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but {{they tend to}} be high in tannins which makes them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and Ailanthus (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily <b>pruned</b> to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are <b>pruned</b> back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be <b>pruned</b> heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we review {{standard}} null-move <b>pruning</b> and introduce our extended version of it, which we call verified null-move <b>pruning.</b> In verified null-move <b>pruning,</b> whenever the shallow null-move search indicates a fail-high, instead of cutting off the search from the current node, the search is continued with reduced depth. Our experiments with verified null-move <b>pruning</b> show that on average, it constructs a smaller search tree with greater tactical strength in comparison to standard null-move <b>pruning.</b> Moreover, unlike standard null-move <b>pruning,</b> which fails badly in zugzwang positions, verified null-move <b>pruning</b> manages to detect most zugzwangs and in such cases conducts a re-search to obtain the correct result.

5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be <b>pruned</b> severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily sprout from old wood. This {{is not the case}} for var.cunninghamii which should not be <b>pruned</b> below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E

Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are <b>pruned</b> away.|$|E

These surpluses will probably be felt in both fresh and dried <b>prunes.</b> This thesis presents the results of an investigation to find. new markets and new products which will be of value in utilizing these surpluses. The following products have been investigated and are included in this report. Canned prepared dried <b>prunes.</b> A. prolonged study was made of the effect of prepared Italian <b>prunes</b> on various types of cans. It was found that plain charcoal cans were entirely satisfactory over a period of 11 months' storage. Single enameled cans should not be used as they swell in less than eight months' storage. Methods of preparation of <b>prunes</b> for canning were studied. A long pre-soaking was found most satisfactory, for high quality. Short hot blanch before canning can be used if proper conditions of syrup and fill are observed. Yields and costs were given for the two methods of preparation. <b>Prune</b> beverages. Three types of <b>prune</b> beverages were discussed. Pulpy juice was most promising. A cloudy and a clear beverage were also satisfactory. Yields and costs were given and compared. Pitted <b>prune</b> pulp. Small or low-grade dried <b>prunes</b> were made into pulp by means of a suitable machine. This product was suitable for use in the bakery trade. Halved Pitted <b>prunes.</b> Fresh <b>prunes</b> were split and pitted before drying. The machine to do this was developed during this investigation. Large savings were effected in drying time, because of quicker evaporation of moisture from these halved <b>prunes.</b> Because of shorter drying time and lower temperature the quality was more nearly that of fresh <b>prunes.</b> Fresh <b>Prune</b> Juice. Small or low-grade fresh <b>prunes</b> were used to make a pulpy fresh <b>prune</b> juice. This product was excellent in flavor and color.

40|$|Forward <b>pruning,</b> or {{selectively}} searching {{a subset}} of moves, is now commonly used in game-playing programs {{to reduce the number}} of nodes searched with manageable risk. Forward <b>pruning</b> techniques should consider how <b>pruning</b> errors in a game-tree search propagate to the root to minimize the risk of making errors. In this paper, we explore forward <b>pruning</b> using theoretical analyses and Monte Carlo simulations and report on two findings. Firstly, we find that <b>pruning</b> errors propagate differently depending on the player to move, and show that <b>pruning</b> errors on the opponent’s moves are potentially more serious than <b>pruning</b> errors on the player’s own moves. This suggests that <b>pruning</b> on the player’s own move can be performed more aggressively compared to <b>pruning</b> on the opponent’s move. Secondly, we examine the ability of the minimax search to filter away <b>pruning</b> errors and give bounds on the rate of error propagation to the root. We find that if the rate of <b>pruning</b> error is kept constant, the growth of errors with the depth of the tree dominates the filtering effect, therefore suggesting that <b>pruning</b> should be done more aggressively near the root and less aggressively near the leaves...|$|R
