YahnkeJeong-Hee KimThis {{study is}} a {{narrative}} inquiry {{into the lives of}} <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> in order to gain insight into their identities as <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> and their understanding {{of what it means to}} be physically literate as well as investigate into the thoughts of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> about the concept of comprehensives school physical activity programs. According to Whitehead (2010), physical literacy is a disposition to capitalize on the human embodied capability, wherein an individual has the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to value and take responsibility for maintaining purposeful physical pursuits/activity throughout a lifetime. Development of the debate regarding physical literacy was stimulated by the study of existentialist and phenomenological philosophers, such as Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, who articulate a particular stance towards the nature of our mind and body connection. Merleau-Ponty’s (1945 / 2010) philosophy facilitated the gain of knowledge regarding 1) how stories of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> help promote <b>physical</b> literacy in schools; 2) how <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> perceive the mind/body connection; and 3) how <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> understand what it means to be physically literate. The contributions to the thought and practice of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> as a result of this study will highlight 1.) physical literacy is embodied in adapted physical education; 2.) the role of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> is not just teaching and moving the body, but to help students learn better; 3.) A stressed mind affects the body, and having a healthy body helps students learn better; 4.) A new role of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> is to bridge the gap between <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> and the classroom by providing ideas to classroom teachers regarding brain breaks. 5.) <b>Teacher</b> <b>education</b> programs need to highlight reflective practices that help future physical educators draw upon knowledge from their own life experiences to enrich their teaching; 6.) <b>Physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> should collaborate with public health officials to implement comprehensive school physical activity programs...|$|R
