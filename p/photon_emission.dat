5|$|The other iodine radioisotopes {{have much}} shorter half-lives, {{no longer than}} days. Some of them have medical {{applications}} involving the thyroid gland, where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated. Iodine-123 has a half-life of thirteen hours and decays by electron capture to tellurium-123, emitting gamma radiation; it is used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single <b>photon</b> <b>emission</b> computed tomography (SPECT) and X-ray computed tomography (X-Ray CT) scans. Iodine-125 has a half-life of fifty-nine days, decaying by electron capture to tellurium-125 and emitting low-energy gamma radiation; the second-longest-lived iodine radioisotope, it has uses in biological assays, nuclear medicine imaging and in radiation therapy as brachytherapy to treat a number of conditions, including prostate cancer, uveal melanomas, and brain tumours. Finally, iodine-131, with a half-life of eight days, beta decays to an excited state of stable xenon-131 that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation. It is a common fission product and thus is present in high levels in radioactive fallout. It may then be absorbed through contaminated food, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure {{to high levels of}} iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and thyroiditis. The usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine-131 is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine-127 in the form of potassium iodide tablets, taken daily for optimal prophylaxis. However, iodine-131 may also be used for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy for this very reason, when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue. Iodine-131 is also used as a radioactive tracer.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{and implications of}} photons within the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet behaving as sources of intracellular and intercellular communication and information were investigated experimentally for melanoma cells during the 24 hrs following removal from incubation. Specific wavelengths during different intervals were associated with specific classes of biomolecules that were predicted based on the physical properties associated with their amino acid sequences. Application of a specific intensity and physiologically patterned magnetic field predicted from a model that applied the concept of magnetic moment to the whole cell resulted in <b>photon</b> <b>emissions.</b> They were detected at distances sufficient to allow intercellular communication. The occurrence of macroscopic entanglement or non-locality was shown between two loci of where simple chemically-based <b>photons</b> <b>emissions</b> were generated. Within all three experiments there was marked quantitative congruence between the energies associated with the power density of the <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> and the physicochemical variables involved with their reduction.

2500|$|Persinger {{suggested}} that ultraweak <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> (picoWatt per meter squared) {{could serve as}} a medium through which local and non-local space could be connected. Power densities of spontaneous background <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> indicated potential solutions for Lorentz contractions and galactic sources that define the properties of space-time. He quantified the relationship between Casimir and magnetic energies and showed by calculation the dual properties of photons (particle/wave) could be derived if the electron displayed a discrete particle and wave value with each orbit. [...] Persinger argued that macroscopic manifestations would involve the thixotrophic changes in water that included viscosity, pH, and interfacial water. With Nirosha J.

50|$|As the {{electrical}} stimulus pattern is repetitively {{applied to the}} DUT, internal transistors switch on and off. As pMOS and nMOS transistors switch on or off, they emit <b>photons.</b> These <b>photons</b> <b>emissions</b> are recorded by a sensitive photon detector. By {{counting the number of}} photons emitted for a specific transistor across a period of time, a photon histogram may be constructed. The photon histogram records an increase in <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> during times that the transistor switches on or off. By detecting the combined <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> of pairs p- and n-channel transistors contained in logic gates, it is possible to use the resulting histogram to determine the locations in time of the rising and falling edges of the signal at that node. The waveform produced is not representative of a true voltage waveform, but more accurately represents the derivative of the waveform, with photon spikes being seen only at rising or falling edges.|$|R

25|$|Fine {{structure}} cooling: The {{process of}} fine structure cooling is dominant in most {{regions of the}} Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot gas and regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with abundant atoms having fine structure levels close to the fundamental level such as: CII and OI in the neutral medium and OII, OIII, NII, NIII, NeII and NeIII in HII regions.

50|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, Persinger and his colleagues, Blake T. Dotta and David Vares, {{measured}} ultraweak <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> from human volunteers, experimental animals, cells, aqueous reactions, and air. Increases in numbers of photon counts under hyperdark conditions during cellular activity and certain types of cognition were associated with small decreases in local geomagnetic intensity with the potential for non-local effects. Persinger and his colleagues experimentally demonstrated that simultaneous application of temporally patterned magnetic fields and specific wavelengths of light to cells stored energy that was subsequently released as the same wavelength of light more than an hour later. He argued that ultraweak <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> contributed to cell-cell communication at great distances and carried the templates for the direction of signalling within cells and their interactions with applied electromagnetic fields.  He and his colleagues showed that <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> or shifts in pH from two different reactions separated by non-traditional distances showed excess correlation (“entanglement”) if both shared the same circularly rotating, changing velocity magnetic fields. That is, the two spaces operated as if they were the same space.|$|R

The decay time of these discrete line emissions is approximately 10 ns, which {{is at least one}} order longer than the lifetime of the broad localized (L) excitons. These characteristics lead to a conclusion that the excitons bound to deep level defects can be responsible for the observed single <b>photon</b> <b>emissions.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{quantitative}} {{relationship between}} local changes in magnetic fields and <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> within ∼ 2 mm of aggregates of 105 – 106 cells was explored experimentally. The vertical {{component of the}} earth’s magnetic field as measured by different magnetometers was ∼ 15 nT higher when plates of cells removed from incubation were measured compared to plates containing only medium. Additional experiments indicated an inverse relationship over the first ∼ 45 min between changes in photon counts (∼ 10 − 12 W·m− 2) following removal from incubation and similar changes in magnetic field intensity. Calculations indicated that the energy within the aqueous volume containing the cells was equivalent for that associated with the flux densities of the magnetic fields and the <b>photon</b> <b>emissions.</b> For every approximately 1 nT increase in magnetic field intensity value there was a decrease of ∼ 2 photons (equivalent of 10 − 18 J). These results complement correlation studies and suggest {{there may be a}} conservation of energy between expression as magnetic fields that are subtracted or added to the adjacent geomagnetic field and reciprocal changes in <b>photon</b> <b>emissions</b> when aggregates of cells within a specific volume of medium (water) adapt to new environments...|$|R
25|$|Single <b>photon</b> <b>emission</b> {{computed}} tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique using gamma rays. It {{may be used}} with any gamma-emitting isotope, including Tc-99m. In the use of technetium-99m, the radioisotope is administered to {{the patient and the}} escaping gamma rays are incident upon a moving gamma camera which computes and processes the image. To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every three to six degrees. In most cases, a full 360° rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds are typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{glow of a}} flame is complex. Black-body {{radiation}} is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles {{are too small to}} behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also <b>photon</b> <b>emission</b> by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the {{radiation is}} emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.|$|E
