The {{youngest}} child in the family, his interest in drawing and natural history was nurtured by his mother. At seven he spotted and caught a rare <b>pale</b> <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> butterfly. The family moved to Great Yarmouth and later Ipswich where he found many interesting butterflies. After {{the death of his father}} around 1873, the family moved to Croydon and later South Norwood. He went to school at Norwood College and during this time contracted typhoid leading to near blindness in one eye. In 1880 the family moved to Upper Norwood and here Frohawk concentrated on illustration and obtained his first commission for illustrating The Field. Frohawk was encouraged in his work by Lord Walter Rothschild, who later bought his water-colours of butterflies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the molecular {{organization of the}} eye of the Eastern <b>Pale</b> <b>Clouded</b> <b>Yellow</b> butterfly, Colias erate (Pieridae). We cloned four cDNAs encoding visual pigment opsins, corresponding to one ultraviolet, two blue and one long wavelength-absorbing visual pigments. Duplication of the blue visual pigment class occurs also in another pierid species, Pieris rapae, suggesting that blue duplication is a general feature in the family Pieridae. We localized the opsin mRNAs in the Colias retina by in situ hybridization. Among the nine photoreceptor cells in an ommatidium, R 1 - 9, we found that R 3 - 8 expressed the long wavelength class mRNA in all ommatidia. R 1 and R 2 expressed mRNAs of the short wavelength opsins in three fixed combinations, corresponding to three types of ommatidia. While the duplicated blue opsins in Pieris are separately expressed in two subsets of R 1 - 2 photoreceptors, one blue sensitive and another violet sensitive, those of Colias appear to be always coexpressed...|$|E

40|$|The {{compound}} eyes of {{the eastern}} <b>pale</b> <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> butterfly, Colias erate, contain three types of ommatidia (I, II and III), identifiable by the differing arrangements of pigment clusters around the rhabdoms. The pigment color is red in all ommatidial types except for type II ommatidia of females, where the pigment is orange. Intracellular recordings demonstrated that the spectral sensitivities of the proximal photoreceptors (R 5 - 8) of all ommatidia in both sexes are strongly tuned by the perirhabdomal pigments. These pigments act as long-pass filters, shifting the peak sensitivities into the wavelength range above 600 nm. Due to the sex-specific pigments in type II ommatidia, the spectral sensitivities of the R 5 - 8 photoreceptors of females peaked at 620 nm while those in males peaked at 660 nm. The measured spectral sensitivities could be well reproduced by an optical model assuming a long-wavelength-absorbing visual pigment with peak absorbance at 565 nm. Whereas the sexual dimorphism was unequivocally demonstrated for the ventral eye region, dimorphism in the dorsal region was not found. Presumably the ventral region is adapted for sexual behaviors such as courtship and oviposition. ...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{remarkable}} {{anatomy of the}} eye of the Eastern <b>Pale</b> <b>Clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> butterfly, Colias erate. An ommatidium of C. erate bears nine photoreceptors, R 1 – 9, which together form a tiered and fused rhabdom. The distal tier of the rhabdom consists of the rhabdomeral microvilli of R 1 – 4 photoreceptors, R 5 – 8 photoreceptors contribute the proximal tier, and the R 9 photoreceptor adds a few microvilli at the base. In transverse sections, four spots of red pigment surrounding the rhabdom are evident in the ventral region of the eye. The red pigment acts as a strong red filter for the proximal photoreceptors. The arrangement of the pigment spots distinguishes the ommatidia into three types: trapezoidal (type I), square (type II) and rectangular (type III). In all types of ommatidia, the distal and the proximal tiers of the rhabdom are divided by a strong constriction, clearly to enhance the filtering effect of the red pigment. The ommatidial heterogeneity can also be observed by optical measurements. The eye shine, resulting from tapetal reflections, peaks in type I ommatidia at 660 nm, and in type II and III ommatidia at 730 nm. The far-red-peaking eye shine indicates that C. erate has far-red-sensitive photoreceptors. Type I ommatidia fluoresce under violet excitation, implying the presence of a violet-absorbing pigment that acts as a short-wavelength filter. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{compound}} eye of Colias erate {{is composed}} of about 6, 500 ommatidia, eachcontaining nine photoreceptors (R 1 - 9), forming a tiered rhabdom, surrounded by fourreddish pigments. The ommatidia are divided into three types (I-III) due to thearrangement of perirhabdormal pigment spots and expression pattern of four opsinmRNAs. The opsins are already identified: they are short (CeUV), two middle (CeV 1,CeV 2) and L (CeL) -absorbing types. In the thesis research, I studied the physiologicalbasis of color vision in the Eastern <b>Pale</b> <b>Clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> butterfly, Colias erate Esper, indetail focusing on the production mechanism {{of the variety of}} spectral photoreceptors. Following General Introduction, I describe a few basic properties of the Colias eye inChapter 1. The basic properties are the eyeshine, which is a reflection from the tapetum atthe bottom of the ommatidia, and the spectral sensitivity of the entire eye. The eyeshine ofthe dorsal region has identical reflectance spectrum in both sexes. In the ventral region ofmales, type I ommatidia reflect 660 nm and type II and III ommatidia reflect 730 nm. Infemales, type II ommatidia have broadband reflection from 620 to 730 nm, while type Iand III respectively reflect 660 nm and 730 nm as in males. Remarkable sexual differenceof eyeshine spectrum in type II ommatidia is attributable to the female-specific orangepigment. Regionalization was also found in the eye spectral sensitivity determined byelectroretinography. Dorsal region of the retina is relatively more sensitive below 420 nmrange, whereas the ventral region is more sensitive in the wavelength range of 420 nm to 550 nm. This is probably because of the differential distribution of different ommatidialtypes. Four of nine photoreceptor cells contribute their rhabdomeral microvilli to the distaltier of the tired Colias rhabdom. In chapter 2, I analyzed the visual pigments and spectralsensitivities of individual photoreceptors in the distal tier in both sexes of Colias erate. Asubset of photoreceptor cells expresses a newly discovered middle wavelength-absorbingopsin, Colias erate Blue (CeB), in addition to two previously described middlewavelength-absorbing opsins, CeV 1 and CeV 2. The other photoreceptors either coexpressCeV 1 and CeV 2, or exclusively express a short wavelength-absorbing opsin, CeUV, or along wavelength-absorbing opsin, CeL. Males and females have the same visualpigment expression patterns, but the photoreceptor spectral sensitivities are sexuallydimorphic. The photoreceptors coexpressing three middle wavelength-absorbing opsinsare broad-blue receptors in males, but in females they are narrow-blue receptors. Thosewith CeV 1 and CeV 2 are violet receptors in females, while they are shouldered-bluereceptors in males. The sexual dimorphism in spectral sensitivity is caused by asex-specific distribution of fluorescent pigment that functions as a spectral filter. In chapter 3, I demonstrated by intracellular recording that the spectralsensitivities of the proximal photoreceptors (R 5 - 8) of all ommatidia in both sexes arestrongly tuned by the perirhabdomal pigments. These act as long-pass filters, shifting thepeak sensitivities into the wavelength range above 600 nm. Due to the sex-specificpigments in type II ommatidia, the spectral sensitivities of the R 5 - 8 photoreceptors offemales peaked at 620 nm while those in males peaked at 660 nm. The measuredspectral sensitivities could be well reproduced by an optical model assuming a longwavelength-absorbing visual pigment with peak absorbance at 565 nm. Whereas thesexual dimorphism was unequivocally demonstrated for the ventral eye region,dimorphism in the dorsal region was not found. Presumably the ventral region isstrongly related to sexual behaviors such as courtship and oviposition. I demonstrated in this thesis that males and females of Colias have different setof eight classes of spectral photoreceptor in the ventral region of the eye. On the otherhand, I did not detect any sexual dimorphism in the dorsal retina. The eight types ofphotoreceptor identified in the Colias ventral retina are generated by 1) duplication ofopsin genes, 2) expression of multiple opsins in single photoreceptors and 3) the filteringeffect of the fluorescent and perirhabdomal pigment. Together with previous studies,especially on the small white, Pieris rapae, and the Japanese yellow swallowtail Papilioxuthus, these mechanisms underlying various spectral receptors appear to be widespreadamong butterflies...|$|E
