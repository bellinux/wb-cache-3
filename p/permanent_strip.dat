The editors at the {{magazine}} were impressed by Moore's work and decided to offer him a more <b>permanent</b> <b>strip,</b> starting with a story {{that they wanted to}} be vaguely based upon the hit film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The result, Skizz, which was illustrated by Jim Baikie, told the story of the titular alien who crashes to Earth and is cared for by a teenager named Roxy, and Moore later noted that in his opinion, this work [...] "owes far too much to Alan Bleasdale." [...] Another series he produced for 2000AD was D.R. and Quinch, which was illustrated by Alan Davis. The story, which Moore described as [...] "continuing the tradition of Dennis the Menace, but giving him a thermonuclear capacity", revolved around two delinquent aliens, and was a science-fiction take on National Lampoons characters O.C. and Stiggs. The work widely considered to be the highlight of his 2000AD career, and that he himself described as [...] "the one that worked best for me" [...] was The Ballad of Halo Jones. Co-created with artist Ian Gibson, the series was set in the 50th century. It finished before all the episodes were written.|$|E
5000|$|Magnepan's speaker design, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Magneplanar (often {{referred}} to as [...] "Maggies" [...] in the industry), {{differs from that of}} conventional speakers in relying not on cones mounted in an enclosure but on a planar driver system mounted in a panel. A Magneplanar's reproducing mechanism comprises thin conductive wires and or foil strips attached to a thin sheet of Mylar residing in a magnetic field created by a vertical array of <b>permanent</b> <b>strip</b> magnets. When an amplified signal is applied to the conductors, the resultant electrical forces react with the magnetic field to excite the Mylar film sheet, which projects sound as a dipole. In principle, this approach relies on the same concept as a voice coil-driven cone speaker, but in a Magneplanar speaker the [...] "voice coils" [...] are attached (glued) directly to the radiating surface.Sound is projected from both the front and back of the radiating surface. The sound {{from the back of the}} speaker is reflected from the front wall of the listening area. This is said to effectively enhance the soundstage - the sense of space and realism - of the speaker. The Magneplanar design, using a passive magnet array, is not a unique loudspeaker implementation, although it was the first of its type. Eminent Technology, Analysis Audio, and others also employ passive magnet designs. Broadly, these are classed as planar-magnetic speakers.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compare the attention-getting characteristics, movements and vertical displacements of several portable, reusable rumble strips. The attention-getting characteristics and displacement were measured after passes of a fully loaded heavy truck and a passenger vehicle. Sound and vibration tests revealed that the portable plastic rumble strips were more effective on cars than trucks for generating in-vehicle vibration and increasing in-vehicle sound levels. Further, they were generally better able to match the characteristics of the tested <b>permanent</b> rumble <b>strip</b> compared to the adhesive rumble strips, and that this was also true for the configurations that contained less than six portable plastic rumble strips. The configurations with four plastic rumble strips were found to be sufficient enough to generate similar vibration and sound levels for either heavy trucks or passenger cars. If the vibration generated by the <b>permanent</b> <b>strips</b> is considered as the standard performance, these configurations could be implemented in short-term work zones and provide similar results to <b>permanent</b> rumble <b>strips.</b> The movement and vertical displacement test results revealed that the earlier generations of plastic rumble strips did not perform as well as the fourth generation especially at 60 mph (96. 6 km/hr). The steel rumble strips also hold some promise; however, the structural integrity of the steel rumble strips is an issue that needs to be addressed...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} on hillslopes often cause soil erosion and degradation. <b>Permanent</b> vegetation <b>strips</b> on cultivated slopes {{could be an}} effective soil conservation technique to reduce erosion. Previous studies showed that cultivated Mahonia aquifolium {{can be an effective}} plant for water erosion control. However, no detailed studies have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of M. aquifolium as a <b>permanent</b> vegetation <b>strip.</b> The objective of the present study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} M. aquifolium strips on soil erosion control under various bio-physical conditions with the use of the Revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney model (RMMF). The RMMF model was first calibrated by using measured quantities of surface runoff and validated against soil loss data from M. aquifolium plots. After calibration the model showed erosion to be transport limited process for all M. aquifolium plots and a detachment limited for the bare soil control plot. The model was then used to predict surface runoff and soil loss for various soil types, slope angles and cultivations with and without M. aquifolium strips. The study indicated that the presence of M. aquifolium strips substantially reduced the soil loss rate on all studied crop fields. For steeper slopes with M. aquifolium strips the model predicted a lower soil loss rate than for gentle slopes without strips. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|A {{passive and}} {{wireless}} sensor {{was developed for}} monitoring pressure in vivo. Structurally, the pressure sensor, {{referred to as the}} magneto-harmonic pressure sensor, is an airtight chamber sealed with an elastic pressure membrane. A strip of magnetically-soft material is attached {{to the bottom of the}} chamber and a <b>permanent</b> magnet <b>strip</b> is embedded inside the membrane. Under the excitation of an externally applied AC magnetic field, the magnetically-soft strip produces a higher-order magnetic signature that can be remotely detected with an external receiving coil. As ambient pressure varies, the pressure membrane deflects, altering the separation distance between the magnetically-soft <b>strip</b> and the <b>permanent</b> magnet. This shifts the higher-order harmonic signal, allowing for detection of pressure change as a function of harmonic shifting. The wireless, passive nature of this sensor technology allows for continuous long-term pressure monitoring, particularly useful for biomedical applications such as monitoring pressure in aneurysm sac and sphincter of Oddi. In addition to demonstrating its pressure sensing capability, an animal model was used to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of the pressure sensor in a biological environment...|$|R

During this procedure, three to six+ dacron (the material used in <b>permanent</b> sutures) <b>strips</b> are inserted into the soft palate, using a modified syringe and local anesthetic. While the procedure was initially approved for the insertion of three [...] "pillars" [...] into the soft palate, {{it was found that}} there was a significant dosage response to more pillars, with appropriate candidates. As a result of this outpatient operation, which typically lasts no more than 30 minutes, the soft palate is more rigid, possibly reducing instances of sleep apnea and snoring. This procedure addresses {{one of the most common}} causes of snoring and sleep apnea — vibration or collapse of the soft palate (the soft part of the roof of the mouth). If there are other factors contributing to snoring or sleep apnea, such as conditions of the nasal airway or an enlarged tongue, it will likely need to be combined with other treatments to be more effective.|$|R

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple and reliable gasket insulation technique for electrical feedthroughs in the Diamond Anvil Cell has been successfuly developed. This involved the use of, {{easy to use}} components such as epoxy resins which can be easily obtained, and, the use of simple equipment which are part of any reasonably equiped laboratory. Photoconductivity, demonstrator, experiments on strained layer quantum well material were successfully used to prove the feasibility of these techniques. The pressure coefficient values obtained for strained InGaAs/GaAs, InGaAs/AlGaAs and unstrained InGaAs/InGaAsP were in agreement with that obtained with a photoluminescence technique. Unlike photoluminescence {{it is also possible}} to obtain the pressure coefficients of higher energy states with the photoconductivity experiment. In the process, laminated gaskets for electrical measurements were also developed. This has led to a tremendous improvement in the experimental reliability {{to such an extent that}} the electrical feedthroughs have become almost as routine as the optical experiments. Further, it is now possible to use ordinary optically cut anvils to conduct electrical feedthroughs without resorting to specially designed ones, such as rounded or multiple bevelled anvils, or, even depositing <b>permanent</b> conducting <b>strips</b> onto the diamond culets. The benefits of this is that obtaining ordinary cut anvils is much simpler than obtaining specialist bevelled or rounded edge anvils...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:] Bitumen-stabilized {{materials}} with emulsion (BSM-E) are gaining increasing importance {{within the scope}} of road pavement engineering and the fight against climate change. Both environmental and economic aspects of BSM-E can be further improved by substituting the natural aggregates (NA) with recycled construction and demolition waste aggregates (CDWA). The objective of the present paper is to analyze how such substitution affects the two critical properties that mostly define the durability and long-term performance of BSM-E: resistance to stripping and resistance to <b>permanent</b> deformation. The <b>stripping</b> phenomena were analyzed in terms of binder–aggregate affinity through the Rolling Bottle Test and Boiling Water Test. The results showed that the weak mortar that attached to the aggregate surface produced poorer binder–aggregate affinity when the samples were subjected to mechanical agitation. However, the recycled aggregates did not affect the affinity at high temperatures and improved the resistance to permanent deformation, leading to failure of the material after many loading cycles...|$|R
40|$|The Pays de Caux, Upper Normandy, {{involves}} {{a large number}} of places with erosive phenomena. From a socio-economic point of view, the erosive damages affect both agricultural and non agricultural lands, off-site damages being the most dramatic with muddy floods and sometime the death of people. There is thus generation of negative externalities from farmers towards the other socio-economic agents. As run-off, which flows on a slope is unaware of the limits of fields and farms, the actions to be undertaken require a co-operation between farmers. But imagining a collective agricultural land management is all the more difficult. This environmental management, commanded in a way by natural process to be controlled, do not leave actors free to choose their cooperation. At the beginning of 2006, we proposed to the local actors to set up a companion modelling approach to try, {{with the assistance of the}} tools which it proposes (multi-agents systems and role playing game), to initiate a collective management of this problem. To limit erosive runoff to various scales of investigation (farms and the catchment area), several actions are tested such as implementation of <b>permanent</b> grass <b>strip</b> or buffer pond and changes in agricultural practices. The objective of this article is to present the methodology used to build a multi-agents systems and its associated role-playing game with the help of local stakeholders. These tools allow actors to “decide” future objectives concerning catchment collective management and to imagine scenarios to reach their objectives.

40|$|Buffer strip use in {{vineyard}} {{could represent}} an environmental strategy for nitrate control of surface and deep water due to agricolture managment. Buffer strip determines {{a reduction of}} soil erosion and consequently can reduce nutritive and pollulant elements losses. With the aim to evaluate buffer strips and soil managment effectiveness on nitrate control in vineyard, a trial {{was carried out in}} a South-West part of Sicily characterized by an high nitrate losses sensitivity, an annual rainfall of about 516 mm and an average temperature of 18 °C. In a vineyard on about 7 % slope and 90 m lenght a 10 meter buffer strip was seeded using a Lolium perenne permanent meadow. Vineyard was managed both traditionally and alternative management using Durum wheat cover crop and Vetch cover crop. Monthly nitrate were monitored along vineyard slope and buffer strips for all soil management options studied to evaluate buffer strip effectiveness for nitrate control. To study nitrate movement an isotopic N fertilization(using labeled Nitrogen- 15 N) was done on March just on the top of bufer strips. Lolium perenne biomass and his isotopic nitrogen content was alsomonitered. Vetch cover crop management, especially after bomass moving into the soil, promoted a nitrogen excess in comparison to traditional and durum wheat, but generally nitrate nitrate values increase from the top {{to the bottom of the}} vineyard. Buffer strip efficiency ranged between 70 and 40 % demonstrating that a nitrate control is possible only if cropping system diversification "field measures for diffusive pollution sources control" and specific " structural practices such as measures relative to landscape structure (fences, <b>permanent</b> buffer <b>strips,</b> etc.) " will turn a common agricolture practice...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWeeds are {{harmful for}} crop {{production}} but are crucial for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Two contrasting strategies exist for reconciling these ecosystem services: landsharing, where crop production and biodiversity are maximised in individual fields, or landsparing, where some fields or habitats are assigned for biodiversity conservation while the remaining fields aim to maximise production. The {{objective of the}} present study was to evaluate these two strategies in silico, based on a case study with maize-based cropping systems including genetically modified varieties that allow the use of the highly efficient herbicide glyphosate in crops. The virtual-field model FLORSYS simulates multi-species weed floras and their impact on crop production and biodiversity depending on cropping systems and pedoclimate. It was scaled up to the landscape level by simulating several fields in parallel, including semi-natural habitats and integrating between-field seed dispersal depending on plant height, seed mass and dispersal mode. Three series of scenarios were simulated over 28 years and 10 weather repetitions in a small landscape consisting of four 3 -ha fields in Aquitaine (South-Western France) : (1) landsharing scenarios based on a single diverse rotation (soybean/maize/wheat/maize), with different crop patterns in the landscape, (2) landsparing scenarios with varying proportions (ranging from 0 to 100 %) of contrasting cropping systems in the landscape, either cropping system aiming to maximise biodiversity or one aiming to maximise production, and (3) landsparing scenarios including <b>permanent</b> grass <b>strips</b> (10 % of each field). The landsharing scenario combining fields aiming to maximise crop production with either fields aiming to maximise biodiversity (25 % of landscape) or grass strips (10 % of landscape) were best, resulting in high crop production and medium biodiversity at the landscape scale. Landsharing scenarios always produced less biodiversity and less production. When more crops and cropping systems were grown each year in the landscape, the weed impact on production and biodiversity was higher and more stable over the years. These results are case-specific; new simulations and rules are needed for different types of cropping systems, landscapes and pedoclimates, and the performance of the best solutions should be tested in field studies...|$|R

The tools used in this discovery process are a qualitative analysis of farmers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of conservation technologies, an analysis of the adoption and diffusion model, and the formulation of a local dependency theory to explain the patterns of adoption on Iowa farms. Specifically, this investigation comes {{to the conclusion that the}} Iowa farmer is trapped in a dependency situation that is controlled by the government, trans-national corporations, and local capital, a triad known as the triple alliance. The resulting dependency hampers the adoption of technologies that do not benefit the triple alliance;The argument is based on an USDA funded study of mid-western farmers known as the Management Systems Evaluations Area project, or MSEA.

40|$|Topsoil is a {{valuable}} resource for agricultural production. Any destructive changes in {{the quantity and quality}} of topsoil can deteriorate the on-site and off-site environment and be detrimental to agricultural production. Small scale mountain agro-ecosystems are particularly sensitive to soil degradation and their productivity is heavily influenced by soil quality. The appropriate plant selection, cultivation and soil conservation techniques can help provide income in the long term as well as prevent or reduce land degradation. This research provides information and possible solutions to farmers and soil conservationists on the sustained utilization and maintenance of small-scale mountain agro-ecosystems in Hungary and France with the view to prevent or reduce soil erosion damage for long term sustainability. Vegetation cover is of major importance for soil protection, especially on slopes. The role of vegetation in improving soil stability is widely recognized. And while vegetation is able to improve soil stability through both its above-ground and below-ground biomass, few studies have focussed on the significance of the root system. The root system is particularly important when above-ground vegetation is absent for some time. Therefore, this study investigated root characteristics and how root systems contribute to reducing topsoil erosion in mountainous agro-ecosystems. The morphological and functional traits of roots of various plant species (tree, shrub and herbaceous) and their efficiency in erosion control were first determined. In particular, the root system of Mahonia aquifolium was studied. The Mahonia aquifolium shrub has been cultivated in Hungary for decades. Due to its wide marketability as well as its high adaptability to soil and site conditions it is of interest to determine its potential for soil erosion control. Laboratory, field and modelling studies were carried out to evaluate the suitability of Mahonia aquifolium for soil erosion reduction. An existing reinforcement model was applied to evaluate and compare the root system of Mahonia aquifolium with tree, herbaceous and shrub species for soil reinforcement. The results show that the root system of Mahonia aquifolium is comparable in terms of slope stabilization with other plant species that are used or could potentially be used for slope stabilization. Plot based field studies on soil loss and runoff with different ages of Mahonia aquifolium shrubs were carried out and confirmed the plant’s suitability as effective erosion control. Such soil conservation techniques are significant factors in the stabilisation of the soil and for long-term sustainable use of small-scale mountainous agro-ecosystems. The use of <b>permanent</b> vegetation <b>strips</b> between crops on cultivated slopes is a common and effective way to trap runoff and sediment. Therefore the effectiveness of Mahonia aquifolium strips on soil erosion control under various bio-physical conditions was investigated by model simulations. The outcome of the empirical soil erosion model simulations confirmed that contour strips of Mahonia aquifolium on sloping agricultural fields can reduce soil loss up to 73 % and runoff up to 13 % on the selected crop fields. The results also show that steeper slopes can be used for agricultural plant production both on small-scale and large-scale if Mahonia aquifolium strips are applied...|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) {{has been}} {{identified}} as “key” technology for the production of primary aerospace structures, being able to substitute conventional riveted airframes. FSW is a solid state welding process that avoids any problems caused by the solidification of the melted weld pool. Besides the production of high quality similar joints from high strength aluminum alloys, it allows for joining materials of different metallurgical characteristics. However, problems concerning the corrosion behavior of dissimilar joints may arise, since aircrafts operate in corrosive media. For the safe implementation of dissimilar joints, a good understanding of the relevant corrosion mechanisms is crucial. In this study, the correlation between microstructure, local strength and corrosion behavior of dissimilar FSW joints produced from 2024 A and 6056 alloys in two different tempering conditions was investigated. The heat affected zone of 6056 in 2024 A-T 3 / 6056 -T 6 as-welded joints could easily be identified by a marked hardness drop. Coarsening and dissolution of strengthening precipitates in that region brought about the weakest link during static tensile tests. Because of the low strength of as-welded dissimilar joints, welds were also produced from 6056 in the naturally aged T 4 condition. After FSW, these joints were aged at 190 °C for 10 h resulting in a 2024 A-T 8 / 6056 -T 7 X tempering condition. Due to a more homogeneous precipitation of hardening particles, the post-weld heat treatment improved hardness and static strength remarkably. The corrosion performance of the dissimilar joints observed in various immersion tests was governed by galvanic coupling between both aluminum alloys. For as-welded joints, the more active 6056 -T 6 alloy provided cathodic protection to 2024 -T 3 when exposed to aqueous chloride solutions, particularly under <b>permanent</b> immersion conditions. <b>Strips</b> of alloy 6056 being present in the nugget region corroded preferentially. A significant improvement of the corrosion behavior was observed {{in the case of the}} post-weld heat treated 2024 A-T 8 / 6056 - T 7 X joints. Although corrosion potential of both alloys considerably decreased, the difference between them was also reduced. Therefore, the post weld heat treatment equalized the corrosive attack and suppressed preferential dissolution of 6056 alloy...|$|R
