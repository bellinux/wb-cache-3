40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method of bone fracture evaluation based on A-Mode ultrasound. Utilising the <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> method, the <b>attenuation</b> of 1 MHz ultrasound wave propagating through a normal and fractured bone was investigated. Two types of bone fracture were investigated, namely the linear fracture and comminuted fracture. An ultrasound transducer {{was used to}} transmit the sound wave to the normal and fractured bone in the body, simulated using a goat’s bone encased in gelatine. The transducer then captured the reflected echoes to be viewed via an oscilloscope. The echo signal indicated the time used by the sound wave to travel {{back and forth from}} the bone surface. The echo was filtered and the power spectral density was calculated for attenuation measurement based on insertion loss method. The comparison of power spectral density from a normal and fractured bone showed that average signal power on the fractured bone was lower than the normal bone by 4. 3 dB for both linear and comminuted fractures. Based on the result, the ultrasound signal attenuation showed a potential for use to detect bone fracture; nevertheless, further studies are still needed to determine the type of fractures. The present finding shows the potential of ultrasound in diagnosing bone fracture as an adjunct to x-ray imaging...|$|R

Gray matter, which contains multiple cell types and fibers, exhibits a more complicated <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> profile than the phantom.

Experimental evidence is given that, when the acoustic echo path is almost linear, computationally complicated algorithms (such as RLSor APA) give considerable better <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> than normalized LMS, {{but this is not the}} case when there are considerable nonlinearities (i. e. acoustic distortion) in the echo path. However, it is illustrated that when a suitable nonlinear preprocessor is added to produce acoustic distortion to adaptive linear filter input then the more complicated algorithms give better overall <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> than normalized LMS.

The study uses Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo-based techniques in the gas-phase, {{with the aim of}} obtaining more sophisticated information than just translational self-diffusion coefficients. <b>Pulsed</b> Gradient <b>Echo</b> studies of continuous flow laser-polarized xenon gas in unrestricted tubing indicate clear diffraction minima resulting from a wide distribution of velocities in the flow field. The maximum velocity experienced in the flow can be calculated from this minimum, and is seen to agree with the information from the complete velocity spectrum, or motion propagator, as well as previously published images.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of a spatial acoustical impression is one aim of high-quality video conferencing systems. Therefore, the {{transmission of}} stereo speech signals is a major task of such a device. Compared to the mono-case, specific problems arise, if an acoustic echo canceller (AEC) is one component of the transmission device. Its <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> in the receiving room degrades, if spatial statistics in the sending room vary. Simulation results indicate that short echo cancellers are less sensitive regarding this “stereo problem”. However, to achieve sufficient <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> a post-filter should be applied. In this paper, we introduce a new method to design a post-filter for stereo acoustic echo cancellation. A vital task during the design procedure is the estimation of the residual echo’s power spectral density (PSD) at {{the output of the}} stereo acoustic echo canceller (Stereo AEC). This estimate is sensitive regarding the “stereo problem”, too. Therefore, we show up an effective way to increase its robustness and give a theoretical foundation. The result is a combination of a short Stereo AEC and a post-filter, which reveals less and shorter degradation of <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> after spatial modifications in the sending room than a long Stereo AEC, which shows the same steady-state performance. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} a new technique to estimate the residual echo at the output of an acoustic echo canceller (AEC). It is known that the compensation filter of the AEC {{has to be very}} long in reverberant environments in order to provide sufficient <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation.</b> However, high filter or-ders involve long convergence periods during initialisation or after modifications of the echo path impulse response. In these periods poor <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> leads to undesired artifacts. One possible solution to this problem is to use a low-order and quickly converging AEC in combination with a Wiener post-filter after the AEC. Therefore, the power spectral density (PSD) of the residual echo has to be esti-mated properly. However, the problem is to achieve reliable estimates in periods of double-talk or during modifications of the echo path impulse response. This paper suggests a new method for estimating the residual echo with the help of minimum statistics to suppress interferences by near-end speech during double-talk situations. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>echo</b> signals {{measured}} in ultrasonic NDT include {{the effect of}} the measuring systems, the propagation paths taken by the ultrasonic waves, and are corrupted by additive noise. For instance, the ultrasonic signals for a particular reflector recorded under the same conditions, but using different transducers can be quiet different. This leads to the difficulty of comparing and analyzing signals particularly in automated defect identification systems employing different transducers. Generally, it is assumed that the measured <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> is obtained by linearly convolving the defect impulse response with the measured system response. Deconvolution operation therefore, seeks to undo {{the effect of the}} convolution and extract the defect impulse response which is an essential step for the identification and characterization of defects. Conventional deconvolution techniques such as least square, Wiener filter, and minimum variance deconvolution [1] are based on a priori knowledge of second-order statistics (SOS) of the noise and the input signal. In practice however, ultrasonic <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> signals are found to be non-minimum phase systems and the acoustic noise due to scattering from the grains inside the propagation medium does not have a readily known statistic [2]. SOS-based deconvolution techniques, being phase-blind cannot therefore, accurately estimate the defect impulse response...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Translational {{diffusion}} is {{the most}} fundamental form of transport in chemical and biochemical systems. Pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance provides a convenient and noninvasive means for measuring translational motion. In this method the <b>attenuation</b> of the <b>echo</b> signal from a Hahn spin-echo pulse sequence containing a magnetic field gradient pulse in each � period is {{used to measure the}} displacement of the observed spins. In the present article, the physical basis of this method is considered in detail. Starting from the Bloch equations containing diffusion terms, the (analytical) equation linking the <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> to the diffusion of the spin for the case of unrestricted isotropic diffusion is derived. When the motion of the spin occurs within a confined geometry or is anisotropic, such as in in vivo systems, the <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> also yields information on the surrounding structure, but as the analytical approach becomes mathematically intractable, approximate or numerical means must be used to extract the motional information.

A major drawback of the established methods are the relatively long recording times needed to acquire the spectra, excluding the monitoring of rapidly progressing reactions and (hence) measurements of less stable components. In order to overcome these shortcomings a new pulse sequence, Difftrain, has been developed.
