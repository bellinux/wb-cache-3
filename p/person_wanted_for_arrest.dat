Taylor mistakenly {{identified}} Woolmudgin as a <b>person</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> {{an armed}} attack. He tied Woolmudgin {{to a tree}} and placed a shepherd named John Whitehead as sentry while he went to notify the authorities. Whitehead later shot Woolmudgin and dumped his body in the Barwon River. Whitehead was arrested and Taylor was placed on a ₤50 bond as a witness. At the subsequent trial, Taylor failed to appear and Whitehead was acquitted. Captain William Lonsdale wrote that he thought Taylor [...] "entertained a strong suspicion that he had given strong encouragement to the prisoner Whitehead to commit the murder". Taylor then avoided any further legal scrutiny by fleeing to Van Diemen's Land.|$|R

He entered a handsome building, and being early had his choice of the great dailies, neatly cut and arranged upon rollers for him. One by one he read them through with feverish interest, and when he set them down he laughed softly to himself. There was not one of them which did not chronicle the death of Douglas Guest on the Midland Express, and refer to him as the <b>person</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> the Feldwick murder.

50|$|Salomon {{was born}} in 1815 in Les Cayes. His family was {{influential}} in the tiny black elite of the south. Prominent and educated, his family often clashed with the relatively more powerful mulatto elite of south Haiti. During the regime of Charles Rivière-Hérard, the Salomons were <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> <b>arrest</b> after a heated battle with the mulattoes and exiled to Neyba. As Faustin Soulouque came into power, Salomon returned along with other powerful black leaders to serve the new government. Salomon became the minister of finance under Faustin and began to monopolize export transactions in coffee and cotton, run foreign imports through state monopolies, and impose levies on capital. As a result, smuggling and piracy exploded during Soulouque's reign. After the fall of Soulouque, Salomon was exiled to Paris and London, where he read and traveled widely.|$|R

50|$|Sudetendeutsches Freikorps was {{a factual}} {{successor}} to Freiwillinger Schutzdienst, {{also known as}} Ordnersgruppe, an organization that had been established by the Sudeten German Party in Czechoslovakia unofficially in 1933 and officially on 17 May 1938, following the example of Sturmabteilung, the original paramilitary wing of the German Nazi Party. Officially being registered as promoter organization, the Freiwillinger Schutzdienst was dissolved on 16 September 1938 by the Czechoslovak authorities due to its implication in large number of criminal and terrorist activities. Many of its members as well as leadership, <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> <b>arrest</b> by Czechoslovak authorities, had moved to Germany where they became the basis of Sudetendeutsches Freikorps, conducting Freikorps' first cross-border raids into Czechoslovakia only few hours after its official establishment. Due to the smooth transition between the two organizations, similar membership, Nazi Germany's sponsorship and application of the same tactic of cross-border raids, some authors often don't particularly distinguish between the actions of Ordners (i.e. up to 16 September 1938) and Freikorps (i.e. from 17 September 1938).|$|R

50|$|Koo {{also was}} {{involved}} {{in the formation of the}} League of Nations as China's first representative to the newly formed League. From 1922, Koo served successively as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister. He was twice Acting Premier, in 1924 and again in 1926 during a period of chaos in Beijing under Zhang Zuolin in 1926-7. Koo was Acting Premier from 1 October 1926 and acted concurrently as Interim President. He served as Premier from January until June 1927, when Zhang organised a military government and Koo resigned. After the Northern Expedition toppled the government in Beijing in 1928, he was briefly <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> <b>arrest</b> by the new Nationalist government in Nanjing, but through Zhang Xueliang's mediation he was reconciled with the new government and returned to the diplomatic service. He represented China at the League of Nations to protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. He served as the Chinese Ambassador to France from 1936-1940, until France was occupied by Germany. Afterwards, he was the Chinese Ambassador to the Court of St James's until 1946. In 1945, Koo was one of the founding delegates of the United Nations. He later became the Chinese Ambassador to the United States and focused in maintaining the alliance between the Republic of China and the United States as the Kuomintang began losing to the Communists and had to retreat to Taiwan.|$|R

[...] Jones and Higgins wrote up a document about the incident called [...] "Kidnapped/Held Incommunicado," [...] which {{was sent to the}} national press, and on March 3, 1997, was forwarded to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.

During this time, Jones's novel The Healing {{was in the process of}} being released. Higgins began to bombard the Lexington police, calling them and writing them multiple times a day. A letter that arrived to the police station on February 20, 1998, indicated a bomb threat, and police figured out that Higgins, who at the time was using the alias Bob Jones, was previously <b>wanted</b> <b>for</b> <b>arrest.</b> After a standoff with police at their residence, Higgins committed suicide and Jones was put on suicide watch.

2500|$|Kant {{begins his}} new {{argument}} in Section II with some observations about rational willing. All things in nature must act according to laws, but only rational beings act {{in accordance with}} the representation of a law. In other words, only rational beings have the capacity to recognize and consult laws and principles in order to guide their actions. Thus, only rational creatures have practical reason. [...] The laws and principles that rational agents consult yield imperatives, or rules that necessitate the will. For example, if a <b>person</b> <b>wants</b> to qualify <b>for</b> nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will recognize and consult the rules that tell him how to achieve this goal. These rules will provide him with imperatives that he must follow as long as he <b>wants</b> to qualify <b>for</b> nationals.|$|R

40|$|End of life care in England has {{recently}} been framed by two very different discourses. One (connected to advance care planning) promotes personal choice, the other promotes compassionate care; both are prominent in professional, policy and media settings. The article outlines the history of who promoted each discourse from 2008 to 2014, when, why and how and this was done. Each discourse is then critically analysed from a standpoint that takes account of bodily decline, structural constraints, and human relationality. We focus on the biggest group of those {{nearing the end of}} their life, namely frail very old people suffering multiple conditions. In their care within contemporary healthcare organisations, choice becomes a tick box and compassion a commodity. Informed choice, whether {{at the end of life}} or in advance of it, does not guarantee the death the <b>person</b> <b>wants,</b> especially <b>for</b> those dying of conditions other than cancer and in the absence of universally available skilled and compassionate care. Enabling healthcare staff to provide compassionate, relational care, however, implies reversing the philosophical, political and financial direction of healthcare in the UK and most other Anglophone countries...|$|R
2500|$|Kant {{thinks that}} all of our actions, whether {{motivated}} by inclination or morality, must follow some law. For example, if a <b>person</b> <b>wants</b> to qualify <b>for</b> nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will have to follow a law that tells him to practice his backhand pass, among other things. Notice, however, that this law is only binding on the <b>person</b> who <b>wants</b> to qualify <b>for</b> nationals in ultimate frisbee. In this way, it is contingent upon the ends that he sets and the circumstances that he is in. We know from the third proposition, however, that the moral law must bind universally and necessarily, that is, regardless of ends and circumstances. [...] At this point, Kant asks, ‘what kind of law can that be, the representation of which must determine the will, even without regard for the effect expected from it...?’ (4:402) He concludes that the only remaining alternative is a law that reflects only the form of law itself, namely that of universality. [...] Thus, Kant arrives at his well-known categorical imperative, the moral law referenced in the above discussion of duty. Kant defines the categorical imperative as the following: “I ought never to act except {{in such a way that}} I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.” (4:402) ...|$|R
