All lubricants reacted with the oxygen, leading to fires and other failures. The solution was to lubricate the bearing with the oxygen. Although liquid oxygen is a poor lubricant, it was adequate, since the service life of the pump was just a few hours.|$|E

50|$|The rotor is {{stabilized}} {{in all of}} its {{six degrees}} of freedom. One degree is governed by the electric motor. Minimally, this degree must be stabilized electronically (or by a diamagnetic material, which is too unstable to be used in a precision <b>pump</b> <b>bearing).</b> Another way (ignoring losses in magnetic cores at high frequencies) is to construct this bearing as an axis with a sphere at each end. These spheres are inside hollow static spheres. On the surface of each sphere is a checkerboard pattern of inwards and outwards going magnetic field lines. As the checkerboard pattern of the static spheres is rotated, the rotor rotates. In this construction no axis is made stable on the cost of making another axis unstable, but all axes are neutral and the electronic regulation is less stressed and will be more dynamically stable. Hall effect sensors can be used to sense the rotational position and the other degrees of freedom can be measured capacitively.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{engine and}} all related systems are {{inspected}} and what ever {{is necessary to}} get them into original presale condition is done. The engine and all of the ancillary components - starter, generator/alternator, radiator, distributor, carburettor and all others - must be inspected and corrected to factory specifications. The engine itself, plus the transmission, clutch, overdrive unit, and even the driveshaft must be meticulously inspected, cleaned, and measured for wear. This will show up as deviation from original factory specifications. All of the parts - block, crankcase, head, transmission housing, etc. - should be inspected for cracks or other damage. All moving parts - pistons, crankshaft, camshaft, oil <b>pump,</b> <b>bearing</b> and bushings, flywheel, water pump and all others - must be cleaned and measured against factory specifications and, if necessary, machined or re-manufactured to bring them within specifications. The same goes for the transmission, clutch, differential and all other moving parts of the power line and drive line. All of the electrical system has to be inspected and, if it shows chafing, wear or damage, replaced. If the car is old enough to have used rubber or even fabric based electrical wiring insulation, this should be replaced even if looks okay and upgraded to modern insulation because it is a fire risk. Then the entire engine/driveline will have to be reassembled, replacing all worn bearing and bushings, seals, gaskets, belts and gears.|$|E

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of geothermal resources often requires that naturally heated subterranean brines be pumped {{to the surface}} from depths of up to 6000 feet underground while minimizing heat losses and maintaining sufficient fluid pressure to prevent boiling.

40|$|Dynamic {{analysis}} of an unbalanced rotor-water pump-bearing system considering varying compliance effect and localized defects on bearing races Zheng-mei Li 1, Qiong Zhou 2, Qi An 1 and Zheng-dong Wang 1 A multi-degree of freedom (DOF) dynamic model is developed using the {{transfer matrix method}} to obtain the vibration response of an unbalanced rotor-coaxial water <b>pump</b> <b>bearing</b> system due to varying compliance and localized race defects of the bearing. In this model, the bending flexibility and masses of the rotor and bearing housing are taken into consideration. The two rolling element rows of the water <b>pump</b> <b>bearing</b> are modeled {{as a series of}} springs and dampers, and the anisotropic bearing stiffness and damping changing with the rotational speed are analyzed. The varying compliance and the localized race defect are both modeled as periodic excitations, on which the influences of the unbalanced forces in the rotor are considered. By using the vibration model, the discrete frequency spectra of vibration responses caused by the varying compliance and localized race defects of the two rolling element rows are predicted. The results show that for the varying compliance or a race defect of an individual rolling element rows, there are a series of additional components in the frequency spectrum in addition to the peaks at the harmonics of characteristic frequency due to the effect of the rotor unbalance. The response amplitude due to varying compliance of the roller row is found to be quite high in comparison to that due to varying compliance of the ball row because the axial load carried by the ball row uniforms the contact load distribution among balls and then reduces the varying compliance excitation...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 103 As many as 91 {{percent of}} all rolling element {{bearings}} fail to achieve their calculated theoretical lifetimes. One of the primary reasons for this failure is contamination of the lubricants. Past practice for protecting bearing from contamination includes the use of lip seals and labyrinth isolators, but both of these solution suffer from certain shortcomings that lead to premature bearing failures. Using modern mechanical seal technology, {{it is now possible}} to hermetically seal <b>pump</b> <b>bearing</b> housings, gearboxes, and other rotating equipment, so as to completely contain the lubricant and totally exclude contaminants. With this hermetic seal in place, it is easier to cost-justify the use of superior (but more costly) synthetic lubricants, and lower the total cost of operating the equipment significantly...|$|E

40|$|Condition-based {{maintenance}} (CBM) is {{an advanced}} maintenance strategy in which maintenance actions are scheduled based {{on both the}} age data and condition monitoring information. Proportional Hazards Model (PHM) is a powerful statistical tool for estimating the equipment failure rate under condition monitoring. Effective CBM using PHM can decrease the overall maintenance costs by reducing unnecessary scheduled preventive maintenance actions. In CBM using PHM, main optimization objectives including minimizing maintenance costs and maximizing equipment reliability typically conflict to each other. But the reported research only focuses on single-objective. In this thesis, we propose a multiple-objective CBM optimization approach based on physical programming, which can systematically balance the tradeoff between the optimization objectives and find the optimal solution that best represents the decision maker's preference on the objectives. In CBM using PHM, the accuracy of parameter estimation greatly affects {{the accuracy of the}} model in representing and predicting the equipment health condition. Traditional optimization methods such as Newton's methods are inaccurate because they can only find local optimal value in parameter estimation. In this thesis, we develop an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) for PHM parameter estimation and this approach can improve the accuracy of parameter estimation significantly. To illustrate the proposed approaches, we conduct two case studies using real-world vibration monitoring data, shearing <b>pump</b> <b>bearings</b> in a food processing plant and Gould <b>pump</b> <b>bearings</b> at Canadian Kraft Mill. The proposed approaches contribute to the general knowledge of condition based maintenance, and have the potential to greatly benefit various industries...|$|R

The heat transport pumps for a new reactor have been qualified by full-scale testing under simulated field conditions.
