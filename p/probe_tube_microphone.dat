40|$|A study {{realised}} among 60 {{children by}} means of a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> <b>microphone</b> allowed us to determine the mean ear canal resonance by the newborn and the young children. This is noticeably less than the adult one. The ear canal reaches its adult physiology after one year, so it implies a somewhat different auditory sensibility by the newborns than by the adults, particularly in the 2000 - 4000 Hz range. We suggest that the A. B. R. wave I latency and thresholds modifications during children's first year of life are (at least partially and in the majority of cases) an ear canal physiological variation effect and that different calibrations should be used for newborns screening test and for adults purposes.

40|$|In the {{experiments}} reported here, the amplitude and the latency of human compound action potentials (CAPs) evoked from a chirp stimulus are {{compared to those}} evoked from a traditional click stimulus. The chirp stimulus was created with a frequency sweep to compensate for basilar membrane traveling wave delay using the O-Chirp equations from Fobel and Dau [(2004). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 116, 2213 – 2222] derived from otoacoustic emission data. Human cochlear traveling wave delay estimates were obtained from derived compound band action potentials provided by Eggermont [(1979). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 65, 463 – 470]. CAPs were recorded from an electrode placed on the tympanic membrane (TM), and the acoustic signals were monitored with a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> <b>microphone</b> attached to the TM electrode. Results showed that the amplitude and latency of chirp-evoked N 1 of the CAP differed from click-evoked CAPs in several regards. For the chirp-evoked CAP, the N 1 amplitude was significantly larger than the click-evoked N 1 s. The latency-intensity function was significantly shallower for chirp-evoked CAPs as compared to click-evoked CAPs. This suggests that auditory nerve fibers respond with more unison to a chirp stimulus than to a click stimulus...|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous otoacoustic {{emissions}} (SOAEs) and synchronized spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SSOAEs) {{were recorded}} using both the standard closed-canal method of recording and a novel open-canal method which involved suspending the probe {{at the entrance}} to the ear canal with no occluding tip. In both conditions, a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> <b>microphone</b> was inserted down the ear canal to measure the acoustic pressure near the tympanic membrane. Open- and closed-canal recordings were obtained in twelve otologically normal ears, all of which exhibited SSOAEs, and 6 of which exhibited SOAEs. The results were analysed to identify any differences in response to frequency and amplitude. The different recording conditions appeared to have no significant effect on SOAE or SSOAE frequency, suggesting little effect on the SOAE generator within the cochlea. Below about 2 kHz, the amplitude for both types of emission was less for the open-canal recording when compared to the closed-canal recordings. Above 2 kHz, SSOAE amplitudes were greater in the open- than the closed-canal condition. Model stimulations of the ear canal and middle-ear acoustics are presented which were in qualitative agreement with the results shown for the effects on emission amplitudes. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{conduction}} {{sound transmission}} {{in the human}} skull and the occlusion effect were estimated from hearing thresholds and ear-canal sound pressure (ECSP) measured by a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> <b>microphone</b> when stimulation was at three positions on the skull (ipsilateral mastoid, contralateral mastoid, and forehead). The measurements were done with the ear-canal open as well as occluded by an ear-plug. Depending on the estimation method, transcranial transmission at frequencies below 1  kHz was between − 8 and 5  dB, around 0  dB at 1  kHz that decreased with frequency to between − 17 and − 7  dB at 8  kHz. The forehead transmission was, except at frequencies between 1 and 2  kHz, similar to that proposed in the standard ISO: 389 - 3 (1994) when the threshold measurements were conducted with open ear-canals. Compared with the same measurements using hearing thresholds, the ECSP gave similar transmission results at most frequencies, but differed at 0. 5, 0. 75, 2 and 3  kHz. One probable reason for the differences between thresholds and ECSP might be a significant perception improvement (lower thresholds) when the stimulation was at the ipsilateral mastoid that was not found at the other positions. This improvement, which also was present in the occlusion effect data, was hypothesized to originate in greater sensitivity of the cochlea for vibration {{in line with the}} ipsilateral stimulation direction than from other directions...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of human ear canal orientation to tympanic membrane (TM) surface motion and sound pressure distribution near the TM surface is investigated {{by using an}} artificial ear canal (aEC) similar in dimensions to the natural human ear canal. The aEC replaced the bony ear canal of cadaveric human temporal bones. The radial orientation of the aEC relative to the manubrium of the TM was varied. Tones of 0. 2 to 18. 4 kHz delivered through the aEC induced surface motions of the TM that were quantified using stroboscopic holography; the distribution of sound in {{the plane of the}} tympanic ring PTR was measured with a <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> <b>microphone.</b> The results suggest that the ear canal orientation has no substantial effect on TM surface motions, but PTR at frequencies above 10 kHz is influenced by the ear canal orientation. The complex TM surface motion patterns observed at frequencies above a few kilohertz are not correlated with simpler variations in PTR distribution at the same frequencies, suggesting that the complex sound-induced TM motions are more related to the TM mechanical properties, shape, and boundary conditions rather than to spatial variations in the acoustic stimulus.

30|$|SAGD {{horizontal}} wells {{are used}} to enhance oil recovery from heavy oil reservoirs. This technology requires precise separation between the production well and the injection well to ensure the efficient drainage of the reservoir. By studying {{the attitude of the}} downhole <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> and the production well trajectory, an algorithm is proposed for eliminating ferromagnetic interference while drilling injection wells. A high accuracy filter circuit has been designed to correct the detected magnetic signals, which are ultra-weak, frequency-instable, and narrow-band. The directional drilling magnetic guidance system (DD-MGS) has been developed by integrating these advanced techniques. It contains a sub-system for the ranging calculation software, a magnetic source, a downhole <b>probe</b> <b>tube</b> and a sub-system for collecting & processing the detected signals. The DD-MGS has succeeded in oilfield applications. It can guide the directional drilling trajectory not only in the horizontal section but also in the build section of horizontal injection wells.

A primary alternative to the expensive condenser microphone is the dynamic microphone, used more often in live performances due to its durability. The major disadvantages of condenser microphones are their expense and fragility. Also, most condenser microphones require phantom power, unlike dynamic microphones. Conversely, the disadvantages of dynamic microphones are they do not generally possess the wide spectrum of condenser microphones and their frequency response is not as uniform.
