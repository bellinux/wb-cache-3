40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between placental territory and birthweight discordance and vascular anastomoses in monochorionic diamniotic twin placentas from pregnancies that were not complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome with 2 liveborn twins. Study Design Placentas originated from a prospective follow-up study of monochorionic diamniotic twins included in the first trimester. After injection with dyed barium sulphate, a digital x-ray angiography and high-resolution digital photograph were taken. The 2 venous territories were delineated on the angiogram. The diameter of each arterioarterial anastomosis and of each vein that participated in an arteriovenous anastomosis was measured on the digital photograph. Net transfusion over the arteriovenous anastomoses was calculated as the difference between the total venous diameters of the 2 placental parts. Results: One hundred placentas were analyzed. Birthweight discordance increased with placental territory discordance (P <. 0001). Arterioarterial <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> <. 01), net arteriovenous transfusion (P <. 001), and total anastomotic <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> <. 01) increased with placental territory discordance. On the other hand, birthweight discordance for a given placental territory discordance decreased with increasing arterioarterial <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> <. 01), net arteriovenous transfusion (P <. 001), and total anastomotic <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> <. 01). Conclusion: In unequally shared placentas, the 2 fetal circulations are more tightly linked than in equally shared placentas, which may reduce the birthweight discordance for a given placental territory discordance...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{provides}} {{analysis of}} the first Allegro (“Eden Valley”) and the coda from Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring. Following Joseph Straus and Arthur Berger, this investigation traces the correspondences of the work’s <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> with other <b>pitch</b> components of the music’s surface. The varied musical approaches of the Allegro—functional progressions, polychords, quartal trichords, chains of triads related by half or whole step, and pandiatonic melodies—coalesce to create a multi-faceted movement from centricity on A to centricity on F, while also presenting unique, individual narratives of that procession to F. In Appalachian Spring’s coda, both A and F reappear in marked contexts, and the coda’s overall focus on C recalls an important role C had in {{the progress of the}} Allegro. The resulting tonal connections span the entire composition. This linking of <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> with other musical elements can yield analytic insights into a large cross-section of repertoire cutting across stylistic and historical boundaries. In that respect, this analysis illustrates an approach potentially appropriate to any pitch-centric music...|$|R

The alto and bass voices, again always playing an M role, are mirrored, and the soprano and tenor T-voices alternate above and below the M-voices. While both are centered on E, the M-voices use E Phrygian against E major in the T-voices; this makes for striking cross-relations between G-natural and G-sharp, though the two never sound at the same time. Pilate, like Christ, is accompanied only by the organ, but sings in faster rhythmic values and has a higher tessitura. Pilate's part is the most unstable in the piece, created in part through the use of an M-voice centered on B and a T-voice centered on F (a tritone apart) and through the refusal of Pilate to be either a T-voice or M-voice, always alternating between these two roles.|$|R

We enrolled 75 patients on hemodialysis, including 34 women, in our prospective study. The mean age was 42. 5 ± 13. 8 years. The echocardiographic parameters were all measured within 2 h after a dialysis session. The study population was divided into two groups: Group- 1 consisted of patients on dialysis for 5 years. The two groups were similar regarding demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors. On univariate analysis, a statistically significant difference was seen in the left ventricular end-diastolic <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 002), left ventricular end-syslotic <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 008), left ventricular mass (P = 0. 006), inter-ventricular septum (P = 0. 024), mitral flow deceleration time (P = 0. 03), tricuspid anteroposterior systolic excursion (P = 0. 01), inferior vena cava <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 04), left atrial size (P = 0. 02), valvular calcification (P = 0. 01) and pericardial effusion (P = 0. 01) between the two groups.

In this study, we assessed the extent {{and nature of the}} flexibility of these rings in vivo, which has not been objectively demonstrated. Methods. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography was used intraoperatively to acquire data regarding dynamic motion of mitral annuli and annuloplasty rings in 33 patients undergoing mitral repair (15 CG Future and 18 CE Physio II) and in 15 control patients. Data were analyzed to assess the dynamic changes in annular geometry after implantation of selectively flexible rings. Results. After annuloplasty, there was an immediate and significant decrease in annular displacement (p < 0. 001) and annular displacement velocity (p < 0. 01). Dynamic change in multiple variables including anteroposterior <b>diameter</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001) and annular area (p < 0. 001) was also significantly depressed. In comparison with normal mitral valves, partially flexible rings allowed limited dynamic motion: percentage changes in anteroposterior <b>diameter</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001), anterolateral posteromedial <b>diameter</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001), and total circumference (p < 0. 001) were significantly lower. Compared with each other, the two rings resulted in similar changes in anterior annulus length (p = 0. 93), posterior annular length (p = 0. 82), and annular area (p = 0. 31). Conclusions. Mitral annular dynamics were uniformly depressed after implantation of these rings. Selective flexibility could not be demonstrated in vivo using echocardiographic data.

The present experiment investigated the effect of lighting schedule and light-dark transition during the first days of a broiler chicken's life on leg bone development. In 2 experiments, Ross- 308 broiler chicks (n = 2, 500 per experiment) were subjected to 1 of 5 treatments for 4 d: 24 L; 2 L: 1 D lighting schedule with either an abrupt or gradual light-dark transition (“dimming”); and a 2 L: 6 D lighting schedule with an abrupt transition or dimming. At d 4, tibia and femur weight, length, and diameter, yolk free body mass, organ weights, realized weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and mortality were determined. In Experiment 2, chick length and relative asymmetry of the femur and tibia were determined additionally. Data were analyzed using orthogonal contrasts. 24 L resulted in higher femur <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 028; both experiments), tibia <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 001; Experiment 1), relative asymmetry of tibia length (P = 0. 002; Experiment 2), and relative asymmetry of femur length (P = 0. 003) than applying a light-dark schedule. A 2 L: 1 D lighting schedule resulted in higher femur length (P = 0. 039; Experiment 1) and relative asymmetry of tibia length (P = 0. 032; Experiment 2) and lower relative asymmetry of tibia <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 016) than a 2 L: 6 D lighting schedule. An abrupt light-dark transition resulted in higher relative asymmetry of tibia length (P = 0. 004; Experiment 2) and relative asymmetry of tibia <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 018) than dimming. To conclude, leg bone development in the first 4 d of a broiler chicken's life was higher for 24 L than when a lighting schedule was applied, but relative asymmetry was higher as well, suggesting developmental instability. The effect of dimming on leg bone development was less pronounced, but the decreased relative asymmetry levels in the dimming treatment suggested lower environmental stress than for the abrupt light-dark transition...|$|R

This study assessed the progression of autograft root diameters {{and its effect on}} aortic regurgitation (AR). Methods: Neoaortic echo dimensions from 48 children (< 16 years) undergoing Ross operation who had follow-up echocardiograms before age 20 were analyzed (mean follow-up, 5. 1 ± 3. 3 years). Results: The mean age {{at the time of the}} Ross operation was 10. 0 ± 4. 3 years. Mean z values of the neoaortic annulus (1. 5 ± 0. 4), sinus (2. 5 ± 0. 4), and sinotubular junction (2. 6 ± 0. 9) when the autograft was implanted were significantly larger compared with normal values (p < 0. 001, all). The mean z values significantly increased with follow-up at the level of the sinus (0. 5 ± 0. 1 /year, p < 0. 001) and the sinotubular junction (0. 7 ± 0. 2, p < 0. 001), but not at the level of the annulus (0. 1 ± 0. 1, p = 0. 59). AR increased with follow-up time (0. 07 ± 0. 02 grade/year, p < 0. 001). AR increased with sinotubular junction <b>diameter</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 028), but there was not significant evidence of an association with annulus <b>diameter</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 25) or sinus <b>diameter</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 40).

Measurements were performed on cytologic imprint technique smears in five cases from each ER strata, using a computer-assisted tracing device. Nuclear, cytoplasmic, and cellular parameters were measured on 50 cells per case. The cytometric findings were correlated with ER concentrations. A statistically significant correlation between decreasing area (P = 0. 011), perimeter (P = 0. 015), maximum <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 034), minimum <b>diameter</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 008), and volume (P = 0. 01) of nuclei and increasing ER levels was found.

This study aims to investigate whether ovarian stimulation deranges the homocysteine pathway thereby affecting the pre-ovulatory follicle. METHODS: Blood samples were collected on cycle day 2 and the day of hCG administration in 181 women undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF. In each subject, {{the diameter of the}} two leading follicles was measured and the corresponding follicular fluids were collected. In blood and follicular fluid samples, total homocysteine (tHcy), folate, cobalamin and pyridoxal' 5 -phosphate (PLP) were determined. According to the blood folate levels, women were classified as either folic acid supplemented (n = 113) or non-supplemented (n = 32). RESULTS: Ovarian stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in blood tHcy and cobalamin levels (both P ≤ 0. 001). The blood concentrations of tHcy, folate, cobalamin and PLP were significantly correlated with the corresponding follicular fluid concentrations (all P ≤ 0. 001).

No statistically significant differences were found between three subgroups of infants with cystic fibrosis, which included those with meconium ileus with no lung infection, those with meconium ileus with lung infection, and those with lung infection and no history of meconium ileus. The normal pattern of {{development of}} tracheal submucosal glands in infants with cystic fibrosis was in contrast to the deficiency of normal maturation seen in the exocrine pancreas of these infants. The lumen fraction, an index of dilatation of acinar lumina, showed no significant relationship with PCA in either the control group or the group with cystic fibrosis. However, statistically significant dilatation of acini was observed in the tracheal submucosal glands of infants with cystic fibrosis (0. 14, P less than 0. 005) ...|$|R
