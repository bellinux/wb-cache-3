40|$|My work {{deals with}} loss and the {{emotions}} entangled with grief. To do this, I incorporate text, found organic imagery, bound fibers, and hand-spun threads into my work. I relate these objects and materials to {{the stages of}} a woman’s life, which is a symbolic reference to the nymph, mother, and crone and the transformation from life to death. The background surface of information in my two-dimensional work serves as a cryptic guide to the actual meaning of things. All the excerpted information comes from medical or general knowledge dictionaries. This ground of text is methodically planned but also spontaneously created by tearing through one layer to expose what lies beneath. The rough surface of the torn paper conceals and dilutes the imagery I place upon it. I see my surfaces as an artifice, constantly masking information and obscuring meaning. By hiding my imagery behind the words or hiding the text within my work I {{do not have to}} confront their emotional implications or full meanings. They are seen as visual imagery based on their aesthetic appearance as well as to be read literally. I approach my three-dimensional work with same destructive manner. By letting the material and construction of <b>piece</b> <b>guide</b> my process I am forced to think only of the brevity of its existence in various stages of life. The forms are transformed and shaped by the elements of water, fire, and air leaving only a memory, whisper, or shadow of the organic shape they represent to me...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- By {{analyzing}} {{the structure and}} motion characteristics of the flexible guide system of the projectile-feeding chain of a small-bore naval gun, a mathematical model of three-dimensional space attitude dynamic simulation for the flexible guide is proposed; also the corresponding dynamic simulation software is developed. Through which the position of each <b>guide</b> <b>piece</b> in the flexible guide can be determined when the naval gun’s rotating and pitching angle of fire is of any degree. Then the friction force between the projectile-chain and the flexible guide can be calculated according to each <b>guide</b> <b>piece’s</b> position and projectile-chain’s moving velocity and the friction factor. Consequently the automation’s load can be determined. The result of computing can be the criteria to the automation’s designing parameters. Moreover, it is significant to study the adaptive technology of the raise-feed system of the small-bore naval gun...|$|R

40|$|Despite Bartók's lasting {{international}} fame, some of {{his works}} remain unjustly lesser-known. One of the pieces that still resides in relative obscurity is his Violin Concerto No. 1 —a gem of the violin repertoire that must {{be brought to the}} broader public’s attention. The fact that the concerto was hidden definitely contributed to its little–known status at first. However, the most important cause for the lack of enthusiasm to tackle this terrific work lies in the unorthodox demands it puts on the violinist.

50|$|With its {{colorful}} {{mixture of}} African and Western cultures, Sierra Leonean music is extremely creative and varied and forms {{an essential part}} of daily life both in Freetown and the interior. The instruments are dominated by a great variety of drums. Drumming groups may also include a lively mix of castanets, beaten bells, and even wind instruments. Sierra Leoneans from northern parts of the country, the Korankos, add a type of xylophone, the balangi. Another popular instrument is the seigureh, which consists of stones in a rope-bound calabash. The seigureh is used to provide background rhythm. Longer musical <b>pieces</b> are <b>guided</b> by a master drummer and contain embedded signals within the overall rhythm that indicate major changes in tempo. Some pieces may add the continuous blowing of a whistle as a counterpoint. In Freetown, traditional tribal music has given way to various calypso styles that incorporate Western instruments such as the saxophone. In the United States, many Sierra Leonean music and dance traditions are kept alive by the Ko-thi Dance Company of Madison, Wisconsin. Groups like theBeaufort, South Carolina, Hallelujah Singers perform and record traditional Gullah music.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Information {{visualization}} {{is traditionally}} {{viewed as a}} tool for data exploration and hypothesis formation. Because of its roots in scientific reasoning, visualization has traditionally been viewed as an analytical tool for sensemaking. In recent years, however, both the mainstreaming of computer graphics and the democratization of data sources on the Internet have had important repercussions in the field of information visualization. With the ability to create visual representations of data on home computers, artists and designers have taken {{matters into their own hands}} and expanded the conceptual horizon of infovis as artistic practice. This paper presents a brief survey of projects in the field of artistic information visualization and a preliminary examination of how artists appropriate and repurpose “scientific ” techniques to create <b>pieces</b> that actively <b>guide</b> analytical reasoning and encourage a contextualized reading of their subject matter.

40|$|Prescribing of {{antipsychotic}} {{medications for}} patients with delirium remains controversial. Concerns exist that these vulnerable and frail patients may be prescribed antipsychotics inappropriately {{as a substitute for}} non-pharmacological approaches when identifiable causes are not found or they challenge ward processes. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that antipsychotics may cause more harm than good in the palliative care patient group with delirium. On the other hand, guidelines in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands support prescribing of antipsychotics in certain circumstances, and a large European survey has revealed that antipsychotics tend to be prescribed first line for hyperactive delirium. Never before, therefore, is there a greater need to examine whether indeed these medications are clinically useful for the treatment of delirium. With this in mind, evidence-based arguments for and against prescribing antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium are presented in this debate article.
