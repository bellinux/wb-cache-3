5000|$|<b>Peptization</b> is {{also used}} in {{nanoparticle}} synthesis to make a large grouping of particles split into many primary particles. This is done by changing the surface properties, applying a charge, or by adding a surfactant.|$|E
50|$|In the {{synthesis}} of titania (titanium dioxide) nanoparticles, <b>peptization</b> involves adsorption of quaternary ammonium cation on the titania surface. This causes the surface to become positively charged. Electrostatic repulsion of the primary particles in the agglomerated titania breaks up the agglomerate into primary particles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Peptization</b> is {{the process}} {{responsible}} {{for the formation of}} stable dispersion of colloidal particles in dispersion medium. In other words it may be defined as a process of converting a precipitate into colloidal sol by shaking it with dispersion medium in the presence of small amount of electrolyte. The electrolyte used in this process is called as peptizing agent.|$|E
50|$|Particle {{aggregation}} {{is normally}} an irreversible process. Once particle aggregates have formed, {{they will not}} easily disrupt. In the course of aggregation, the aggregates will grow in size, {{and as a consequence}} they may settle {{to the bottom of the}} container, which is referred to as sedimentation. Alternatively, a colloidal gel may form in concentrated suspensions which changes its rheological properties. The reverse process whereby particle aggregates are disrupted and dispersed as individual particles, referred to as <b>peptization,</b> hardly occurs spontaneously, but may occur under stirring or shear.|$|E
5000|$|... 4. Washing and Filtering the Precipitate: It {{is crucial}} to wash the {{precipitate}} very well in order to remove all adsorbed species which will add to weight of precipitate. One should be careful nor to use too much water since part of the precipitate may be lost. Also, in case of colloidal precipitates we should not use water as a washing solution since <b>peptization</b> would occur. In such situations dilute nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, or dilute acetic acid may be used. Usually, {{it is a good}} practice to check for the presence of precipitating agent in the filtrate of the final washing solution. The presence of precipitating agent means that extra washing is required. Filtration should be done in appropriate sized Gooch or ignition filter paper. 5. Drying and Ignition: The purpose of drying (heating at about 120-150 oC in an oven) or ignition in a muffle furnace at temperatures ranging from 600-1200 oC is to get a material with exactly known chemical structure so that the amount of analyte can be accurately determined.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Preparation of the Solution: This {{may involve}} several steps {{including}} adjustment of the pH {{of the solution}} {{in order for the}} precipitate to occur quantitatively and get a precipitate of desired properties, removing interferences, adjusting the volume of the sample to suit the amount of precipitating agent to be added. 2. Precipitation: This requires addition of a precipitating agent solution to the sample solution. Upon addition of the first drops of the precipitating agent, supersaturation occurs, then nucleation starts to occur where every few molecules of precipitate aggregate together forming a nucleous. At this point, addition of extra precipitating agent will either form new nuclei or will build up on existing nuclei to give a precipitate. This can be predicted by Von Weimarn ratio where, according to this relation the particle size is inversely proportional to a quantity called the relative supersaturation where Relative supersaturation = (Q - S)/S The Q is the concentration of reactants before precipitation, S is the solubility of precipitate in the medium from which it is being precipitated. Therefore, in order to get particle growth instead of further nucleation we need to make the relative supersaturation ratio as small as possible. The optimum conditions for precipitation which make the supersaturation low are: a. Precipitation using dilute solutions to decrease Qb. Slow addition of precipitating agent to keep Q as low as possiblec. Stirring the solution during addition of precipitating agent to avoid concentration sites and keep Q lowd. Increase solubility by precipitation from hot solutione. Adjust the pH in order to increase S but not a too much increase np as {{we do not want to}} loose precipitate by dissolutionf. Usually add a little excess of the precipitating agent for quantitative precipitation and check for completeness of the precipitation 3. Digestion of the precipitate: The precipitate is left hot (below boiling) for 30 min to 1 hour in order for the particles to be digested. Digestion involves dissolution of small particles and reprecipitation on larger ones resulting in particle growth and better precipitate characteristics. This process is called Ostwald ripening. An important advantage of digestion is observed for colloidal precipitates where large amounts of adsorbed ions cover the huge area of the precipitate. Digestion forces the small colloidal particles to agglomerate which decreases their surface area and thus adsorption. You should know that adsorption is a major problem in gravimetry in case of colloidal precipitate since a precipitate tends to adsorb its own ions present in excess, Therefore, forming what is called a primary ion layer which attracts ions from solution forming a secondary or counter ion layer. Individual particles repel each other keeping the colloidal properties of the precipitate. Particle coagulation can be forced by either digestion or addition of a high concentration of a diverse ions strong electrolytic solution in order to shield the charges on colloidal particles and force agglomeration. Usually, coagulated particles return to the colloidal state if washed with water, a process called <b>peptization.</b>|$|E

It usually involves several successive steps, mainly used to control textural properties such as pore diameter and pore volume of γ-alumina catalyst supports. The ability to successfully tune these properties is highly dependent on the boehmite precursor features. This work aims at understanding {{the influence of the}} <b>peptization</b> and neutralization steps on the textural properties of boehmite exhibiting similar crystallite size and shape but different <b>peptization</b> abilities. Three kinds of boehmite (low, medium and high <b>peptization</b> ability) obtained either by precipitation or by alkoxide hydrolysis were subjected to a <b>peptization</b> and neutralization steps in order to simulate the full shaping process of kneading extrusion. After <b>peptization</b> and neutralization, no significant changes were found in crystallite shape and size, but only in their spatial arrangement. For the boehmite exhibiting the lowest <b>peptization</b> ability, the particle packing seems to be frozen and no modifications result from <b>peptization</b> or neutralization. However for boehmite with the medium <b>peptization</b> ability, obtained by precipitation from the same precursors as the low peptizable sample, the particles were initially poorly organised and their spatial packing was very affected by the <b>peptization</b> and neutralization phases, giving a narrower pore size distribution than the synthesized powder. Though the third boehmite, obtained by alkoxide hydrolysis, was fully peptizable, this does not allow tailoring the textural properties, whatever the phase of the shaping process. Finally the partially peptizable boehmite seems to be the most versatile starting material for the control of the textural properties...|$|E

30|$|TiO 2 {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized from titanium isopropoxide by {{a simple}} <b>peptization</b> method using sulfuric, nitric, and acetic acids. The effect of peptizing acid on physicochemical and photocatalytic properties of TiO 2 powders was studied. The structural properties of synthesized TiO 2 powders were analyzed by using XRD, TEM, N 2 -physisorption, Raman, DR UV-vis, FTIR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The characterization results showed that acetic acid <b>peptization</b> facilitated the formation of pure anatase phase after thermal treatment at 500  °C; in contrast, nitric acid <b>peptization</b> led to a major rutile phase formation (67 %). Interestingly, the sample peptized using sulfuric acid yielded 95 % anatase and 5 % rutile phases. The photocatalytic activity of synthesized TiO 2 nanoparticles was evaluated for degradation of selected organic dyes (crystal violet, methylene blue, and p-nitrophenol) in aqueous solution. The results confirmed that the TiO 2 sample peptized using nitric acid (with rutile and anatase phases in 3 : 1 ratio) offered the highest activity for degradation of organic dyes, although, TiO 2 samples peptized using sulfuric acid and acetic acid possessed smaller particle size, higher band gap energy, and high surface area. Interestingly, TiO 2 sample peptized with nitric acid possessed relatively high theoretical photocurrent density (0.545  mAcm− 2) and pore diameter (150  Å), which are responsible for high electron-hole separation efficiency and diffusion and mass transportation of organic reactants during the photochemical degradation process.
