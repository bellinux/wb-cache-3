5|$|August, 1955- Hurricanes Connie and Diane <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of {{the state}} during the month, {{bringing}} over 8inches (200mm) of rain to the Delaware Valley and causing record-breaking flooding.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Druckenmiller got Virginia Tech's drive {{started with}} a first-down <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tech 42-yard line. After a short run by Edmonds, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass, setting up a third-and-seven for Virginia Tech's offense. During the third-down play, wide receiver Bryan Still broke free of the Texas defense and caught a 55-yard pass from Druckenmiller for Tech's second offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was successful, and Tech took a 2110 lead with 12:28 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 82 {{traverses}} it, in {{the process}} reaching the highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road. After Cottonwood <b>Pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, it is the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state, the fourth-highest paved road {{in the state and}} the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation, it is closed in wintertime, isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E
5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense {{with him as he}} tossed the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|After Tech's kickoff was downed {{in the end}} zone, the Longhorns' offense began a new {{drive from}} their 20-yard line. Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then completed a first-down pass to Adams at the 32-yard line. From there, Brown threw an incomplete pass, then tossed a 15-yard screen pass to Fitzgerald, who gained a first down at the Texas 42-yard line. Williams crossed into Virginia Tech territory on the next play as he ran straight ahead for a 13-yard gain. A one-yard run was followed by an incomplete pass, and on third down Brown threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech defender Torrian Gray, who returned the <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tech 33-yard line.|$|E
50|$|The parish councils {{that had}} been {{introduced}} by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894 were dissolved. Their responsibilities regarding poor law <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> county council, other powers <b>passing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new district councils.|$|R
25|$|During the 14th century, Poland and Lithuania fought wars {{against the}} Mongol invaders, and {{eventually}} most of Ukraine <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule of Poland and Lithuania. More particularly, {{the lands of}} Volynia {{in the north and}} north-west <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule of Lithuanian princes, while <b>the</b> south-west <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> control of Poland (Galicia). Also the Genoese founded some colonies in Crimean coasts until the Ottoman conquest in the 1470s.|$|R

5|$|American forces finally {{halted the}} North Korean advance {{in a series}} of engagements in the {{southern}} section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening a <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pusan area. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju to the west, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for more North Korean attacks. US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Because Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Florida State's kickoff was returned to their 29-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense had the first possession of the second half. Jones rushed for six yards, then Noel completed a first-down pass to Andre Davis at the Florida State 45-yard line. The Seminoles sacked Noel, but Noel regained the lost yardage and earned a first down with a completed <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 20-yard line. Three Tech rushes advanced {{the ball to the}} nine-yard line and earned a first down. Two plays later, Jones dashed across the goal line for the first Tech touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and Tech tied the score, 1010, with 10:02 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|During the sede vacante, as {{the papal}} vacancy is known, certain limited powers <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> College of Cardinals, which is convoked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals.

The Particular Congregation, which deals with the day-to-day matters of the Church, includes the Cardinal Camerlengo and the three Cardinal Assistants—one Cardinal-Bishop, one Cardinal-Priest and one Cardinal-Deacon—chosen by lot. Every three days, new Cardinal Assistants are chosen by lot. The Cardinal Camerlengo and Cardinal Assistants are responsible, among other things, for maintaining the election's secrecy.|$|E
60|$|The weighty {{business}} of dressing began, and one courtier after another knelt and paid his court and offered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little King his condolences upon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded. In the beginning, a shirt {{was taken up}} by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> First Lord of the Buckhounds, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Third Groom of the Stole, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Master of the Wardrobe, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> Norroy King-at-Arms, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Constable of the Tower, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chief Steward of the Household, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lord High Admiral of England, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Canterbury, who <b>passed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took what was left of it and put it on Tom. Poor little wondering chap, it reminded him of passing buckets at a fire.|$|R
50|$|Saint-Pol {{was first}} {{controlled}} by the Flemish counts, then by the family known as Campdavaine from early in the 11th century. In 1205 <b>the</b> county <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seigneurs of Châtillon through marriage, and remained with this dynasty until 1360 when it <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Luxembourg dynasty. Around 1487 <b>the</b> county <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Capetian-Bourbon-Vendôme dynasty through marriage, then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Longueville-Neuchâtel dynasty from around 1563. In 1702 it came under direct rule of France.|$|R
25|$|Ingó and Hreindís Ylva Garðarsdóttir Holm <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final, with Páll Rósinkrans and Erna & Lísa failing <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final.|$|R
5|$|In {{subsequent}} possessions, Nevada and Maryland both {{failed to}} gain first downs and exchanged punts. Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick then led a drive {{that included a}} 68-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Maryland three-yard line. The Terrapins' defense stopped two rushing attempts by Vai Taua, but a short pass to wide receiver Chris Wellington was completed for Nevada's first touchdown. With the extra point, Nevada took the lead, 7–6. Wolf Pack placekicker Brett Jaekle executed a 69-yard kickoff to Torrey Smith, and he returned it 99yards for a second Maryland touchdown. Egekeze made the extra point and Maryland regained the lead, 13–7, with 7:53 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|In the west, US {{forces were}} pushed back {{repeatedly}} before finally halting the North Korean advance. Forces from the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly {{arrived in the}} country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing the 19th Infantry Regiment back and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces. US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve {{to prepare for the}} attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down at its 25-yard line. After a rushing play was stopped for a loss and Paci was forced {{to throw the ball}} away to avoid a sack, Indiana punted {{for the first time in}} {{the second quarter}}. Tech resumed offense at its 41-yard line. DeShazo completed a <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indiana 47-yard line, then a 25-yard toss to Cornelius Wright, who carried it to the Indiana 22. Swarm carried the ball for a first down inside the Indiana 10-yard line, and two plays later, he carried it across the goal line for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech took a 147 lead with 11:14 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's offense began {{play from}} the Hoosiers' 34-yard line {{following}} the kick. Paci scrambled for several yards, then completed a {{pass for a}} first down at the 50-yard line. On the next play, however, Paci fumbled the ball, which bounced {{into the hands of}} Tech defensive end Lawrence Lewis, who returned it 20yards for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Tech a 2113 lead with 23 seconds remaining before halftime. Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech 42-yard line, potentially setting up an Indiana field goal try before halftime. Paci completed a <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 36-yard line, and the few seconds remaining in the first half apparently ran off the clock before Indiana could use its final timeout to stop the clock.|$|E
5|$|Near Borough station the new tunnels would branch off via a new {{station to}} form an {{interchange}} with the SE and the LB at London Bridge mainline station. The tunnels would then <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of London Bridge, north through the City of London to Angel. Following a delay, during which a Joint Select Committee reviewed the proposals of several new underground railways, the City and South London Railway Act, 1893 received royal assent on 24 August 1893. The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant an extension of time to build the southern extension to Clapham.|$|E
5|$|On Dominica, Omar's close <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island left 30 {{families}} {{homeless and}} severely hampered the fishing community. On December15, the Board of Directors of the Caribbean Development Bank approved $9.16million for assistance to those affected by Omar {{on the island}} and to restore the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane. On December18, the government of Dominica invested $4million in aid for the fishing communities impacted by Omar. A total of 140 fishermen were provided with $250 per week for a total of four weeks. Sixty-two of which continued to receive funds due to their circumstances. The government also purchased 121 boat engines to distribute to fishers. Another $794,000 was spent to repair 47 boats and construct another 28 that had been damaged or destroyed by Omar. The government also bought replacement fishing gear.|$|E
