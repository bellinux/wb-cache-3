25|$|St. John the Evangelist, Glebe, 1868, is Blacket's {{most famous}} {{design in the}} Norman style, in which rich {{mouldings}} and carved capitals form a striking contrast with the <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> arches. Blacket also designed the major furnishings.|$|E
25|$|The Doric order {{originated}} on {{the mainland}} and western Greece. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, faceted, heavy columns with <b>plain,</b> <b>round</b> capitals (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 20 flutes. The capital consists of a necking which is of a simple form. The echinus is convex and the abacus is square.|$|E

[...] The nave is 27feet 9inches by 13feet 8inches (8.5 by 4.2m). Between the nave and the chancel there is a <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> arch, from the 11th or 12th century, a step up, and a rail. At the east end of the chancel, there is a further step up from the chapel into the sanctuary, which has some 18th-century gravestones set into it. The late 15th-century chancel, which {{measures}} 32feet 6inches by 14feet (9.9 by 4.3m), has some memorials from the 18th and early 19th centuries. [...] One is to a bonesetter called Evan Thomas (died 1814), erected by Thomas Bulkeley, 7th Viscount Bulkeley; another, to Emma Viscountess Bulkeley Williams, is made from ornately decorated marble.|$|E
2500|$|Early chronicler Juan de Castellanos {{noted that}} the Muisca were [...] "more traders than fighters".

6000|$|We were {{twelve hours}} at sea, {{and the heavy}} swell obliged us to exert all our strength. At length, by mere dint of rowing, we reached the French coast. The stars faded, and the grey morning cast a dim veil over the silver horns of the waning moon--the sun rose broad and red from the sea, as we walked over the sands to Calais. Our first care was to procure horses, and {{although}} wearied by our night of watching and toil, some of our party immediately went in quest of these in the wide fields of the unenclosed and now barren <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> Calais. We divided ourselves, like seamen, into watches, and some reposed, while others prepared the morning's repast. Our foragers returned at noon with only six horses--on these, Adrian and I, and four others, proceeded on our journey towards the great city, which its inhabitants had fondly named {{the capital of the}} civilized world. Our horses had become, through their long holiday, almost wild, and we crossed the <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> Calais with impetuous speed. From the height near Boulogne, I turned again to look on England; nature had cast a misty pall over her, her cliff was hidden--there was spread the watery barrier that divided us, never again to be crossed; she lay on the ocean plain, ...|$|E

60|$|The boys ran out. Below, {{a mass of}} red flame was rising; and it {{was evident}} that several houses were in flames. The sight was a grand one, for the light showed the outline of the slopes of the hills and, {{reflected}} on the roofs of the houses of the little town, made them look as if red hot. Out upon the <b>plain,</b> <b>round</b> Molsheim, were the scattered lights of innumerable camp fires while, in the distance, flickering flashes--like the play of summer lightning--told of the ceaseless rain of fire kept up upon the unhappy town of Strasburg.|$|E
60|$|Bursts {{of great}} {{shouting}} rose and died away, like wild gusts of wind on the <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> the barricaded house; the fitful popping of shots grew louder above the yelling. Sometimes there were intervals of unaccountable stillness outside, and {{nothing could have}} been more gaily peaceful than the narrow bright lines of sunlight from the cracks in the shutters, ruled straight across the cafe over the disarranged chairs and tables to the wall opposite. Old Giorgio had chosen that bare, whitewashed room for a retreat. It had only one window, and its only door swung out upon the track of thick dust fenced by aloe hedges between the harbour and the town, where clumsy carts used to creak along behind slow yokes of oxen guided by boys on horseback.|$|E
6000|$|... 146. You will find, on consideration, the {{ultimate}} fact {{to be that}} to which I have just referred you;--my statement in [...] "Aratra," [...] {{that the idea of}} a construction originally useful is retained in good architecture, through all the amusement of its ornamentation; as the idea of the proper function of any piece of dress ought to be retained through its changes in form or embroidery. A good spire or porch retains the first idea of a roof usefully covering a space, as a Norman high cap or elongated Quaker's bonnet retains the original idea of a simple covering for the head; and any extravagance of subsequent fancy may be permitted, so long as the notion of use is not altogether lost. A girl begins by wearing a <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> hat to shade her from the sun; she ties it down over her ears on a windy day; presently she decorates the edge of it, so bent, with flowers in front, or the riband that ties it with a bouquet at the side, and it becomes a bonnet. This decorated construction may be discreetly changed, by endless fashion, so long as it does not become a clearly useless riband round the middle of the head, or a clearly useless saucer on the top of it.|$|E

60|$|I cannot say I {{liked the}} very little I saw of Peru: in summer, however, {{it is said}} that the climate is much pleasanter. In all seasons, both {{inhabitants}} and foreigners suffer from severe attacks of ague. This disease is common on the whole coast of Peru, but is unknown in the interior. The attacks of illness which arise from miasma never fail to appear most mysterious. So difficult is it to judge from the aspect of a country, {{whether or not it is}} healthy, that if a person had been told to choose within the tropics a situation appearing favourable for health, very probably he would have named this coast. The <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> the outskirts of Callao is sparingly covered with a coarse grass, and in some parts there are a few stagnant, though very small, pools of water. The miasma, in all probability, arises from these: for the town of Arica was similarly circumstanced, and its healthiness was much improved by the drainage of some little pools. Miasma is not always produced by a luxuriant vegetation with an ardent climate; for many parts of Brazil, even where there are marshes and a rank vegetation, are much more healthy than this sterile coast of Peru. The densest forests in a temperate climate, as in Chiloe, do not seem in the slightest degree to affect the healthy condition of the atmosphere.|$|E
6000|$|... "Moab is my wash-pot, {{and over}} Edom will I cast out my shoe!" [...] There {{they were before}} us, very visible to the eye, and we began {{naturally}} to ask questions of each other. Why was Moab the wash-pot, and Edom thus cursed with indignity? Why had the right {{bank of the river}} been selected for such great purposes, whereas the left was thus condemned? Was there, at that time, any special fertility in this land of promise which has since departed from it? We are told of a bunch of grapes which took two men to carry it; but now there is not a vine in the whole country side. Now-a-days the sandy <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> Jericho is as dry and arid as are any of the valleys of Moab. The Jordan was running beneath our feet,--the Jordan in which the leprous king had washed, though the bright rivers of his own Damascus were so much nearer to his hand. It was but a humble stream to which he was sent; but the spot probably was higher up, above the Sea of Galilee, where the river is narrow. But another also had come down to this river, perhaps to this very spot on its shores, and submitted Himself to its waters;--as to whom, perhaps, it will be better that I should not speak much in this light story.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{more curious}} ghost in Drumcliff or Rosses than the snipe- ghost. There is a bush behind {{a house in a}} village that I know well: for {{excellent}} reasons I do not say whether in Drumcliff or Rosses or on the slope of Ben Bulben, or even on the <b>plain</b> <b>round</b> Knocknarea. There is a history concerning the house and the bush. A man once lived there who found on the quay of Sligo a package containing three hundred pounds in notes. It was dropped by a foreign sea captain. This my man knew, but said nothing. It was money for freight, and the sea captain, not daring to face his owners, committed suicide in mid-ocean. Shortly afterwards my man died. His soul could not rest. At any rate, strange sounds were heard round his house, though that had grown and prospered since the freight money. The wife was often seen by those still alive out in the garden praying at the bush I have spoken of, for the shade of the dead man appeared there at times. The bush remains to this day: once portion of a hedge, it now stands by itself, for no one dare put spade or pruning-knife about it. As to the strange sounds and voices, they did not cease till a few years ago, when, during some repairs, a snipe flew out of the solid plaster and away; the troubled ghost, say the neighbours, of the note-finder was at last dislodged.|$|E

50|$|Erecting steles at tombs or temples {{eventually}} became a widespread social and religious phenomenon. Emperors {{found it necessary to}} promulgate laws, regulating the use of funerary steles by the population. The Ming dynasty laws, instituted in the 14th century by its founder the Hongwu Emperor, listed a number of stele types available as status symbols to various ranks of the nobility and officialdom: the top noblemen and mandarins were eligible for steles installed on top of a stone tortoise and crowned with hornless dragons, while the lower-level officials had to be satisfied with steles with <b>plain</b> <b>rounded</b> tops, standing on simple rectangular pedestals.|$|R

Evans was eight points behind Barker, despite missing the Symmons <b>Plains</b> <b>round</b> due to a Formula Abarth test at Misano. Australian driver Tom Tweedie remained in the championship hunt, despite competing in the older 2004 specification Dallara-Renault compared to the 2007 model Team BRM Dallara-Mercedes cars of Barker and Evans.|$|R
