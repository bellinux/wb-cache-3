It finished its training on 27 March 1944, and transferred to Camp Forrest on 24 March 1944. The division staged at Camp Myles Standish on 12 August 1944 before departing Boston <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> on 20 August 1944. The 17th Airborne Division arrived in the United Kingdom on 26 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground support}} echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support {{elements}} sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. The Cape Victory made brief port calls at Honolulu and Eniwetok but the passengers were {{not permitted to}} leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men flew by C-54 to North Field on Tinian, between May 15 and May 22.|$|E
5|$|The Port of New York and New Jersey {{comprised}} {{the main point}} of embarkation for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b> The congestion at the port led experts to realize {{the need for a}} port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority {{under the supervision of the}} governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects.|$|E

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945 to its <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> at Seattle, Washington. On 6 May the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. An advance {{party of the}} air echelon flew by C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between 15 and 22 May. It was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945, marking the group's official change of station. It was from Tinian that it carried out the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland {{returned}} to Saint-Nazaire in May and loaded Major General Joseph E. Kuhn and some 3,000 men of his U.S. 79th Infantry Division, {{which included the}} 304th Engineer Regiment, and departed France on 18 May. The band of the 304th Engineers gave concerts on deck every evening on the voyage home to entertain the men. Though initially bound for Newport News, Kroonlands crew received orders in mid ocean to head instead to New York, where they arrived on 29 May. After completing another passage to Newport News in late June, Kroonland sailed on 19 July with 3,642 passengers—including officers, men, thirteen war brides, and one war baby—from Saint-Nazaire, in the final transport departure from that port before it was closed as a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> by U.S. military authorities. Among the passengers was Brigadier General Samuel D. Rockenbach, {{the founder of the}} United States Tank Corps.|$|E
5|$|During the 1929 {{stock market}} crash and {{subsequent}} economic depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed, while the region attempted to spur job growth by simultaneously undertaking two large infrastructure projects: construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay. After the United States joined World War II in 1941, the Bay Area became a major domestic military and naval hub, with large shipyards constructed in Sausalito and across the East Bay to build ships for the war effort, and Fort Mason acting the primary <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, the United Nations was chartered in San Francisco to help prevent the kind of devastation that occurred over the past decade, and on September 1951, Japan officially surrendered to the Allied forces in San Francisco, with the Treaty of San Francisco entering into force a year later. In the years immediately following the war, the Bay Area saw a huge wave of immigration as populations increased across the region. Between 1950 and 1960, San Francisco welcomed over 100,000 new residents, inland suburbs in the East Bay saw their populations double, Daly City's population quadrupled, and Santa Clara's population quintupled.|$|E

50|$|The NYPOE {{was by far}} {{the largest}} <b>of</b> the Army <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> and at the close of 1944, aside from the {{embarkation}} camps, controlled piers with berths for 100 oceangoing vessels, 4,895,000 square feet of transit shed space, 5,500,000 square feet of warehouse space and 13,000,000 square feet of open storage and working space. By August 1945 3,172,778 passengers and 37,799,955 measurement tons of cargo had passed through NYPOE with 5,893,199 tons of cargo having passed through its Philadelphia cargo sub-port. With the total for all ports being 7,293,354 passengers and 126,787,875 tons of cargo this put the NYPOE at 44% of all troops and 34% of all cargo passing through Army <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hampton Roads <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> (HRPOE or HRPE) was {{the third}} largest United States Army Transportation Corps <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> in terms of {{passengers}} and second in terms of cargo tonnage on the East Coast of the United States during World War II. Until June 1942 Hampton Roads was a sub-port of the New York <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{ports of}} {{embarkation}} were established with commanders appointed 17 July 1917, one at New York with headquarters at Hoboken and the second, then officially the Newport News <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> in Hampton Roads with headquarters at Newport News. While 88% of troops, 1,656,000 from New York itself and 142,000 from its sub-ports, sent overseas transited through the New York <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> 288,000 transited through the Newport News <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hampton Roads <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> was the Army command {{structure}} and distributed port infrastructure in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia supporting movement of personnel and cargo overseas. It had been activated as the Newport News <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> in World War I, deactivated, then reactivated 15 June 1942.|$|E
5000|$|Promoted to Brigadier General, from 1940 to 1941 he was {{commanding}} general <b>of</b> Pacific <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> working out <b>of</b> Fort Mason California.

50|$|By {{working around}} the clock during rush periods, the 274th AAF Base Unit at Herington was able to process an average of nine combat crews a day. Normally, however, the rate of {{processing}} was much more moderate. Figures for the year ending 30 June 1944 may be regarded as typical. They reveal that during that interval an average of just over 86 crews and 76 aircraft were processed each month. With some slight diminution this rate was maintained until the end of World War II. On the whole most of the crews involved left Herington with their own aircraft. Some of the others traveled by train to the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> The remainder, along with some few aircraft, were transported to <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> by the Air Transport Command.|$|R
50|$|Operated {{primarily}} by civilian contract pilots, including the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), the Ferrying Division moved aircraft and parts from manufacturing {{plants in the}} United States to and between various training bases within the USA and to <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> for overseas shipment (Hamilton Field, California; Morrison Field, Florida; Presque Isle Field, Maine; and Anchorage-Elmendorf Field, Alaska). From the <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> aircraft were flown to final overseas destinations {{primarily by}} contracted civil airline pilots or former airline pilots serving in the AAF. The ATC Ferrying Division was also responsible for the preparation for and movement of combat units overseas and for the movement of replacement aircraft and crews, who were temporarily assigned to the ATC Ferrying Division {{from the time they}} left the United States until they arrived at their assigned theater.|$|R

50|$|Activated 9 May 1942 at Camp John T. Knight, Oakland Sub-Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> California. In January 1943, the {{battalion}} proceeded to Camp Stoneman, Pittsburg, Northern California where {{they participated in}} numerous training exercises in preparation for deployment. The Battalion delivered by convoy large numbers <b>of</b> vehicles to <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> {{up and down the}} Pacific Coast from the Stockton Ordnance Depot to Vancouver, Washington, Port Hueneme, California and Los Angeles, California.|$|R
50|$|ATC's origins begin during World War I {{with the}} need to {{transport}} aircraft supplies and materiel from the aircraft manufacturers to the maintenance facilities supporting the training bases in the United States. Railroads was used to move the equipment and aircraft from one base to another and to the <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> along the East Coast for subsequent sea shipment to the battlefields of France.|$|R
50|$|Hunter {{trained as}} a pilot and {{eventually}} became a pilot during World War II, {{as a member of}} the Women Airforce Service Pilots, also known as the WASPs, graduating with class 43-W5.

50|$|The {{following}} day, Shirer {{heard about}} further train loads of wounded soldiers.

50|$|Established as the Domestic Division, Air Corps Ferrying Command in {{the early}} days of World War II, the organization's mission was the {{transport}} of newly produced aircraft from points within the United States to <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> for shipment to Britain and other overseas Allies. In 1946, the organization was transferred to Air Transport Command and became, in essence, a military airline its Continental Division, managing transport routes within the United States.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of its {{departure}} from the United States, the 39th Division was composed of 22 per cent Arkansas National Guard, 40 per cent National Army draftees, and 10 per cent shortage from authorized strength. On August 1, 1918, the division entrained for the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and sailed for overseas service on August 6, 1918.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} no longer needed as a {{hospital}} ship {{at that time and}} put into the Marine Repair Shop at the San Francisco <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> for conversion to carry a combination of troops and military dependents. During this interval, the ship reverted to her original name as USAT George Washington Carver. After the work was completed, the ship departed for her new homeport of Seattle.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately piers of the {{terminal}} {{became part of the}} United States Army's New York <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> which at the war's end included eight piers in Brooklyn including six Bush Terminal piers, 120 Bush Company warehouses and two at the Army Supply Base; in Hoboken twelve piers and seven warehouses and three piers in the North River, Manhattan. The federal government quietly returned Bush Terminal to private ownership after the war.|$|E
25|$|Both MWDs {{and their}} {{civilian}} counterparts provide service in drug detection, sniffing out {{a broad range}} of psychoactive substances despite efforts at concealment. Provided they have been trained to detect it, MWDs can smell small traces of nearly any substance, even if it is in a sealed container. Dogs trained in drug detection are normally used at <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> such as airports, checkpoints, and other places where there is high security and a need for anti-contraband measures.|$|R
50|$|On 17 December 1941 all depots and <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> {{came under}} the Chief of the Transportation Branch, G-4, with the Chief of Transportation, Services of Supply, gaining command {{oversight}} in March when that position was established. Central control tightened and was coordinated under a Transportation Control Committee that extended to all the military services, the War Shipping Administration (WSA), Office of Defense Transportation and allied British Ministry of War Transport that controlled all movements of troops and freight including Lend Lease moving through the ports.|$|R
50|$|Six Technical Services found {{themselves}} part of Army Service Forces {{when they were}} grouped in 1942: the Corps of Engineers, Signal Corps, Ordnance Department, Quartermaster Corps, Chemical Corps and Medical Corps. A seventh technical service, the Transportation Corps was established as the Transportation Division 28 February 1942 under Executive Order 9082. It was renamed the Transportation Service in April 1942 and became a corps {{in its own right}} on 31 July 1942.
