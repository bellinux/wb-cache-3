50|$|The recipe {{proportions}} aren't rigid. The <b>pearl</b> <b>glue</b> can {{be increased}} to 300 grammes for a harder and stronger result, or then the rosin to 150 grammes for a more elastic and generally more robust composition. Some workers prefer to use rabbit-skin glue (as used in bookbinding) rather than pearl or hide glue, giving a more flexible result.|$|E
