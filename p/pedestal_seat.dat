Sisman The problem faced by the operators with the type of sander machine MODEL 6 "Belt and 9 " Disc Sander, NS: 121 001 113 existing in the Lab. Juruasn manufacturing system engineering in industrial engineering is the position operator, at operator's position in the machine do the work stands beside the machine and the operator's position must operate in a standing position which causes rapid operator to feel tired. Felt fatigue in the legs because as long as the machine operators to operate in conditions as well as the perceived standing on the waist because {{at the time of the}} material making process operator must rotate his body to reach the material or materials to be mashed. From the problems that the author gives a solution that is designing a chair that could fix the problem condition.

Users Bench Situps also tend to have difficulties in terms of storage when the room is not large enough possessed. Owner sit-up bench in person in general are among the top due to its price.
