30|$|In this work, {{we focus}} on organic nanostructures. Initial growth {{experiments}} have demonstrated that para-hexaphenylene (p- 6 P) molecules can self-assemble into mutually parallel aligned nanofibers when deposited by physical vapor deposition on a globally [16] or locally [17] heated muscovite mica substrate. The resulting fibers are straight, crystalline and have specific optical properties such as emission of polarized blue light [18], waveguiding [19], and lasing [20]. However, muscovite mica is not further processable, {{making it difficult to}} <b>pattern</b> <b>device</b> architecture directly on the growth substrate. One solution to this problem is to transfer the nanofibers to an appropriate device platform. However, this method is complicated due to the weak van der Waals forces between the molecular constituents that render the nanofibers fragile, and thereby make it difficult to directly adopt the printing transfer techniques developed for large-scale transfer of inorganic nanowires [9].|$|E

40|$|A planar {{inhibiting}} fabrication {{technique of}} HTS electronic devices {{has been developed}} {{in recent years and}} is summarized. A systematic study of the properties of ion inhibited HTS films is presented. The inhibition of superconductivity is carried out by the implantation of reactive ions such as Al, B, Ca, and Si into YBCO epitaxial films. The inhibited films are characterized using resistivity, susceptibility, SIMS, XRD, XPS, and SEM measurements. The results indicate that the implanted ions react strongly with oxygen, which turn the films resistive, and even insulative without altering the overall crystalline structure of the films. The effect of ion diffusion is also investigated. Ion gettering phenomenon is observed in Si implanted films. Those effects define the pattern resolution of the planar inhibiting fabrication process. The ion implantation process is applied to the fabrication of HTS single layer devices. These devices include Josephson junctions, DC SQUIDs, RF coils, and microwave waveguides. Operational step-edge junctions and DC SQUIDs with a minimum width of 2 μm were formed and tested at 77 K. Passive devices such as low loss waveguides (1 - 25 GHz) and high Q resonators (33 MHz) were demonstrated. The performance of these devices, in general, is better than or at least equal to that of dry etched devices. However, the new process offers two major advantages. first, the <b>patterned</b> <b>device</b> is planar, which allows a multilayer device to be built, and second, {{there is little or no}} chemical contamination of the <b>patterned</b> <b>devices.</b> To demonstrate the viability of this technique for the fabrication of multilayer devices, simple YBCO/STO/YBCO tri-layer structures (such as crossover and a parallel-plate capacitor), with two implantations were fabricated. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} directly patterned active layer together with silver nanograting arrays as the anode of inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). The patterned nanostructure not only greatly enhances the light absorption of the active layer through both light diffraction and coupling to surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes but also obviously promotes the fill factor of the <b>patterned</b> <b>device.</b> The absorption spectrum shows improvement over a broad wavelength range, especially around the 400 nm region and the near-infrared region surrounding 700 nm, which can also be reconfirmed from Incident Photon to Electron Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) and zeroth-order reflection spectra. Most importantly, our physical study shows that the absorption peak of 400 nm is due to the resonant waveguide mode, and the absorption peak of 700 nm is attributed to the excited SPP mode induced by the metallic back grating. Besides, another splitting SPP mode, called plasmonic band edge, around 800 nm is clarified from our detailed model. Consequently, on one hand, ou...|$|R
40|$|Description of {{the work}} Garden of Shrinking Violets is a {{collection}} of six half scale garments and three illustrations, continuing the practice-led research project into design for disassembly, developed in the work Shrinking Violets (2015). All garments are constructed in laser cut modules that enable the items to be reassembled in new combinations. The project extended the materials used to include ahimsa (peace) silk, silk organza and silk twill. The pattern pieces have internal laser cut grids of 5 mm circles, allowing the textiles to be layered, threaded and knotted to achieve rich embellished surfaces that play with the transparencies and colour overlays of the sheer and opaque silks. Research Background Conceptually grounded in design for sustainability, the aim {{of the work}} is to develop approaches to garment construction that could allow users to engage with the garments by adding, removing and reconfiguring elements. This approach to design considers the use and end-of-life phases of the transient fashion garment through considering how the garments can be later disassembled. Research Contribution This construction process is unique in being not only a <b>patterning</b> <b>device</b> but also integral to the garment’s construction. This work sits at the intersection of technical design and craft: the laser cutting and technical approach to developing new forms of garment construction is coupled with the artisanal approach of hand-knotting, a reference to traditional quilting techniques, as a method to layer and pattern the textiles. The technique developed in Shrinking Violets was extended to experiment with different grid structures, knotting devices, and decorative fringing. The result is a proposed construction system in which the laser cut grid and knotting form a decorative <b>patterning</b> <b>device,</b> but are also integral to the garments’ construction.
