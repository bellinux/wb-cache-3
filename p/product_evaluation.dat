40|$|This study {{addresses}} the advertising effectiveness of round and thin models. Integrating previous findings and theories, the authors predict {{and find that}} impulsive and reflective <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> as responses to thin and round advertisement models diverge. Specifically, four experiments indicate that impulsive <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> follow a priming logic, such that {{the beauty of the}} model spills over directly onto product evaluations; thin models thus produce more favorable implicit responses than do round models. For reflective <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> however, this pattern appears reversed. Moreover, these explicit <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> are mediated by campaign liking.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 It is {{commonly}} argued that although sales promotions effectively influence initial brand choice, they may ultimately undermine brand evaluations and repurchase intentions. Prior experimental results demonstrate that under certain conditions, persons who receive {{a reward for}} selecting a product exhibit less favorable <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> than persons who are offered no reward. These findings conflict with the common wisdom of marketers who use promotions extensively. Either marketers are unconcerned with long-run effects or sales promotions {{may not have the}} detrimental effects on brand evaluations predicted by past research. The current research program focuses on positive promotional effects whereby <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> are enhanced by rewards. I apply availability valence theory (Tybout, Sternthal and Calder 1983; Hannah and Sternthal 1984) to a reward context and delineate the psychological processes that lead to enhancement effects. I also synthesize empirical evidence from prior research that is consistent with the availability valence explanation. I then construct a theoretical framework termed Promotional Enhancement Theory that links the theoretical concepts from availability valence theory with promotional execution tactics to explain and predict how promotional factors can enhance consumer <b>product</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Initial testing of Promotional Enhancement Theory focuses on how the timing and source of promotions impact <b>product</b> <b>evaluations.</b> A reward timing effect was obtained in Study 1 whereby persons who received an immediate, pre-evaluation reward for choosing a new product reported higher <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> than persons who received either no reward or a promised-but-delayed reward that was distributed after <b>product</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Furthermore, the delayed reward undermined evaluations relative to the no-reward condition, presumably due to the enhanced task-contingency of the delayed reward. Study 2 demonstrated that immediate rewards do not enhance <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> when the source of the reward is unrelated to the product, suggesting that promotions elicit a favorable <b>evaluation</b> of a <b>product</b> only when the information they provide is considered product relevant. These results suggest that promotions can enhance <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> when they elicit consumer perceptions of marketer goodwill and minimize the salience of a promotion's task-contingency by maximizing consumer behavioral freedom...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} <b>product</b> <b>evaluations,</b> nutritional and persuasion knowledge on children's food choices conducted because of limited evidence {{about the role of}} <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> on consumer choices in conjunction with cognitive defences. A randomised controlled 2 × 2 factorial experiment with an exposure to a food and a control (toy) advertisement conducted in a non-laboratory setting at an annual event traditionally visited by families. Children aged 7 - 13 years with biometric/weight data representative of the general Australian population. Height and weight (converted into body mass index z-scores) measured in addition to children's nutritional and persuasion knowledge, <b>product</b> <b>evaluations,</b> age and gender. The factors that undermine children's cognitive defences relate to taste, social appeal of foods and low nutritional and persuasion knowledge. An interplay between the above-mentioned factors was also observed, identifying four groups among young consumers, alluding to a complex and at times impulsive nature of children's decisions: (1) knowledgeable children with less positive <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> choosing a healthy snack; (2) knowledgeable but hedonism-oriented children seeking peer conformity choosing an advertised product; (3) knowledgeable children who chose a snack belonging to the same product category; and (4) less knowledgeable children with positive <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> and low nutritional knowledge choosing snacks from the advertised product category. Obese children were more likely to belong to a cluster of less knowledgeable and hedonism-oriented children. The problem of consumption of less healthy foods is complex and multiple factors need to be considered by health practitioners, social marketers and parents {{to address the issue of}} childhood obesity. Nutritional knowledge alone is not sufficient to ensure children make healthier food choices and emphasis should also be placed on persuasion knowledge education, targeting of peer norms, self-efficacy and stricter regulation of advertising aimed at children.

40|$|The authors {{examined}} the effects of image congruence and self-monitoring on <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> of counterfeit <b>products.</b> Study results show that image congruence is positively related to both product attitude and purchase intentions. Specifically, they found that ideal self-image congruence is more relevant to genuine products, while actual self-image congruence is more relevant to counterfeit products. The study provides further evidence that high self-monitored consumers would have better <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> on a genuine product compared to the low self-monitored consumers. In contrast, low self-monitored consumers would have higher <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> on counterfeits compared to high self-monitored consumers. The evaluation of image congruence–product relationship is also found to be positively moderated through self-monitoring in the context of genuine products. The major theoretical contribution of this study is an extension of the image congruence hypothesis to the context of counterfeit products and the acknowledgment of the role of self-monitoring in consumer behavior. The implications of the study for marketing practice suggest grounds for refining understanding of how consumers purchase and use counterfeits...|$|R

In Experiment 1, we draw on research in cultural psychology to demonstrate that while members of an individualist culture tend to follow the attenuation strategy described above, members of a collectivist culture tend to follow an additive strategy wherein both source and attribute information impact <b>product</b> <b>evaluations.</b> In Experiments 2 and 3, we provide further support for the proposed psychological mechanism underlying these results, and identify contexts under which these cultural differences are diminished...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the use of}} the intermediate representations, during the <b>products</b> <b>evaluations</b> occurs often tardily, after the validation of the concepts, what can cause expensive modifications and an increase of the time of putting on the market. It is thus preferable to be able to evaluate, in the early design phases, the characteristics and the functionalities of the future <b>product.</b> Traditionally, this <b>evaluation</b> is performed by means of physical intermediate representations. Today, the virtual reality allows to realize virtual intermediate representations, less expensive in term of time and money. So, why not working essentially with these virtual representations ? Our research concerns exactly this problematic. Trough our experiments, we tried to determine the advantages and the inconveniences of the virtual intermediate representations in comparison to the physical intermediate representations. Our study thus investigates the stakes of the virtual representations for <b>products</b> <b>evaluation,</b> in the early phases of the design process. this research work aims to reveal the positives and negatives implications of the usage of virtual reality, as <b>products</b> <b>evaluation</b> tool, in comparison to the traditional tools. Cette thèse s'intéresse à l'utilisation des représentations intermédiaires, durant les phases d'évaluation de produits. Les décisions prises durant ces phases importantes, orientent les choix de conception. Cependant, ces évaluations interviennent souvent tardivement, après la validation des concepts, ce qui peut entraîner des modifications coûteuses et un allongement du temps de mise sur le marché. Il est donc souhaitable de pouvoir évaluer, dès les phases amont de conception, les caractéristiques et les fonctionnalités du futur produit...|$|R

Most cue utilization {{studies have been conducted}} using simultaneous <b>evaluations</b> of <b>product</b> alternatives. This study was designed to compare the use of intrinsic and extrinsic cues in making <b>product</b> <b>evaluations</b> in a simultaneous evaluation circumstance and a sequential, time delayed evaluation circumstance. ^ The product used for the investigation was barbecue sauce. Students sampled and evaluated three perceptually different sauces under one of four possible conditions: branded [...] no time delay, brand [...] time delay, unbranded [...] no time delay, and unbranded [...] time delay. ^ Student evaluations of quality and similarity were analyzed using analysis of variance, 2 ̆ 2 t 2 ̆ 2 tests, and Latin square analysis. ^ Results indicated that ratings of product similarity and quality are different when evaluations made in sequential, time delayed trials are compared to simultaneous evaluation trials. It was also found that the ordering of the products had an influence on evaluations in the time delay conditions. In general, the findings related to the use of cues did not indicate a clean preference for either intrinsic or extrinsic cues in making <b>product</b> <b>evaluations.</b> ^ The conclusions drawn from the study include: (1) Time delayed <b>evaluations</b> of <b>products</b> are different than simultaneous evaluations of the same products.
