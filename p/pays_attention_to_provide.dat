This has negative consequences for the ecosystem and the health of the population in the long term. This problem led to the main question in this bachelor thesis: “How sustainable do Dutch consumers act with their pharmaceutical disposals?” To investigate the factors that influence environmentally significant behaviour in pharmaceutical waste disposal, I carried out a survey that reached 203 respondents in The Netherlands. I used several theories to construct the reasons how people make decisions in disposal of unused pharmaceuticals and why they throw them away by household waste or via sink or toilet for example. Included in this study are multiple (socio-) demographic factors and assumptions based on relevant literature. I found that environmental concerned people bring their medication to the pharmacy more often than people who are not concerned about the environment. However, there seems to exist incongruence between the attitude and actual behaviour. Women and elderly people show more sustainable behaviour regarding pharmaceutical waste. Being informed about the possibility to bring medication back to the pharmacy was a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour regarding pharmaceutical waste. The awareness of the harmful effects is also a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour. Thus, <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> information and enhance awareness amongst consumers, could be worthwhile to improve...|$|R
40|$|The {{advancement}} {{of the internet and}} information technology has been a great vehicle for the development of solutions for all human endeavors. The banking and the financial services sector has advanced from traditional banking services to internet-based banking. In recent times, banks and financial services firms have developed software solutions such as, ATM locator, Mobile banking and others which makes it easier and convenient for the user to have access to the bank without ever walking into the banking hall. The general adoption of mobile banking solutions worldwide is still not that encouraging. There are several drivers which affect the adoption of these internet-based banking solutions, such as socio-economic factors, mobile device adoption, and user behavior to name a few. The present project focuses on enumerating the key factors for user adoption of mobile banking solutions. The factors are then grouped into multiple perspectives and prioritized using the Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM). The results are ranked, discussed and then appropriate suggestions and conclusions are drawn. Our results show that all the factors are important but reliability and privacy are the most important factors that banks should <b>pay</b> much <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> during design and development of mobile banking solutions. We conclude that if a bank <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> a solution that meets the user’s reliability expectation, then the privacy risk can be further minimized since the user might have more confidence that their information will also be handled in the right way, which will not compromise their privacy...|$|R

40|$|Defined as the {{differential}} {{degree to which}} rich and poor countries benefit from new information and communi-cations technologies such as the Internet, the global digital divide is widely measured by international institutions {{in terms of the}} number of persons with individual access to those technologies. Yet, while this measure makes sense in the rich countries, where individual ownership is wide-spread among the population, it makes very little sense in poor countries. For, in the latter, what we find is that although individual access is indeed very limited, a remark-able number of local innovations ensure that the benefits of the Internet are made available to at least 10 million people throughout the Third World. Many such persons are illiter-ate, unskilled and resident in the rural areas of developing countries. These findings directly contradict the commonly held notion that there are few, if any, local innovations in the applications of the Internet outside the rich countries and those parts of poorer countries with close connections to the former (most typically through multinational corporations). From a policy point of view, we suggest that foreign aid donors and national governments <b>pay</b> less <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> individual access facilities such as so-called tele-centres and focus instead on ways to foster indigenous rural innovation systems devoted to finding relevant and cost-effective applications of the Internet. 1...|$|R

Maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) {{has been used as}} a measure of physical fitness. This study aimed to determine the effect of jogging program on midwives' physical fitness. Methods:In this randomized controlled trial two large healthcare centers in Mashhad were randomly selected and each center assigned to either intervention or control group. 60 employed midwives, working at these centers, were selected via convenience sampling. The intervention group performed aerobic exercises at 30 - 60 % VO 2 max during 24 sessions. At the beginning and end of the study, participants’ physical fitness was measured  by calculating VO 2 max, using Bruce test. Independent t-test, paired t-test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, and Chi-square tests were carried out using SPSS version 19 to analyse data.   Results: The two groups showed no significant difference in terms of age, marital status, level of education, economic status and body mass index (P> 0. 05). Mean VO 2 max in the intervention group (30. 6 ± 9. 1) was significantly higher than that of the control group (24. 3 ± 7. 3) (P= 0. 023). Participants' physical fitness was increased up to 30 % by jogging. Conclusion:As the results indicated, jogging could improve midwives’ physical fitness. Therefore, it is essential that health system directors <b>pay</b> more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> facilities at every workplace in order to improve employees’ physical fitness...|$|R
30|$|With the {{development}} of high-speed railway and public growing demand on data traffic, people <b>pay</b> much more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> high data rate and high reliable services under high mobility circumstance. Due to the higher data rate and lower system latency, long-term evolution (LTE) has been chosen as the next generation's evolution of railway mobile communication system by the International Union of Railways. However, {{there are still many}} problems to be solved in the high mobility applications of LTE, especially the higher handover failure probability, which seriously degrades the reliability of railway communication. This article proposes an optimized handover scheme, in which the coordinated multiple point transmission technology and dual vehicle station coordination mechanism are applied to improve the traditional hard handover performance of LTE. The scheme enables the high speed train to receive signals from both adjacent base stations and obtain diversity gain when it moves through the overlapping areas, so it improves the quality of the received signal and provides reliable communication between train and ground eNodeBs. Numerical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can decrease the outage probability remarkably during handover and guarantee the reliability of train to ground communication.|$|R
