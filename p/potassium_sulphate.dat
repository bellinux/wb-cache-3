50|$|Electrochemical dualism is an {{obsolete}} scientific {{theory in}} chemistry relevant between around 1800 and around 1830 and pioneered by Jöns Jacob Berzelius.

Berzelius based his theory on investigations he conducted in collaboration with Wilhelm Hisinger on certain salts with the newly discovered voltaic pile.

The theory was ultimately challenged and made redundant by radical theory.|$|E

5000|$|The method {{consists}} of heating a substance with sulphuric acid, which decomposes the organic substance by oxidation {{to liberate the}} reduced nitrogen as ammonium sulphate.

The amount of ammonia present, and thus the amount of nitrogen present in the sample, is determined by back titration. The end of the condenser is dipped into a solution of boric acid.

The potency is estimated by comparing the inhibition of growth of sensitive micro-organisms produced by known concentrations of the antibiotic to be examined and a reference substance. The validation study aims to demonstrate {{the determination of the}} potency of benzylpenicillin <b>potassium</b> and streptomycin <b>sulphate,</b> it is an appropriate analytical method, reproducible and meets the quality requirements of Ascomicin product. The paper establishes the performance characteristics of the method considered and identify the factors that influence these characteristics. The diameters of inhibition zones, directly proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the antibiotic used for the assay, measured and calculated using statistical methods (Combistats Soft). The assay is designed {{in such a way that}} the mathematical model on which the potency equation is based can be proved to be valid. A parallel-line model is chosen. The two log dose response lines of the preparation under examination and the standard preparation are parallel; they are rectilinear over the range of doses used in the calculation. These conditions are verified by validity tests for a given probability (P = 0. 05). The test is not valid unless the confidence limits (P = 0. 95) are not less than 50 per cent and not more than 200 per cent of the estimated potency.
