Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E

First published August 29, 2008; doi: 10. 1152 /ajplung. 00465. 2007. -Recent {{evidence suggests that}} asthma leads to inflammation and remodeling {{not only in the}} airways but also in <b>pulmonary</b> vessels and <b>parenchyma.</b> In addition, some studies demonstrated that aerobic training decreases chronic allergic inflammation in the airways; however, its effects on the <b>pulmonary</b> vessels and <b>parenchyma</b> have not been previously evaluated. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that aerobic conditioning reduces inflammation and remodeling in <b>pulmonary</b> vessels and <b>parenchyma</b> in a model of chronic allergic lung inflammation. Balb/c mice were sensitized at days 0, 14, 28, and 42 and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) from day 21 to day 50. Aerobic training started on day 21 and continued until day 50. <b>Pulmonary</b> vessel and <b>parenchyma</b> inflammation and remodeling were evaluated by quantitative analysis of eosinophils and mononuclear cells and by collagen and elastin contents and smooth muscle thickness. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify the density of positive cells to interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, interferon-gamma, IL- 10, monocyte chemotatic protein (MCP) - 1, nuclear factor (NF) -kappa B p 65, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I. OVA exposure induced pulmonary blood vessels and parenchyma inflammation as well as increased expression of IL- 4, IL- 5, MCP- 1, NF-kappa B p 65, and IGF-I by inflammatory cells were reduced by aerobic conditioning. OVA exposure also induced an increase in smooth muscle thickness and elastic and collagen contents in pulmonary vessels, which were reduced by aerobic conditioning. Aerobic conditioning increased the expression of IL- 10 in sensitized mice. We conclude that aerobic conditioning decreases pulmonary vascular and parenchymal inflammation and remodeling in this experimental model of chronic allergic lung inflammation in mice.

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of pulmonary infarction involves occlusion of the pulmonary artery, which increases blood {{flow from the}} bronchial artery, thereby generating pressure beyond {{the capacity of the}} peripheral vascular bed and causing extravasation of red blood cells, which results in hemorrhagic infarction [2, 3]. Pathological changes in pulmonary infarction initially include hemorrhage in the alveolar space, followed by necrosis of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> which leads to progressive fibrosis and parenchymal reorganization. Histological examination in this case revealed three layers of tissues (proximal to distal): normal lung, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary necrosis. This finding was consistent with the progression of the pathology of pulmonary infarction. Horizontal layers with various pathological changes indicated that the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>parenchyma</b> received blood supply both from the pulmonary artery and the bronchial artery.

40|$|Increased {{production}} of EGF or TGF-alpha by the respiratory epithelial cells {{has been associated}} with the pathogenesis of various forms of lung injury. Growth factors and cytokines are thought to act locally, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, to stimulate cell proliferation and matrix deposition by interstitial lung cells resulting in pulmonary fibrosis. To test whether TGF-alpha mediates pulmonary fibrotic responses, we have generated transgenic mice expressing human TGF-alpha under control of regulatory regions of the human surfactant protein C (SP-C) gene. Human TGF-alpha mRNA was expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells in the lungs of the transgenic mice. Adult mice bearing the SP-C-TGF-alpha transgene developed severe pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrotic lesions were observed in peribronchial, peribronchiolar, and perivascular regions, as well as subjacent to pleural surfaces. Lesions consisted of fibrous tissue that included groups of epithelial cells expressing endogenous SP-C mRNA, consistent with their identification as distal respiratory epithelial cells.

Respiratory rehabilitation is addressed to patients with chronic respiratory disease in all stages of severity who report symp-toms and limitation of their daily activity. It must be integrated in an individual patient tailored treatment as it improves dyspnea, exercise performance, and quality of life. Acute exacerbation of COPD is a sudden worsening of usual symptoms in a person with COPD, over and beyond normal daily variability that requires treatment modification. The pharmacologic therapy can be ap-plied at home and includes the administration of drugs used during the stable phase by increasing the dose or modifying the route, and adding, whenever required, drugs as antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids. In case of patients who because of COPD severity and/or of exacerbations do not respond promptly to treatment at home hospital admission should be considered. Patients with "severe or "very severe COPD who experience exacerbations should be carried out in respiratory unit, based on the severity of acute respiratory failure.

The highest R mut/wild KRAS was found in NSCLC specimens – 1. 36  ±  0. 29 while the lowest in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>parenchyma</b> – 0. 02  ±  0. 03 (p <  0. 001). R mut/wild KRAS in EBC did not correlate with the blood and cancer ratios. Determination of mutated KRAS oncogene in EBC can be potentially helpful in the follow-up of surgical treatment of pulmonary malignancy...|$|E
40|$|COPD is {{a chronic}} {{pathological}} {{condition of the}} respiratory system characterized by persistent and partially reversible airflow obstruction, to which variably contribute remodeling of bronchi (chronic bronchitis), bronchioles (small airway disease) and lung <b>parenchyma</b> (<b>pulmonary</b> emphysema). COPD can cause important systemic effects and be associated with complications and comorbidities. The diagnosis of COPD {{is based on the}} presence of respiratory symptoms and/or a history of exposure to risk factors, and the demonstration of airflow obstruction by spirometry. GARD of WHO has defined COPD "a preventable and treatable disease". The integration among general practitioner, chest physician as well as other specialists, whenever required, assures the best management of the COPD person, when specific targets to be achieved are well defined in a diagnostic and therapeutic route, previously designed and shared with appropriateness. The first-line pharmacologic treatment of COPD is represented by inhaled long-acting bronchodilators. In symptomatic patients, with pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 [*] 55 %. Respiratory rehabilitation is addressed to patients with chronic respiratory disease in all stages of severity who report symptoms and limitation of their daily activity. It must be integrated in an individual patient tailored treatment as it improves dyspnea, exercise performance, and quality of life. Acute exacerbation of COPD is a sudden worsening of usual symptoms in a person with COPD, over and beyond normal daily variability that requires treatment modification. The pharmacologic therapy can be applied at home and includes the administration of drugs used during the stable phase by increasing the dose or modifying the route, and adding, whenever required, drugs as antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids. In case of patients who because of COPD severity and/or of exacerbations do not respond promptly to treatment at home hospital admission should be considered. Patients with "severe" or "very severe" COPD who experience exacerbations should be carried out in respiratory unit, based on the severity of acute respiratory failure. An integrated system is required in the community in order to ensure adequate treatments also outside acute care hospital settings and rehabilitation centers.
