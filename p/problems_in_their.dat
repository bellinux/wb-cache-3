5|$|The {{majority}} of Queer Eye episodes {{use the same}} basic format. The episode begins with the Fab Five in an SUV (usually in New York City, where the series was based) discussing their heterosexual subject. The Five review details of the subject's personal life and note <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> various areas of expertise. The Five usually have a specific event for which they plan to prepare the subject. These included everything from throwing a backyard barbecue for friends to preparing {{to ask for a}} salary increase to proposing marriage.|$|E
5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of {{residents}} in the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane, as narrated by their deceased neighbor, Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong), who kills herself in the pilot episode after receiving a blackmail note. In recent episodes, Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross) begins dating a detective named Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake). Meanwhile, Lynette (Felicity Huffman) and Tom Scavo (Doug Savant) decide to separate after experiencing <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> marriage. Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) accidentally kills his wife Gabrielle's (Eva Longoria) stepfather, Alejandro Perez (Tony Plana), who raped her in her childhood and returns to inflict more harm.

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E

25|$|Considering {{the many}} signs and symptoms, the {{generally}} delayed diagnosis, {{and the possibility}} of residual complaints after treatment, it is little wonder that a significant number of people with Graves' disease have difficulty keeping their job. One study found that of 303 patients successfully treated for hyperthyroidism (77% had Graves' disease) 53% dealt with lack of energy. About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent mental <b>problems.</b> <b>In</b> <b>their</b> 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted disability pensions on the basis of intellectual dysfunction. Between 2006 and 2008, Ponto et al. surveyed 250 Graves' disease patients. Of these, 36% were written off sick and 5% even had to take early retirement.

500|$|A core {{tenet of}} {{psychodrama}} is Moreno's theory of [...] "spontaneity-creativity". Moreno {{believed that the}} best way for an individual to respond creatively to a situation is through spontaneity, that is, through a readiness to improvise and respond in the moment. By encouraging an individual to address a problem in a creative way, reacting spontaneously and based on impulse, they may begin to discover new solutions to <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives and learn new roles they can inhabit within it. Moreno's focus on spontaneous action within the psychodrama was developed in his Theatre of Spontaneity, which he directed in Vienna in the early 1920s. [...] Disenchanted with the stagnancy he observed in conventional, scripted theatre, he found himself interested in the spontaneity required in improvisational work. He founded an improvisational troupe in the 1920s. [...] This work in the theatre impacted the development of his psychodramatic theory.|$|E
