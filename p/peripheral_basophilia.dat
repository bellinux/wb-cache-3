40|$|Myelodysplastic {{syndrome}} (MDS) terminally transforms to acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) or bone marrow failure syndrome, but {{acute myeloid leukemia}} with basophilic differentiation has been rarely reported. An 81 -year-old man was referred to our department for further examination of intermittent fever and normocytic anemia during immunosuppressive treatment. Chromosomal analysis showed additional abnormalities involving chromosome 7. He was diagnosed as having MDS. At the time of diagnosis, basophils had not proliferated in the bone marrow. However, his anemia and thrombocytopenia rapidly worsened {{with the appearance of}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>basophilia</b> three months later. He was diagnosed as having AML with basophilic differentiation transformed from MDS. At that time, monosomy 7 was detected by chromosomal analysis. We found that basophils can be confirmed {{on the basis of the}} positivity for CD 203 c and CD 294 by flow cytometric analysis. We also found by cytogenetic analysis that basophils were derived from myeloblasts. He refused any chemotherapy and became transfusion-dependent. He died nine months after the transformation. We should keep in mind that MDS could transform to AML with basophilic differentiation when <b>peripheral</b> <b>basophilia</b> in addition to myeloblasts develops in patients with MDS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A morphologic {{study of}} the lungs {{was carried out in}} Swiss mice {{infected}} with yeast isolated from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb 18). The lung was processed 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after inoculation for histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), methenamine silver nitrate (Gomori–Grocott), and picrosirius to qualitative and quantitative analyses of the granulomas and the presence of fungal lesions. The numbers of CFUs/g counted in the lungs were 189. 8 ± 20. 64, 353. 6 ± 46. 21, 547. 2 ± 108. 1, and 295. 2 ± 89. 17 in the first, second, fourth, and eighth weeks, respectively. One week after infection, inflammatory cells and reticular and collagens fibers, the latest typical of fibrosis, were detected. After 2 and 4 weeks, a progressive intensification of the infection and fibrosis was observed, but in week 8 a more orga-nized granuloma was evident, with macrophages, epithelioid cells, and yeasts in the central portion, and intense <b>peripheral</b> <b>basophilia.</b> Pycnotic structures typical of apoptotic bodies were observed in weeks 1 and 8. The different histologic stain-ing used acted as a fundamental tool for the {{study of the}} morphologic organization of granuloma formation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Translocations {{involving}} region 5 q 31 - 32 (PDGFRB) {{have been}} reported in a variety of myeloproliferative diseases and are often associated with significant peripheral eosinophilia. We report an unusual case of a patient presenting with <b>peripheral</b> <b>basophilia</b> and systemic mastocytosis in whom cytogenetic analysis revealed a t(4; 5) (q 21. 1;q 31. 3). DESIGN AND METHODS: We used molecular analyses to determine the role of PDGFRB in this case. The patient was treated with imatinib. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) documented a breakpoint in PDGFRB. In agreement with this, the patient responded very well to imatinib with resolution of clinical symptoms, basophilia, and mast cell disease. Molecular analyses revealed that PDGFRB, encoding an imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinase, was fused to PRKG 2. The fusion gene incorporates the first two exons of PRKG 2 fused to the truncated exon 12 of PDGFRB, resulting in the disruption of its juxtamembrane domain. Functional studies confirmed that the activity and transforming properties of PRKG 2 -PDGFRbeta were dependent on the disruption of the auto-inhibitory juxtamembrane domain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify a second case of the PRKG 2 -PDGFRB fusion and confirm the unusual PDGFRB breakpoint associated with this fusion. This work also illustrates the use of imatinib for the treatment of specific cases of systemic mastocytosis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Pyoderma gangrenosum at {{the site}} of sternal marrow {{aspirate}} was observed in a patient with acute myeloproliferative disease characterized by a high <b>peripheral</b> blood <b>basophilia.</b> Lesions with a similar appearance were also seen on the palate. No other disease known to be associated with pyoderma gangrenosum could be demonstrated. A review of the literature suggests that myeloproliferative disease should now be recognized as occurring in association with pyoderma gangrenosum...|$|R
40|$|The {{anticoagulant}} {{activity of}} proteoglycans released from human basophils was evaluated. Basophils {{were obtained from}} normal donors and patients with abnormally high <b>peripheral</b> blood <b>basophilia</b> accompanying chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and enriched by Hypaque-Ficoll gradient sedimentation. From normal donors (8. 9 ± 4. 6) × 10 (6) basophils were obtained with a purity of 6. 2 ± 1. 7 %, and from patients with CML (1. 4 ± 0. 3) × 10 (7) basophils were obtained with a purity of 52. 1 ± 6. 9 %. Isolated basophils from normal donors, which were passive-sensitized with high IgE serum from an allergic patient and challenged with rabbit anti-human IgE or stimulated by calcium ionophore A 23187, released proteoglycans which stained metachromatically with Azure A, as well as histamine. No anticoagulant activity was detected in proteoglycans released from human basophils by the amidolytic method using chromogenic substrate S- 2238. Isolated basophils from patients with CML, which were labeled by [(35) S] sulfate, were also passive-sensitized and challenged with rabbit anti-human IgE. Released [(35) S] proteoglycans filtered on Sephadex G- 25 were resistant to heparinase and chondroitin- 6 -sulfatase, and susceptible to degaradation by chondroitin ABC lyase, chondroitin AC lyase and chondroitin- 4 -sulfatase. These findings indicate that the [(35) S] proteoglycans released from basophils were made up of chondroitin sulfate type A. No heparin was identified. The basophil proteoglycans had no anticoagulant activity and were different from the proteoglycans of human lung mast cells. This fact may be particularly relevant {{to the location of}} each cell...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the immune}} {{responses}} to intestinal nematode infection {{have been well}} studied and {{have been shown to}} be strongly driven by Th 2 -associated cytokines in mice, such information has been limited with respect to rats. We investigated changes in levels of the mRNAs encoding interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), IL- 3, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, and gamma interferon in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis by reverse transcription-PCR in comparison with immunoglobulin E (IgE) /IgG 2 a antibody, eosinophil, basophil, and mucosal mast cell responses. In the two rat strains used, Brown Norway and Fischer- 344, which show different responses to allergens, serum IgE increased to much higher levels in the former than in the latter 2 weeks after infection. Intestinal mastocytosis was observed much earlier and more intensely in Brown Norway rats than in Fischer- 344 rats, but the degrees of <b>peripheral</b> eosinophilia and <b>basophilia</b> did not differ between the two strains. In both strains, IL- 3, IL- 4, and IL- 5 mRNA expression increased and peaked around 7 to 14 days after infection, while expression of IL- 2, IL- 10, and gamma interferon mRNAs did not change notably throughout the experimental period. The highest IL- 4 mRNA expression was observed slightly earlier in Brown Norway than in Fischer- 344 rats, but levels of IL- 3 and IL- 5 mRNAs peaked synchronously in both strains. The amounts of mRNAs encoding these three cytokines were always higher in Brown Norway than in Fischer- 344 rats. It is suggested that in rats, Th 2 or Th 2 -like cells are also induced after nematode infection, and IgE elevation is mainly related to increased IL- 4 gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Discrete bodies {{which may}} be {{designated}} cytochondria occupy {{the greater part of}} the cytoplasm of liver cells. A part, but not all, of these bodies have the characteristics of mitochondria. They consist of a rim which stains deeply and a central part which stains faintly or remains unstained. In liver cells about portal spaces, in foci of regeneration, and in tumor cells the rims of the cytochondria stain with basic dyes and contain ribonucleic acid or related substances. With increasing accumulation of basophile substances about cytochondria as the central veins are approached, these bodies aggregate to form clumps or orient themselves with palisade-like arrangment in two rows just within the margins of the liver cell columns. With aggregation of the cytochondria that are surrounded by basophile material, other cytochondria in the same cells are devoid of this material and wholly acidophile. With chromatolysis (disappearance of basophile substance) caused by dimethylaminoazobeiizene (butter yellow) cytochondria lose their <b>peripheral</b> <b>basophilia</b> and stain only with acid dyes. When ribonucleic acid is removed from fixed liver tissue by ribonuclease, cytochondria lose their affinity for basic stains and become acidophile. Of the cytochondria that are surrounded by ribonucleic acid or related substances part have the characteristics of mitochondria. Under the influence of butter yellow cytochondria may become greatly swollen and intensely acidophile in the center though they retain their basophile rim. These swollen bodies in part at least have the reactions of mitochondria. In tumor cells of hepatomas mitochondria are smaller and less abundant than in parenchymatous cells of the liver, and accompanying them are bodies of similar size which do not react as mitochondria. The cytochondria of hepatomas produced by butter yellow undergo acidophile degeneration similar to that of liver cells and form swollen spherical bodies with basophile rims. With partial or complete loss of basophile substance, these altered cytochondria may form conspicuous cell inclusions...|$|E
