5|$|Despite this, the Army Air Corps {{found the}} {{performance}} of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five <b>pre-production</b> <b>aircraft,</b> to be designated YB-21. However, soon after this contract was awarded, it was cancelled, and none of the YB-21s were ever built, leaving the XB-21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed. Operated by North American Aviation, the XB-21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement.|$|E

2500|$|The French Air Force {{acquired}} the three <b>pre-production</b> Br.761S <b>aircraft,</b> these {{and the six}} Sahara aircraft acquired from Air France provided the French Air Force with a valuable transport fleet for moving personnel and materials to the Pacific nuclear testing areas. [...] The Sahara fleet was retired in 1972.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Pre-production</b> Ki-44 <b>aircraft</b> {{and two of}} the prototypes {{were turned}} over to the Army for service trials on 15 September 1941. The type {{commenced}} operations when nine aircraft were received by an experimental unit, 47th Chutai [...] "Kawasemi Buntai" [...] ("Kingfisher Flight, 47th Squadron"), commanded by Major Toshio Sakagawa at Saigon, Indochina in December 1941.|$|R
5|$|The XR-1, {{having been}} {{repaired}} in the meantime, {{was once again}} flying, and a contract had been awarded to Platt-Lepage {{for the construction of}} seven <b>pre-production</b> <b>aircraft,</b> to be built to an improved version of the XR-1A design, and designated YR-1A. Motivated by Congressional concerns about potential favouritism towards Sikorsky Aircraft, which had in the meantime been given a contract for development of an improved version of their VS-300 experimental helicopter, the contract called for delivery of the first YR-1A to the Army in January 1945. However, due to continued financial and flight-testing problems, Platt-Lepage proved incapable of meeting this schedule.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{selected}} the Sea King {{to meet a}} requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex, placing an order with Westland for 60 SH-3D Sea Kings in June 1966. The prototype and three <b>pre-production</b> <b>aircraft</b> were built by Sikorsky at Stratford, Connecticut and shipped to the United Kingdom to act as trials and pattern aircraft. The first of the SH-3Ds was initially fitted with General Electric T58s and, after being shipped from the United States, was flown in October 1966 from the dockside at Avonmouth to Yeovil airfield. The other three were delivered from the docks, by road to Yeovil, for completion with British systems and Rolls-Royce Gnome engines. The first Westland-built helicopter, designated Sea King HAS1, flew on 7 May 1969 at Yeovil. The first two helicopters were used for trials and evaluation by Westland and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment; subsequent production Sea Kings were delivered to the Royal Navy's 700 Naval Air Squadron from August 1969 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{production}} {{problems and}} the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first <b>pre-production</b> <b>aircraft,</b> but it was stymied, again, for a lack of an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of ignition cables were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests. All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed.|$|E
50|$|These Joint STARS {{developmental}} aircraft {{also participated}} in Operation Joint Endeavor, a NATO peacekeeping mission, in December 1995. While flying in friendly air space, the test-bed E-8A and <b>pre-production</b> E-8C <b>aircraft</b> monitored ground movements to confirm compliance with the Dayton Peace Accords agreements. Crews flew 95 consecutive operational sorties and more than 1,000 flight hours with a 98% mission effectiveness rate.|$|R
2500|$|The Air France {{aircraft}} had accommodation for 59 {{passengers on}} the top deck, and 48 on the lower deck, although the aircraft was capable of carrying 135 passengers in a high-density layout. During 1964 Air France transferred six Br.763s to the French Air Force. [...] The air force also acquired the three <b>pre-production</b> Br.761S <b>aircraft</b> and four new Br.765 Sahara freighter aircraft with removable cargo doors.|$|R
5|$|The British Government {{ordered a}} total of four prototypes (two F-4K and two F-4M), {{together}} with a pair of <b>pre-production</b> F-4K <b>aircraft.</b> The first UK Phantom, a prototype F-4K (designated YF-4K), first flew on 27 June 1966 at the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis. The second made its first flight on 30 August 1966. The two <b>pre-production</b> F-4K <b>aircraft</b> were constructed alongside the prototypes, and were initially used for fit check trials of the various systems to be fitted â€“ the first was used for catapult/arrestor and deck landing trials, and the second was primarily for testing the radar and missile systems. All four were delivered to the UK from 1969 to 1970 for continued test work by both the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment and British Aerospace. One of the pre-production examples was subsequently delivered to the RAF for operational use, but was lost in 1978. The first F-4M prototype (designated YF-4M) first flew on 17 February 1967, and was also used for fit checks before delivery to the UK.|$|R
5|$|In November 2007, the PAF and PAC {{conducted}} flight {{evaluations of}} aircraft {{fitted with a}} variant of the NRIET KLJ-10 radar developed by China's Nanjing Research Institute for Electronic Technology (NRIET), and the LETRI SD-10 active radar homing AAM. In 2005, PAC began manufacturing JF-17 components; production of sub-assemblies commenced on 22 January 2008. The PAF was to receive a further six <b>pre-production</b> <b>aircraft</b> in 2005, for a total of 8 out of an initial production run of 16 aircraft. Initial operating capability was to be achieved by the end of 2008. Final assembly of the JF-17 in Pakistan began on 30 June 2009; PAC expected to complete production of four to six aircraft that year. They planned to produce twelve aircraft in 2010 and fifteen to sixteen aircraft per year from 2011; this could increase to twenty-five aircraft per year. On December 29, 2015, Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) announced the rollout of 16th JF-17 Thunder fighter manufactured in the calendar year 2015, taking total number of manufactured aircraft to more than 66. Later, a PAF spokesperson said that in light of the interest shown by various countries, it has been decided that production capacity of JF-17 Thunder at PAC Kamra will be expanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Hamilcars that the War Office {{required}} frequently fluctuated. In May 1942 the War Office asked GAL for 360 Hamilcars {{to be used}} in two major airborne operations, but this was found to be unrealistic; not only was the production rate for the glider far too slow to accommodate this large number, the same number of tugs needed to tow the gliders could not be found. In November 1943 the War Office issued another report in which it increased the number of required gliders to 800, an even more unrealistic number; by the time production of the Hamilcar ended, a total of 344 had been built. GAL produced an initial run of 22 Hamilcars, which included the two prototype models and ten <b>pre-production</b> <b>aircraft</b> required for evaluation trials. Subsequent production of parts was assigned to a series of sub-contractors called the 'Hamilcar Production Group', which included the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, the Co-operative Wholesale Society and AC Cars. Production for the glider was targeted to begin in late 1941 with approximately 40â€“50 to be completed {{by the end of that}} year; in reality this was overoptimistic, with the planned 40â€“50 only being completed by June 1944.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1939, Italy {{received}} its first Daimler-Benz DB 601Aâ€”a liquid-cooled inverted V-12 engine rated at [...] from Germany. This gave the F.4 project {{a new lease on}} life, as the Air Ministry approved of its use in fighters. The last of 12 <b>pre-production</b> F.5 <b>aircraft</b> ordered for the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) was selected for conversion into the F.4 prototype, powered by the DB 601A. It flew {{for the first time in}} July 1940.|$|R
50|$|On 19 December 2008, Lockheed Martin {{rolled out}} the first weight-optimized F-35A, {{designated}} AF-1. It was the first F-35 built at full production speed, and is structurally identical to the production F-35As that were delivered starting in 2010. On 5 January 2009, six F-35s had been built, including AF-1; another 13 <b>pre-production</b> test <b>aircraft</b> and four production aircraft were being manufactured. On 6 April 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed speeding up production for the U.S. to buy 2,443 F-35s.|$|R

50|$|During May 1938, the 2nd Escadrille of the 7th Groupes de Chasse at Rheims {{conducted}} {{operational testing}} of the type using a handful of <b>pre-production</b> M.S.406 <b>aircraft.</b> In spite of some accidents experienced, pilots were commonly pleased with the type's performance; {{in response to the}} accidents, improvements such as the strengthening of the undercarriage and the cabin hood were implemented during mid-1939. In spite of complaints regarding the forward fuselage exterior covering and motor attachments, no corrective actions were implemented to address these concerns.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1943, {{however, the}} third {{prototype}} was fitted with refined versions of the HeS 8 engine and was ready for its next demonstration. On 22 December, a mock dogfight was staged for RLM officials in which the He 280 was matched against an Fw 190. Here, the jet demonstrated its vastly superior speed, completing four laps of an oval course before the Fw 190 could complete three. Finally, {{at this point the}} RLM became interested and placed an order for 20 <b>pre-production</b> test <b>aircraft,</b> to be followed by 300 production machines.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, {{a program}} {{to develop a new}} jet trainer for the Polish Air Force started at the Institute of Aeronautics (Polish: Instytut Lotnictwa) to replace the TS-11 Iskra. The Iryda was {{designed}} in PZL Mielec (then WSK-Mielec). The first prototype was flown on March 3, 1985. The project was finally canceled in the 1990s due to problems and a lack of funding. Another reason was a crash of the <b>pre-production</b> series <b>aircraft,</b> even though the cause of accident was exceeding of the performance limits during forced flutter tests.|$|R
