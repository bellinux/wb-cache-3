5|$|After Labor's defeats at {{the hands}} of the United Australia Party (UAP) at the 1932 and 1935 state elections, Heffron became {{associated}} with a small group in caucus and in the NSW Labor Council who aimed to depose Lang as leader. However, while Heffron's movement was based on his personal stronghold in his BotanyMaroubra ALP branches and the left-wing trade unions, Lang maintained majority control of the caucus, <b>party</b> <b>machine</b> and the party newspaper, Labor Daily.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the <b>party</b> <b>machine,</b> and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|A few hip-hop dance shows {{appeared}} {{on television in}} the 1990s such as 1991's The <b>Party</b> <b>Machine</b> with Nia Peeples and 1992's The Grind. Several hip-hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including (but not limited to) Dance Fever, Dance 360, The Wade Robson Project, MTV Dance Crew, America's Best Dance Crew, Dance on Sunset, and Shake It Up. In 2006, MTV France documented {{the creation of a}} dance crew for an original series called MTV Dance Crew. Viewers were able to see the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul. Original Soul was coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing. Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at Juste Debout, the Seven 2 Smoke battle at The Notorious IBE, and b-boy battles at Chelles Battle Pro. B-boy Lilou, b-boy crew Phase T, and promoter Bruce Ykanji (the founder of Juste Debout) all made appearances during the show.|$|E

McNutt was challenging Roosevelt for the Presidential nomination, forcing Minton {{to choose between}} the administration and his allies in the state party.

50|$|In 1887, Cole became {{editor of}} the Andover Townsman. In 1896 he became the {{publisher}} of the Lawrence Telegram. He was also the manager and treasurer of the Andover Press.

25|$|Wishing to {{make the}} Milwaukee Sentinel into a more {{reliable}} organ for the state Republican party, Carpenter and other backers bought the paper and forced out editor Alexander M. Thomson, who had been instrumental in getting Carpenter elected senator. Thomson was now deemed too critical of the <b>party</b> <b>machine.</b> His ousting made him a lifelong enemy of Carpenter. The Sentinel soon was seen as Carpenter's personal mouthpiece.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the 1981 general {{election}} Fine Gael had a <b>party</b> <b>machine</b> that could easily match Fianna Fáil's. The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach on 30 June 1981. To the surprise of many Fitzgerald excluded Richie Ryan, Richard Burke and Tom O'Donnell, former Fine Gael stalwarts, from the cabinet.|$|E
25|$|From the 1920s to the 1960s, {{the state}} was {{dominated}} by the Byrd Organization, with dominance by rural counties aligned in a Democratic <b>party</b> <b>machine,</b> but their hold was broken over their failed Massive Resistance to school integration. After World War II, the state's economy thrived, with a new industrial and urban base. A statewide community college system was developed. The first U.S. African-American governor since Reconstruction was Virginia's Douglas Wilder in 1990. Since the late 20th century, the contemporary economy has become more diversified in high-tech industries and defense-related businesses. Virginia's changing demography makes for closely divided voting in national elections {{but it is still}} generally conservative in state politics.|$|E

Nicholson won by just 43 votes over Churchill;Churchill had {{come close to}} defeating the <b>party</b> <b>machines.</b> The extent of his support was mainly due to the backing he received from significant sections of the London press who backed him as a personality rather than in support for a Unionist/Liberal coalition.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s, Sanders was active in several peace and antiwar movements. He {{was a member of}} the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Student Peace Union while attending the University of Chicago. Sanders applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be drafted. Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought and has been a strong supporter of veterans' benefits. Sanders also worked on the reelection campaign of Leon Despres, a prominent Chicago alderman who was opposed to mayor Richard J. Daley's Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>machine.</b> During his student years he also read a variety of American and European political authors, from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and John Dewey to Karl Marx and Erich Fromm.|$|E
500|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Thacher Longstreth, a 35-year-old {{advertising executive}} {{who had never}} run for office before. He emerged the victor of a four-way primary contest over George P. Williams (the Republican leadership's preferred candidate), city magistrate James J. Clothier, and Oscar H. Newman, a deputy constable. Longstreth's campaign {{got off to a}} rocky start when he broke with the city Republican organization over their failure to elect his preferred candidate, John M. Pomeroy, as chairman of the Republican City Committee. Although he did receive a campaign visit and endorsement from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Longstreth had little other assistance from the Republican <b>party</b> <b>machine</b> and ran as an [...] "Independent Republican". Republicans still held an edge in voter registration in 1955, but their share of the electorate continued to decline over previous years.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} a {{difference}} between Marine Le Pen's and her father's views concerning the Holocaust and Jews. In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine Rivarol that the German occupation of France [...] "was not particularly inhumane, {{even if there were}} a few blunders, inevitable in a country of [...] " [...] and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as [...] "a point of detail {{of the history of the}} Second World War." [...] He has repeated the latter claim several times. Also in 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said [...] "I do not question the existence of concentration camps but historians could discuss the number of deaths. As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to speak their minds" [...] (de se déterminer). Jean-Marie Le Pen received fines for this sentence, Bruno Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation. The current leader of the party, Marine Le Pen distanced herself for a time from the <b>party</b> <b>machine</b> in protest against her father's comment.|$|E

50|$|The Atari {{joystick}} port is {{a widely}} used computer port used to connect various gaming controllers to game console and home computer systems. It was originally introduced on the Atari 2600 in 1977 and then used on the Atari 400 and 800 in 1979. It went cross-platform with the Commodore VIC-20 of 1981, and was then used on many following machines from both companies, {{as well as a}} growing list of 3rd <b>party</b> <b>machines</b> like the MSX platform and various Sega consoles.|$|R
500|$|Even {{while the}} {{economic}} boom continued, the LCL vote gradually declined after 1941. [...] The LCL never held more than 23 seats during Playford's tenure due to being almost nonexistent in Adelaide. [...] With few exceptions, its support in the capital {{was limited to the}} eastern crescent and the Holdfast Bay area even at the height of Playford's power. [...] It relied on favourable preferences from minor parties and independents and the malapportioned electoral system in order to stay in office. It did, however, win a majority of actual votes, barring 1944 and 1953, on a two-party-preferred basis until 1962. Labor had begun to combat the Playmander by directing its efforts at individual seats, and abandoning a statewide campaign. Slowly, seats were whittled away—the loss of Norwood in 1953 was followed by the losses of Murray, Millicent and Frome in 1956, and Mt Gambier and Wallaroo in 1957–8 by-elections. Playford's dominance over the party and his ignorance of the wishes of its broad membership base brought about a degree of disillusionment, and the <b>party</b> <b>machine</b> began to decay. The dominance stopped {{the emergence of a new}} generation of political talent, and had a [...] "stultifying" [...] effect. Although the Playmander ensured his ongoing electoral success, and Playford was credited with South Australia's economic success, the LCL polled a lower percentage than the corresponding Liberal government at federal level.|$|E

They recorded a version of Richard Berry's [...] "Louie Louie" [...] in 1965 which led to a recording contract and three more singles. In 1967 they formed The <b>Party</b> <b>Machine,</b> which had a more radical sound (influenced by Frank Zappa and Howlin' Wolf), the band included Mike Rudd (later in Spectrum) on bass guitar. They released a single [...] "You've All Gotta Go" [...] in 1969; their printed songbooks were confiscated and burned by the Victorian Vice Squad for being obscene and seditious. Wilson disbanded The <b>Party</b> <b>Machine</b> after receiving an invitation to travel to London to join expatriate Australian band Procession during 1969. After they released Procession on Festival Records Wilson returned to Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the party}} {{there was a}} long debate over organisation. The {{original}} idea was the so-called [...] "light party" [...] (partito leggero), intended to be different from Italian traditional, bureaucratic and self-referential, <b>party</b> <b>machines.</b> This was the line of the early founders of the party, notably Marcello Dell'Utri and Antonio Martino. However Claudio Scajola and most former Christian Democrats supported a more capillary-based organisation, in order to make participate as much people as possible, and a more collegial, participative and democratic decision-making process.|$|R

2500|$|To obtain {{large-scale}} {{federal money}} the mayor became a close partner of Roosevelt and New Deal {{agencies such as}} CWA, PWA and WPA, which poured $1.1billion into the city from 1934–39. In turn he gave FDR a showcase for New Deal achievement, helped defeat FDR's political enemies in Tammany Hall (the Democratic <b>party</b> <b>machine</b> in Manhattan). [...] He and Moses built highways, bridges and tunnels, transforming the physical landscape of New York City. The West Side Highway, East River Drive, Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, Triborough Bridge, and two airports (LaGuardia Airport, and, later, Idlewild, now JFK Airport) were built during his mayoralty.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Stewart Parnell {{possessed the}} {{remarkable}} attribute of charisma, was an enigmatic personality, politically gifted and {{is regarded as}} one of the most extraordinary figures in Irish and British politics. He played a part in the process that undermined his own Anglo-Irish caste; within two decades absentee landlords were almost unknown in Ireland. He created single-handedly in the Irish Party Britain's [...] first modern disciplined political <b>party</b> <b>machine.</b> He held all the reins of Irish nationalism and also harnessed Irish-America to finance the cause.

2500|$|Wilson {{began his}} musical career in 1964 and formed his first band The Pink Finks with thirteen-year-old Ross Hannaford (guitar and vocals), {{who would become}} his long-time musical partner, whilst both were still at school. They {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Louie Louie" [...] as a single in 1965 on their own label, Mojo, and followed with three more singles after being signed to local label W & G. At about this time he met Patricia Higgins (future Pat Wilson) whilst working at the Department of Supply. The Pink Finks {{was followed by the}} more progressively oriented The <b>Party</b> <b>Machine</b> (1967–69) still with Hannaford, but included Mike Rudd on bass (later in Spectrum). Compensation for his earlier car accident was received by 1969, which enabled Wilson to travel to England with Pat. He had been invited by Brian Peacock (bass guitar) to join his band Procession. Whilst there, Wilson married Pat, recorded an album Procession with the band and began to work on the song [...] "Eagle Rock". Wilson returned to Australia later that year and formed Sons of the Vegetal Mother (1969–70), again including Hannaford and Rudd, a group inspired by the work of Frank Zappa.|$|E
2500|$|The party's {{branches}} and local groups {{were referred to}} as [...] "units" [...] within the party. These were designed to recruit followers, raise funds, and campaign during elections. Under Tyndall, the party operated with a skeleton organisation. It had no full-time staff {{and for most of}} the 1980s lacked a telephone number. Instead it relied on a handful of geographically scattered, unpaid regional organisers. Its early activists were recruited from within the extreme-right movement, and thus lacked the experience and skills in electoral campaigning. When Griffin took control, he introduced a variety of internal departments to help manage the party's activities: the administration and enquiries department, department for group development, legal affairs department, security department, and communications department. Griffin tried to build a more professional <b>party</b> <b>machine</b> by educating and training BNP members, providing them with incentives, establishing a steady income stream, and overcoming factionalism and dissent.
