Methods: Cross sectional, retrospective observational study using secondary data. The value of pharmaceuticals procured by primary health care facilities in 87 randomly selected districts for the Financial Year 2011 / 2012 was collected. Various specifications of the dependent variable (<b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure)</b> were used: total <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure,</b> Per capita district <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> per district health facility and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> per outpatient department visit. Andersen’s behaviour model of health services utilisation was used as conceptual framework to identify independent variables likely to influence health care utilisation and hence <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Econometric analysis was conducted to estimate parameters of various regression models.

40|$|This paper differs in {{two ways}} from {{previous}} comparative health system research. First, it focuses {{on the impact of}} <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> on total health expenditures as trends in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> have been blamed of being a major driver of national health expenditures. In addition to <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures,</b> other variables of interest are income, public financing, public delivery, ageing and urbanization. Second, the analysis includes a thorough sensitivity analysis on the proposed model using four samples (with and without the US, and imputed and not imputed data) {{to address the issue of}} robustness. Based on a typology of health care systems, trends of relevant explanatory variables are described using OECD Health Data 2003 data. Unlike any other of the variables, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> show contradicting trends when measured as per capita <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> and <b>pharmaceutical</b> share of total health expenditures. Next, a regression analysis is performed on data from 1970 – 2000 for 19 OECD countries. Regression diagnostics indicated the absence of multicollinearity but the presence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Based on the Hausman test, a fixed effect model was chosen. As in all previous empirical research, per capita GDP turned out to be the most influential explanatory variable. While public financing of health care was always three out of four samples significantly inversely related to health expenditures, public delivery as a NHS dummy was always significantly positively related to the dependent variable. Unlike previous research, ageing is consistently and significantly related to higher total health expenditures and, so is urbanization. Finally, all samples show a highly negative relationship between share of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> and health expenditures, suggesting support for the substitution theory. health care expenditure; health care system; health economics; health policy; comparative...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A key policy {{question}} for the government of Uganda is how to equitably allocate primary health care pharmaceutical budgets to districts. This paper seeks to identify variables influencing current primary health care <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> and their usefulness in allocating prospective pharmaceutical budgets to districts. Methods: This was a cross sectional, retrospective observational study using secondary administrative data. We collected data {{on the value of}} pharmaceuticals procured by primary health care facilities in each district from National Medical Stores for the financial year 2011 / 2012. The dependent variable was expressed as per capita district <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure.</b> By reviewing literature we identified 26 potential explanatory variables. They include supply, need and demand, and health system organization variables that may influence the demand and supply of health services and the corresponding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure.</b> We collected secondary data for these variables for all the districts in Uganda (n[*]=[*] 112). We performed econometric analysis to estimate parameters of various regression models. Results: There is a significant correlation between per capita district <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> and total district population, rural poverty, access to drinking water and outpatient department (OPD) per capita utilisation. (P< 0. 01). The percentage of health centre IIIs (HC III) among each district’s health facilities is significantly correlated with per capita <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). OPD per capita utilisation has a relatively strong correlation with per capita <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> (r[*]=[*] 0. 498); all the other significant factors are weakly correlated with per capita <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> (r< 0. 5). From several iterations of an initially developed model, the proposed final model for explaining per capita <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> explains about 53 % of the variation in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> among districts in Uganda (Adjusted R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 528).

Objective: To describe and explain the rise in drug expenditures through decomposition of the increase into the contribution of changes in prices, in volumes and a product-mix effect. Methods: The decomposition of the growth in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Greece over the period 1991 - 2006 was conducted using data from the largest social insurance fund (IKA) that covers more than 50 % of the population. Results: Real drug spending increased by 285 %, despite a 58 % decrease in the relative price of pharmaceuticals. The increase in expenditure is mainly attributable to a switch to more innovative, but more expensive, pharmaceuticals, indicated by a product-mix residual of 493 % in the decomposition. A rising volume of drugs also plays a role, and this is due to {{an increase in the number}} of prescriptions issued per doctor visit, rather than an increase in the number of visits or the population size.

40|$|Background: The {{predicted}} ageing {{rate of the}} Italian {{population is}} one of the highest worldwide and this condition is expected to produce a growing increase in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} assess whether or not off-patent drugs could counterbalance the economic effects generated by the aging of the Italian population in the next ten years. Methods: On the basis of the predicted ageing rate of the Italian population for the period 2008 - 2018, the average annual cumulative increase of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> and potential savings generated by the future loss of patent coverage have been considered in order to identify the year of the Breakeven Point. Results: The economic effect induced by the progressive ageing of population produces an average of 0. 94 % cumulative increase in local <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> per year, corresponding to an incremental <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> of about € 116 millions per year. A number of 509 brands (103 active substances) will lose their patent coverage in the next 10 years.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> vary by age and the {{presence}} of chronic health problems. METHODS: Data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey were used to obtain nationally representative estimates of outpatient prescription drug expenditures for the noninstitutionalized population and the fraction of total health expenditures used to purchase medications for age-chronic disease population subgroups. RESULTS: Although the elderly make up 12 % of the population, they account for 34 % of total <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures.</b> <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> are 9 % of total expenditures for children, 13 % for nonelderly adults, and 23 % for the elderly. Among nonelderly adults, approximately one third have at least one chronic condition and account for over two thirds of drug expenditures. Among the elderly, 36 % have three or more chronic conditions and account for 57 % of drug expenditures for this group; 41 % of total drug expenditures are for cardiovascular or renal drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Significant pharmaceutical spending is for treatment of chronic conditions, which subjects insurance coverage to adverse selection and could affect the design of prescription drug benefit packages.

40|$|Objectives: Pharmaceutical {{policies}} have become paramount in China {{and other countries}} of the Asia-Pacific region because of rapidly rising expenditures on drugs. The prob-lems are especially acute in China because expenditures on drugs are typically so large. This article intends to review effects of the policy of drug expenditure containment with primary reference to China, and it proposes some measures to deal with rising <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Methods: This article overviews the issues of pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access in China, {{and there are a}} number of policies or measures to control <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Nevertheless, the effect of those policies of containing drug expenditure is ambiguous so far, and some {{policies have}} negative impacts to the manufacturers, provid-ers, and patients. Some underlying reasons are identified. First, the policy’s focus on health-care costs is, to some extent, neglected. Second, the governance of the health sector, including pharmaceutical sector, needs to be improved by both the government and the market. Results: This article proposes some suggestions to change policies in drug pricing, reimbursement, and access, and make policies more responsive to the main problem of rising health-care expenditures rather than that of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> alone.

40|$|Rising <b>{{pharmaceutical}}</b> <b>expenditure</b> {{has become}} a major concern for policy makers in Germany over recent years.

Although it is difficult to attribute certain effects to single measures, some measures like reference pricing and physician spending caps are more effective and long-lasting than others.

40|$|External price {{referencing}} (EPR) {{is applied}} {{more and more}} frequently worldwide by payers to control pharmaceutical prices. Together with the parallel trade of pharmaceuticals, EPR may result in lower pharmaceutical prices in higher-income countries and higher prices in lower-income countries, which implies that <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> grows more rapidly in the latter than in the former group. Our objective was to assess this hypothesis. We used hierarchical linear models on country-level panel data to show that—after controlling for compounding factors such as GDP, {{the proportion of the}} old-age population or life expectancy—the annual growth rate of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> was 2. 1 % points larger in the lower- than in the higher-income members of the European Union between 2000 and 2008. This difference in trends became non-significant (0. 6 % points) after the onset of the global economic crisis. There {{was no significant difference between}} lower- and higher-income countries in the growth rate of non-pharmaceutical health expenditure in either period. Our results indirectly support the presence of price convergence of pharmaceuticals among European countries, and EPR and parallel trade may provide a reasonable explanation to the observed trend difference of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the two groups of countries between 2000 and 2008. This higher growth rate of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure</b> put extra burden on public health care budgets in lower-income countries and resulted in disproportionately more cost-containment measures compared to higher-income countries after 2008.

In a sample of developed countries, we found that pharmaceutical consumption, as measured by per capita drug expenditures, has a positive effect on life expectancy at advanced ages. The marginal effect of pharmaceutical consumption is consistent with estimates that have been reported previously but appears to decline with increasing age. Over the past few years, the substantial and disproportionate growth of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> for public and private payers in the U.

As the Target Project of Tuscany Region {{is aimed}} to {{identify}} significant changes occurring {{during the time}} of the project compared to the previous years, we have analyzed antifracture drugs consumption in the years immediately preceding the start-up of the program. Methods. We have analyzed the regional administrative database to search for antifracture drugs delivered by the regional healthcare system to people living in Tuscany in the year 2009. Both drugs directly distributed by hospitals or local health authorities (direct distribution dataset, FED), and those delivered through pharmacies (pharmaceutical distribution dataset, SPF) were included in the analysis. Private expenditures were indirectly computed because total <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> were also known. A specific subgroup analysis has been carried out on elderly patients with femoral fractures (years 2006 - 2010), which represent the population of Target Project, in order to assess the evolution of all antifracture drug prescriptions before the start up of the project. Results. A total of 690, 768 boxes of antifracture drugs (20 million defined daily doses, DDD) have been delivered in year 2009 for total expenditures of 23 million Euros.

40|$|In recent years, the Spanish {{government}} has been battling to keep pharma-ceutical expenditures under control. Its measures include control of prices, introduction of a “negative list ” of drugs no longer reimbursed, increased cost-sharing, and introduction of overall budgets for pharmaceutical expen-ditures. Although the average prices of old pharmaceutical products declined by 39 {{percent over the last}} 15 years and consumption in value increased by only 10 percent, real <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Spain increased by 264 percent over that period. The main reason for the continuing rise in these expenditures and the failure of cost-containment measures is the introduction of new, more expensive drugs, which often fail to offer any real therapeutic advantages over products already on the market. This situation is exacerbated by a lack of effective demand-side measures such as budgets for doctors and lack of a generics market. The Spanish pharmaceutical market is the seventh largest market {{in the world and the}} fifth largest in Europe in terms of consumption in value. It is an open market, with most leading foreign pharmaceutical companies having a strong presence. Medicines are the fastest growing component of National Health Service (NHS) expenditure. In response, the Spanish {{government has}} adopted several measures to keep <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> under control. These include a new system for fixing prices and the introduction of a Ministerial Decree for selective reimbursement of medicines. The Decree separates authorization and registration of products from reimbursement decisions (until the Decree took effect, all medicines were reimbursed). A “negative list ” of 892 pharmaceuticals (for “minor ailments”) that would no longer be reimbursed was introduced. In addition, the number of medicines for treatment of chronic conditions was increased, subject to a reduced patient contribution.

There are many similarities in the reference price policies but the markets to which they apply {{are more likely to be}} different. The European experience gives a `once-for-all' lowering effect on <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditure,</b> often at the expense of compromises on prescribing. In Germany and The Netherlands, reference pricing has been relatively ineffective in lowering expenditure which has led to a succession of other interventions to achieve expenditure control goals. The US also has reference pricing, but it occurs in a very competitive market which may be responsible (at least in part) for the relatively modest growth in expenditure compared with European countries.

Copayments were the most commonly used cost-containment measure, though their use and amount varied for those with certain conditions, most often chronic diseases (in 17 countries), and by socio-economic status (either income or employment status), or with age (in 15 countries). Caps and deductibles were only used by five systems. Drug cost-containment strategies targeting physicians were also identified in 24 countries, including guideline-based prescribing, prescription monitoring and incentive structures. CONCLUSIONS: There was variable use of cost-containment strategies to limit <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> in publicly funded formularies within OECD countries. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the best approach to constrain costs while maintaining access to pharmaceutical drugs...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To review {{pharmaceutical}} {{price regulation}} methods in {{countries of the}} European Union (EU), {{in terms of the}} an-ticipated impact of regulation on <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures</b> and evidence of actual outcomes. Methods. An extensive search was performed of medical and economic studies on regulatory interventions specifi-cally targeting pharmaceutical prices in EU countries, published between January 1990 and April 2002. Both peer-re-viewed and “gray ” literature were systematically reviewed. Results. Four principle approaches to pharmaceutical price regulation with some methodological differences were identified in EU countries, as follows: fixed pricing, cost-effectiveness pricing, profit controls, and reference pricing. Actual evidence of the impact of price regulation was limited in many of these countries. Cross-country comparisons suggested that limiting the rise of pharmaceutical prices did not equate to controlling the rise of pharmaceutical expen-ditures because of the volume effect of utilization. Conclusions. Supply-side regulation without the simultaneous use of demand-side incentives and volume controls does little to control the rise in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The types of needed demand-side controls depend on the context of the individual country, on political priorities, and on the type of supply-side regulation in place.
