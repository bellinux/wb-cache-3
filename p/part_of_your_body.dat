He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddhā (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it {{the source of his}} physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, [...] "Take up one idea.

5000|$|Master Shengyen {{explains}} {{the meaning of}} the term in this way: This “just sitting” in Chinese is zhiguan dazuo.

The business of minding yourself just sitting. At least, you should be clear that you're sitting. “Mind yourself just sitting” entails knowing that your body is sitting there. This does not mean minding a particular <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> or getting involved in a particular sensation. Instead, your whole body, your whole being is sitting there.|$|E
