5|$|Katyusha-like MRLs {{were also}} {{allegedly}} {{used by the}} Rwandan <b>Patriotic</b> Front during its 1990 invasion of Rwanda, through the 1994 genocide. They were effective in battle, but translated into much anti-Tutsi sentiment in the local media.|$|E
5|$|On Independence Day and Republic Day, <b>patriotic</b> {{songs in}} {{regional}} languages are broadcast {{on television and}} radio channels. They are also played alongside flag hoisting ceremonies. <b>Patriotic</b> films are broadcast. Over the decades, according to The Times of India, {{the number of such}} films broadcast has decreased as channels report that audiences are oversaturated with <b>patriotic</b> films. The population cohort that belong to the Generation Next often combine nationalism with popular culture during the celebrations. This mixture is exemplified by outfits and savouries dyed with the tricolour and designer garments that represent India's various cultural traditions. Retail stores offer Independence Day sales promotions. Some news reports have decried the commercialism. Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders, nationalistic themes and defence-related themes on 15 August.|$|E
5|$|Polish music, {{including}} orchestras, {{also went}} underground. Top Polish musicians and directors (Adam Didur, Zbigniew Drzewiecki, Jan Ekier, Barbara Kostrzewska, Zygmunt Latoszewski, Jerzy Lefeld, Witold Lutosławski, Andrzej Panufnik, Piotr Perkowski, Edmund Rudnicki, Eugenia Umińska, Jerzy Waldorff, Kazimierz Wiłkomirski, Maria Wiłkomirska, Bolesław Woytowicz, Mira Zimińska) performed in restaurants, cafes, and private homes, {{with the most}} daring singing <b>patriotic</b> ballads on the streets while evading German patrols. <b>Patriotic</b> songs were written, such as Siekiera, motyka, the most popular song of occupied Warsaw. <b>Patriotic</b> puppet shows were staged. Jewish musicians (e.g. Władysław Szpilman) and artists likewise performed in ghettos and even in concentration camps. Although many of them died, some survived abroad, like Alexandre Tansman in the United States, and Eddie Rosner and Henryk Wars in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The royalist army {{crossed the}} Desaguadero on June 20, 1811, {{starting}} the Battle of Huaqui. The army waited near Huaqui, between {{the plains of}} Azapanal and Lake Titicaca. The <b>patriotic</b> left wing, commanded by Diaz Velez, faced {{the bulk of the}} royalist forces, while the center was hit by the soldiers of Pio Tristan. Many <b>patriotic</b> soldiers recruited at Upper Peru surrendered or fled, and many of the recruits from La Paz switched sides during the battle. The Saavedrist Juan José Viamonte helped ensure Castelli's defeat by refusing to join the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a <b>patriotic</b> army {{defending}} its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used {{as an example of the}} advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.|$|E
5|$|By late 1957, due to {{the prior}} {{expulsion}} of foreign clergy and the subsequent imprisonment of Chinese clergy, 120 out of 145 dioceses and prefectures apostolic were without ordinaries. The Diocese of Qingdao went without an ordinary until the state-run Chinese <b>Patriotic</b> Catholic Association consecrated and appointed Bishop Paul Han Xirang, OFM without papal sanction in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} on a concert platform at London's Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, {{in a final}} <b>patriotic</b> gesture, he played {{for the benefit of}} Polish refugees. By this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 99 pounds (i.e. less than 45kg), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.|$|E

5|$|Due to the war, the SAFA {{suspended}} its {{competition from}} 1916 through to 1918. Despite this official suspension, {{a group of}} South Australian clubs decided to form their own league in 1916 and the money generated would be put toward the war effort. The Railways Football Club {{was one of the}} clubs that participated in this competition and managed to attract Harold Oliver to be the clubs captain. Unfortunately for the Railways, Oliver would only play one game for the Railways, and would instead return to Berri to focus on his farm. Later in the season, Oliver returned to Port Adelaide to play a few games for the club who was also partaking in the <b>Patriotic</b> League. Port Adelaide would end up winning the 1916 South Australian <b>Patriotic</b> League Grand Final defeating West Torrens 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19). Harold Oliver played for Port Adelaide during the game and kicked a goal.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the ACLU's {{primary focus}} was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor {{movement}} particularly. Because most of the ACLU's efforts {{were associated with the}} labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the American Legion, the National Civic Federation, and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied <b>Patriotic</b> Societies.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{graduates}} of state-run Shinto schools, such as Kokugakuin University and Kougakkan University, were implicitly allowed to become public school teachers. A {{greater number of}} better-trained priests with educations at state-supported schools, combined with a rising <b>patriotic</b> fervor, is believed by some to have seeded {{an environment in which}} grassroots Emperor worship was possible, even without financial support for local shrines.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, the Congolese army {{carried out}} a joint {{operation}} with UN troops in the Masisi and Walikale territories of the North Kivu province. In the process, they liberated over 20 villages and a mine from the control of two rebel groups, the Mai Mai Cheka and the Alliance for the Sovereign and <b>Patriotic</b> Congo.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016 Laurence Fox apologised for {{swearing}} at {{a member}} of the audience who had been muttering audibly in the front row during a performance of The <b>Patriotic</b> Traitor at London's Park Theatre on 8 March. The audience saw Fox step out of character - that of French statesman Charles de Gaulle - and chastise the heckler with robust language.|$|E
5|$|In September 1991, Bosnian Serbs proclaimed a Serbian Autonomous Oblast with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the Bosnian {{referendum}} on independence was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, although Bosnian Serbs either boycotted it or were prevented from voting by Bosnian Serb authorities. A poorly organized, local Bosniak <b>Patriotic</b> League paramilitary group {{had been established}} {{in response to the}} Bosnian Serb proclamation. On 31 March, the <b>Patriotic</b> League in Bijeljina was provoked into fighting by local Serbs and the SDG. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA took over Bijeljina with little resistance; murders, rapes, house searches, and pillaging followed. These actions were described as genocidal by the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York. Professor Michael Sells of the University of Chicago concluded that they were carried out to erase the cultural history of the Bosniak people of Bijeljina.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the Warner brothers' early {{opposition}} to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services. In addition, the studio produced <b>patriotic</b> musicals such as This is the Army and Yankee Doodle Dandy.|$|E
5|$|It is {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} to the majority of <b>patriotic</b> wartime films, especially among the plethora of those that take place primarily on a ship, which usually feature themes such a brotherhood, respect for higher-ranking officers, and able, hard working seamen.|$|E

5|$|May25 is a {{national}} day in Argentina, known as First <b>Patriotic</b> Government, with {{the character of a}} public holiday. The public holiday is set by law 21.329 and is always celebrated on May25, regardless of the day of the week. The Argentina Centennial and the Argentina Bicentennial were celebrated in 1910 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|On {{both the}} {{paternal}} and maternal sides, {{the family had}} lost their property and fortunes through <b>patriotic</b> involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the January Uprising of 1863–65). This condemned the subsequent generation, including Maria, her elder sisters and her brother, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life.|$|E
5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the <b>Patriotic</b> Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased the value of an alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist <b>Patriotic</b> Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|Postwar Communist {{governments in}} Eastern Europe {{severely}} restricted religious freedoms. Although some priests and religious collaborated with Communist regimes, many were imprisoned, deported or executed and the Church {{was an important}} player {{in the fall of}} Communism in Europe. In 1949, Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries. The new government also created the <b>Patriotic</b> Church whose unilaterally appointed bishops were initially rejected by Rome before many of them were accepted. In the 1960s, the Cultural Revolution saw the closure of all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained {{under the control of the}} <b>Patriotic</b> Church. Many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Rejtan's {{dramatic}} {{attempt to}} prevent the partition earned him lasting recognition in Poland, one that began even during the proceedings, as he was lauded by some other deputies. His action was also praised as <b>patriotic</b> and respectable by the Prussian and Russian military commanders in Warsaw, who offered him a military escort {{to protect him from}} some confederates (particularly Poniński was holding a grudge against him). Soon, brochures and newspaper articles spread the information about his <b>patriotic</b> gesture throughout Poland and abroad. During the Great Sejm of 1788–92, a decree was passed, commending Rejtan, and deputies discussed a project to put a plaque to his name in the Sejm Chambers. His gesture in the Sejm was less famously repeated by Jan Suchorzewski during that period.|$|E
5|$|Sunday also opposed eugenics, recent {{immigration}} from {{southern and eastern}} Europe, and the teaching of evolution. Further, he criticized such popular middle-class amusements as dancing, playing cards, attending the theater, and reading novels. However, he believed baseball was a healthy and even <b>patriotic</b> form of recreation, {{so long as it}} was not played on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Surviving D-1 howitzers {{can be seen}} {{in various}} {{military}} museums and war memorials, e. g. in the Museum of Artillery and Engineering Forces, Saint Petersburg, Russia; in the Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol on Sapun Mountain, Sevastopol; in the Museum of the Great <b>Patriotic</b> War, Kiev, Ukraine; in Poznań Citadel, Poland and in Polatsk, Belarus, as a memorial piece.|$|E
5|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. Largely composed of former Rwandan <b>Patriotic</b> Army (RPA) soldiers, it includes the Rwanda Land Force, Rwanda Air Force and specialised units. After the successful conquest {{of the country in}} 1994 {{in the aftermath of the}} Rwandan Genocide, the Rwandan <b>Patriotic</b> Front decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a military division which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of {{the national}} budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E
5|$|The Serbian <b>patriotic</b> song March on the Drina {{was written}} by Serbian {{composer}} Stanislav Binički shortly after the battle to commemorate the victory. Binički dedicated the march to his favourite commander in the army, Colonel Stojanović, who was killed during the fighting. A Yugoslav war film also titled March on the Drina was released in 1964 and is loosely based on the battle.|$|E
5|$|The report's main {{recommendations}} included deporting alien radicals and enacting peacetime sedition laws. Other recommendations included strict {{regulation of}} the manufacture, distribution, and possession of high explosives; control and regulation of foreign language publications, {{and the creation of}} <b>patriotic</b> propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Shostakovich {{concentrated}} on composition and soon limited his performances primarily {{to those of}} his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a <b>patriotic</b> piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, the pieces were not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm granted to the First.|$|E
5|$|They {{remained}} {{de facto}} senior officers, but the change {{caused them to}} accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. They joined an organisation called the Rwandan <b>Patriotic</b> Front (RPF), a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979. Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and, while still working for the Ugandan army, he and Kagame completed their invasion plans.|$|E
5|$|Under American protection, Iraqi Kurdistan {{had evolved}} into a {{successful}} semi-autonomous region. US pressure helped lead to a peace deal in 1999 between the major Iraqi Kurdish factions, the <b>Patriotic</b> Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq. While both parties officially swore off independence, the Turkish government remained sufficiently concerned, and continued to keep troops in northern Iraq.|$|E
