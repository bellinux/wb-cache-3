25|$|The {{position}} of the recording and reproducing heads, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted so that several recordings could be cut on the same wax-coated strip. Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is interesting as a predecessor to the later magnetic tape recorder, which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined {{at one of the}} Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> was missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning the machine could be put back into working order.|$|E
500|$|The Mellotron has {{a similar}} {{behaviour}} to a sampler, but generates its sound via audio tape. When a key is pressed, a tape connected to it is pushed against a <b>playback</b> <b>head,</b> like a tape recorder. While the key remains depressed, the tape is drawn over the head, and a sound is played. When the key is released, a spring pulls the tape back to its original position. A variety of sounds {{are available on the}} instrument. On earlier models, the instrument is split into [...] "lead" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] sections. There is a choice of six [...] "stations" [...] of rhythm sounds, each containing three rhythm tracks and three fill tracks. The fill tracks can also be mixed together. Similarly, there is a choice of six lead stations, each containing three lead instruments which can be mixed. In the centre of the Mellotron, there is a tuning button that allows a variation in both pitch and tempo. Later models do not have the concept of stations and have a single knob to select a sound, along with the tuning control. However, the frame containing the tapes is designed to be removed, and replaced with one with different sounds.|$|E
2500|$|Les Paul invented Sound on Sound {{recording}} {{using this}} machine by placing an additional <b>playback</b> <b>head,</b> located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads. This allowed Paul {{to play along}} with a previously recorded track, {{both of which were}} mixed together on to a new track. This was a mono tape recorder with just one track across the entire width of quarter-inch tape; thus, the recording was [...] "destructive" [...] {{in the sense that the}} original recording was permanently replaced with the new, mixed recording. [...] He eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track. [...] This preserved the original recording.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, the <b>playback</b> <b>heads</b> of tape echo {{machines}} are also connected to controls {{that allow the}} user to determine the volume of each echo relative to the original signal. Another control (sometimes called [...] "regeneration") allows the signal from the <b>playback</b> <b>heads</b> to be fed back into and variably mixed with the original input signal, creating a distinctive [...] "feedback" [...] effect that adds more and more noise to the loop with each repeat. If fully activated, this control ultimately produces a continuous feedback loop of pure noise. Roland manufactured various models of magnetic tape echo and reverb sound effect machines from 1973 until the introduction of digital sound effect machines.|$|R
2500|$|Tape echoes became commercially {{available}} in the 1950s. An echo machine is the early name for a sound processing device used with electronic instruments to repeat the sound and produce a simulated echo. The device was popular with guitarists and was used by Brian May, Jimmy Page and Syd Barrett among others. One example is the Echoplex which used a tape loop. [...] The length of delay was adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} tape record and <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b> [...] Another example is the Roland Space Echo with a record and multiple <b>playback</b> tape <b>heads</b> and a variable tape speed. [...] The time between echo repeats was adjusted by varying the tape speed. [...] The length or intensity of the echo effect was adjusted by changing the amount of echo signal was fed back into the pre-echo signal. [...] Different effects could be created by combining the different <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b> [...] Some models also included a spring reverb.|$|R

2500|$|According to Cowboy Jack Clement, {{who took}} over {{production}} duties from Sam Phillips, [...] "There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound comes along and it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, {{it goes to the}} <b>playback</b> <b>head.</b> But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, you can have a separate machine and do that. if you do it on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
2500|$|Slapback echo uses {{a longer}} delay time (75 to 250 milliseconds), {{with little or}} no feedback. The effect is {{characteristic}} of vocals on 1950s rock-n-roll records, particularly those produced by Sam Phillips and issued by his Sun Records label. In July 1954, Phillips produced the first of five 78s and 45s that Elvis Presley would release on Sun over the next two years, all of which featured a novel production technique that Phillips termed [...] "slapback echo". Phillips noted that no live sound was heard without echo, and hence added the effect to add realism and resultant depth to the played sound. The effect was produced by re-feeding the output signal from the <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> tape recorder to its record head. The physical space between heads, the speed of the tape, and the chosen volume being the main controlling factors. Analog and later digital delay machines also easily produced the effect. It is also sometimes used on instruments, particularly drums and percussion.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, John Cage {{completed}} his noise composition Cartridge Music for phono cartridges with foreign objects replacing the 'stylus' and small sounds amplified by contact microphones. Also in 1960, Nam June Paik composed Fluxusobjekt for fixed tape and hand-controlled tape <b>playback</b> <b>head.</b> On May 8, 1960, six young Japanese musicians, including Takehisa Kosugi and Yasunao Tone, formed the Group Ongaku with two tape recordings of noise music: Automatism and Object. These recordings {{made use of}} a mixture of traditional musical instruments along with a vacuum cleaner, a radio, an oil drum, a doll, {{and a set of}} dishes. Moreover, the speed of the tape recording was manipulated, further distorting the sounds being recorded. Canada's Nihilist Spasm Band, the world's longest-running noise act, was formed in 1965 in London, Ontario and continues to perform and record to this day, having survived to work with many of the newer generation which they themselves had influenced, such as Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Jojo Hiroshige of Hijokaidan. In 1967, Musica Elettronica Viva, a live acoustic/electronic improvisational group formed in Rome, made a recording titled SpaceCraft using contact microphones on such [...] "non-musical" [...] objects as panes of glass and motor oil cans that was recorded at the Akademie der Kunste in Berlin. At the end of the sixties, they took part in the collective noise action called Lo Zoo initiated by the artist Michelangelo Pistoletto.|$|E
50|$|The Betacam SX {{system was}} very {{successful}} with newsgathering operations, which had a legacy of Betacam and Betacam SP tapes. Some Betacam SX decks, such as the DNW-A75 or DNW-A50, can natively play and work from the analog tapes interchangeably, because they contain both analog and digital <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mistaking Chamberlin sounds {{for real}} {{instruments}} is common with all Chamberlin sounds {{because of the}} way they were recorded (no processing) and because there were fewer mixdown master tapes made compared to the Mellotron library. The M series Chamberlins also have greater bandwidth <b>playback</b> <b>heads,</b> which enhances this quality further.|$|R
50|$|In the US, stereo {{magnetic}} tape recording was demonstrated on standard 1/4-inch tape {{for the first}} time in 1952, using two sets of recording and <b>playback</b> <b>heads,</b> upside-down and offset from one another. A year later, Remington Records began recording a number of its sessions in stereo, including performances by Thor Johnson and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{recording}} head, the <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> {{has a single}} core. The <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> gap covers both of the tracks created by the record head. The magnetic field changes across {{the width of the}} gap are effectively added in the <b>playback</b> <b>head,</b> so the <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> reproduces the audio signal, which is the same in both tracks. But the pilot tone cancels itself in the playback head: at a point on the tape where it has a certain intensity on the upper track, it has the opposite intensity on the lower track, and so always sums to zero.|$|E
50|$|In a {{video tape}} recorder, {{tracking}} is a calibration adjustment which {{ensures that the}} spinning <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> is properly aligned with the helical scan signal written onto the tape.|$|E
50|$|Instead, Townsend {{came up with}} {{a system}} using tape delay, after similar {{principles}} already in place for echoes applied via tape during a song mixdown. In essence, Townsend's system added a second tape recorder to the regular setup. When mixing a song, its vocal track was routed from the recording head of the multitrack tape, which was before the <b>playback</b> <b>head,</b> and fed to the record head of the second tape recorder. An oscillator was used to vary the speed of the second machine, providing more or less delay depending on how fast or slow the second machine was run relative to the first. This signal was then routed from the <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> of the second machine to a separate fader on the mixer. This allowed the delayed vocal to be combined with the normal vocal, creating the double tracked effect.|$|E
5000|$|The mellotron is an electro-mechanical, {{polyphonic}} tape replay keyboard {{that used}} {{a bank of}} parallel linear magnetic audio tape strips. <b>Playback</b> <b>heads</b> underneath each key enable the playing of pre-recorded sounds. Each of the tape strips has a playing time of approximately eight seconds, after which the tape comes to a dead stop and rewinds to the start position.|$|R
5000|$|... fulltrack (1-track Mono) recorders. These ran at {{a single}} 15 ips speed and {{provided}} a sync head for motion picture sound synchronization as well as dedicated record and <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b> These models were not widely adopted. Even German and European television tended despite outfitting their radio reports with 4000-series machines to adopt Nagra or Stellavox recorders for film production.|$|R
5000|$|This {{machine was}} {{conceived}} to build complex forms through repetition, and accumulation of events through delays, filtering and feedback. It {{consisted of a}} large rotating disk, 50 cm in diameter, on which was stuck a tape with its magnetic side facing outward. A series of twelve movable magnetic heads (one each recording head and erasing <b>head,</b> and ten <b>playback</b> <b>heads)</b> were positioned around the disk, {{in contact with the}} tape. A sound up to four seconds long could be recorded on the looped tape and the ten <b>playback</b> <b>heads</b> would then read the information with different delays, according to their (adjustable) positions around the disk. A separate amplifier and band-pass filter for each head could modify the spectrum of the sound, and additional feedback loops could transmit the information to the recording head. The resulting repetitions of a sound occurred at different time intervals, and could be filtered or modified through feedback. This system was also easily capable of producing artificial reverberation or continuous sounds [...]|$|R
50|$|A {{recording}} head is the physical interface between a recording apparatus and a moving recording medium. Recording heads are generally classified {{according to the}} physical principle {{that allows them to}} impress their data upon their medium. A {{recording head}} is often mechanically paired with a <b>playback</b> <b>head,</b> which, though proximal to, is often discrete from the record head.|$|E
50|$|Multi-track {{recording}} {{differs from}} overdubbing and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks. Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording {{by placing a}} second <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> {{in front of the}} erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.|$|E
5000|$|If, {{instead of}} simply playing back a {{recorded}} loop, something is done to progressively alter the recorded material between cycles, such as re-recording the sound as it passes the <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> or adding new material to the loop, then a process of change will occur in the content, quality, complexity, or perception—or some combination of them [...]|$|E
5000|$|Stationary DCC {{recorders}} (i.e. recorders {{meant for}} use in home stereo systems) such as the DCC-900 use a head assembly that has 9 (MR) <b>playback</b> <b>heads</b> and 9 (coil) recording heads for DCC, and two (MR) heads for playing analog compact cassettes. This type of head assembly {{was designed to be}} rotated by the mechanism when the recorder/player switched from side A to side B.|$|R
50|$|Ampex's {{quadruplex}} {{magnetic tape}} video recording system has certain limitations, {{such as the}} lack of clean pause, or still-frame, capability, because the picture signal was segmented, or broken down into discrete segments to be recorded on the tape individually (only 16 lines of the picture in each segment). Thus, when tape motion is stopped, only a single segment of the picture recording is present at the <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b> The helical scan system overcame this limitation.|$|R
5000|$|The first widely {{accepted}} video tape in the United States was 2 inch quadruplex videotape and traveled at 15 inches per second. To gain enough head-to-tape speed, four video recording and <b>playback</b> <b>heads</b> were spun on a head wheel across {{most of the}} two-inch width of the tape. (Audio and synchronization tracks were recorded {{along the sides of}} the tape with stationary heads.) This system was known as [...] "quad" [...] (for [...] "quadruplex") recording.|$|R
50|$|Blank {{cassettes}} {{from the}} 70's-90's are unaffected because the hygroscopic binder {{was not used}} in cassette formulations. However, some cassette tape formulations do suffer from a similar problem caused by fatty acids working {{to the surface of}} the tape that can cause sticking to heads and guides and severe modulation of signals through the <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> until it is cleaned.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{playback}} heads determines {{the number of}} repeats, and the physical distance between each <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> determines the ratio of delay between each repeat of the sound (usually some fraction of a second). The actual length of the delay between each repeat can be varied by a pitch control that alters {{the speed of the}} tape loop across the heads.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radio station}} WKAP in Allentown, Pennsylvania, {{introduced}} a tape delay system consisting of an external <b>playback</b> <b>head,</b> which was spaced {{far enough away}} from the record head to allow for a six-second delay. A system of rollers guided the tape over the <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> before it wound up on the take up reel. This system was introduced in 1952 when WKAP started a talk show called Open Mic. It is believed that {{this was the first time}} a telephone call-in show was broadcast with the telephone conversation [...] "live" [...] on the air. The FCC rules at the time prohibited the broadcasting of a live phone conversation. However, there was no rule prohibiting a taped playback of a phone call, provided that a [...] "beep" [...] tone was heard by the caller every 15 seconds so that the caller knew he was being recorded. The six-second delay constituted a [...] "taped" [...] phone conversation, thus complying with FCC regulations, that being a legal fiction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system had}} two {{recording}} modes: standard mode (STD), and a long-play mode (LP) which sacrificed recording quality for extra capacity. In STD mode both recording and <b>playback</b> <b>heads</b> are used, writing both fields of each interlaced video frame. In long-play mode {{only a single}} head is used to record a single field from each video frame, with each field being read twice on playback, in a [...] "skip field" [...] technique. The heads scanned the tape in a helical scan fashion ...|$|R
50|$|In 1962 Bill Franson {{had gone}} missing for several months. A radio {{could be heard}} playing music in his {{apartment}} but attempts to contact him proved futile. Franson had left for England by boat taking two Chamberlin 600 models with him (one of these eventually became the possession of Todd Rundgren's studio and appears on XTC's Skylarking album in 1986). Franson placed an ad asking {{for a company that}} could manufacture seventy standard <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b> Bradmatic Ltd. (an engineering company) responded to the ad.|$|R
50|$|When Ampex {{developed}} the quadruplex magnetic tape video recording system in 1956, it had certain limitations, {{perhaps the most}} important of which was the lack of pause or still frame capability, because the picture signal was segmented, or broken down into discrete segments to be recorded on the tape individually (only 16 lines of the picture in each segment). Thus, when tape motion was stopped, only a single segment of the picture recording was present at the <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b> The helical-scan system overcame this limitation.|$|R
50|$|The {{heads are}} kept from {{contacting}} the platter surface {{by the air}} that is extremely close to the platter; that air moves {{at or near the}} platter speed. The record and <b>playback</b> <b>head</b> are mounted on a block called a slider, and the surface next to the platter is shaped to keep it just barely out of contact. This forms a type of air bearing.|$|E
50|$|Nakamichi was {{the first}} to use a three-head {{recording}} technique in a cassette deck. Separate tape heads were used for playback, recording, and erase. Previously the playback and recording functions were combined in a single tape head. The three-head mechanism allowed higher quality reproduction as well as the ability to hear a recording in progress - as the tape traveled past the recording head onto the <b>playback</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} prototype {{was built}} from a heavily modified Sony Pressman, a lightweight, compact tape recorder designed for journalists. By replacing the recording {{head with a}} <b>playback</b> <b>head,</b> and the speaker with an amplifier, Sony engineers were able to combine the portability of the Pressman with the stereo experience of the TC-D5. By using lower-end components to reduce the price, and enclosing the parts in an attractive casing, they had solved Ibuka's challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{invention}} of audio delay technology, music employing a delayed echo had to be recorded in a naturally reverberant space, often an inconvenience for musicians and engineers. The popularity of an easy-to-implement real-time echo effect led {{to the production of}} systems offering an all-in-one effects unit that could be adjusted to produce echoes of any interval or amplitude. The presence of multiple [...] "taps" [...] (<b>playback</b> <b>heads)</b> made it possible to have delays at varying rhythmic intervals; this allowed musicians an additional means of expression over natural periodic echoes.|$|R
50|$|Soundstream-modified Honeywell 5600e Instrumentation Tape Drives (HTD) used custom {{high-frequency}} 18-track {{record and}} <b>playback</b> <b>heads.</b> The two outer tracks were reserved for ancillary data - SMPTE time code and the like. The remaining sixteen tracks {{were used to}} record up to eight channels of digital audio - two redundant tracks for each audio channel. The two tracks in a redundant track pair were separated as widely as possible to minimize playback errors due to tape defects (dropouts) - audio channel one was recorded on tracks 1 and 9.|$|R
50|$|Tape echo units use {{an endless}} loop of {{magnetic}} tape, which is drawn across {{a series of}} recording and playback heads.When a signal from a voice or instrument is fed into the machine, it records the signal onto the tape loop as it passed over the record head. As the tape advances, the newly recorded signal is then {{picked up by a}} series of <b>playback</b> <b>heads</b> mounted in line with the record head. These play the sound back as the signal passes over each head in turn, creating the classic rippling or cascading echoes that are typical of tape echo units.|$|R
