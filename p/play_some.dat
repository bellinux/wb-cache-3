5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of foul <b>play,</b> <b>some</b> have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E
5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may <b>play</b> <b>some</b> role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E

He posted a video of his preparation for the 2014 NBA Summer League.|$|E
5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less {{likely it is that}} any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults <b>play</b> <b>some</b> role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|After Kieswetter's {{retirement}} from cricket, his father {{suggested that he}} {{take a break and}} <b>play</b> <b>some</b> golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with David Leadbetter, who suggested that he try to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he took part in a couple of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour qualifying school in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the 2017 season. He played regularly on the Tour during 2017 and in September won his biggest prize of the season, winning US$360 in the Dubai Creek Open after finishing tied for 38th place.|$|E

5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s bag was actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake out where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to <b>play</b> <b>some</b> of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E
5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to <b>play</b> <b>some</b> midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E
5|$|The American Samoa {{team were}} troubled by {{passport}} issues, {{with only one}} member of their original 20-man senior team, goalkeeper Nicky Salapu, eligible to <b>play.</b> <b>Some</b> hint that the passport issue was an Australian ploy to win the match by a large margin {{in order to secure}} the team's move to the AFC. American Samoa were also unable to call their under-20 players because most of them were involved in high school exams at the time. They were forced to draft in their youth players, including three 15-year-old players, to put together a makeshift team with an average age of 18. According to team manager and Football Federation American Samoa vice-president Tony Langkilde, some of the Samoan players had never played a full 90-minute game before the match with Australia.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to <b>play</b> <b>some</b> role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness {{towards the end of the}} <b>play</b> <b>some</b> critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E
5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to <b>play</b> <b>some</b> part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E
