40|$|In the United State today, {{many people}} {{do not have access to}} {{adequate}} dental treatment, while tooth decay is the single most common chronic childhood disease-five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than hay fever. At the same time, studies show that 80 % of dental illness takes place in 25 % of the population, which is comprised mostly of lower socioeconomic groups. A study undertaken by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2000, concludes that poor children suffer five times as much tooth decay as their more affluent peers. Furthermore, in poor children with tooth decay, almost 80 % remain untreated. Poor dental health there-fore is a major health concern for under privileged families. The goal of this project is to enhance and facilitate the delivery of better dental treatment by designing a new prototype for a <b>portable</b> dental <b>office</b> that will be more flexible and more usable in a variety of situations and locations. For the purpose of this study, this prototype will be considered or tested within the context of three different types of spaces: the single closed room; a large open public space; and within mobile and nonpermanent structures such as tents. Several aspects of working conditions specific to the dental office will be taken into account when developing this design including transportability, degree of flexibility, storability, hygiene, and the creation of a relaxing atmosphere all of which greatly impact both the dentists and patients experience and are essential to the creation of a successful <b>portable</b> dental <b>office...</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{became very}} popular when Chelsea Football Club came into {{existence}} in 1905 and began playing at the Stamford Bridge Athletic Ground, and <b>portable</b> booking <b>offices</b> had {{to be used to}} cope with the demand on match days, when special football trains were chartered to bring fans to the ground. In 1930 the platforms were lengthened to cope with this extra demand. According to the sports history writer Tim Harris, the station was the inspiration for naming the football club; the entrepreneur and founder of the club, Gus Mears, had considered Stamford Bridge FC, Kensington FC, and London FC, but chose Chelsea FC because of its proximity to Chelsea & Fulham station and in spite of the stadium not actually being located in Chelsea proper.|$|R

40|$|Screened {{electronic}} devices are quite effective at capturing children 2 Ì† 7 s and parents 2 Ì† 7 attention. Now {{an integral part}} of the daily lives of Americans, screened {{electronic devices}} such as computers, entertainment centers, gaming devices, laptops, smartphones, and tablets serve as <b>portable</b> <b>offices,</b> entertainment centers, and a means to stay connected with others. Research focusing on television viewing, the older and more traditional type of screen time, has suggested that television is positively correlated with aggression, attention problems, obesity, and poor academic performance. It is suspected that screen time, which includes all screened devices, may have potentially significant child developmental, educational, parent-child relational, and social consequences. The exposure to electronic devices has increased exponentially in the past decade, suggesting some urgency to investigate, measure, and understand this phenomenon and its potential impact, particularly on children. ^ This study examines both children 2 Ì† 7 s and parents 2 Ì† 7 time with screened electronic devices and to what extent screen time may be correlated with children 2 Ì† 7 s behavior. The parent development theory (PDT; Mowder, 2005) was used as the overarching theoretical model for defining parents and parenting. The sample consisted of 96 parents and caregivers who provided information on one 2 Ì† 2 target 2 Ì† 2 child under their care. Participants responded to two questionnaires, the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC- 2) and the screen time questionnaire (STQ). ^ Major findings of this study were: With regard to a parent engaging in screen time that distracts their attention away from their child, or parent distracting screen time, (1) a positive relationship with children 2 Ì† 7 s aggressive behavior was found, and (2) the relationship between parents 2 Ì† 7 distracting screen time and children 2 Ì† 7 s degree of somatization behaviors were determined to be moderated by parents 2 Ì† 7 educational level. With reference to children 2 Ì† 7 s screen time: (1) A significant interaction was found between children 2 Ì† 7 s general use of screen time and parent employment, (2) children 2 Ì† 7 s gender was found to moderate the relationship between children 2 Ì† 7 s screen time use for entertainment and withdrawal behaviors, with contrasting relationships for male and female children, and (3) parents 2 Ì† 7 employment status was found to moderate the relationship between children 2 Ì† 7 s screen time for entertainment purposes and adaptive skills, particularly in the areas of activities of daily living and functional communication. Thus, the findings of this study highlight the need to take into account the particular context of screen time use (e. g., for entertainment purposes, distracting screen time), by both parents and children, when considering the relationship with children 2 Ì† 7 s behavior. As screened electronic devices become increasingly embedded in the parent-child dyad, further investigation is warranted to fully understand the positive and negative influences screen time may have on children 2 Ì† 7 s behavior. ...|$|R
50|$|Arondizuogu Patriotic Union (APU) is the {{umbrella}} organisation of all Arondizuogu communities in Nigeria and the Diaspora. Established in 1932 in Aba, APU {{is one of}} the earliest and most enduring organs of community development set up by an Igbo clan in colonial Nigeria. The youngmen of Arondizuogu who laid the foundation for APU left their homes {{for the first time in}} the 1920s and early 1930s to seek a better life in the emerging urban centres of colonial Nigeria. They found themselves in social, economic and political environments different from the life they knew at home. Refusing to be intimated or alienated, they held on to that deep feeling of love for the community with which they grew up. They assembled at Aba on October 8, 1932 to aggregate ideas on how best to convey the concomitants of modern development with which they were surrounded in the city (such as wide roads, schools, hospitals, post <b>offices,</b> <b>portable</b> water, electricity, court rooms, etc.) to their village community.|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} {{radio interface}} architecture for short-range high-speed wireless networking All recent wireless technology developments, although pulled by different market requirements and applications (e. g., WLANs for <b>portable</b> connectivity in <b>office</b> IT enterprises, WPANs for cable replacement and personal sphere interconnectivity, etc.), have {{been characterized by}} a common quest for higher capacity density and link speed, on the one hand, as well as greater reliability and scalability {{in the presence of}} varying channel conditions and/or traffic loading and QoS system requirements, on the other. Guided by strong evidence on these common persistent trends, the WIND-FLEX European-wide consortium was launched in 2000, aiming at fulfilling the above requirements. Due to the combined adoption of a high frequency (17 GHz) for the radio carrier, of flexible radio interface schemes, plus maximization of modem functions/controls allocation in the digital domain, the specified WIND-FLEX radio interface provides dynamically adaptive reliable and efficient communications at a very high link speed, namely, up to 4 bundle-able channels, each one providing a maximum speed of 215 Mbit/s gross data rate in the air, which translates to slightly more than 100 Mbit/s payload at IP layer, thus representing a very attractive and innovative solution for nextgeneration wireless LAN/PAN developments.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [97]- 99) Speech can {{be modeled}} as short bursts of vocal energy separated by silence gaps. During a typical conversation, talk-spurts comprise only 35 % of each party's speech while the remaining 65 % are silence. Wireless communication systems can achieve significant gains in spectral and energy efficiency by disconnecting the user from the spectral resource during the silence periods. Therefore, {{a simple and}} robust voice activity detector is critical for a wireless system's efficiency and speech quality. This thesis presents a new voice activity detection algorithm based on fuzzy logic. The fuzzy soft decisions are made based on four parameter values: energy level, spectral distribution, periodicity, and stationarity. The input signal to the proposed fuzzy voice activity detection algorithm is subdivided into 15 -msec frames. Each frame is processed and measured for relative energy content, percentage of signal energy below 1000 Hz, and the periodicity. Stationarity between adjacent frames is also measured as a continuous variable using the spectral covariance method. All four parameter values are extracted from every speech frame based on conventional speech processing techniques, and then act as fuzzy input variables. The fuzzy rule base, on which the fuzzy inference phase is based, consists of 16 empirically designed fuzzy rules. The thesis concludes with both objective and subjective test results illustrating {{the performance of the}} proposed fuzzy voice activity detection algorithm in <b>office,</b> <b>portable</b> and mobile environments. Both objective and subjective tests show that the proposed voiced activity detection algorithm is practical for mobile and portable wireless systems. The fuzzy algorithm's simplicity also augurs its attractiveness for real-time implementation using a portion of a single DSP chipset. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

Importance and mission of remuneration systems at company management leading to increase in value for owners, respectively for stakeholders is investigated here. The dissertation thesis deals with the factors influencing both, employees, their performance and motivation for companyÂ´s aims achievement, and companiesÂ´ systems of remuneration. The subject of dissertation thesis is actually concurrent because employeesÂ´ performance increasing in a form of stimulation bonuses, an effort for possessing employees in the company, and dividing companyÂ´s profit for employees {{at the same time}} are very demanding managerial tasks in every stage of companyÂ´s development. At the dissertation thesis elaboration, the author has stemmed from theoretical backgrounds of scientific publications of Czech authors as well as of foreign authors, and also from realized investigations. Primary research has been realized by a combination of single techniques of quantitative research, i. e. by the means of questionnaires, personal interviews and telephonic interviews. Results of the primary research obtained have been analysed using the applications of Microsoft Excel, <b>Portable</b> Open <b>Office</b> Calc and XLStatistics software. Results obtained at elaboration of the dissertation thesis have been used with the aim to determinations of the most important factors influencing employeesÂ´ motivation for performance increasing and interestedness on companyÂ´s goals achievement. Moreover, the results obtained by primary research outcomes analysis have made possible the statistic verification of the hypotheses of dissertation. The partial outcome of dissertation thesis is the definition of premises of value oriented systems of remuneration use in small and medium-sized entities. Based on this definition of these systems implementation premises, the methodical order of implementation of value oriented system of remuneration into companyÂ´s practice. For elaboration of the value oriented system of remuneration proposal, first of all, it has been necessary to create the system of EVA quantification in a company, i. e. to divide companyÂ´s assets into responsibility centres, to calculate EVA of every single responsibility centre, and to propose a concept of employeesÂ´ interest on change of the EVA indicator value. The proposed methodology has been proved in condition of concrete company, and in the dissertation thesis, it is presented as a case study. This way, one can get complete information about characteristics of the presented model, in concrete about necessary adjustments of costs and revenues, about determination of the amount of invested capital and its valuation, and about division of created value for employees and owners as well. Elaborated case study provides a feedback on a possibility and demandingness of implementation of value based systems of remuneration in small and medium-sized entities. The conclusion of dissertation thesis is devoted to the summary of knowledge obtained, to the discussion of premises for the proposed methodology implementation into business practice, and to the discussion about possibilities of next scientific work in elaborated area...|$|R
