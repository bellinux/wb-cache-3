At the same time, the 1.6 L 8-valve unit was replaced with the 16-valve unit from the Polo GTI, but detuned to 77 kW (105 PS). The 2.0 L gasoline engine was the base engine in the sportier GTI only as a 1999.5 model. For 2000, Volkswagen opted for the relatively new 1.8 L turbocharged gasoline engine as a base engine for the GTI.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} the results of {{experimental}} investigations on the performance of a jet pump operated under selected primary flows to optimize the related parameters. For this purpose a two-phase flow jet pump was used employing various profiles of nozzles as the primary device which was designed, fabricated and used along with the combination of mixing tube and diffuser. The profiles employed were circular, conical, and elliptical. The diameter of the nozzle used was 4 mm. The area ratio of the jet pump was 0. 16. The test facility created for this purpose was an open loop continuous circulation system. Performance of the jet pump was obtained as iso-efficiency curves on characteristic curves drawn for various water flow rates. To perform the suction capability, evacuation test was conducted at best efficiency point for all the profiles.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of numerical simulation and experimental study of fluid flow in the jet pump, and, in particular, near the nozzle. It considers the influence of possible manufacturing errors of the pump on its characteristics, such as head and efficiency. Numerical simulation is based on the calculation method of control volume discrete analogs of the Reynolds averaged Navies-Stokes and continuity equations of a continuous medium (method RANS). The closure of the system of equations is performed by k-ω SST turbulence model. The number of cells of the computational grid is about 2 million. The boundary conditions are a fluid velocity at both pump inlets and a pressure at the outlet. In this case the calculated value is the pressure at both inlets. An experimental study is conducted on a hydraulic test bench. The data obtained by experiment are used to discharge characteristic of the pump and its efficiency. Given comparison of design and experimental characteristics shows a significant difference resulting from the manufacturing inaccuracies of the inner shape of the <b>pump</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The paper reports results of modeling a flow in the pump with a shape of the nozzle corresponding to that of really manufactured and several models more with intermediate forms of the nozzle. The simulation results obtain good agreement between the calculation of the corresponding real prototype model with experimental data, and it is shown that a small taper of the inner shape of the nozzle significantly affect the pump head, namely it increases with insignificant change of pressure at the pump inlet, which gives an indication of increasing pump efficiency. This work complements the existing studies of the effect of various factors on the operation of jet devices, such as the scale factor, the change in the axial position of the nozzle and the surface roughness. From {{the results of the study}} several conclusions can be drawn. In contrast to the accepted recommendations of designing the jet <b>pump</b> <b>nozzle</b> should be made slightly conical (no straight section) to improve the efficiency of the pump. In preparing design documentation and conducting control, one should focus on the tolerances of the nozzle shape. </p...|$|E

The models focused on removal of the sludge heel located at the east side of Tank 8 using the four existing slurry pumps. The models and calculations were based on prototypic tank geometry and expected normal operating conditions as defined by Waste Removal Closure (WRC) Engineering. The calculated results demonstrated that for pump speeds higher than 1800 rpm and at a 130 inch liquid level, a recommended orientation of the slurry pumps could be provided, based on a minimum sludge suspension velocity of 2. 27 ft per sec. Further results showed that the time to reach a steady-state flow pattern was affected by both the tank level and the pump speed.
