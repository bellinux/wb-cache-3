40|$|Abstract. A novel {{approach}} is proposed for measuring fabric texture orientations and recognizing weave patterns. Wavelet transform is suited for fabric image decomposition and Radon Transform is fit for line detection in fabric texture. Since different weave patterns {{have their own}} regular orientations in original image and sub-band images decomposed by Wavelet transform, these orientations features are extracted and used as SOM and LVQ inputs to achieve automatic recognition of fabric weave. The experimental {{results show that the}} neural network of LVQ is more effective than SOM. The contribution {{of this study is that}} it not only can identify fundamental fabric weaves but also can classify double layer and some derivative twill weaves such as angular twill and <b>pointed</b> <b>twill...</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{described}} in previous articles [1 - 5], code drafting traditionally {{is done in}} overshot. Other methods are not mentioned and {{the implication is that}} code drafting can only be done in overshot. The mechanism of code drafting simply translates a string of characters into a sequence of shaft numbers — the code sequence corresponding to the string. Any commemorative significance of the string is captured in the code sequence. This sequence {{can be used as a}} threading and treadling sequence in a variety of ways while still capturing the message of the string. While overshot tends to produce attractive patterns, there are other methods that do also. One is <b>point</b> <b>twill.</b> The key idea of code drafting for <b>point</b> <b>twill</b> is to interpret the code sequence as values connecting straight-draw segments of a threading sequence. For example, the code sequence 1, 6, 2, 5 becomes the threading sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5 where the code-sequence values are underlined. A grid plot illustrates the point-twill threading: If the code sequence has successive values in increasing or decreasing order, they are “absorbed ” in the point-twill threading; it is successive high and low values (inflection points) that count. For example, the code sequence 1, 3, 6, 5, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5 produces the same point-twill sequence as the previous example...|$|R
40|$|The {{first article}} in this series {{introduced}} crackle weave design {{in terms of the}} conventional block method and an alternate, unconventional method of placing a motif along a path [1]. Before going on to more interesting topics, there are some nuts-and-bolt issues to cover. Tie-Ups Crackle is a twill weave, a variety of <b>point</b> <b>twill.</b> As such, twill tie-ups normally are used. In order to keep the maximum float length to 3, expected of conventional crackle weaves, twill counters must be less than 3. The following tie-ups work well for crackle: 4 shafts: 5 shafts: 6 shafts...|$|R
