50|$|Each link {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} metal curved into two partial cylinders, into which adjacent rounds slide. Like the M13 link, the M27 link is a <b>push-through</b> design. Rounds are extracted by pushing forward out of the link. With the round freed, the link disintegrates (detaches from the belt) and is ejected. This is in contrast with older belt systems which were typically made of fabric and were fed straight through the weapon without disintegrating.|$|E
50|$|Medical blister trays {{differ from}} {{pharmaceutical}} blister packs in {{that these are}} not <b>push-through</b> packs.

The lidding film provides a peel-open feature and is generally porous to allow sterilization (such as the Dupont medical Tyvek material). Such medical blister packs are used for sterile medical devices, used in hospitals.|$|E
5000|$|Design of an LSAT battle rifle {{began in}} 2008. [...] Half way into 2008, the designs are nearing completion. The rifle designs {{are made to}} use the same {{cartridge}} as developed for the LMG, and this means separate rifles are being designed for the cased and caseless cartridges. Design began with seventeen concepts; after the concepts were investigated and trade-offs were analysed, only two remained for the cased round, and two for the caseless round. [...] The concepts involve two magazine approaches, both of which are focussed on high capacity: one uses the standard approach of placing inside the magazine springs that feed rounds into the weapon; the other uses a 'weapon powered' approach, presumably to reduce the extra weight and space that springs create in magazines. [...] If any of the rifle designs use the same swinging chamber mechanism as the LMG, they should be well suited to a bullpup layout, since the forward ejection of the <b>push-through</b> feed-and-ejection mechanism could easily be extended to achieve full ambidexterity, which is a problematic absence in most bullpups. Even in other configurations, the <b>push-through</b> mechanism lends itself very well to ambidexterity: the G11 demonstrates this. The rifle designs are undergoing the same simulated, structural, and kinematic analyses as the LMG. On 14 May 2014, Textron Systems was awarded a two-year $5.7 million contract for work that included development of a carbine firing cased-telescoped ammunition.|$|E

50|$|Blister packs are {{commonly}} used as unit-dose packaging for pharmaceutical tablets, capsules or lozenges. Blister packs can provide barrier protection for shelf life requirements, and a degree of tamper resistance. In the US, blister packs are mainly used for packing physician samples of drug products or for over-the-counter (OTC) products in the pharmacy. In {{other parts of the}} world, blister packs are the main packaging type since pharmacy dispensing and re-packaging are not common. A series of blister cavities is sometimes called a blister card or blister strip as well as blister pack. The difference between a strip pack and blister pack is that a strip pack does not have thermo-formed or cold formed cavities; the strip pack is formed around the tablet {{at a time when it}} is dropped to the sealing area between sealing moulds. In some parts of the world the pharmaceutical blister pack is known as a <b>push-through</b> pack (PTP), an accurate description of two key properties (i) the lidding foil is brittle, making it possible to press the product out while breaking the lidding foil and (ii) a semi-rigid formed cavity being sufficiently collapsible to be able to dispense the tablet or capsule by means of pressing it out with the thumb. Breaking the lidding foil with a fingernail for the appropriate tablet will make the pressing out easier.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{material}} for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is {{sometimes referred to as}} Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the <b>push-through</b> effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 [...] "MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>push-through</b> {{bending process}} can be {{regarded}} as a bending mechanism with two fixed diepoints and two movable diepoints, resulting in a total of four points.

In this paper, we clarify different aspects of lubrication and research excellent lubrication oil in <b>push-through</b> bending. Based on theresultsobtained, it was found that adhesion occursdepending on the lubricant used and the occurring force. It was also confirmed, that olefin is effective as a remedy for oiliness, in case of using a mineral oil-based lubricant. In addition, it was confirmed that excellent lubrication oil could be obtained by increasing the alcohol content and adjusting the content of synthetic ester.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the different modalities of congenital obstructing vaginal malformations and the evaluation of techniques to solve the problem. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: The University Hospital Nijmegen, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The medical records of 18 patients with congenital obstructive malformations of the vagina operated on by one gynecologist were retrospectively reviewed. The conditions were classified in three groups: group I with one uterus and vagina and with a transverse vaginal septum, group II with a partial vaginal agenesis and group III with a double genital system and a septum with occlusion of one vagina. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Operating technique used, mold treatment after surgery, menstruation outflow, the possibility of having intercourse and the need for additional surgery. RESULTS: 18 patients were evaluated. Of 10 patients in group I, 8 patients were treated with the pull-through technique and 2 patients with the <b>push-through</b> technique. Four of the patients with a pull-through operation did not get mold treatment; of these patients, 3 needed repeat surgery because of the tendency for constriction. Of 4 patients in group II, 1 patient was treated with the pull-through technique and 3 with the <b>push-through</b> technique. The patient with the pull-through technique needed repeat surgery because of constriction. There was no mold treatment after the first procedure. Group III were 4 patients all treated with the pull-through technique. None of them received mold treatment, and none of these patients needed repeat surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>push-through</b> method is a good surgical technique for the patients in whom problems of constriction after surgery are expected and for patients with difficulties during surgery. Mold treatment is recommended after surgery in patients with a thick transversal vaginal septum or a partial vaginal aplasia...|$|E
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) force measurements {{elucidate the}} effect of cation alkyl chain length and the anion species on ionic liquid (IL) interfacial structure at highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces {{as a function of}} potential. Three ILs are examined: 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate ([HMIM] FAP), 1 -ethyl- 3 - methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate ([EMIM] FAP), and 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([EMIM] TFSA). The step-wise force-distance profiles indicate the ILs adopt a multilayered morphology near the surface. When the surface is biased positively or negatively versus Pt quasireference electrode, both the number of steps, and the force required to rupture each step increase, indicating stronger interfacial structure. At all potentials, <b>push-through</b> forces for [HMIM] FAP are the highest, because the long alkyl chain results in strong cohesive interactions between cations, leading to well-formed layers that resist the AFM tip. The most layers are observed for [EMIM] FAP, because the C₂ chains are relatively rigid and the dimensions of the cation and anion are similar, facilitating neat packing. [EMIM] TFSA has the smallest <b>push-through</b> forces and fewest layers, and thus the weakest interfacial structure. Surface-tip attractive forces are measured for all ILs. At the same potential, the attractions are the strongest for [EMIM] TFSA and the weakest for [HMIM] FAP because the interfacial layers are better formed for the longer alkyl chain cation. This means interfacial forces are stronger, which masks the weak attractive forces...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Oncologic resections or {{complications}} of segmental femoral prostheses {{can result in}} severe bone loss of the femur for which a total femoral prosthesis (TFP) is required. This study assesses whether the loss of stability and function caused {{by the loss of}} muscle attachments can be improved by using a <b>push-through</b> total femoral endoprosthesis (PTTF), because it saves parts of the femur and its muscle attachments. Methods In this retrospective case series, ten patients aged 25 - 77 (mean 54) who received a PTTF between 2005 and 2014 were included for baseline, complications and survival analysis with a mean follow-up of 5. 3 (1. 1 - 9. 6) years. Functional outcome was assessed in six patients using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score, WHO performance scale, Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS), SF 36, EQ- 5 D, NRS pain score, fatigue score and satisfaction score. Results The mean MSTS score was 64 %(23 - 93 %). Five patients had a WHO performance scale of 1, one patient of 3. Mean TESS was 69 % (13 - 90 %). SF 36 was most notably limited by physical functioning (mean 48), vitality (68) and general health (67). NRS score was 1. 9, 1. 8 and 8. 3 for pain, fatigue and satisfaction, respectively. There were four failures: two infections (one resulting in amputation and one in a minor revision) and two mechanical failures (which required one revision to a TFP and one minor revision). Patient survival was 100 %, limb survival 90 %, and prosthesis survival 80 %.

Mechanical fasteners can be an effective method for preventing stiffener-skin separation. One potential failure mode for bolted panels occurs when the bolts pull through the stiffener attachment flange or skin. The resulting loss of support by the skin to the stiffener and by the stiffener to the skin can result in local buckling and subsequent panel collapse.

40|$|New {{pop-up menu}} styles such as pie menus and marking menus {{have proven to}} be measurably faster and more {{accurate}} in mouse and pen-based interfaces. These characteristics suggest that they may also be useful for 3 D haptically enhanced environments. This paper reports on our development and evaluation of a pie menu style and two types of linear menu styles. All utilize force to aid the user in option selection and activation. Our evaluation results show that selection using the pie menu is considerably faster and more accurate than both types of linear menu. Selection using <b>push-through</b> or exceed border methods was found to be superior to conventional button selection. We conclude that pop-up pie menus, with the right combination of selection method and assistive forces, can provide an excellent solution to providing menu choices in 3 D haptic environments and that considering speed accuracy tradeoffs is important in making design decisions. 1...|$|E
40|$|SiCf/SiC {{composites}} with BN interface {{were prepared}} through isothermal-isobaric chemical vapour infiltration process. Room temperature mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural, inter-laminar shear strength and fracture toughness (K-IC) were studied for the composites.

The fracture toughness is similarly enhanced to 23 MPa m(1 / 2) by stabilisation treatment. Fibre <b>push-through</b> test results showed that the interfacial bond strength between fibre and matrix for the composite with un-stabilised BN interface was too strong (> 48 MPa) and it has been modified to a weaker bond (10 MPa) due to intermediate heat treatment. In the case of composite in which BN interface was subjected to thermal treatment soon after the interface coating, the interfacial bond strength between fibre and matrix was relatively stronger (29 MPa) and facilitated limited fibre pull-out...|$|E
40|$|Background: Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} and endoprosthetic replacement for bone sarcomas {{of the lower}} extremity is well established. The specific long-term consequences of these endoprosthetic reconstructions for the patient's affected limb are unknown. Method: The oncologic results and {{the survival of the}} endoprostheses were reviewed in 32 patients with primary bone sarcoma of the femur or proximal tibia. There were 26 high-grade sarcomas, and 6 low-grade sarcomas. A proximal femoral endoprosthesis was used for reconstruction in 4 patients, a total or <b>push-through</b> femoral endoprosthesis in 11 patients, a distal femoral endoprosthesis in 15 patients, and a proximal tibial endoprosthesis in two patients. Results: Median survival was 10 years (range, 1. 1 to 18. 9 years) for patients with high-grade sarcoma, and 8. 1 years (range, 7. 1 to 10 years) for patients with low-grade sarcomas. Distant metastases developed in seven patients (22 %), all with stage IIB sarcoma, with concomitant local recurrence in 3 patients (9 %). Five-year overall and disease-free survival rates for high-grade sarcomas were 81 % and 73 %, respectively. The overall endoprosthetic survival rate was 87 % at 5 years, 80 % at 10 years, and 56 % at 15 years. Median follow-up of the original endoprostheses was 8. 3 years (range, 0. 6 to 18. 7 years). Endoprosthesis-related complications occurred in 13 patients (41 %); most complications were mechanical failures. The highest complication rate was found in distal femoral replacements (60 %); amputation was necessary in both patients treated with a proximal tibial endoprosthesis. Five endoprostheses (16 %) were revised. An amputation of the involved limb was performed in four patients (13 %) : in two patients because of local recurrence and in the other two patients because of infection. For patients alive at follow-up, the median functional Enneking evaluation score was 22 points (range, 12 to 28 points), with the highest functional scores in patients with a distal femoral endoprosthesis, and the lowest functional scores in patients with total or <b>push-through</b> femoral replacements. Conclusion: Endoprosthetic reconstructions gave satisfying functional results in most patients after long-term survival. However, the proximal tibial and distal femoral endoprosthesis are particularly at risk for long-term endoprosthetic complications requiring additional surgical procedures...|$|E
40|$|Unidirectional celsian matrix {{composites}} having 42 - 45 vol % of uncoated or BN-SIC coated Hi-Nicalon fibers {{were tested}} in three-point bend at room temperature. The uncoated fiber-reinforced composites showed catastrophic failure with strength of 210 35 MPa and a flat fracture surface. In contrast, composites reinforced with coated fibers exhibited graceful failure with extensive fiber pullout. Values of first matrix cracking stress and strain were 435 +/- 35 MPa and 0. 27 +/- 0. 01 %, respectively, with ultimate strength as high as 960 MPa. The elastic Young modulus of the uncoated and coated fiber-reinforced composites were 184 +/- 4 GPa and 165 +/- 5 GPa, respectively. Fiber <b>push-through</b> tests and microscopic examination indicated no chemical reaction at the uncoated or coated fiber-matrix interface. The low strength of composite with uncoated fibers is due to degradation of the fiber strength from mechanical damage during processing. Because both the coated- and uncoated-fiber-reinforced composites exhibited weak interfaces, the beneficial effect of the BN-SIC dual layer is primarily the protection of fibers from mechanical damage during processing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tubulobulbar {{complexes}} (TBCs) are actin-based {{structures that}} help establish close contact between Sertoli–Sertoli cells or Sertoli–mature germ cells (spermatids) in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. They are actin-rich <b>push-through</b> devices that eliminate excess spermatid cytoplasm and prepare mature spermatids for release into the tubular lumen. Just prior to spermiation, the elongated spermatid {{interacts with the}} Sertoli cell via an extensive structure comprising various adhesion molecules called the apical ectoplasmic specialization which is partially replaced by the apical TBC, on the concave surface of the spermatid head. The sperm release process involves extensive restructuring, namely the disassembly and reassembly of junctions at the Sertoli–spermatid interface in the seminiferous epithelium. Based {{on the presence of}} different classes of molecules in the TBCs or the defects observed in the absence of TBCs, the main functions attributed to TBCs are elimination of excess spermatid cytoplasm, endocytosis and recycling of junctional molecules, shaping of the spermatid acrosome, and forming transient anchoring devices for mature spermatids before they are released. This review summarizes the recent findings that focus on the role of TBCs in cell cytoskeleton restructuring during sperm release in the testes and the molecular mechanism involved. </p...|$|E
40|$|This text aims to {{identify}} the main features of development of sickness insurance in the Czech lands. In {{the second half of}} the 19 th century new mutual benefit societies started to emerge [...] similarly like in Great Britain and the United States, and in the same time in 1888 the compulsory workers sick insurance was introduced.

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) force measurements {{have been}} used to study the solvate ionic liquid (IL) double layer nanostructure at highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and Au(111) electrode surfaces as a function of potential. Two solvate ILs are investigated, [Li(G 4) ] TFSI and [Li(G 4) ] NO₃. Normal force versus apparent separation data indicates that both solvate ILs adopt a multilayered morphology at the electrode interface, similar to conventional ILs. Calculations of adsorption free energies indicate that at 0 V the ion layer in contact with the electrode surface is enriched in the more surface active cations. When a positive or negative surface bias is applied, the concentration of counterions in the innermost layer increases, and higher <b>push-through</b> forces are required to displace near surface layers, indicating a stronger interfacial structure. Generally, [Li(G 4) ] TFSI has a better defined structure than [Li(G 4) ] NO₃ on both electrode surfaces due to stronger cohesive interactions within layers. Interfacial structure is also better defined for both solvate ILs on HOPG than Au(111) due to the greater surface roughness of Au(111). Further, at all negative potentials on both surfaces, a small final step is observed, consistent with either compression of the complex cation adsorbed structure or desolvation of the glyme from the Li⁺...|$|E

In this report two common tests, namely lie push-in test and the slice compression test were analytically simulated. In the push-in test, the effect of factors ich as indentor shape, indentor size, <b>push-through</b> radius hole, and transverse isotropy of fibers on load-"splacement curves was studied. All factors except the push through hole-radius were found to affect the load-placement curves. In the slice compression test, comparison was made for the values of maximum protrusion, idual protrusion and debond lengths for a simple shear-lag analysis and a finite element analysis model. Large |fferences ranging from 15 % to 70 % were found by using the two different models. Hence, the importance of rate modeling of the test cannot be ignored.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify design features of oral medicines that cause use problems among older patients in daily practice. A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews on the experiences of older people with the use of their medicines was performed (n= 59). Information on practical problems, strategies to overcome these problems and the medicines' design features that caused these problems were collected. The practical problems and management strategies were categorised into 'use difficulties' and 'use errors'. A total of 158 use problems were identified, of which 45 were categorized as use difficulties and 113 as use error. Design features that contributed the most to the occurrence of use difficulties were the dimensions and surface texture of the dosage form (29. 6 % and 18. 5 %, respectively).

40|$|Anthropogenic {{or natural}} {{disturbances}} {{can have a}} significant impact on wild animals. Therefore, understanding when, how and what type of human and natural events disturb animals is a central problem in wildlife conservation. However, it can be difficult to identify which particular environmental stressor affects an individual most. We use heart rate telemetry to quantify the energy expenditure associated with different types of human-mediated and natural disturbances in a breeding passerine, the white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus). We fitted 0. 5  g heart rate transmitters to 14 male vireos and continuously recorded heart rate and activity for two days and three nights on a military installation. We calibrated heart rate to energy expenditure for five additional males using an open-flow, <b>push-through</b> respirometry system showing that heart rate predicted 74 per cent of energy expenditure. We conducted standardized disturbance trials in the field to experimentally simulate a natural stressor (predator presence) and two anthropogenic stressors. Although birds initially showed behavioural and heart rate reactions to some disturbances, we could not detect an overall increase in energy expenditure during 1 - or 4 -hours disturbances. Similarly, overall activity rates were unaltered between control and experimental periods, and birds continued to perform parental duties despite the experimental disturbances. We suggest that vireos quickly determined that disturbances were non-threatening and thus showed no (costly) physiological response. We hypothesize that the lack of a significant response to disturbance in vireos is adaptive and may be representative of animals with fast life histories (e. g. short lifespan, high reproductive output) so as to maximize energy allocation to reproduction. Conversely, we predict that energetic cost of human-mediated disturbances will be significant in slow-living animals...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} hybrid, {{coarse-grained}} and atomistic, {{molecular dynamics simulation}} study of the size, motion, and function of the SecY protein-conducting channel. Growing and pushing virtual soft ball constructs through the pore of SecY, we mimic the <b>push-through</b> of polypeptides, performed cotranslationally by the ribosome and posttranslationally by the SecA ATPase. Forced lateral opening of a “front gate” between transmembrane helices is also induced by {{the passage of the}} virtual probes, with implications for the membrane insertion of peptides. We conclude that the SecY channel can stretch to allow passage of peptides with transversal sizes of ∼ 16 Å. The observed motion of a transmembrane helical “plug” controlling the closed and open states of the channel is consistent with experimental results and confirms previous hypotheses. Additionally, the “hinge” region for front gate opening is observed to be highly mobile as postulated. Both the forced dilation of a “ring” of residues at the middle of the pore and the lateral opening of the front gate are shown to induce plug displacement, but neither accomplish a full-extent motion of the plug {{to the back of the}} channel. For probes whose passage does not destroy the resilience of the SecY, both lateral exit and full translocation are observed, despite the fact that applied forces were always in the direction along the pore axis. Lateral exit is accompanied by front gate opening and slight plug displacement, whereas full translocation is accompanied by large plug displacement but no apparent lateral opening. Simulations also reveal that dilating the pore ring is a more effective way to destabilize the plug than intercalation of a cylinder-like probe at the front gate. Based on the simulations, the existence of a family of diverse open states is proposed...|$|E

The influence of various parameters including IL molecular structure, applied electric potential, bulk liquid viscosity and interfacial liquid viscosity on nanoscale friction were studied. Friction force microscopy (FFM) {{was used to}} investigate the friction behaviours {{of a series of}} protic ionic liquids (PILs) confined between a silica colloidal probe and a mica surface. The effect of solvophobic interactions on friction was investigated by varying cation alkyl chain length (propylammonium cation vs. ethylammonium cation). The effect of the hydrogen bonding capacity of both the cation (ethanolammonium cation vs. ethylammonium cation) and anion (nitrate vs. formate) was also studied. The effect of steric hindrance was probed using an IL (dimethylethylammonium formate) with weak interfacial structure. The friction coefficient changed at a critical normal load equal to the final <b>push-through</b> force in normal force-distance profiles in each IL. At this critical normal load all but a single layer of ions was removed from between the surfaces. Soft contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging showed a change in the morphology of the propylammonium nitrate (PAN) -mica system from a structure with an undulating appearance to one with a worm-like appearance as the imaging load crossed the critical normal load. This indicated a structural rearrangement, consistent with the number of confined ion layers changing as load increased. Addition of n -alkanols to PAN resulted in a decrease in friction. The reduction was dependent on the concentration of n-alkanol, but independent of n -alkanol alkyl chain length. The friction reduction was not correlated with the bulk viscosity of the system, and thin-film drainage experiments showed that localised viscosity reductions did not occur in the system. The decrease in the friction force was attributed to weakening of intermolecular interactions between ions adsorbed to the mica surface and those in near surface layers. Friction was reduced when PEO was adsorbed to silica surfaces and immersed in pure PAN and in the aprotic ionic liquid (AIL) 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. A range of PEO molecular weights were investigated. Theoretical fits to AFM force-distance profiles showed that PEO adsorbed onto silica from both ILs in a mushroom conformation. FFM experiments showed that friction was lower when PEO was present compared to either pure IL, and that friction decreased as polymer molecular weight increased. Friction was reduced due to the high osmotic pressures generated as polymer layers were compressed; this provided an effective barrier to direct surface-surface contact. The ability of an IL to lubricate an electrically charged contact was investigated by applying a surface potential to a gold surface lubricated by the IL 1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate. Friction varied as a function of both the sign and magnitude of the bias. The composition of the adsorbed layer of ions varied as surface polarity changed from positive to negative or vice versa. The adsorbed layer composition influenced ion packing arrangements and both had a significant effect on friction; the relatively long alkyl chains of the cations lowered friction more effectively than the bulky anions...|$|E
40|$|The skills {{shortage}} {{is one of}} {{the problems}} that existed in South Africa as a result of its historic political situation. South Africa was characterized by a white dominant government in an economy which was marked by exclusions of various people of race and gender. In the working environment, the situation reflected job reservation for white males, limited career opportunities for white females with repercussions of isolation, sanctions and global deprivation. The 1994 elections brought a change in leadership and a democratic government had as its primary mission skills development for all. On a macro level, South Africa was marginalized from global participation and on a micro level, many people were not able to enter the workforce because of a lack of skills let alone be active in the economy. The South African government’s resultant Human Resources Development – (HRDS) and National Skills Development Strategy (NSDS) were driven by supportive legislation namely the Skills Development Act No 97 of 1998, Employment Equity Act No 55 of 1998, Skills Development Levies Act of 1999 and the South African Qualifications Authority Act No 58 of 1995. These strategies and legislative measures intended to address the skills shortages through the implementation of learnerships as a national qualification. Following from the high level strategy were the initial over-ambitious targets for people to become qualified learners. The result was a <b>push-through</b> effect of individuals who were not necessarily suited to a particular learnership nor were they able to function on the required standard. Low level evaluations were used to ‘certify’ potential learners in terms of their numeracy and literacy levels only. This provided an opportunity to evaluate the suitability of learners on the New Venture Creation Learnership in terms of their entrepreneurial functionality and leadership qualities. After evaluating a number of models (Carland Entrepreneurial Index, the Bar-on Emotional Intelligence test and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), the Functional ii Intelligence Assessment Tool (FIAT) scientific model was selected because of its holistic approach of the individual and his/her functionality within an environment. The Functional Intelligence Assessment Tool identified and substantiated the suitability or non-suitability of the respondents in terms of entrepreneurial requirements. An additional questionnaire was administered to evaluate leadership qualities which are an essential component of the entrepreneur. The first of three research goals were attained when the respondents who were in the process of completing the New Venture Creation Learnership were successfully assessed in terms of entrepreneurial functionality. The outcome of this research concluded that only three (3) out of nineteen (19) candidates were found to be suitable for the entrepreneurial environment while two of the three had leadership qualities. The analysis of one candidate was such that no accurate analysis in terms of leadership qualities could be obtained. In terms of Functional Tendency, eight (8) candidates showed extrovert tendencies, six (6) showed introvert tendencies while five (5) candidates rendered results that did not give a clear indication of the individual’s functionality. Nine (9) individuals intentionally tried to manipulate their results but were identified through their inconsistent results while candidate 1 manipulated her results unintentionally; Five (5) individuals tried to disguise their results by giving extreme scores thereby hoping to impress with their choice of answers (impression management) while two (2) individuals were in denial about their situation having scored unrealistic results. Two (2) individuals had serious problems with their emotional functioning to the extent that they should consult a professional person (professional intervention). Twelve (12) individuals revealed inconsistent results while the remainder of candidates shows some or an insignificant degree of inconsistency in their results. Only three (3) individuals should be re-assessed due to the extent of their inconsistency. iii The second research goal to give comprehensive feedback to the Services Seta and respondents regarding the outcome of the Functional Intelligence Assessment Tool assessments will only be attained after this thesis but it sets the base for follow-up of the respondents’ progress and to conduct future research. The third research goal is also more medium - to long term - to apply this tool to potential learners and – employees in addition to the initial research performed. This goal will also only be attained after negotiations with SETAs and continuous populating of a central database with the FIAT’s assessments. The holistic approach to assessing the functionality of an individual gives the person a vast number of areas known as super constructs (self perception and emotional functioning; relationships and corporate functioning, personal – and organizational value comparison) that will either highlight a serious situation or spell out how the individual will react and interact in certain situations. Small business is said to drive the economy of a country. It is therefore critical that the entrepreneurs in a country are identified early (through a scientific instrument such as FIAT) and skilled appropriately (through learnerships or other educational routes). It is equally important that individuals that are not entrepreneurs be found their rightful vocation and then everyone can contribute effectively to the economic activity. Prof. J. J. D.
