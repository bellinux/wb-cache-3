40|$|Since September 20, 1957, the Nebraska {{oil and gas}} lien statute {{has been}} in effect. Prior to its passage, Nebraska had only a general {{mechanic}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute. With a growing oil and gas drilling industry, it soon became apparent that due to the complexities and uniqueness of {{the oil and gas}} drilling business, the general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute had many shortcomings when it was stretched to include this industry. In some of these states the oil and gas drilling industry was brought within the terms of the more general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes either by judicial construction or by slight amendment of their already existing mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes. In other jurisdictions, particularly those with a significant oil and gas drilling industry, special oil and gas lien statutes were enacted. Even though Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute can and often does cover many wide and varied contingencies, the complexities of the oil and gas drilling industry convinced many that a special statute, addressed specifically to this growing industry, was needed. As the oil and gas drilling industry in Nebraska grows in significance, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s oil and gas lien statute will likewise grow in significance. It should become a necessary and familiar tool to those attorneys who do oil and gas work in Nebraska. While Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s statute is similar to other oil and gas lien statutes, many questions concerning this statute are at present unanswered...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{one aspect}} of the law regarding the satisfaction of judgments: when a creditor is determined to have a lien on property of the debtor. The unnecessary cumbersomeness of the present system, which limits the ability of creditors to promptly obtain a legally cognizable interest in specific property, hampers creditors in preventing the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s use, sale, or hypothecation of property {{that could be used to}} satisfy their debts. This is particularly true of intangible property and property where federal law or the law of sister states controls transfers. Not only do judgment creditors face the risk that the debtor will voluntarily dissipate or transfer assets, but also the risk that they will be defeated by subsequent parties who deal with the debtor, become creditors, and are able to find assets. Possibly the most pernicious of those subsequent creditors are the federal and state taxing authorities. The tax lien, once filed, locks in all personal and real property of the debtor. Bankruptcy also presents a serious difficulty for the judgment creditor. If the debtor files for bankruptcy before the creditor can locate personal property of the debtor, the creditor (despite having obtained a judgment) has no greater priority than all of the unsecured creditors of the debtor. If the judgment creditor locates personal property and obtains a lien on that property shortly before the date that the debtor files a Bankruptcy petition, the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> can be avoided as a preference. Even where a debtor files a Chapter 11 petition and maintains control of the business as a debtor in possession, the debtor can still use the preference section to avoid the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien.</b> This article proposes that the computer systems currently being introduced to automate court systems around the country serve as the vehicle for the implementation of major reforms in the substantive and procedural law regarding judicial liens. The most significant change would involve the creation of statewide judgment liens on virtually all of the property of the debtor. This article will explore how the proposed system might deal with various types of property and particular third parties, and how to solve some of the transitional problems involved in adopting such a system. The changes proposed are incorporated in a Model Judgment Lien Act (MJLA) which is set forth in the Appendix of this article. It is hoped that the MJLA makes clear precisely how the rules discussed in the article would operate...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{inside the}} nuclei of cells is folded into an {{intricate}} three-dimensional (3 D) structure that influences {{how and when}} genes are turned on and off. For example, 3 D interactions between distal regulatory elements, such as enhancers and their promoter targets {{are known to be}} responsible for regulating a range of genes with cell-type specific functions. Recent technologies coupling chromosome conformation capture to next-generation sequencing, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, allow for genome-wide identification of 3 D interactions at unprecedented resolution. However, analysis is challenging due to the complexity of the data. This PhD-thesis presents several statistical models and computational tools to analyze such data, based on realistic assumptions regarding the underlying properties of chromatin structure. The thesis presents a model for analysis of 3 D co-localization of selected elements in the genome. Additionally, the thesis presents a web-based analysis server called HiBrowse ([URL] for performing statistical analysis of 3 D genomes in a range of different settings.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to continue the dialogue begun by the proposed Restatement and has two distinct goals in this effort. Parts I through III argue that {{the position of the}} Restatement drafters is both legally and functionally sound and that bankruptcy courts should embrace and apply the proposed Restatement in administering distressed real estate developments. Part I reviews the reasoning articulated in the hotel bankruptcy cases, demonstrating how courts have applied the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and state law in a formalistic manner to extinguish the hotel mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> upon postpetition room revenues. Part II rejects the analysis of the hotel bankruptcy cases on legal grounds. Although the drafters of the proposed Restatement appear to base their recommendations purely upon the functional similarity of rents and hotel room revenues, bankruptcy courts properly may characterize hotel room revenues as “rent” in the nature of real property. The notion that a licensee may pay “rent” in exchange for its constituent rights respecting the land is consistent with the original common law scope of the term “rent,” as well as the nature and scope of the term within the civil law tradition. Part III then criticizes the hotel bankruptcy cases on policy grounds, demonstrating that financial and economic realities do not justify distinguishing between real estate projects based solely upon the status of the occupier as a tenant rather than a licensee. To the developer and the mortgagee, the occupancy revenues generated by the apartment and the hotel are economically identical. Accordingly, sound commercial policy dictates that security law should treat hotel mortgagees with liens upon hotel room revenues no differently than apartment mortgagees holding liens upon rents...|$|R
40|$|Creditors {{have more}} than a dozen prejudgment, no-notice {{remedies}} which permit them to seize or encumber a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property even before the creditor has sued the debtor and recovered a judgment. Moreover, a creditor may take a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property without giving the debtor prior notice and the opportunity to oppose the taking in a judicial proceeding. These extraordinary remedies have been employed in England and the United States for centuries and in the 1920 s the Supreme Court affirmed their constitutionality. However, in a set of decisions beginning in with Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. in 1969 and Fuentes v. Shevin in 1972, the Supreme Court laid down the broad principle that, except in extraordinary circumstances, no private citizen could use the courts to summarily seize another person 2 ̆ 7 s property. Now, however, the Supreme Court is retreating from these decisions, signalled by its actions in three cases decided in May 1974 which, respectively, rehabilitated replevin, upheld the constitutionality of mechanics 2 ̆ 7 and materialmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liens,</b> and held that cognovits were valid. The author surveys current Supreme Court jurisprudence on creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies, analyzing the constitutionality of: I. Liens which do not disturb possession, II. Judicial remedies of secured creditors, III. Judicial remedies of unsecured creditors, and IV. Self-help remedies. The author argues that it was a mistake for the Supreme Court to invalidate various no-notice creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies on due process grounds because the vindication of abstract and subjective notions of procedural due process is not the business of the courts. The author concludes that the present Court is more likely to defer to the judgment of the peoples 2 ̆ 7 legislators and, as such, creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies which inflict no injustice on debtors in general or upon a particular debtor in a given case will pass constitutional muster despite the absence of prior notice and the opportunity for a hearing...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A re-sourcing decision is a sourcing decision subsequent to an outsourcing arrangement. Effective management of re-sourcing decisions is vital in ensuring the stability and continuity of organisational operations supported by outsourced critical activities. However, despite {{the importance of this}} stage in the outsourcing cycle, most outsourcing research has focused on outsourcing determinants and outsourcing process control stages. The study reported in this thesis set out to explore maintenance re-sourcing decisions in an asset-intensive service organisation operating in a capital constrained economy. The objectives of the study were to determine the factors that influence the management of maintenance re-sourcing decisions in asset intensive service organisations and to propose a management model for guiding maintenance re-sourcing decision making processes in such organisations. In order to achieve these objectives, a qualitative style oriented in-depth case study was adopted. Results from a thematic data analysis revealed that the management of re-sourcing decisions is impacted by factors that fall into three categories: the purchasing organisation s structural elements, external structural elements and boundary spanning elements. However, of the three categories, boundary spanning elements were found to have a greater bearing on the effectiveness of the most critical stages, incumbent supplier performance evaluation and incumbent to alternative supplier comparison. In addition to the recognised role that outsourcing models play in guiding sourcing decisions, this study has revealed the importance of three more key enablers. These include: recruiting qualified and experienced individuals into boundary spanning roles, developing and maintaining enabling environments for boundary spanners to engage in behaviour that supports the <b>purchaser</b> <b>s</b> goals and values, and, developing information management systems targeted at enhancing regular capturing of incumbent and alternative supplier capability and capacity before re-sourcing decision time. The results from this study will primarily benefit sourcing managers in asset-intensive service organisations operating in capital constrained economies that have outsourced or intend to outsource maintenance...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Article 9 {{is a much more}} {{comprehensive}} personal property security statute than was ever found in American law prior to its enactment, cases continue to present issues on the scope of the Article. Gone are the cases in which a court was called upon to determine whether a 2 ̆ 2 conditional sales contract 2 ̆ 2 could be dealt with under the 2 ̆ 2 factor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> 2 ̆ 2 law; {{it is now clear that}} all such personal property security devices are governed by Article 9. Yet many problems remain for the unwary lawyer. I will identify several and deal in detail with three of these coverage problems. [ [...] . ] The first is the treatment of the United States government as a lender. When the United States grants credit either to a farmer (as the Farmers Home Administration) or in one of a number of other transactions, its rights are governed by federal statutory and common law. To what extent should that common law be derived from state law, namely Article 9 ? Second, I deal with 2 ̆ 2 quasi consignments. 2 ̆ 2 These are transactions in which an owner of goods puts those goods in the hands of another party for processing or other work of some sort. These arrangements are as varied as the imagination of the parties undertaking them. Some look indistinguishable from bailments, others look very much like consignments. In each case there is the question should we treat the original owner merely as an owner who has bailed his or her goods to another party or should we treat him or her as an unpaid seller or an unsecured creditor? Finally, I will deal with Article 9 as it applies to transactions somehow involving real estate. The most familiar case is that in which a secured creditor lends money against a mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s interest in a mortgage and mortgage note. Less well articulated, but nearly as important, are the secured creditor 2 ̆ 7 s rights when he or she is lending to the vendor on a land-sale contract, to the lessee on a lease or even to the lessor...|$|R

40|$|Today 2 ̆ 7 s soaring {{mortgage}} {{default rate}} and the uncertainty and delay associated with mortgage foreclosure proceedings threaten to cause financial tragedies of the commons in condominiums and homeowner associations across the country. Assessment defaults in privately governed communities result in an inequitable allocation of upkeep costs-a phenomenon that current law has failed to prevent. But the collateral damage caused by delayed foreclosures and insufficient recoveries can be minimized by increasing the payment priority of the association lien. In a majority of states, association liens are completely subordinate to the first mortgage lien. At foreclosure of the mortgage lien, the junior priority assessment lien will be extinguished {{whether or not there}} are sufficient proceeds to reimburse for community charges. Assessment delinquencies grow over time, so the longer it takes to complete foreclosure, the greater the costs to the neighborhood. Although several states have adopted a limited lien priority for up to six months 2 ̆ 7 worth of unpaid assessments, foreclosures today take far longer than six months, and the amount ultimately owed to a community can be significant and far exceed that cap. Federal housing policy affects the resolution of the issue because the Federal Housing Administration (2 ̆ 2 FHA 2 ̆ 7), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only permit qualifying mortgages to be subject to a six-month assessment lien priority. The decelerating pace of foreclosure further exacerbates the already unjustifiable financial impact borne by non-defaulting neighbors. The lien priority status quo fails to adequately protect communities in today 2 ̆ 7 s context of widespread, delayed foreclosures andunder-collateralized mortgage loans. Decreasing the first mortgage lien 2 ̆ 7 s priority during a foreclosure delay would mitigate the harm. Lien priority statutory changes could protect association finances in the future, and such provisions might be applied retroactively as well. In other contexts, states have held that changes to a lien priority regime could apply to existing associations and existing mortgages without unconstitutionally impairing contract or property rights. This has been particularly true where the association 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> was deemed to have been created on the date the community 2 ̆ 7 s organizational documents were recorded (prior to any unit 2 ̆ 7 s mortgage). Historically, bank lobbyists have opposed any enhanced assessment lien priority. However, supporting property upkeep and making assessments more predictable and collectible would actually benefit lenders by shoring up the value of their collateral. Moreover, increased certainty with respect to homeowner payment obligations would enable more responsible credit underwriting and contribute to economic recovery. Shoring up assessment lien priority would not only ensure a fair allocation of community costs, but also would help to contain the current housing market decline...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of country-of- origin on the apparel purchase decision. One-hundred and eighty-one adult female sweater purchasers were surveyed directly following {{the purchase of a}} sweater for personal use in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. The sample consisted of 138 department store shoppers and 43 discount store shoppers. Country-of-origin and price information were recorded from the garments purchased while respondents completed questionnaires. A semantic differential scale was used to measure the importance of country-of-origin and the following purchase criteria in the decision to purchase a sweater: fit, designer label/brand name, expected durability, color, warmth/coolness properties, ease of care, fashion, store, price, quality of workmanship, coordinates with wardrobe, fiber content, feel of garment, and style/design. On {{a scale of one to}} seven, country-of-origin received the lowest mean importance score of the purchase criteria with a score of 2. 40. This mean was significantly lower in importance than all other criteria except designer label/ brand name. Fit, color, and coordinates with existing wardrobe received the highest mean importance scores, each above 6. 25. Findings revealed that only 17 percent of the respondents were aware of garment origin at the time of purchase. A significantly greater proportion of <b>purchasers</b> of U. <b>S.</b> made sweaters (23. 9 %) were aware of garment origin than were purchasers of imported sweaters (12. 5 %). Other significant findings showed country-of-origin to be most important to: <b>purchasers</b> of U. <b>S.</b> made sweaters; <b>purchasers</b> aware of a garment's origin; sweater purchasers over 50 years of age; and homemakers. However, even for these groups mean importance scores for country-of-origin remained low. Importance ratings for country-of-origin were not found to differ significantly on the basis of education, income, price paid, or store type. In conclusion, country-of-origin was not found to be an important criterion compared to other purchase criteria that influence the decision to buy a sweater, although a limited number of purchasers did notice garment origin and considered U.

S. economic interdependence with the Far East and Taiwan has increased dramatically since the early *Department of Economics, Stanford University. CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 1960 s. The fuzziness of their perception of the Asian trade situation may be attributed {{to the fact that the}} bulk of published international business reporting remains devoted to U. S. -European affairs. Thus, this audience, as well as the broader audience of all American voters, would surely be surprised to learn the true degree of U. S. -Far Eastern trade interdependence. As of 1973, Taiwan was the seventh largest source of U. S. imports-more important than France. It was the fifteenth largest <b>purchaser</b> of U. <b>S.</b> exports, outranking countries such as Switzerland and Israel. The most recent assessment, 1976, places Taiwa...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, some {{hospitals}} have gained significant market power to com-mand high prices from private insurers {{for a variety}} of reasons, including hospital con-solidation, unique specialty services and in some cases reputations for superior clinical quality. Emerging payer strategies to counter hospital market power include develop-ing limited-provider networks that either exclude high-price providers or require greater patient cost sharing. Another approach is reference pricing where a purchaser sets a maximum allowed amount—the reference price—for a specific medical service or procedure in a specific market. If enrollees receive care at a facil-ity that has an allowed amount above the reference price, the enrollee must pay the additional amount out of pocket. The goal of reference pricing is to save money by direct-ing enrollees toward low-price providers, while also motivating high-price providers to lower prices to retain market share. 1 What is Reference Pricing? Reference pricing has long been used in other countries for prescription drugs with generic alternatives or therapeutic equivalents. 2 In recent years, a handful of U. <b>S.</b> <b>purchasers</b> have adopted reference pricing not only for prescription drugs but {{for a variety of}} other medical services, including inpatient ortho-pedic surgery, outpatient arthroscopy an...|$|R
40|$|In {{our study}} of 43 drugs, {{prescription}} drug prices in several wealthy nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U. K.) were {{much lower than}} in the U. S. on average, well below relative per capita GDP. There was relatively little difference among the five foreign nations. All {{this is consistent with}} previous research. After separating less-unique from moreunique drugs, however, important new findings emerged. Relative prices for less-unique drugs, which are subject to strong competition, were at about half the U. S. level. We suggest that this reflects the exercise of monopsony power that does not exist in the U. S., where buyers as well as sellers compete. On the other hand, relative prices for highly unique drugs tended to be approximately proportional to per capita GDP or higher. Remarkably, biotech drugs were priced at or above U. S. levels in Canada and France. These results carry uneasy implications for the future of pharmaceutical research. The follow-on drugs that make therapeutic classes competitive also amplify the incentives to conduct new R&D within these classes even as R&D incentives for pioneer brands disappear with the approach of patent expiration. Our results suggest that price controls operate to blunt these incentives for follow-on drug research, leaving most of the burden to U. <b>S.</b> <b>purchasers.</b> Because these follow-on R&D results are often extremely valuable, the implications merit substantial concern. In contrast, biotech drug prices in foreign nations appear to be above profit-maximizing levels, which we suggest is caused by political forces in the U. S., while foreign revenues, as one would expect, are very low. This, too, undermines research incentives, especially for creating highly innovative drugs. ...|$|R

Baltimore 2 ̆ 6 Ohio Railroad, 1 the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{considered}} {{whether the}} owner of a security may assert his seller 2 ̆ 7 s section 10 (b) cause of action if the current owner did not receive an express assignment of the seller 2 ̆ 7 s rights. 2 That is, if the seller of a security has a section 10 (b) claim, does the seller 2 ̆ 7 s cause of action 2 ̆ 2 run with the security 2 ̆ 2 so that the seller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>purchaser</b> takes the seller 2 ̆ 7 s cause of action by automatic assignment, or must the purchaser secure an express assignment of the seller 2 ̆ 7 s cause of action in order for the purchaser to sue the party who defrauded the seller? This note addresses the issue whether a section 10 (b) cause of action should run with the security where existence of the cause of action has become a matter of public knowledge. The note first reviews the law of assignments of causes of action in general, 3 and then summarizes three possible resolutions of the issue: adopting a rule of automatic assignments, 4 inferring the parties 2 ̆ 7 intent from the facts, 5 and requiring an expression of the parties 2 ̆ 7 intent. 6 In discussing these three resolutions, the note evaluates the various arguments expressed in Lowry, 7 the consistency of each argument with the law of assignments 8 and with federal securities law, 9 and the ramifications of each argument for maintaining class actions. 10 The note concludes that an express assignment of the seller 2 ̆ 7 s cause of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the {{jurisdictional}} problems related to global horizontal cartels, comparing the jurisdictional treatment of antitrust actions for damages brought by vitamins <b>purchasers</b> in U. <b>S.</b> A. and in Europe. While the U. S. Supreme Court has recently narrowed the scope for “foreign-to-foreign” claims in the antitrust field, a prime opportunity of forum shopping seems to be still open in Europe – specially when transnational groups of undertakings are involved – relying on Art. 6. 1 of EC Regulation N. 44 / 2001. An interesting decisions of the U. K. High Court allows a German firm that has purchased goods in Germany from an indirect subsidiary of the parent company fined by the EC Commission to sue that subsidiary in the U. K., relying on the link between this claim and the claim for damages brought – by the same plaintiff – against another subsidiary domiciled in the U. K., notwithstanding {{the absence of any}} purchase from the U. K. defendant. The Author argues that the enforcement of Art. 6. 1 in the situation sketched above could lead to inappropriate multiplication of forums and should therefore not be granted de plano. In order to avoid the risk of abuse of process it is suggested that consolidation of claims should be possible only in the State of the domicile of the main responsible of the infringement or of the firm from which the goods were purchased at inflated prices. The Author then critically addresses the latest developments in the E. C. J. case law on Art. 6. 1, remarking the importance of a scrutiny of the strength of the primary claim, in order to prevent the use of the proviso with the sole object of removing a defendant from his proper forum...|$|R
