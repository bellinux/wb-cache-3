Two main directions can be identified {{in the attempt to}} clarify the content of this debate and in order to look to the future as to new developments. The first {{has to do with the}} impact of the controversial rulings of the Court of Justice dealing with collective social rights. The enforcement of these judgments falls into the dangerous trap of <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles</b> and opens up difficult scenarios for judges and social partners alike at the national level when faced with overriding market freedoms. 1 Some member states are already active in establishing new rules for the game in compliance with the Court’s judgments, while still preserving the autonomy of collective bargaining. ...|$|R
2500|$|The Justices {{could not}} agree, however, whether {{and to what}} extent the Eighth Amendment imposed a {{proportionality}} requirement in noncapital sentencing proceedings. Justice Antonin Scalia, as is typical of his originalist interpretation of the Constitution, introduced historical evidence in support of his argument that the Eighth Amendment imposes no proportionality requirement at all. Justice Anthony Kennedy argued in favor of a vague <b>proportionality</b> <b>principle</b> that allowed the Court to uphold Harmelin's sentence. And Justice Byron White argued that Harmelin's sentence was the sort of [...] "excessive" [...] sentence forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|For Justice White, Kennedy's narrow <b>proportionality</b> <b>principle</b> {{effectively}} [...] "eviscerates" [...] Solem, {{leaving only}} an [...] "empty shell" [...] in its place.

The paper illustrates the current trend consistent with the subsidiarity and <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles</b> : the State main responsability in respect of health policy, being integrated by efficiency criteria in the delivery stage, to ensure a more effective application of the right to good quality care.

40|$|Should {{the state}} punish its {{disadvantaged}} citizens {{who have committed}} crimes? Duff has recently argued that where disadvantage persists the state loses its authority to hold individuals to account and to punish for criminal wrongdoings. I here scrutinize Duff’s argument for the claim that social justice is a precondition for the legitimacy of state punishment. I sharpen an objection to Duff’s argument: with his framework, we seem unable to block the implausible conclusion that where disadvantage persists the state lacks the authority to punish any citizen for any crime. I then set out an alternative line of argument {{in support of the}} claim that social deprivation can threaten the states legitimate punitive authority. I argue that a penal system must incorporate certain <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles,</b> and that these principles cannot both be met where citizens suffer from deprivation...|$|R
2500|$|Judges have {{historically}} exercised much discretion in criminal sentencing. [...] Much of this discretion had been conferred by legislatures, who fixed criminal penalties over very broad ranges. [...] "It was not unheard of for a statute to authorize a sentence ranging from {{one year to}} life, for example." [...] In order to exercise this discretion, judges had to take into account all the goals of punishment in fixing a proportional sentence. [...] Stevens believed that the Eighth Amendment could support such determination of proportionality. [...] "I think it clear that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments expresses a broad and basic <b>proportionality</b> <b>principle</b> that takes into account all of the justifications for penal sanctions." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court's narrow ruling left a major {{question}} of Eighth Amendment law unresolved. [...] Since the Court's decision in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976), the Court had incorporated a detailed proportionality analysis into the {{cruel and unusual}} punishment analysis required in capital cases. The defendant Ronald Harmelin directly asked the Court to extend the reach of that analysis to noncapital cases such as his. Although five Justices agreed that Harmelin's sentence was not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, six Justices agreed that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause bore some kind of proportionality analysis. Yet among those six, three supported a <b>proportionality</b> <b>principle</b> that is highly deferential to legislative judgments, while three others supported a more searching proportionality analysis that would have struck down Michigan's mandatory life-without-parole sentence for possessing more than 650grams of cocaine (672grams).|$|E
2500|$|As {{an initial}} matter, Kennedy {{identified}} four principles that undergird the Eighth Amendment's <b>proportionality</b> <b>principle</b> as he understood it. First, [...] "the fixing of prison terms for specific crimes involves a substantive penological judgment that, {{as a general}} matter, is properly within the province of legislatures, not courts." [...] Second, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate the adoption of one theory of punishment over anotherstates are free to tailor their punishments {{to meet the needs}} of either a deterrence rationale, a retribution rationale, or both or some other rationale. Third, in light of these first two principles, there is bound to be some variation of punishments between and within particular jurisdictions. Thus, the intra- and interjurisdictional comparison required by the Solem test would frequently prove unworkable. Fourth, any proportionality analysis required by the Eighth Amendment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.|$|E

2500|$|Justice O'Connor {{wrote an}} opinion for herself, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Kennedy. [...] Under the Eighth Amendment, a narrow <b>proportionality</b> <b>principle</b> applies to non-capital sentences. [...] Before Ewing, the Court had {{from time to}} time {{examined}} lengthy sentences imposed for relatively minor crimes. [...] In Rummel v. Estelle, , the Court upheld a life sentence for obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses imposed on a three-time offender under Texas's recidivist statute. [...] In Solem v. Helm, , the Court struck down a life without parole (LWOP) sentence imposed on a defendant who had committed a seventh non-violent felony. [...] Most recently, in Harmelin v. Michigan, , the Court upheld a life without parole sentence imposed on a first-time offender convicted of possession of more than 650grams of cocaine. [...] Against this backdrop of case law, O'Connor said that the gross disproportionality principle contained in the Eighth Amendment would require striking down only an extreme noncapital sentence, such as a life sentence for overtime parking.|$|E

40|$|Subsidiarity is the {{principle}} which the European Community has begun applying to consider whether federal legislation is necessary, or whether action by the Member States will suffice. This article considers whether subsidiarity should constrain the Court of Justice 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence as well. It begins by analyzing the federalism problems posed by the Court 2 ̆ 7 s case law concerning remedies for the violation of Community law, in particular the doctrine holding Member States liable in damages for failing properly to implement Community directives. After concluding that the Court is required to review this jurisprudence for consistency with the subsidiarity principle, and that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s existing compensation and rights-centered rationale is largely insufficient, the article develops a two-fold argument for sustaining Member State liability even under the subsidiarity principle: such liability is essential to deterring Member State cheating on implementation, and encourages the development of directives that delegate rather than precisely prescribe regulatory content. The article concludes by describing possible modifications to prevailing liability doctrine in order to render it more consistent with the subsidiarity and <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles...</b>|$|R
40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{documented}} reasoning with conditionals, less {{is known about the}} personal interpretation of a conditional and whether respondents are flexible or consistent in their interpretations. Using a probabilistic reasoning task and the mental model theory of extensional reasoning, we infer the likely interpretation of the conditional by applying the equiprobability and <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles.</b> We test whether the apparent consistency is significantly different from a random pattern of independent answers and apply a threshold to identify consistent respondents. We find individual consistency with the mental model theoretical interpretation, the bi-conditional and conjunction interpretations, and distinguish two groups of respondents: consistent versus flexible. The 27 % of respondents who are consistent, focus on the conditional premise to build their mental representation. Consistent respondents spend more time reading the premise and answer more quickly than flexible respondents. Flexible respondents spend more time considering both premise and problem item to produce a task-specific interpretation. Response time increases when respondents change interpretation. 60 % of respondents change interpretation at least twice over the course of eight questions. IQ has little effect. These results support the hypothesis that flexible respondents use a task-specific mechanism of interpretation different from the one of consistent interpretations. status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|Immigration judges {{routinely}} use {{police reports}} to make life-altering decisions in noncitizens’ lives. The {{word of the}} police officer prevents a detainee from being released on bond, leads to negative discretionary decisions in relief from removal, and can prove that a past crime fits within a ground of removability. Yet the police officers who write these reports rarely step foot in immigration court; immigration judges rely on the hearsay document to make such critical decisions. This practice is especially troubling when the same police reports cannot be used against the noncitizen {{in a criminal case}} without the officer testifying, due to both the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause and Federal Rules of Evidence, neither of which apply in immigration court. In these days of the increasing criminalization of immigration law and prioritization of deporting so-called “criminal aliens,” the police report problem is salient, and impacts thousands of noncitizens every year. This article argues for a right to confront police officers in immigration court by examining three different ways to conceptualize removal proceedings: (1) in light of the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Padilla v. Kentucky, deportation should be considered punishment, thus guaranteeing all of the protections of a criminal trial, including the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause; (2) under the Mathews v. Eldridge case-by-case balancing test of the due process clause, courts should balance the interests at stake and adopt a right to confrontation and cross-examination of police officers in immigration court; and (3) if deportation is conceptualized as “quasi-criminal” and thus deserving of some, but not all, of the protections guaranteed at a criminal trial, one of those protections should be the right to confront one’s accuser, especially when the accuser is a police officer. The scholarship has focused on why other rights guaranteed in a criminal trial –court-appointed counsel, freedom from ex post facto laws, freedom from double jeopardy, <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles,</b> and the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule – should apply to removal proceedings. An overlooked criminal protection is the right to confront one’s accuser in immigration court...|$|R
40|$|The {{pitfalls of}} the {{relationship}} between European and national judges constitute a well-travelled ground in literature, especially with regard to 'sagas' over the reconciliation of national sovereignty with EU law primacy. Hence, the contribution that this article is attempting to make is to explore the judicial understanding and potential of the concept of constitutional identity {{in the light of the}} newly-introduced Article 4 (2) TEU by the Treaty of Lisbon, which makes it explicit that national identity encompasses constitutional specificity. A number of questions are raised and discussed. For instance: How has the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) been adjudicating on issues pertaining to the constitutional identity of the Member States pre- and post-Lisbon? How far can Member States stretch the concept to avoid the tidal effect of EU law upon their legal systems? For the sake of clarity, two notions of constitutional identity are identified and presented in this article: One related to the CJEU's case law, where 'constitutional identity' has been invoked by defending Member States as a qualified derogation from their EU law obligations (a 'shield') and another, inherent in the German Constitutional Court's (BVerfG) use of 'constitutional identity' as a break to an unprecedented transfer of competences to the EU and a tool of judicial review of national implementation measures of secondary legislation (a sword). The arguments advanced hereafter suggest that the implications of identity retention as a 'shield' may not be far-reaching since the CJEU has, through a pragmatic use of the loyalty and <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles,</b> succeeded in reducing its effect to the bare minimum. On the other hand, as a judicial review mechanism, the German paradigm demonstrates that, as a 'sword', constitutional identity retention comprises, largely, a theoretical possibility. These assumptions aside, it is concluded that constitutional identity retention may provide both national judiciaries and legislatures with new opportunities to participate in trans-national constitutional development through monitoring and assessing the compatibility of the exercise of EU competence with the requirements of national constitution...|$|R

The chapeau, that is the legal instrument putting into effect the eventual CESL, concerns such fundamental questions as legal basis, namely Art. 114 TFEU on the internal market, importance of the subsidiarity and <b>proportionality</b> <b>principles,</b> personal, territorial and substantive scope of the proposal, the mechanism of “opting-in” in cross-border B 2 C (business to consumer) transactions, its relation to the “acquis”, in particular the recently adopted “Consumer Rights Directive” (CRD) 2011 / 83 /EU of 25. 10. 2011, to existing Member State law under conflict-oflaw provisions of Art. 6 on consumer protection of Regulation (EU) 593 / 2008, and to options left to them. The second part, written by Hans Micklitz, analyses the substantive provisions of the so-called Annex I, namely the text of the CESL itself which with some modifications took over over the results of the EU expert group on a “feasibility study on an optional instrument” of 3. 5. 2011. It is concerned with B 2 C provisions on so-called “off-premises” and distance contracts with respect to information obligations of traders and withdrawal rights of consumers which are particularly relevant in ecommerce. Also the new proposals on unfair terms are discussed which go beyond the existing acquis of Dir. 93 / 13 /EEC. The third part, written by Norbert Reich, is concerned with provisions on consumer sales and related service transactions, also based on the feasibility study with an extension to “digital content”. Some of them go beyond the existing acquis of Dir. 99 / 44 /EC, while the concept of “related service contracts” remains rather obscure and controversial.
