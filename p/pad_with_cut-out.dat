40|$|The {{reliability}} of fine pitch Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu flip chip solder joints <b>with</b> three different <b>pads,</b> i. e., bare <b>pads,</b> <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> solder masks, and <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> microvia, on {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) was studied through thermal cycling. After assembly, (Au,Ni) Sn 4 intermetallics (IMCs) formed both in the bulk solder and at the interfaces due to the immersion-Au finish on the PCB side. The (Au,Ni) Sn 4 IMCs formed in the solder joints on the <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> microvia were more abundant than those formed in the solder joints on the pads without microvia. The {{results showed that the}} solder joints on the <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> a microvia had poor reliability due to the insufficient solder volume and the formation of large amounts of (Au,Ni) Sn 4 IMCs. The main crack initiation position was the corner of solder joint at the chip side. For the <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> microvia, the main location of failure was at the (Au,Ni) Sn 4 /solder interface on the chip side, and for the solder joints on bare <b>pads</b> and <b>pads</b> <b>with</b> solder mask, the possible failure location was in the bulk solder...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{experimental}} and numerical investigations {{were conducted on}} seismic behaviour of steel plate shear wall systems (SPSW) <b>with</b> and without <b>cut-outs.</b> Medium-scale specimens <b>with</b> moment-resisting connections between beam and columns and specific edge connections for fish plates were designed and constructed. The specimens were subjected to the cyclic quasi-static load. A loading system and proper lateral bracing unit was designed and built to apply the loading history according to ATC- 24 protocol. Nonlinear finite element analysis models with dynamic formulation were developed to analyse test specimens. The results were validated with available published test results from other researchers. After validation, the model was used for estimating the maximum load required for testing of specimens. The efficiency of the method was finally proved by comparing the pushover and hysteresis analysis results with tests carried out in Kingston University's lab. The test series comprised frame-only, steel plate shear wall with {{two different types of}} steel plate and corresponding specimens <b>with</b> circular <b>cut-outs</b> in the steel plates, GFRP-steel Sandwich Shear Walls (GSSW) with different GFRP lay-up, GSSW <b>with</b> <b>cut-outs</b> and finally the steel plate shear wall <b>with</b> <b>cut-out</b> and optimally designed steel stiffeners, The specification of boundary members and the type of connections was kept unchanged in all specimens. The effectiveness of utilising the GFRP plies and steel stiffeners for improving the seismic performance of steel plate shear walls <b>with</b> and without <b>cut-outs</b> was explored. The effectiveness of these methods for enhancing the initial stiffness and ultimate load capacity of specimens with no noticeable requirements for increasing flexural stiffness for columns was verified...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigations on reinforced concrete slabs strengthened using fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP). Eight tests were carried out on four two-way slabs, <b>with</b> and without <b>cut-out</b> openings. Investigations on slabs <b>with</b> <b>cut-outs</b> revealed that the FRP can be placed only {{around the edges of the}} cut-out when retrofitting the slabs whereas, in the situation of inserting <b>cut-outs</b> combined <b>with</b> increased demands of capacity, it is necessary to apply FRP components on most of the soffit of the slab. The proposed strengthening system enabled the load and deflection capacities of the FRP-strengthened slabs, in relation to their un-strengthened reference slabs, to be enhanced by up to 121 % and 57 % for slabs <b>with</b> and without <b>cut-outs</b> respectively...|$|R
