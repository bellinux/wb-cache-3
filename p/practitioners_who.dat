The pair was charged with unlicensed broadcasting, and sentenced to 2 and 3 years in prison. Earlier in the same year, another radio station operated by Falun Gong practitioners in Indonesia, Radio Erabaru, was shuttered under diplomatic pressure from China.|$|E

5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals {{found in the}} Wheel of the Year, a tradition that they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other <b>practitioners,</b> <b>who</b> highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E

5|$|With the {{publication}} of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, {{it became clear that the}} vast majority of voluntary organisations would not have been able to access ContactPoint. This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for <b>practitioners</b> <b>who</b> wanted to see who was working with a particular child or young person.|$|E
5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private <b>practitioners,</b> <b>who</b> {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|Heathen festivals {{can be held}} on {{the same}} day each year, {{although}} they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those <b>practitioners</b> <b>who</b> work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things. At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.|$|E

5|$|In June 2002, when Jiang Zemin visited Iceland, Icelandic {{authorities}} {{complied with}} requests from the Chinese government to deny entry to Falun Gong <b>practitioners</b> <b>who</b> sought {{to enter the}} country to protest. Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if they managed {{to make it to}} the country. The blacklisting ignited protests by Icelandic citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating Falun Gong practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E

25|$|If a Falun Gong {{practitioner}} {{refuses to}} be “transformed” in prison or RTL camps, they can be sent directly to transformation centers upon completion of their sentence. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China writes that the facilities “are used specifically to detain Falun Gong <b>practitioners</b> <b>who</b> have completed terms in reeducation through labor (RTL) camps but whom authorities refuse to release.” <b>Practitioners</b> <b>who</b> are involuntarily detained in the transformation centers must pay tuition fees amounting to hundreds of dollars. The fees are extorted from family members {{as well as from}} practitioners’ work units and employers.|$|E
