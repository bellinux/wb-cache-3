This article examines the Israeli use of language and the emphasis on terror, trauma and victimhood as vehicles upon which to mobilize and justify its multi-narrative, collective punishment of the Palestinian. I will identify how this use of language helps to frame Israel’s actions as democratic by acting in defence, a process articulated throughout previous military operations. Such a process is implicit within the dominant political imaginary that constitutes much of the popular discourse that shapes the Israeli relationship with the Palestinian. Thereafter, I will highlight how a number of documentary photographers have sought to challenge the <b>political</b> <b>visibilities</b> related to the Israeli Palestine conflict by attempting to visualize the ongoing ‘catastrophization of Gaza’ before switching my attention to Hebron and the work of the photography collective, Activestills...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the role of {{contemporary}} landscape photography, specifically related {{to the politics of}} visibility, space and belonging in the Occupied Palestinian Territories during the Second Intifada and the formation of visual dead-spaces. By examining the work of Gaston Ickowicz’s landscape series Settlement (2003 - 2006) and Shai Kremer Infected Landscapes (1999 – 2004) I will outline how the Israeli photographers shift the paradigm of spectatorship away from the exemplary visual tropes of the occupation. Firstly, by focusing on what first seem like arbitrary spaces and topological scares including empty houses and car tracks, both photographers invite enquiry and contemplation specifically related to the politics of the space in frame. Through focusing on the indexical signs of human presence, the spectator is asked to consider the history and legitimacy of the mark left and who may of left them. While this will be considered in relation to the on-going occupation, the nationality of the photographers in relation to the authority of looking and seeing and their choice of framing, my overarching aim is to introduce my notion of a ‘dead space’. Secondly, through a comparative reading of Alan Cohen’s seminal project ‘On European Ground’ (2001), I examine how both Israeli photographers record the historical and on-going struggle of the occupation expressly through the relationship between landscapes and the temporal presence upon it. As each photographer documents the landscape I will argue that the spectator begins to read the images through a gesture of identification that symbolises the emptiness as a direct relationship to the politics ‘on the ground’. Under the context of the Israeli occupation, the temporality associated with space, time and identity becomes identifiable through the specific function of the landscape in question. By producing new <b>political</b> <b>visibilities,</b> the shift in spectatorship produced by the critical photography can be understood as a dead-space: a space that functions as lost, contested or in permanent flux. By recording the overwhelming emptiness, absence, and silence within the frame the significance of a place becomes evident in the subtle detail...|$|R

40|$|The general patriarchal {{character}} of the media aligns with the logic of commercialism which prioritizes profit and restricts the diversity of news content in favour {{of those who have}} the means of purchase. It explains why there is a male preponderance in media ownership, staffing and content consumption especially in Nigeria where women have access to, and appear in, the news far fewer times than men. This provokes a question: Does low content consumption by women influence the way media report them? This paper unravels these two variables within a political context. Content assessment and respondents’ rating of Nigeria’s dominant print media (1999 - 2003) shows a robust political reporting but with a gender differential that is heavily skewed towards men. Focus group evaluations of the situation show a connection between women’s low visibility in the news and inconsequential access to content. One evaluation attributes the scenario to unconscious reporting! That brings to the fore journalistic consciousness-raising as a critical factor, among others, in media performance.

In a decision-making similar to the Tu-144 story, the Soviet government introduced the Tu-104 into passenger service before satisfactory stability and controllability had been achieved. During high-altitude and high-speed flight the aircraft was prone to longitudinal instability, and also at high altitudes, it had a narrow range of angle of attack separating the aircraft from stalls known as Coffin corner (aerodynamics). These problems created the preconditions for spin dives, that happened twice before the Tu-104 was eventually properly tested and the problem was resolved.|$|E

The system problems are at least as intractable as the chronic illnesses themselves. Organizing and financing care of patients with comorbities is complicated. At issue are the ways in which we admin-ister mental health and alcohol and drug treatment as well as finance that care. Separate administrative divisions and funding pools, while appropriate for <b>political</b> expediency, <b>visibility,</b> and administrative effi-ciency, have compounded the prob-lems inherent in serving persons with multiple disabilities.

These parties’ position towards the process of European integration can help to identify some possible future scenarios for the EU. In fact, as the hope for a ‘Europe of the Regions’ has faded away and nation states’ role is still strong, it remains to explain what these parties expect from Europe. Whereas scholars agree that ethno-regionalist parties are generally in favour of the European integration, there is no consensus on why this happens. Our research hypothesis is that their support towards the EU depends more on short-term benefits in terms of <b>political</b> opportunities: <b>visibility,</b> funds, offices, networks, policies (a ‘tactical Europeanism’), rather than a wider functional ‘strategic Europeanism’, and so far from a principled and genuine 'identity Europeanism'. To test the hypothesis, we use a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews with members of both Europhile and the few Eurosceptical ethno-regionalist parties, EU Commission’s officers and staff working closely at regional and parliamentary level with those parties. Crossing and comparing their answers we are able to recognize the kind of party support for EU and this way to understand whether their attitude can favourite or obstruct the European integration...|$|R
