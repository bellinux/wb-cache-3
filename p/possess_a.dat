5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> fovea.|$|E
5|$|Most serpins are {{protease}} inhibitors, targeting extracellular, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> nucleophilic serine residue in a catalytic triad {{in their}} active site. Examples include thrombin, trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease's catalytic mechanism.|$|E

While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.|$|E
