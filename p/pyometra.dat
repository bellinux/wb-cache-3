5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{not common}} in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (<b>pyometra,</b> infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (<b>pyometra</b> or hematometra).|$|E
25|$|Stump <b>pyometra</b> is {{a serious}} health {{condition}} that may occur in female dogs that underwent ovariohysterectomy (spaying), particularly if there is residual functional ovarian tissue. In this condition, the remaining stump of the resected uterus becomes infected and filled with a purulent fluid. The symptoms {{are similar to those}} of true <b>pyometra.</b> The risk of this condition is significantly reduced if no ovarian tissue remains from the original ovariohysterectomy. Diagnosis of a stump <b>pyometra</b> may be challenging as <b>pyometra</b> is often discounted as a possibility if the dog has been previously spayed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyometra</b> (or a pus filled womb) ('Pyo' = pus; 'metra' = uterus or womb) is a {{life-threatening}} condition that requires emergency veterinary treatment. The {{risk of a}} non-spayed bitch developing <b>pyometra</b> by age 10 is 25% across all breeds, but can {{be as high as}} 54% in some breeds. The treatment of choice for a closed-pyometra (where the cervix is closed and the pus cannot drain) is admission to hospital, commencement on intravenous fluids and appropriate antibiotics and, once stable enough for the anaesthetic and surgery, emergency removal of the infected pus-filled uterus. Medical management can be attempted if the animal's condition allows (for example {{in the case of an}} 'open' <b>pyometra</b> where the pus drains per-vaginum from the uterus via the open cervix) or dictates (where the animal is too old or otherwise unwell to withstand surgery), if the owner wishes to keep the dog entire to breed or if the owner is unable to afford the veterinary fees associated with surgery. Emergency removal of the infected uterus carries a much higher degree of risk of death than a routine 'spay' operation. The risk of death from in dogs undergoing surgical treatment for <b>pyometra</b> is up to 17%. Thus the risk of death in entire female dogs from a <b>pyometra,</b> even if given correct veterinary attention can be up to 9% by 10 years of age (17% of 54%). This risk is reduced to virtually zero if spayed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyometra</b> is an {{infection}} of the uterus. It is a common and potentially fatal condition in dogs. The main risk period for a female is for eight weeks after her peak standing heat (or estrus cycle) has ended.|$|E
25|$|Glomerulonephritis* is the {{presence}} of immune complexes in the glomerulus, resulting in leakage of protein into the urine. It can be caused by cancer, heartworm disease, <b>pyometra,</b> rickettsial infection, or systemic lupus erythematosus. It can result in chronic kidney failure, hypoalbuminemia, which can cause ascites and peripheral edema, and nephrotic syndrome, which can cause hypertension or hypercoagulability.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and <b>pyometra).</b> Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying cause, if any.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most obvious}} symptom of open <b>pyometra</b> is a {{discharge}} of pus from the vulva in a female that {{has recently been}} in heat. [...] However, symptoms of closed <b>pyometra</b> are less obvious. [...] Symptoms of both types include vomiting, loss of appetite, depression, and increased drinking and urinating. [...] Fever is seen {{in less than a}} third of female dogs with <b>pyometra.</b> [...] Closed <b>pyometra</b> is a more serious condition than open <b>pyometra</b> not only because there is no outlet for the infection, but also because a diagnosis of closed <b>pyometra</b> can easily be missed due to its insidious nature. [...] Bloodwork may show dehydration and/or increased white blood cell count. X-rays will show an enlarged uterus, and ultrasound will confirm the presence of a fluid filled uterus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pyometra,</b> uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, and {{testicular}} cancer are prevented, as the susceptible organs are removed, though stump <b>pyometra</b> may still occur in spayed females.|$|E
2500|$|Females {{that have}} {{received}} estradiol as a mismating shot (abortifacient) in diestrus {{are at risk}} for more severe disease because estrogen increases the number of progesterone receptors in the endometrium. 25 percent of females receiving estradiol in diestrus develop <b>pyometra.</b> [...] <b>Pyometra</b> is less common in female cats because progesterone is only released by the ovaries after mating. Also in cats, the risk of developing the disease differ depending on breed.|$|E
2500|$|If the cervix is open, the {{infected}} material {{can leave the}} body, and this is far easier and safer to treat. [...] This is known as open <b>pyometra.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pyometra</b> or pyometrea is a uterine infection. Though {{it is most}} {{commonly}} known as a disease of the unaltered female dog, {{it is also a}} notable human disease. It is also seen in female cattle, horses, goats, sheep, swine, cats (queens), rabbits, hamsters, ferrets, rats and guinea pigs. <b>Pyometra</b> is an important disease to be aware of for any dog owner because of the sudden nature of the disease and the deadly consequences if left untreated. [...] It has been compared to acute appendicitis in humans, because both are essentially empyemas within an abdominal organ.|$|E
2500|$|If the cervix {{is fully}} closed, {{there is no}} {{discharge}} from the vulva, and like in appendicitis, the uterus may rupture and pus escapes into the abdomen, causing peritonitis and possible rapid death. [...] This is known as closed <b>pyometra.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Spaying (ovariohysterectomy) {{completely}} and promptly removes the infection, prevents uterine rupture and peritonitis, {{and of course}} prevents recurrence, in most cases. [...] Spayed animals do very rarely develop <b>pyometra</b> in the uterine stump. [...] Even so, ovariohysterectomy is currently considered {{the most effective and}} safest treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The risk of {{developing}} <b>pyometra</b> differs between dog breeds. <b>Pyometra</b> {{is a result of}} hormonal and structural changes in the uterus lining. [...] This can happen at any age, whether she has bred or not, and whether it is her 1st or 10th heat (although it becomes more common as the dog gets older). [...] The main risk period for a female is for eight weeks after her peak standing heat (or estrous cycle) has ended. Normally during this period, the cervix, which was open during her heat, begins to close, and the inner lining begins to adapt back to normal. [...] However, cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) [...] known as cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) [...] may occur at this time for some animals, as an inappropriate response to progesterone.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment of <b>pyometra</b> is quick action to provide supportive care. [...] Female dogs are often septic and in shock (see septic shock). Intravenous fluids and antibiotics should be given immediately. Once the female dog has been stabilized, then the treatment of choice is an emergency spay.In Livestock the treatment of choice for minor cases is Dinopost Tremethamine (Lutalyse). Supportive antibiotic treatment may be recommended also. Severe cases require surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Neutering {{is usually}} {{performed}} to prevent breeding, prevent unwanted behavior, or decrease risk of future medical problems. [...] Neutering is also performed {{as an emergency}} procedure to treat certain reproductive diseases, like <b>pyometra</b> and testicular torsion, and {{it is used to}} treat ovarian, uterine, and testicular cancer. [...] It is also recommended in cases of cryptorchidism to prevent torsion and malignant transformation of the testicles. Please see spaying and neutering {{for more information on the}} advantages and disadvantages of this procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} in dogs {{are usually not}} contagious from dog to dog; instead they are usually the result of wound colonization, opportunistic infections secondary to decreased resistance (often the result of viral infections), or secondary to other conditions (pyoderma secondary to skin allergies or <b>pyometra</b> secondary to cystic endometrial hyperplasia). [...] These examples are not considered infectious diseases {{because they do not}} satisfy Koch's postulates - for example Staphylococcus intermedius, a commonly isolated bacteria from skin infections in dogs, would not cause pyoderma when introduced to a healthy dog. [...] In all likelihood that type of bacteria is already present on the skin of a healthy dog.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{diseases}} affecting dogs include endocrine diseases, immune-mediated diseases, {{and reproductive}} diseases. [...] Diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, and hypothyroidism {{are the most}} common endocrine diseases. [...] Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a devastating disease that causes severe anemia in dogs through destruction by the immune system. [...] It has been associated with vaccinations and certain drugs, although many cases are idiopathic. [...] A similar but less severe immune disease is immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, characterized by destruction of platelets by the immune system. [...] Clinical signs include bruising and petechiae (pinpoint bruising, often seen in the mouth). [...] Common reproductive diseases include <b>pyometra</b> (distension of the uterus with pus), mammary tumors, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E
2500|$|Spaying and neutering — According to a {{study by}} the British Veterinary Association (author AR Michell is the {{president}} of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons), [...] "Neutered females lived longest of dogs dying of all causes, though entire females lived longest of dogs dying of natural causes, with neutered males having the shortest lifespan in each category." [...] Neutering reduces or eliminates the risk of some causes of early death, for example <b>pyometra</b> in females, and testicular cancer in males, as well as indirect causes of early death such as accident and euthanasia (intact dogs roam and tend to be more aggressive), but there might increase the risk of death from other conditions (neutering in cited paper only showed an increase in the risk for prostate cancer but has not been repeated in subsequent papers) in males, and neutered males might have a higher rate for urinary tract cancers such as transitional cell carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Caution should be used when interpreting the results of these studies. This is especially important when you consider the frequency of transitional cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma in a male dog versus the chance an intact male dog will succumb to death from roaming (hit by car or other injuries), benign hyperplasia of the prostate causing prostatic abscesses or inability to urinate (causing euthanasia if this does not resolve with therapy) or euthanasia due to fighting or aggression.|$|E
