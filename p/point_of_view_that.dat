5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque style {{dominated}} the Polish culture from the 1580s, {{building on the}} achievements of the Renaissance and for a while coexisting with it, to the mid 18th century. Initially Baroque artists and intellectuals, torn between the two competing views of the world, enjoyed wide latitude and freedom of expression. Soon however the Counter-Reformation instituted a binding <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> invoked the medieval tradition, imposed censorship in education and elsewhere (the index of prohibited books in Poland from 1617), and straightened out their convoluted ways. By the middle of the 17th century the doctrine had been firmly reestablished, sarmatism and religious zealotry had become the norm. Artistic tastes of the epoch were often acquiring an increasingly Oriental character. In contrast with the integrative tendencies of the previous period, the burgher and nobility cultural spheres went their separate ways. Renaissance publicist Stanisław Orzechowski had already provided the foundations for Baroque szlachta's political thinking.|$|E

40|$|Abortion {{is illegal}} in most Latin American countries, {{although}} there are some attenuating and exonerating causes in its practice. However, studies performed in countries with liberalizing processes for more than two decades, such as the United States, show the persistence of different attitudes towards abortion, which go from <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> are pro-life to <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> are pro-choice. Based on Latinobarómetro 2007, this paper analyzes the attitudinal patterns of individuals towards abortion, with emphasis on its degree of justification according to socio-economic features, faith and religion, as well as the countries’ own characteristics. Ordinary least squares estimates for 18 Latin American countries show that men under 40, agnostic, highly educated and with socioeconomic access are those that justify abortion the most; likewise, Uruguay —particularly its female population— is the country where it is most justified...|$|R

25|$|Boromir's {{attempts}} {{to gain the}} Ring for himself {{have been described as}} well-intentioned but oblivious of the potential danger. His perception of Middle-earth is biased by a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> imagines that divine powers have chosen Gondor to lead the fight against evil. He is always eager to praise the great deeds of Gondor, including his own. When his hubris eventually leads him into attacking Frodo to seize the Ring, Boromir seals his own doom by giving in to the malign power of the Ring. He makes way thereby for Aragorn to become the future king of Gondor, {{in a manner similar to}} Virgil's character Turnus.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the medical}} considerations, Jehovah Witnesses {{advocate}} that physicians should uphold {{the right of a}} patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out {{of his or her own}} requests. However, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.|$|E
25|$|Modern New Testament {{scholarship}} {{tends to}} view these not as separate statements, but rather one statement that has either been preserved {{in two different}} forms, or has been altered by the Gospel writers to present a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> expresses {{the needs of the}} Christian community at the time. The Gospel of Mark, generally considered the earliest of the Gospels, presents the 'inclusive' formulation, in association with an account of Jesus rebuking his followers for stopping someone from carrying out exorcisms in his name. The Gospel of Matthew has the other, 'exclusive' version, preceded by a story about a strong man; the Gospel of Mark also includes this story, but without the concluding observation. The Luke version presents both versions. There is still lively discussion about which version is the more authentic, see also the Jesus Seminar.|$|E

25|$|EEG tracings from volunteers during orgasm {{were first}} {{obtained}} by Mosovich and Tallaferro in 1954. These research workers recorded EEC changes resembling petit mal or the clonic {{phase of a}} grand mal seizure. Further studies in this direction were carried out by Sem-Jacobsen (1968), Heath (1972), Cohen et al. (1976), and others. Sarrel et al. reported a similar observation in 1977. These reports continue to be cited. Unlike them, Craber et al. (1985) failed to find any distinctive EEG changes in four men during masturbation and ejaculation; the authors concluded that {{the case for the}} existence of EEG changes specifically related to sexual arousal and orgasm remained unproven. So disagreement arises as to whether the experiment conducted by Mosovich & Tallaferro casts a new light on the nature of orgasm. In some recent studies, authors tend to adopt the opposite <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> there are no remarkable EEG changes during ejaculation in humans.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Boeing {{started to}} study surface-to-air guided {{missiles}} under the United States Army Air Forces project MX-606. By 1950, Boeing had launched more than 100 test rockets in various configurations, {{all under the}} designator XSAM-A-1 GAPA (Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft). Because these tests were very promising, Boeing received a USAF contract in 1949 to develop a pilotless interceptor (a term then used by the USAF for air-defense guided missiles) under project MX-1599. The MX-1599 missile {{was to be a}} ramjet-powered, nuclear-armed long-range surface-to-air missile to defend the Continental United States from high-flying bombers. The Michigan Aerospace Research Center (MARC) was added to the project soon afterward, and this gave the new missile its name Bomarc (for Boeing and MARC). In 1951, the USAF decided to emphasize its <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> missiles were nothing else than pilotless aircraft by assigning aircraft designators to its missile projects, and anti-aircraft missiles received F-for-Fighter designations. The Bomarc became the F-99.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; {{they want to}} move away from a research <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality. College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.|$|E
