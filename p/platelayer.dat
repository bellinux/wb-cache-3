25|$|Maintenance was {{originally}} organized with under two track masters, one in Åndalsnes {{and one in}} Dombås, and subdivided into 17 divisions. Each division had two employees, a <b>platelayer</b> foreman and a <b>platelayer,</b> in addition to four seasonal workers during the summer. Each division had a railway-owned house for {{the family of the}} two platelayers. Later the areas were merged to a single track master in Åndalsnes. During the Second World War, the line was bombed by Germany. This caused among other things the restaurant at Bjorli to burn down.|$|E
25|$|The Dumfries train started {{breaking}} when it {{had just}} passed under the Paisley Road bridge (nowadays the A761 road). When it stopped the guard attempted to unlock the doors of an overturned coach, and a <b>platelayer</b> started back to warn any following train.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the main dam at Scar House finally severed the line to Angram in 1933. By 1936, with construction completed, the railway was lifted, and a sale was held at Pateley Bridge on 1 March 1937, where everything was sold as a single lot. The staff of the Nidd Valley Light Railway were laid off, and although their jobs did not qualify for a pension, pensions were paid to G Pearson, {{who had worked for}} the company as a locomotive driver for 30 years, and to J Brown, who had been a <b>platelayer</b> for 20 years. Pensions were also to be paid to another <b>platelayer</b> and the locomotive fireman on reaching the age of 65. At its peak, the Scar House reservoir project had employed about 780 men, and the population of Scar Village had been 1,135. By 1936, there were just eight houses occupied, and seven pupils at the school, which closed on 31 January 1938.|$|E

25|$|The railway has a Permanent Way team, with a {{full-time}} staff of <b>platelayers.</b> It forms {{part of the}} larger Engineering Department. Some <b>platelayers</b> work all year round, whilst others are diverted to other seasonal employment within the engineering department, for example as summer drivers, when more drivers are required than during the out of season periods. Additionally, the permanent way team is strengthened on many days of the year, especially in the winter months, by volunteer workers.|$|R
25|$|Hostage Martin Cherry, an old <b>platelayer</b> of the district, {{was found}} dying from a groin {{wound in the}} {{outhouse}} or kitchen, immediately behind the main building. He was promptly taken from the burning hotel and laid on the ground, where Father Gibney administered the last sacrament. Cherry was insensible, and barely alive. He succumbed within half an hour. He was fortunate to not have burned alive. He {{seemed to have been}} unintentionally shot by the attacking force.|$|E

50|$|The reconvened enquiry {{therefore}} {{found that}} the <b>platelayers</b> had rashly loosened the rail fastening and {{had been unable to}} make good their mistake in time.|$|R
25|$|The <b>platelayers</b> {{had an old}} van {{bodies as}} a hut at Eastry, two small huts by Wingham Engineering works and another by the old Guilford {{junction}} at Eythorne.|$|R
6000|$|My bias rules me {{altogether}} here. I see men in social, {{in economic}} and {{in international affairs}} alike, eager {{to put an end}} to conflict, inexpressibly weary of conflict and the waste and pain and death it involves. But to end conflict one must abandon aggressive or uncordial pretensions. Labour is sick at the idea of more strikes and struggles after the war, industrialism is sick of competition and anxious for service, everybody is sick of war. But how can they end any of these clashes except by the definition and recognition of a common end which will establish a standard for the trial of every conceivable issue, to which, that is, every other issue can be subordinated; and what common end can there be in all the world except this idea of the world kingdom of God? What is the good of orienting one's devotion to a firm, or to class solidarity, or La Republique Francais, or Poland, or Albania, or such love and loyalty as people profess for King George or King Albert or the Duc d'Orleans--it puzzles me why--or any such intermediate object of self-abandonment? We need a standard so universal that the <b>platelayer</b> may say to the barrister or the duchess, or the Red Indian to the Limehouse sailor, or the Anzac soldier to the Sinn Feiner or the Chinaman, [...] "What are we two doing for it?" [...] And to fill the place of that [...] "it," [...] no other idea is great enough or commanding enough, but only the world kingdom of God.|$|E

5000|$|... 16 December 1864 - a {{collision}} near Blackheath. A ballast train had divided in a tunnel, and an express passenger train {{was allowed to}} enter due to an error by a signalman. Five <b>platelayers</b> were killed.|$|R

60|$|MACKESY. If a man's once {{taken that}} way nothing will hold him, Do you {{remember}} Benoit of your service, Doone? They transferred him to Tharanda when his time came, and {{he married a}} <b>platelayer's</b> daughter, or something of that kind. She was the only female about the place.|$|R
50|$|In 1858 the NER built six {{pairs of}} <b>platelayers</b> cottages along the Whitby branch {{to the design}} of their {{architect}} Thomas Prosser. The pair still standing adjacent to the level crossing are the only survivors of the southernmost three pairs of cottages built for £99 each by Henry Creaser of York.|$|R
50|$|In British usage {{the term}} platelayers' hut {{refers to a}} lineside shelter in which a <b>platelayer</b> would {{historically}} be based. In the heyday of steam railway operation a <b>platelayer</b> might be assigned to each mile or two miles of track, with a platelayers' hut as his shelter and working base. He would regularly patrol his section of track. In modern railway operation platelayers tend to operate in mobile teams, and the lineside of the British railway network still includes {{a large number of}} abandoned and generally dilapidated platelayers' huts. Platelayers' huts were generally a single room, immediately adjacent to the running lines, equipped with a table, chairs, and a simple heating stove.|$|E
50|$|The Dumfries train started {{breaking}} when it {{had just}} passed under the Paisley Road bridge (nowadays the A761 road). When it stopped the guard attempted to unlock the doors of an overturned coach, and a <b>platelayer</b> started back to warn any following train.|$|E
50|$|The former {{post office}} was once two cottages; {{in the part}} that was later the shop lived George Hippey, a <b>platelayer.</b> He fell foul of the {{landlord}} and one day threw paraffin under the front door, hastily followed by a lighted match.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} enquiry {{found that}} the derailment occurred at a trailing crossover which was being worked on by three <b>platelayers.</b> The three maintained they had just been clearing and repacking the ballast which would not have impaired {{the stability of the}} track; and the only contributing cause was the high speed of the train.|$|R
50|$|In 1852 {{a branch}} of the Pensnett railway opened to serve Saltwells Colliery, passing through Mushroom Green. A <b>platelayer’s</b> hut shows up on maps from 1884, {{adjacent}} to the Griff Chains chainshop established in 1865. Although demolished in the 1980s it was carefully rebuilt in an adapted form in 1992 and has a use as a garage and outbuilding.|$|R
50|$|Roger Perrin {{then changed}} his story: it was Faustin Roure, {{who led the}} team of <b>platelayers</b> at Lurs railway station, who had {{informed}} him of the murders when he stopped by at the Perrins’ farm. When Roure was subsequently questioned, he denied this, though he later admitted in the witness box at the murder trial that Perrin’s account was indeed true.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} in Tuamarina near Blenheim in Marlborough, the {{youngest}} of four daughters of John and Julia Duggan. They were both from County Kerry, Ireland, and had married in Wellington on 7 October 1885. John was a <b>platelayer</b> on the New Zealand Railways.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>platelayer</b> (British English) or {{trackman}} (American English) is {{a railway}} employee {{whose job is}} to inspect and maintain the permanent way of a railway installation. [...] The term [...] "platelayer" [...] derives from the plates used to build plateways, an early form of railway.|$|E
50|$|A plaque at {{the station}} commemorates Alexander Anderson, the poet from Kirkconnel, who rose from being a railway worker to become Chief Librarian at Edinburgh University. He was a surfaceman or <b>platelayer</b> on the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and {{generally}} wrote {{under the name of}} Surfaceman.|$|E
50|$|The track {{had been}} laid with the {{cheapest}} materials at {{the advice of the}} engineer Thomas Bouch, and already in 1858 it was giving trouble, being in need of major renewal. The routine maintenance was carried out by <b>platelayers</b> with the assistance of a labourer, each responsible for about two miles of route. In August 1860 all the wooden bridges on the line were tarred and repainted.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] "policeman" [...] (i.e. {{a railway}} {{employee}} stationed {{to control a}} level crossing and regulate trains) was on duty at Berryknowes Road level crossing, and he had exhibited a green hand signal, meaning [...] "caution", to {{the driver of the}} Greenock train. The driver shut off steam but evidently continued coasting, and following the Dumfries train closely, he saw the <b>platelayer's</b> warning too late, and collided with the Dumfries train.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} located where the Warmsworth to Sprotborough road crosses the line over the deep {{limestone}} cutting and {{was approached by}} a covered flight of 66 steps to the Sheffield-bound platform. The station had two flanking platforms and a small wooden shelter which served as both ticket office and waiting room. Following {{the closure of the}} station on 1 January 1875 this structure served as a <b>platelayers</b> hut until the mid-1950s.|$|R
