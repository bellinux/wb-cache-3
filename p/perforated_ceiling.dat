50|$|In 1951, DAMPA {{developed}} the first <b>perforated</b> metal <b>ceiling</b> in the world. In 1959, the company's name {{was changed to}} Chicago Metallic Corporation. In the 1970s, in collaboration with a Danish shipyard, the DAMPA Marine Ceiling Systems were developed, which were the most successful new product launch in the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Repeating {{patterns}} in architecture are utilized in elements {{at a variety}} of scales; scale of a facade, <b>perforated</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and wall reliefs to carpeting and tile stonework. The Truchet tiling concept can now be reconsidered as one means to develop a modular non-repeating pattern. This paper explores some of the basic concepts of Truchet tilings and variations developed; and some current examples of using these methods with digital generation and fabrication methods. Background A number of formal repeating pattern concepts and system exist for designers and architects to utilize. They may as simple as uniform tilings and patterns, frieze and wallpaper groups, or complex as systems that can use randomness for placing individual patterns. Grunnbaum and Shephard offer a comprehensive and systematic treatment of the subject [1]. With the greater introduction of digitally based generative systems, algorithmically generated patterns, and greater means of digitally controlled fabrication, the concept of many-of-one is becoming one-of-many. As real-time steaming fabrication evolves, the need for non-repeating patterns will be easier to satisfy. a. b. c...|$|R
5000|$|The {{structural}} frame is of rough reinforced concrete. The {{panes of glass}} located on the three exterior faces, the so-called [...] "pans de verre ondulatoire" [...] ("undulating glass surfaces"), were designed by Xenakis, and {{are similar to those}} of the Secretariat at Chandigarh on which Xenakis also worked. On the other hand, in the garden-court of the cloister, the fenestration is composed of large concrete elements reaching from floor to <b>ceiling,</b> <b>perforated</b> with glazed voids and separated from one another by [...] "ventilators": vertical slits covered by metal mosquito netting and furnished with a pivoting shutter. The corridors leading to the dwelling cells are lit by a horizontal opening located under the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|The {{fresh air}} comes {{in through the}} air inlet of the AC unit. The {{conditioned}} air is transported in heat insulated aluminum ducts mounted below the roof and distributed through the <b>perforated</b> <b>ceiling</b> into the passenger room. The return air flows back through openings above the compartment door to the AC unit. The entrance area, toilets and pantry {{are connected to the}} exhaust air system.|$|E
50|$|Internally {{the house}} {{comprises}} 15 main rooms on 3 levels, {{with a wide}} vestibule/hallway running centrally north-south through the house on each level. The floor plans of all 3 levels are almost identical. The principal rooms {{on the ground and}} first floor are over 4 metres in height and have decorative plaster cornices which are perforated or undercut, and <b>perforated</b> <b>ceiling</b> roses (these appear to have been designed to ventilate to the roof or floor cavity above). There is extensive use of cedar joinery throughout, including panelled reveals and carved transoms to the doorways. The hallway on the principal level has tessellated tiles on the floor and corinthian pilasters to the archway separating hall from vestibule. There are 8 fireplaces with marble surrounds and tiles to the hearths, as well as the kitchen flue.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the increase of floor impact sound caused by ceiling air space in test building. Firstly, the change in floor impact sound with and without ceiling air-space was measured. Noise reduction effect of <b>perforated</b> <b>ceiling</b> systems and glass wool at ceiling area was also investigated. It was expected that <b>perforated</b> <b>ceiling</b> systems could reduce air-spring effect in ceiling space. As a result, ceiling air space caused increasement of floor heavy-weight impact sound about 2 ~ 4 dB. On the other hands, <b>perforated</b> <b>ceiling</b> with sound-absorbing materials system could reduced heavy-weight floor impact sound by 3 dB...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to demonstrate the importance of initial strategies in acoustical design of underground metro stations. The paper searches for practical design solutions by evaluating different materials for providing optimum acoustical conditions in such spaces. Acoustical designs of three metro stations on a new expansion line in Ankara including Sogutozu, Bilkent and ODTU metro stations are presented through computer simulation. Predictions of room acoustical parameters are presented for both platform and ticket office floors in terms of parameters like reverberation time (RT), speech transmission index (STI) and A-weighted sound level (SPL) distribution within spaces. Simulated reverberation times are evaluated in view of legislative requirements. The study confirms the importance of using sound absorbing materials on the ceiling and sidewalls together. The nonwoven material, used behind <b>perforated</b> metal suspended <b>ceilings,</b> has proved effective in reverberation control...|$|R
40|$|Wall {{corrections}} as {{a function}} of wall porosity in the transonic wall interference problem was assessed. Effective porosities primarily for the two dimensional case were established as follows: (1) comparison of experimental data for two geometrically similar models of different chord/height ratio, an overall value of wall porosity could be deduced; (2) theoretical development which allows for unequal porosity for the floor and ceiling and wall boundary pressure measurements, porosities for floor and ceiling could be deduced; (3) a scheme was developed which allowed unequal porosity of floor and ceiling and streamwise varying porosity. The boundary layer development along the <b>perforated</b> floor and <b>ceiling</b> {{under the influence of the}} model pressure field, variations in boundary layer thickness underlining the difficulties in deducing meaningful values of wall porosity were determined. Wall boundary pressure measurement, in combination with singularity modelling of the airfoil, was sufficient to yield required information on the wall interference flow without having to establish some value for wall porosity. The singularity modelling of the airfoil initially covered only lift and volume but was extended to include drag and pitching moment, and second order volume term. It is shown by asymptotic transonic small disturbance analysis, that the derived corrections to angle of attack and free stream Mach number are correct to the first order...|$|R
40|$|Particle {{concentration}} in patient rooms at various ventilation rates and with differing methods of air supply {{has been investigated}} experimentally in a specially built test room. The size of the test room corresponded to an ordinary bedroom for two patients. Air was supplied isothermally to this test room, either through induction units or through a <b>perforated</b> <b>ceiling,</b> {{and the number of}} air changes per hour varied from 1 to 16. When the air was supplied by means of induction units, tests with different airflow patterns in the room were also carried out. The principle of the measurements was to estimate the decrease in particle concentration at certain points when the initial concentration was uniform all over the room and no generation took place during the measuring period. Talc powder was used as test dust, and the particle concentration was measured at up to six points in the room with a particle counter...|$|E
