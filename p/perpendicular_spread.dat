40|$|The {{interaction}} of TeV gamma rays from distant blazars with the extragalactic background light produces relativistic electron-positron pair beams by the photon-photon annihilation process. Using the linear instability {{analysis in the}} kinetic limit, which properly accounts for the longitudinal and the small but finite perpendicular momentum spread in the pair momentum distribution function, {{the growth rate of}} parallel propagating electrostatic oscillations in the intergalactic medium is calculated. Contrary to the claims of Miniati and Elyiv (2013) we find that neither the longitudinal nor the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>spread</b> in the relativistic pair distribution function do significantly affect the electrostatic growth rates. The maximum kinetic growth rate for no <b>perpendicular</b> <b>spread</b> is even about an order of magnitude greater than the corresponding reactive maximum growth rate. The reduction factors to the maximum growth rate due to the finite <b>perpendicular</b> <b>spread</b> in the pair distribution function are tiny, and always less than $ 10 ^{- 4 }$. We confirm the earlier conclusions by Broderick et al. (2012) and us, that the created pair beam distribution function is quickly unstable in the unmagnetized intergalactic medium. Therefore, {{there is no need to}} require the existence of small intergalactic magnetic fields to scatter the produced pairs, so that the explanation (made by several authors) of the FERMI non-detection of the inverse Compton scattered GeV gamma rays by a finite deflecting intergalactic magnetic field is not necessary. In particular, the various derived lower bounds for the intergalactic magnetic fields are invalid due to the pair beam instability argument. Comment: accepted by ApJ, 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Relativistic collisionless shocks are {{believed}} to be efficient particle accelerators. Nonlinear outcome of the interaction of accelerated particles that run ahead of the shock, the so-called "precursor", with the unperturbed plasma of the shock upstream, is thought to facilitate additional acceleration of these particles and to possibly modify the hydrodynamic structure of the shock. We explore here the linear growth of kinetic modes appearing in the precursor-upstream interaction in relativistic shocks propagating in non and weakly magnetized plasmas: electrostatic two-stream parallel mode and electrostatic oblique modes. These modes are of particular interest because they are the fastest growing modes known in this type of system. Using a simplified distribution function for a dilute ultra-relativistic beam that is relativistically hot in its own rest frame, yet has momenta that are narrowly collimated in the frame of the cold upstream plasma into which it propagates, we identify the fastest growing mode in the full k-space and calculate its growth rate. We consider all types of plasma (pairs and ions-electrons) and beam (charged and charge-neutral). We find that unstable electrostatic modes are present in any type of plasma and for any shock parameters. We further find that two modes, one parallel (k_= 0) and the other one oblique (k_∼ k_), are competing for dominance and that either one may dominate the growth rate in different regions of the phase space. The dominant mode is determined mostly by the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>spread</b> of the accelerated particle momenta in the upstream frame, which reflects the shock Lorentz factor. The parallel mode becomes more dominant in shocks with lower Lorentz factors (i. e., with larger momentum spreads). We briefly discuss possible implications of our results for external shocks in gamma-ray burst sources...|$|E

50|$|Both {{leaf blade}} and petiole {{structure}} influence the leaf's response to forces such as wind, allowing {{a degree of}} repositioning to minimise drag and damage, as opposed to resistance. Such leaf movement may also increase turbulence of the air {{close to the surface}} of the leaf, which thins the boundary layer of air immediately adjacent to the surface, increasing the capacity for gas and heat exchange, as well as photosynthesis. Strong wind forces may result in diminished leaf number and surface area, which while reducing drag, involves a trade off of also reduces photosynthesis. Thus, leaf design may involve compromise between carbon gain, thermoregulation and water loss on the one hand, and the cost of sustaining both static and dynamic loads.

This model functioned by initially creating a single electron which was then split into several simulated electrons of different directions and energies as the probability of spreading increased. However, this method resulted in a too-large number of simulated electrons, consuming large amounts of computer memory.

40|$|The {{macroscopic}} behaviour of cosmic rays in turbulent magnetic fields is discussed. An implementation of anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays {{with respect to}} the magnetic field in a non-conservative, high-order, finite-difference magnetohydrodynamic code is discussed. It is shown that the standard implementation fails near singular X-points of the magnetic field, which are common if the field is random. A modification to the diffusion model for cosmic rays is described and the resulting telegraph equation (implemented by solving a dynamic equation for the diffusive flux of cosmic rays) is used; it is argued that this modification may better describe the physics of cosmic ray diffusion. The present model reproduces several processes important for the propagation and local confinement of cosmic rays, including <b>spreading</b> <b>perpendicular</b> to the local large-scale magnetic field, controlled by the random-to-total magnetic field ratio, and the balance between cosmic ray pressure and magnetic tension.

40|$|New deep tow sidescan sonar {{data from}} the Southwest Indian Ridge reveal complex volcanic/tectonic interrelationships in the axial zone of this ultra-slow {{spreading}} ridge. While some constructional volcanic features resemble examples documented at the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, such as axial volcanic ridges, hummocky and smooth lava flows, their distribution and dimensions differ markedly. The largest axial volcanic ridges occur at segment centres, but fresh-looking volcanic constructions also occur at segment ends and in the deep basins marking the non-transform discontinuities. The orientations of the dominant fault population and main volcanic ridges are controlled by tectonic processes such as orthogonal extension in the sections of the ridge <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>spreading</b> direction and transtensional extension in the obliquely spreading sections of the ridge. Minor faults and small volcanic ridges striking parallel to the axis in the oblique part of the ridge are not controlled by these extensional regimes. This observation suggests that the ridge axis acts as a zone of weakness and that magmatic processes, with associated fractures opening in response to magma pressure, may control local emplacements of axial volcanic ridges at obliquely spreading ridges. This non-systematic pattern of ridge characteristics suggests an along-axis variation between focused and distributed magmatic supply, a model which is supported by our interpretation of low-amplitude mantle Bouguer anomalies calculated for the area.

We focus on understanding main prospects associated with the novel geometry of the Super-X divertor (SXD). This includes {{a discussion of the}} effect of magnetic flux expansion and volumetric power losses on the reduction of target power loads, the effect of divertor geometry on the divertor closure and distribution of neutral species and radiation in the divertor, the role of the connection length in broadening the target wetted area. A comparison in conditions typical for MAST inter-ELM H-mode plasmas confirms improved performance of the Super-X topology resulting in significantly better divertor closure with respect to neutrals (the atomic flux from the target increased by a factor of 6, but the atomic flux from the divertor to the upper SOL reduced by a factor of 2), increased radiation volume and increased total power loss (a factor of 2) and a reduction of target power loads through both magnetic flux expansion and larger volumetric power loss in the divertor (a factor of 5 - 10 in attached plasmas). The reduction of the target power load by SXD further increases with collisionality (high density or detached regimes) thanks to larger importance of volumetric power losses. It is found that a cold divertor plasma leads to stronger parallel temperature gradients in the SOL which drive more parallel heat flux, meaning that the effectiveness of <b>perpendicular</b> transport in <b>spreading</b> the power at the target can be reduced, and this needs {{to be taken into account}} in any optimisation.

The 21 photometrically confirmed type ab RRLs have mean [Fe/H] = - 1. 79 +/- 0. 08, consistent with the abundances found for RRLs in a different portion of the Sgr tidal debris stream. The distribution of velocities in the Galactic standard of rest frame (V_GSR) of the 26 RRLs in the region is not consistent with a smooth halo population. Upon comparison with the Sgr disruption models of Law et al (2005), a prominent group of five stars having highly negative radial velocities (V_GSR ~ - 175 kms- 1) is consistent with predictions for old trailing debris when the Galactic halo is modeled as oblate. The observations also require that the recent trailing debris stream has a broader <b>spread</b> <b>perpendicular</b> to the Sgr plane than predicted by the models. We have also investigated the possible association of the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS) with Sgr debris by comparing radial velocities for RRLs in the region with the same models, finding similarities in the velocity-position trends. As suggested by our earlier work, the stars in the VSS region with large negative V_GSR values are likely to be old leading Sgr debris, but we find that while old trailing Sgr debris may well make a contribution at positive V_GSR values, it is unlikely to fully account for the VSS feature. Overall we find that further modeling is needed, as trailing arm data generally favors oblate models while leading arm data favors prolate models, with no single potential fitting all the observed data.

40|$|Although {{detachment}} faulting {{is thought}} to be a fundamental, widespread style of accretion of oceanic lithosphere, the kinematic evolution of faulting and the link between deformation and magmatic emplacement are still poorly known. Here we use newly acquired geological and geophysical data from the eastern Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) to address this question. The eastern SWIR displays the widest expanses known to date of seafloor with no evidence for a volcanic upper crustal layer. Deep tow TOBI sidescan sonar images and dredged rock samples were collected over two areas with contrasting styles of non volcanic seafloor. In the first survey area (centered at 62 ° 30 ’E) several broad smooth elongated and symmetric ridges are oriented SW-NE, oblique to the spreading direction (~NS). TOBI images show that the hillsides of these ridges, facing toward and away from the axial valley, correspond to smooth surfaces with mass wasting features and almost no evidence of volcanism. Some of these ridges display highly backscattering fuzzy textures with rounded shape features of unknown origin. Serpentinized mantle-derived peridotites were systematically dredged in those areas. Volcanic textures are only observed at the eastern and western ends of these ridges. The second survey area (centered at 64 ° 35 ’E) covers the edge between volcanic and non volcanic seafloor. There, ridges are <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>spreading</b> direction and display mainly an asymmetric shape. TOBI sidescan sonar images show that the inward facing gentle slope of these ridges are smooth and sedimented surfaces covered locally by small sized volcanic patches. Outward facing slopes are steeper and may be covered with volcanic textures. Serpentinized mantle-derived peridotites were also systematically dredged outside these volcanic areas. We interpret the successive non volcanic ridges as the result of large low angle normal faults which exhume mantle rocks alternatively to the northern and to the southern flank of the SWIR. The occurrence of volcanic terrain on top of the detachment faults questions the relationship between shifts in the polarity of these detachment faults and magmatic emplacements...|$|R

A striking feature of the gravity field is a 20  mGal gravity low, about 20  km wide, which runs through {{the centre of the}} bay with approximately the same trend as the magnetic lineations. The gravity low is associated with a change in crustal structure measured from seismic refraction data and sometimes with a deepening of the sediment-basement interface, reminiscent of a median valley. These results suggest that the magnetic anomalies were produced by sea-floor spreading and that the gravity low marks an extinct spreading centre in Baffin Bay. Comparisons of the magnetic anomaly profiles with a model profile computed for magnetic anomalies 13 – 24 (38 to 60  Ma), show good correlation between the observed and computed anomalies in the time period represented by anomalies 13 – 21, with slow spreading rates of about 0. 3 – 0. 4  cm yr− 1 <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>spreading</b> axis. These results are in reasonable agreement with magnetic anomaly identifications and spreading rates deduced from geophysical data in the Labrador Sea. The direction of plate motion in Baffin Bay is not well defined from the data, but the Labrador Sea data require plate motions at a highly oblique angle to the spreading centre in the bay. Peculiarities of the postulated spreading centre, including the change in crustal structure beneath the gravity low along its strike from south to north, and the decrease in coherence and amplitude of the magnetic anomalies immediately north of the survey area, {{may be the result of}} these very low spreading rates, oblique spreading and changes in spreading direction, or the proximity of this area to the junction with a possible major transform fault through the Nares Strait...|$|R
40|$|Highlights • The Red Sea Rift overall {{morphology}} {{is typical}} for (ultra) slow-spreading ridges. • Distribution of various volcanic morphotypes correlates with mantle temperatures. • <b>Spreading</b> <b>perpendicular</b> ridges indicate stable magma focusing over 8 – 12 My. • Warm mantle under the RSR prohibits {{the occurrence of}} oceanic core complexes. • Specific characteristics of the RSR morphology are related to its young age. Abstract Continental rifting and ocean basin formation is occurring today in the Red Sea, providing a possible modern analogue {{for the creation of}} mid-ocean ridges. Yet many of the seafloor features observed along the axis of the Red Sea appear anomalous compared to ancient and modern examples of mid-ocean ridges {{in other parts of the}} world, making it unclear, until recently, whether the Red Sea is truly analogous. Recent work suggests that the main morphological differences between the Red Sea Rift (RSR) and other mid-ocean ridges are due to the presence and movement of giant, submarine salt flows, which blanket large portions of the rift valley and thereby the oceanic crust. Using ship-based, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry of the central RSR between 16. 5 °N and 23 °N we focus here on the RSR volcanic terrains not covered by salt and sediments and compare their morphologies to those observed along slow and ultra-slow spreading ridges elsewhere. Regional variations in style and intensity of volcanism can be related to variations in volcanic activity and mantle heat flow. The Red Sea oceanic seafloor shows typical features of mature (ultra) slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges, such as 2 nd order discontinuities (overlapping spreading centres) and magma focussing in the segment centres (forming spreading-perpendicular volcanic ridges of thick oceanic crust). The occurrence of melt-salt interaction at locations where salt glaciers blanket the neovolcanic zone, and the absence of large detachment faults are unique features of the central RSR. These features can be related to the young character of the Red Sea and may be applicable to all young oceanic rifts, associated with plumes and/or evaporites. Thus, the RSR falls in line with (ultra) slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges globally, which makes the Red Sea a unique but highly important type example for initiation of slow rifting and seafloor spreading and one of the most interesting targets for future ocean research. ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal {{circulation}} and brittle faulting processes affecting the oceanic lithosphere are usually {{confined to the}} upper crust for oceanic lithosphere created at intermediate to fast spreading rates. Lower crust and mantle rocks are therefore relatively dry and undeformed. However, recent studies at subduction zones suggest that hydration of the oceanic plate is most vigorous at the trench–outer rise, where extensional bending-related faulting affects the hydrogeology of the oceanic crust and mantle. To understand the degree of hydration, we studied the seismic velocity structure of the incoming Nazca plate offshore of southern central Chile (∼ 43 °S); here the deep-sea trench is heavily filled with up to 2 km of sediments. Seismic refraction and wide-angle data, complemented by seismic reflection imaging of sediments, are used to derive a two-dimensional velocity model using joint refraction and reflection traveltime tomography. The seismic profile runs <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>spreading</b> ridge and trench axes. The velocity model derived from the tomography inversion consists of a ∼ 5. 3 -km-thick oceanic crust and shows P wave velocities typical for mature fast spreading crust in the seaward section of the profile, with uppermost mantle velocities as fast as ∼ 8. 3 km/s. Approaching the Chile trench, seismic velocities are significantly reduced, however, suggesting that the structures of both the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle have been altered, possibly due {{to a certain degree}} of fracturing and hydration. The decrease of the velocities roughly starts at the outer rise, ∼ 120 km from the deformation front, and continues into the trench. Even though the trench is filled with sediment, basement outcrops in the outer rise frequently pierce the sedimentary blanket. Anomalously low heat flow values near outcropping basement highs indicate an efficient inflow of cold seawater into the oceanic crust. Hydration and crustal cracks activated by extensional bending-related faulting are suggested to govern the reduced velocities {{in the vicinity of the}} trench. Considering typical flow distances of 50 km, water might be redistributed over most of the trench–outer rise area. Where trapped in faults, seawater may migrate down to mantle depth, causing up to ∼ 9 % of serpentinization in at least the uppermost ∼ 2 km of the mantle between the outer rise and the trench axis...|$|R
40|$|Part I of {{this work}} is {{a study of the}} {{seismicity}} of the Ninetyeast and Chagos-Laccadive Ridges in the Indian Ocean. These two features, in the interior of the oceanic plate, both show unusual seismicity. The mechanisms of these earthquakes were studied using body and surface Waves. This analysis shows that the Ninetyeast Ridge is still an active zone of deformation within the plate, along which substantial relative motion is taking place. The Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, though far less active, shows unusual seismicity in its southern portion. The seismicity on both ridges differs substantially from any previously discussed in the ocean basins. Both features should still be regarded as active today, though they do not fit into the classic ridge-transform-trench classifications. Part II {{of this work}} is a study of the mechanics of oblique and asymmetric seafloor spreading. It proposes that asymmetric seafloor spreading occurs {{as a consequence of the}} relative motion between ridges and slow moving mantle material below. A mechanical model of asymmetric spreading predicts that the trailing flank of a ridge migrating with respect to the mantle spreads fastest. These predictions are tested against published data and found to be in good agreement in most places. Oblique spreading is said to occur at midocean ridges which spread slowly (half rate less than 3 cm/yr), while the <b>spreading</b> is <b>perpendicular</b> at faster <b>spreading</b> ridges. This relation is explored using the ratio of the power dissipated at ridges to that on transform faults to determine the most energetically favorable ridge-transform geometry. The angle of oblique spreading (θ) is approximately related to the spreading rate by sin θ ˜ V^(− 1), in good agreement with observations. Part III of this Work is a study of the attenuation of the longest period normal modes of the earth. The rotationally and elliptically split normal modes of the earth are observed for the 1960 Chilean and the 1964 Alaskan earthquakes by analysis in the time domain. Synthetic seismograms are computed using theoretical results which show the dependence of the amplitude and phase of the singlets on source location, depth, mechanism and the position of the receiver. By comparing these synthetics to the filtered record, the Qs of the longest period spheroidal (_ 0 ^S_ 2 -_ 0 ^S_ 5) and torsional (_ 0 ^T_ 3, _ 0 ^T_ 4) modes can be estimated. In addition, the Q of the fundamental radial mode _O^S_O is measured. ...|$|R
