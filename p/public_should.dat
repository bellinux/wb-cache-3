5|$|In 1997, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up {{a status}} survey and {{conservation}} action plan for dragonflies. This proposes the establishment of protected areas {{around the world and}} the management of these areas to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies. Outside these areas, encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution control and the <b>public</b> <b>should</b> be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the <b>public</b> <b>should</b> be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the <b>public</b> <b>should</b> know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} Parliamentary hearing, Labour Party, NZ First, Green Party and Māori Party {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} order of the questions and said that the <b>public</b> <b>should</b> first be asked whether they want a change, and continue with a second referendum only if they do, or both questions compacted into one referendum, which could potentially save millions of dollars. David Seymour (ACT's representative in the Cross-Party Group) said that the planned order made sense, as the public would need to see the alternative designs before deciding on a change. Professor John Burrows, chair of the Flag Consideration Panel, agreed that familiarity with proposals is a prerequisite for a properly informed decision about them.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessors, the 1913 Act {{deliberately}} omitted {{inclusion of}} inhabited buildings, {{whether they were}} castles or palaces. The catalyst for the 1913 Act had been the threat to Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire. An American millionaire wished to purchase the uninhabited castle, and ship it to the USA in its entirety. To frustrate the proposal, the castle had been purchased and restored by Lord Curzon and thus the export of Lord Cromwell's castle was prevented. The 1913 Act was {{an important step in}} highlighting the risk to the nation's many historic buildings. The Act also went further than its predecessors by decreeing that the <b>public</b> <b>should</b> have access to the monuments preserved at its expense.|$|E

25|$|Statistics is {{increasingly}} {{being taught in}} schools with hypothesis testing {{being one of the}} elements taught. Many conclusions reported in the popular press (political opinion polls to medical studies) are based on statistics. An informed <b>public</b> <b>should</b> understand the limitations of statistical conclusions and many college fields of study require a course in statistics for the same reason. An introductory college statistics class places much emphasis on hypothesis testing – perhaps half of the course. Such fields as literature and divinity now include findings based on statistical analysis (see the Bible Analyzer). An introductory statistics class teaches hypothesis testing as a cookbook process. Hypothesis testing is also taught at the postgraduate level. Statisticians learn how to create good statistical test procedures (like z, Student's t, F and chi-squared). Statistical hypothesis testing is considered a mature area within statistics, but a limited amount of development continues.|$|E
25|$|Gay actor Martin Kurath (Prochnow) who is {{in prison}} {{develops}} a friendship with Thomas Manzoni (Hannawald), the 15-year-old son of the prison warden (Lüönd). The two {{fall in love and}} they both yearn for Kurath's release. This triggers intense indignation in their surroundings. After Kurath is released a year later, Thomas accompanied by Kurath, tells his parents he is a homosexual. His father tells him to leave and never return. Kurath and Thomas move in together and Thomas enrolls in school. Thomas' father, however, then has him arrested and condemned to a brutal reformatory. Kurath obtains a fake passport and poses as a psychology doctoral candidate and helps Thomas escape with him to Germany. They are betrayed by a German homosexual friend of Kurath's who insists, in Kurath's absence, that Thomas become his lover in order to obtain a German residency permit. Thomas does so, but then refuses to sleep with the betrayer, is kicked out and prostitutes himself. Broken by these experiences, he voluntarily returns to the reformatory. When he reaches 21 and is released, he is so psychologically damaged that, despite reunion with Kurath, he attempts suicide and is committed to a psychiatric hospital. He escapes and the film ends with a TV announcement that the police are looking for him and that the <b>public</b> <b>should,</b> if approaching him, treat him gently, as he is very depressed and confused.|$|E

The Smoking Man lies {{to the rest of the}} Syndicate, telling them that Scully's would-be assassin was killed in the car bombing and that the tape has been destroyed with him. Mulder and Scully return to Klemper's greenhouse, finding the Well Manicured Man there. He admits to knowing Mulder's father and states that he helped gather genetic data for post-apocalyptic identification, data Klemper used to work on alien-human hybrids. Samantha was taken to ensure Bill Mulder's silence after he learned of the experiments.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of the {{new body}} heralded the Presidential Council as a step forward in {{enhancing}} the country's democratic spirit. Its establishment was seen as putting a limit on possible dictatorial measures in legislation, which is especially important in a one-party dominated Parliament like Singapore's. Even if the new Council's powers were strictly limited to giving advice, this was justified {{on the basis that}} it would nevertheless serve to alert the <b>public</b> <b>should</b> the Government proceed to enact an Act which prejudices a class of minorities. Indeed, the Constitutional Commission had intended for the Council of State [...] "to fix the attention of the public on any matter originating from Parliament which may adversely affect the interests of any minority group".|$|E

Anarky takes business elites hostage and places them on public trial, broadcast from a pirate television show.

When the explosions take place, it is revealed that the bombs are fake, and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness. One bomb explosion carried a specific message. It unfurled a banner that denounced lethal weapons.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{following}} the fire, the tree's vicinity {{was closed for}} the investigation and for {{an assessment of the}} extent of damage and safety risk. On September27, 2007, the West Virginia Division of Forestry's urban forestry coordinator Bob Hannah and technical specialist Jennifer Brashears engaged in an inspection and evaluation of the tree to provide recommendations. In their report, Hannah and Brashears assessed that the tree's [...] "severe structural weakness" [...] was not caused by the fire, and instead highlighted the tree's [...] "size, age, and severity of defects" [...] as the cause of its instability. They did, however, assess that the fire may have caused further mortality of the tree's cambium. They used various measurements developed by the International Society of Arboriculture and the United States Forest Service to formulate a tree risk assessment. At the time of their investigation, the tree's diameter at breast height was , with 27% of the trunk consisting of open space. Hannah and Brashears also found that one-third of the lower trunk and root crown demonstrated callus formation and no new growth, but instead severe decay and peeling bark. Hannah and Brashears further determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be [...] "considered an extreme hazard" [...] and the <b>public</b> <b>should</b> be [...] "excluded from its striking zone through fencing and signage".|$|E

Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E
