Antifungal effects were tested on the fungi using the procedure {{given in the}} Czech national standard CSN 72 4310 : 1977 - Testing the mould <b>proofness</b> properties of building products and materials. A mixture of the fungi Aspergillus niger, Chaetomium globosum, Penicillium funiculosum, Paecilomyces variotii and Gliocladium virens was used for testing. The scale for evaluating mould <b>proofness</b> properties according to CSN 72 4310 : 1977 is from 0 to 5 in degree of fungi growth, where a value of 0 means that no growth of fungi occurs and the building products and materials possess fungistatic properties. The study confirms the fungistatic propeties of GGBS with mould <b>proofness</b> property 0. The addition of GGBS to cements from 65 wt. % to 95 wt. % ensures the achieving of a fungistatic environment, which enables the production of fungistatic blastfurnace cements CEM III/A 32. 5 N (with GGBS content of 65 wt. %), CEM III/B 32. 5 N and CEM III/C 32. 5 N with mould <b>proofness</b> property 0...|$|E
40|$|In my dissertation, I {{focus on}} {{resource}} reallocation problem. Specifically, I consider {{the housing market}} problem. In this problem, there {{is a group of}} agents and a group of objects. Each agent owns at most one object and each object is owned by at most one agent. Agents have preferences over objects. The goal is to reallocate these objects among agents while satisfying desirable properties; Pareto efficiency (not possible to make someone better-off without making someone worse-off), individual rationality (each agent is assigned an object at least as good as her endowment), strategy <b>proofness</b> (no agent has an incentive to lie) and weak-core selection (no group of agents can trade among themselves such that each of them becomes better-off). In addition, I consider this problem while allowing agents to be indifferent between objects. Recently, favorable results have been established for such problems. It has been proved that Pareto efficient, weak-core selecting (hence, individually rational) and strategy proof rules exist for such problems. I consider additional properties for the housing market problem with indifferences. I show that there are rules which, in addition to the aforementioned properties, satisfy no justified-envy for agents with identical endowments and weak group strategy <b>proofness</b> even though Pareto efficiency and group strategy <b>proofness</b> are incompatible under the assumption of indifferences. I achieve this by providing sufficient conditions for weak group strategy <b>proofness.</b> Then, I propose a procedural enhancement which prioritizes the outcome achieved without violating strategy <b>proofness.</b> I show that some of the existing rules do not satisfy this criterion. So, I propose a new mechanism which satisfies this property in addition to other desirable results. Additionally, I present an amended version of sufficient condition for strategy <b>proofness</b> for housing market problem with weak preferences. I also consider random assignment solutions to housing market problem which is referred to as fractional housing market problem in literature. For general and strict preferences, several impossibility results have been established for such problems. I show that for a restricted class of preferences, trichotomous preferences, these impossibility results do not hold...|$|E

By following a similar line of reasoning to the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theoremin the deterministic framework, we first show that if a decision scheme satisfies strategy <b>proofness</b> and unanimity, then there is an underlying probabilistic neutrality result which generates an additive coalitional power function. This result is then used to prove that a decision scheme which satisfies strategy <b>proofness</b> and unanimity can be represented as a weak random dictatorship. A weak random dictatorship assigns each individual {{a chance to be}} a weak dictator. An individual has weak dictatorial power if the support of the social choice lottery is always a subset of his/her maximal utility set.

One, serial cost sharing (SCS), is budget balanced, individually rational, anonymous and strategy proof. The other two are “hybrid” procedures: voluntary cost sharing with proportional rebates (PCS) and with no rebates (NR). PCS satisfies all these properties except strategy <b>proofness,</b> and NR satisfies all the properties except for strategy <b>proofness</b> and budget balance. However, PCS and NR do not exclude any potential users, and they do not require equal cost shares, thereby overcoming the two main sources of inefficiency with SCS. We characterize the Bayesian Nash equilibria (BNE) of the hybrid mechanisms and conduct laboratory experiments to compare the performance of the three mechanisms. We find that PCS produces significantly more efficient allocations than either SCS or NR...|$|E

30|$|The article investigates certain {{desirable}} and natural properties of SCFs representing resource allocation strategies for interference coupled wireless systems. The property of non-manipulation and Pareto optimality {{of the resource}} allocation strategies is captured by the properties of strategy <b>proofness</b> and efficiency of the SCF, respectively. We introduce the certain {{desirable and}} natural properties of resource allocation strategies, namely (strong) intuitive fairness and non-participation. We prove {{that there are certain}} inconsistencies, among the properties of strategy <b>proofness,</b> efficiency, (strong) intuitive fairness, non-participation, and continuity. These inconsistencies result in certain limitations while having algorithmic implementations and certain analytical investigations of these resource allocation strategies. Hence, it can be observed that non-manipulation and Pareto optimality of the resource allocation strategies are stringent requirements and along with certain other desirable properties is not always implementable. It has been shown that the only permissible SCF representing a resource allocation strategy in interference coupled wireless systems, which can be implemented in either Nash equilibrium or dominant strategy is the trivial constant function.|$|E
