30|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} the cause of differences in the improvement in liquid penetration of <b>precompressed</b> <b>wood</b> species. The maximum amount of water uptake by the capillary rise method and changes in the aspirated pits seen with scanning electron microscopy before and after of preextraction and precompression were investigated using heartwood samples of four softwoods. The height of penetration and the weight by the capillary rise method for preextractive wood powders are discussed. Three wood species andLarix leptolepis showed marked increases in the amount of solution uptake after precompressed treatment only.Larix leptolepis wood required compression after extraction by boiling in water. These differences among wood species were caused by the accumulation of extractive material. It was also recognized that the accumulative material inLarix wood has plasticity and that inPseudotsuga is brittle. Based on these results it was found that it is difficult to destroy aspirated pits in the former and easy in the latter. On the other hand, the difference in penetration of each wood species was caused by the quantity and quality of the extraction material in addition to the extent of the wettability of the surface of the cell cavity as well as aspirated pit.|$|E
