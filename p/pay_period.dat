25|$|The {{operations}} of the 53d WRS were affected by the federal budget sequestration of 2013. Furloughs of personnel, amounting to two days in every <b>pay</b> <b>period</b> per member, resulted in a 20% cut in capability, according to the wing commander of the 403d Wing on 24 July 2013. While sequestration was in effect, this meant the squadron was capable of working only two storms simultaneously at full mission scheduling instead of the normal three, and that pace sustainable only {{for five or six}} days.|$|E
25|$|Minimum wage rates {{vary greatly}} across many {{different}} jurisdictions, {{not only in}} setting a particular amount of money—for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which {{is known as the}} tipped minimum wage), $9.47 in the US state of Washington, or £7.50 (for those aged 25+) in the United Kingdom—but also in terms of which <b>pay</b> <b>period</b> (for example Russia and China set monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage. Currently the American federal minimum wage rests at seven dollars, twenty-five cents ($7.25) per hour. However, some states do not recognize the minimum wage law such as Louisiana and Tennessee. Other states operate below the federal minimum wage such as Georgia and Wyoming. Some jurisdictions even allow employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage levels. India {{was one of the first}} developing countries to introduce minimum wage policy. It also has one of the most complicated systems with more than 1,200 minimum wage rates.|$|E

25|$|During {{his second}} term, Davis built the Sunshine Bridge, the new Louisiana Governor's Mansion, and Toledo Bend Reservoir, all criticized at the time, but later {{recognized}} as {{beneficial to the}} state.

500|$|Jobs {{created a}} {{different}} corporate culture at NeXT {{in terms of}} facilities, salaries, and benefits. Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a [...] "community" [...] with [...] "members" [...] instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid $75,000 while those who joined afterwards were paid $50,000. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever {{took advantage of the}} privilege. NeXT's health insurance plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications. The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time: instead of getting paid twice a month {{at the end of the}} <b>pay</b> <b>period,</b> employees would get paid once a month in advance.|$|E
500|$|Ginsburg dissented in the Court's {{decision}} on Ledbetter v. Goodyear, , {{a case where}} plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter {{filed a lawsuit against}} her employer claiming pay discrimination based on her gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] In a 5–4 decision, the majority interpreted the statute of limitations as starting to run at the time of every <b>pay</b> <b>period,</b> even if a woman did not know she was being paid less than her male colleague until later. Ginsburg found the result absurd, pointing out that women often do not know they are being paid less, and therefore it was unfair to expect them to act at the time of each paycheck. She also called attention to the reluctance women may have in male-dominated fields to making waves by filing lawsuits over small amounts, choosing instead to wait until the disparity accumulates. As part of her dissent, Ginsburg called on Congress to amend Title VII to undo the Court's decision with legislation. Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims, became law. Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.|$|E
