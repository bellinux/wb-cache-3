Cost benefit analysis is a widely used method, in which the investments are mainly assessed through the calculation of their evaluation indicators, namely benefit/cost (B/C) ratios, {{as well as the}} quantification of their financial, technical, environmental and social risks. Herein, a novel approach in the form of risk-based multi-criteria assessment (RBMCA) is introduced, which can be used by decision makers, in order to select the optimum alternative of a waste management project. Specifically, decision makers use multiple criteria, which are based on the cumulative probability distribution functions of the alternatives' B/C ratios. The RBMCA system is used for the evaluation of a waste incineration <b>project's</b> <b>alternatives,</b> where the correlation between the criteria weight values and the decision makers' risk preferences is analyzed and useful conclusions are discussed.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} demand for involving stakeholders {{in the development of}} sustainable civil infrastructure systems. It has been acknowledged that one key element of a project is stakeholder involvement. As such, failure to successfully involve the stakeholders of an infrastructure project in its planning and design can drive the failure of the entire project. However, stakeholder involvement practices are in many cases unsuccessful due to a set of gaps in the following areas: 1) Time of stakeholder involvement: stakeholders are not involved early enough in the project lifecycle; 2) Depth of stakeholder involvement: stakeholders are not adequately and actively involved in generating project alternatives; 3) Transparency and systematicness in decision-making: There is a lack of transparent, systematic methods for conducting stakeholder involvement and accordingly analyzing the different alternatives; and 4) Method of alternative analysis (impact assessment vs. benefit assessment) : In the context of infrastructure planning and design, impact assessment has been utilized in the evaluation of alternatives without incorporating benefit assessment as a major criterion in the analysis. Thus, the focus has been on reducing the negative impacts of infrastructure development without adequate consideration of how to increase the collective benefits to the stakeholders. These gaps indicate the need for improving the stakeholder involvement process. There is a need for a process that engages stakeholders actively and early, as well as uses transparent, systematic, and benefit-centric decision-making methods for conducting stakeholder-centric analysis of <b>project</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Benefit assessment has been in many cases conducted in the form of cost-benefit analysis (CBA). However, a critical analysis of CBA in the context of infrastructure project planning and design (and in particular the evaluation of <b>project</b> <b>alternatives)</b> reveals the following two drawbacks: 1) Overemphasizing cost relative to benefits: The use of CBA has been controversial, because it studies benefits {{in the form of a}} comparison to the costs associated with achieving these benefits. This has been criticized for creating a strong presumption that a decision should not be made (or an alternative should not be selected) unless its benefits outweigh or justify its costs, and therefore overemphasizing cost as a criterion in the assessment and selection of alternatives; 2) Not accounting for the sensitivity of benefit assessment to stakeholders’ viewpoints: Benefit assessment is inherently subjective and sensitive to stakeholders’ opinions/preferences; i. e. benefit assessment is stakeholder-sensitive. Yet, benefit assessment during CBA is, commonly, carried out by analysts as a supposedly neutral, mathematical way of determining the benefits of an alternative; thereby not accounting for its sensitivity to stakeholders’ viewpoints. As such, four main requirements of a stakeholder-sensitive, sustainability-oriented benefit analysis of infrastructure <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> were defined: 1) Avoiding overemphasis on cost as a criterion in the assessment and selection of <b>project</b> <b>alternatives,</b> 2) Addressing the stakeholder-sensitivity of the analysis to account for the fact that each stakeholder benefits differently from an infrastructure project alternative, 3) Addressing fairness in the distribution of potential benefits among stakeholders, and 4) Incorporating sustainability in the benefit analysis, thereby analyzing <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> in terms of their collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to the stakeholders. To address the above requirements, this research developed a semantic system for stakeholder-sensitive benefit analysis of infrastructure <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> to support the development of sustainable civil infrastructure systems. First, a decision-making analysis method for stakeholder-sensitive, sustainability-oriented benefit analysis of infrastructure <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> was developed. The aim of this method is to provide a systematic way for analyzing <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> in terms of their collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to the stakeholders. The method evaluates infrastructure <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> based on a proposed sustainable construction social welfare function (SC-SWF). The SC-SWF is a measure of the collective benefits to all stakeholders. Second, an ontology for stakeholder involvement during infrastructure project planning and design (SI-Onto) was developed. The aim of this ontology is to provide a semantic representation of the proposed analysis method in the form of an ontological model. Third, the decision-making analysis method and the SI-Onto were implemented into a prototype software. The aim of the prototype software is to provide a tool for conducting a stakeholder-sensitive, sustainability-oriented benefit analysis of infrastructure <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> in an automated manner.

Ideas for re-operation <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> were generated using participatory input from ?????. Reallocation and re-operation <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> were simulated on a monthly computation interval over the historical period of record using HEC- 5 and on an hourly timestep over 34 -day probabilistic-based synthetic flood events in HEC-ResSim.

Results show tradeoffs between EAD and water supply reliability in the Feather and Yuba River basins for each project alternative. The study complements ongoing flood protection improvement investigations within the basins and demonstrates a further use of HEC-ResSim and HEC-FIA software for reservoir system simulation, flood impact analysis, and planning studies within the Corps Water Management System (CWMS) software suite.

40|$|When {{infrastructures}} {{projects are}} evaluated, {{it is not}} only important to evaluate them with models that represent the average daily situation, but also to evaluate them in case of irregular situations like incidents. This becomes especially relevant when various <b>project</b> <b>alternatives</b> are expected to show significantly different scores in case of incidents. <b>Project</b> <b>alternatives</b> and their road sections have different topological and geometrical characteristics. The focus of this paper is on the following characteristics: hard shoulders, the number of lanes, parallel road structures and weaving sections. The main question that this paper addresses is how these network characteristics affect both the risk of different types of incidents occurring and the effects of those incidents on the network performance (robustness). In order to answer this question, analytical examples are presented for small theoretical networks that give insight into how the selected characteristics affect the total delay caused by incidents and its dependence on the traffic volume, capacity, severity and duration of incidents.
