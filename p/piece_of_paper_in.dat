25|$|The monument, by Gerard Johnson, {{is mounted}} on a wall above Shakespeare's grave. It {{features}} a bust of the poet, who holds a quill pen {{in one hand and a}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>in</b> another. His arms are resting on a cushion. Above him is the Shakespeare family's coat of arms, on either side of which stands two allegorical figures: one, representing Labour, holds a spade, the other, representing Rest, holds a torch and a skull.|$|E
25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at a crumpled <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>in</b> the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E

In August 2016, Chicago Tribune staffers conducted a cooking test of this recipe and claimed after a few attempts that, with the addition of MSG flavor-enhancer, Ac'cent, they produced fried chicken which tasted [...] "indistinguishable" [...] from the chicken they purchased at KFC.|$|E

2500|$|Hanson's {{trial began}} on December 21, 1840. Hanson's defense attorneys, Franklin Dexter and George T. Curtis, argued that no proof {{had been found}} of Hanson {{purchasing}} and administering poison to Kinney. The prosecution called a servant {{who worked in the}} Kinney household as a witness, and she reported seeing a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>in</b> the kitchen with [...] "poison" [...] written on it, but testimony was not concluded to be ample enough evidence to convict Hanson. During the trial, it was confirmed that Kinney had been treated for syphilis immediately before his death, and arsenic was a well-known medication prescribed to treat venereal disease at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{begins with}} [...] "I Zimbra", whose lyrics {{are based on}} a {{nonsensical}} poem by Dadaist writer Hugo Ball. The sound of lyrics, together with the tribal sound of the song, enhanced by guest star virtuoso guitarist Robert Fripp, gave it an [...] "ethnic" [...] style; Jerry Harrison has said that this song influenced what the band was to do on their next album, Remain in Light. [...] "Cities" [...] details a search for the perfect urban settlement to live in and was borne out of Talking Heads' preferences for urban homes, especially in Manhattan. [...] "Paper" [...] compares a love affair with a simple <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> <b>In</b> [...] "Life During Wartime", Byrne cast himself an [...] "unheroic urban guerrilla", who renounced parties, survived on basic supplies like peanut butter, and heard rumours about weapons shipments and impromptu graveyards. The character is only connected to the imminent collapse of his civilization. Byrne considered the persona [...] "believable and plausible". [...] "Air" [...] is a protest song against the atmosphere, an idea Byrne does not consider [...] "a joke". Inspired by The Threepenny Opera, the lyricist wanted to create a melancholic and touching track about a person who feels so depressed that even breathing feels painful.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 June 1882, {{the day of}} the {{execution}} of Guiteau for the assassination of President James Garfield, Guiteau announced, after famously dancing his way to the gallows, that he would read a poem that he had written. Guiteau said that he had written the poem, which was entitled [...] "I am Going to the Lordy", at about 10:00a.m. Eastern Standard Time that day. After [...] "stubbing his toe {{on the way to the}} gallows", as he put it to {{the execution}}er, Guiteau read [...] and announced that he would now read a prayer of his own composition. After paraphrasing , Guiteau proceeded to read the poem from a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>in</b> a style described as both [...] "sad and doleful" [...] as well as [...] "high pitched" [...] and [...] "childlike". Guiteau had requested an orchestra to play behind him as he recited his poem, but his request was denied. After completing the first verse in song, Guiteau stopped singing and chanted the rest. Multiple times during the reading, Guiteau's voice would fail and he would begin sobbing, even stopping to lay his head on the shoulder of a man standing by him. Right before the completion of the poem, Guiteau raised his voice even higher into falsetto to deliver the final two lines. As the executioner fitted the hood over Guiteau's head and put the rope around his neck, he held onto the piece of paper on which he had written his poem. As per request with the executioner, Guiteau signaled that he was ready to die by dropping the paper.|$|E
