5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a <b>pick-axe</b> on his foot and breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|It {{consists}} of: a crest (being {{a rising}} sun); over a torse (or wreath) {{of red and}} gold; over a shield (bearing images of a golden fleece, a sailing ship, a <b>pick-axe</b> and shovel and a garb of wheat, all quartered by a southern cross); supporters (being a kangaroo and an emu); all over a motto ("Australia") on a scroll.|$|E
25|$|The corner {{room that}} John Williams had pulled the two {{patients}} into {{was occupied by}} Private Hook and another nine patients. John Williams hacked at the wall to the next room with his <b>pick-axe,</b> as Hook held off the Zulus. A firefight erupted as the Zulus fired {{through the door and}} Hook returned fire – but not without an assegai striking his helmet and stunning him.|$|E
25|$|While {{large scale}} {{reclamation}} {{began in the}} 1850s, the earliest reclamations in Wellington were conducted by private citizens. A popular story of the first reclamation conducted in Wellington was that done by George Bennet. Bennet had arrived in 1848 on the Berenicia and purchased a hilly section at Windy, or Clay Point (what is now the corner of Lambton Quay and Willis Street). At that time, Windy Point was a precipice with a narrow and often impassible path connecting Willis Street to Beach Road (now Lambton Quay). Bennet commenced, to the amusement of neighbours, with <b>pick-axe,</b> shovel and barrow to move earth from the Point, tossing the spoil onto the path and into the harbour, thus widened the track and performing Wellington's first reclamation.|$|E
500|$|William's actions at the Siege of Antioch {{are known}} from the Gesta Francorum, an {{anonymous}} chronicle written by an Italo-Norman eyewitness. The Gesta was very popular in Europe after the crusade, but was considered crudely written by more refined readers. It was later rewritten and expanded by more educated writers, including the French monks Robert and Guibert, {{both of whom were}} eager to add information about French crusaders like William. According to Robert, William [...] "acquired the name of 'Carpenter' because nobody wanted to take him on in battle—-there was no breastplate, helmet or shield which could withstand the shattering impact of his lance or sword." [...] Guibert says that he [...] "was called the Carpenter, not because he was a craftsman in wood, but because he prevailed in battle like a carpenter, by cutting men down", and has Bohemond ask: [...] "what kind of Carpenter did we have, who, like a construction-worker with a <b>pick-axe,</b> hacked away, with lances and swords, at the backs of the Gentiles?" [...] Christopher Tyerman interprets this as William's [...] "skills as a battlefield butcher". Edward Gibbon, apparently misunderstanding Guibert, thought the nickname came [...] "from the weighty strokes of his axe".|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, ALF activists became {{involved}} in the international Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) campaign to close Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), Europe's largest animal-testing laboratory. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors U.S. domestic extremism, has described SHAC's modus operandi as [...] "frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists". ALF activist Donald Currie was jailed for 12 years and placed on probation for life in December 2006 after being found guilty of planting homemade bombs on the doorsteps of businessmen with links to HLS. HLS director Brian Cass was attacked by men wielding <b>pick-axe</b> handles in February 2001, an attack so serious that Detective Chief Inspector Tom Hobbs of Cambridgeshire police said it was only by sheer luck that they were not starting a murder inquiry. David Blenkinsop was one of those convicted of the attack, someone who in the past had conducted actions {{in the name of the}} ALF.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{successfully}} {{forced the}} French from the outlying blockhouse by siege tactics, the Chinese sapped relentlessly towards the French perimeter wall. [...] If they could mine {{the walls and}} collapse sections of the defence perimeter, they could bring their superior numbers to bear by assaulting the French through open breaches. [...] The Chinese intentions were obvious, and the French engineering sergeant Jules Bobillot {{did his best to}} frustrate them. [...] Both the French and the Chinese feverishly dug galleries and counter-galleries. [...] On 11 February a <b>pick-axe</b> blow severed the membrane which separated a French from a Chinese miner, and an underground revolver fight took place. [...] The French tried vainly to flood the Chinese saps, which were lower than theirs. [...] On the evening of 12 February the first Chinese mine was exploded beneath the perimeter wall, but its effect was weakened by the counter-galleries and a subsequent Chinese assault was repelled with heavy losses.|$|E
2500|$|... "knew not the {{invention}} of putting a handle of Wood to their Hammers, but worked with certain Instruments they had made of Copper, mixed {{with a sort of}} fine Brass. Neither did they know how to make Files or Graving-tools, or Bellows for Melting down Metals ... But above all, their Carpenters seemed to be worst provided with Tools; for though ours use many Instruments made of Iron, those of Peru had no other than a Hatchet, and a <b>Pick-axe</b> made of Copper; they neither had Saw, nor Augre, nor Planer, nor any other Tool for the Carpenter's work, so that they could not make Arches or Portals for doors; onely they hewed and cut their Timber, and whitened it, and then it was prepared for their Building: And for making their Hatchets and Pick-axes, and some few Rakes, they made use of the Silversmiths, for as yet they had not attained to the Art of Working in Iron. Nor did they know how to make Nails, or use them, but tied all their timber with Cords of Hemp. Nor were their Hewers of Stone more artificial, for in cutting and shaping their Stones, they had no other Tool, than one made with some sharp Flints and Pebbles, with which they rather wore out the Stone by continual rubbing, than cutting." ...|$|E
60|$|It was now eleven o'clock, and a <b>pick-axe</b> had {{not been}} put into the ground, nor the work marked.|$|E
60|$|So saying, the miner {{threw his}} <b>pick-axe</b> and shovel into the hole, {{and led the}} way towards the colony of Little Creek.|$|E
6000|$|They {{laid the}} <b>pick-axe</b> to the stones [...] And they moved them soon asunder. They shovell'd away the hard-prest clay [...] And {{came to the}} coffin under.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, father," [...] {{said the}} boy, {{dropping}} {{the head of}} his <b>pick-axe</b> on the ice, resting his hands on the haft, and looking up with a flushed countenance.|$|E
60|$|Note. Three things I wanted {{exceedingly}} {{for this}} work, viz. a <b>pick-axe,</b> a shovel, and a wheel-barrow, or basket; so I desisted from my work, {{and began to}} consider how to supply these wants, and make me some tools. As for a <b>pick-axe,</b> I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy: but, the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it; {{but what kind of}} one to make I knew not.|$|E
60|$|We Minute Boys {{could handle}} <b>pick-axe</b> or shovel {{as well as}} any man, and I'll answer for all that they labored most industriously once the work was laid out for them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume {{you mean}} that for a compliment," [...] said Ned, looking up with a smile at the tall, wiry, sun-burnt, red-flannel-shirted, straw-hatted {{creature}} that leaned on his <b>pick-axe</b> beside him.|$|E
60|$|And by {{this time}} we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the <b>pick-axe,</b> {{demolished}} one of them, and then we all got aboard the other {{and set out to}} go round by sea for North Inlet.|$|E
60|$|A grim {{smile of}} {{satisfaction}} played {{for a minute}} on the Captain's rugged face, as {{he glanced at his}} son, who, a short distance ahead, was hacking at the ice with a <b>pick-axe,</b> in company with Alf and Butterface and the Eskimo men.|$|E
6000|$|... "For thee this <b>pick-axe,</b> Henri Meunier! Remember the new roof on thy hut, which thou didst {{build to}} keep the wet off thy wife's bed, who was {{crippled}} with ague--and the heavy impost levied on thee by the tax-collector for this improvement to thy miserable hovel.|$|E
60|$|And this {{put me in}} {{mind that}} I wanted many things, {{notwithstanding}} all that I had amassed together; and of these, this of ink was one; as also a spade, <b>pick-axe,</b> and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread: as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first words}} which Edward uttered were,--"My brother is safe, reverend father--he is safe, thank God, and lives!--There {{is not in}} Corri-nan-shian a grave, nor a vestige of a grave. The turf around the {{fountain}} has neither been disturbed by <b>pick-axe,</b> spade, nor mattock, since the deer's-hair first sprang there. He lives as surely as I live!" ...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, a sound broke {{unexpectedly}} on {{the silence}} of their prison. A dull thud seemed to make itself faintly heard from beyond the thick wall of sand that cut them off from the daylight. Cyril stared with surprise. It was a noise like a <b>pick-axe.</b> Stooping hastily down, he laid his ear against the rail beside the shattered carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. You {{see that}} glacier. Take a <b>pick-axe</b> and wade into it. In a day {{you can have}} a decent groove from top to bottom. See the point? The Chilkoot and Crater Lake Consolidated Chute Corporation, Limited. You can charge fifty cents a hundred, get a hundred tons a day, and have no work to do but collect the coin." ...|$|E
60|$|Archie {{began to}} feel certain tremors. Her eyes were gleaming, and her {{determined}} mouth had become a perfectly straight line of scarlet. It {{was going to be}} difficult to be chatty to this girl. She {{was going to be a}} hard audience. Would mere words be able to touch her heart? The thought suggested itself that, properly speaking, one would need to use a <b>pick-axe.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{site of the}} {{building}} having already been carefully traced out with the <b>pick-axe,</b> the artificers this day commenced the excavation of the rock for the foundation or first course of the lighthouse. Four men only were employed at this work, while twelve continued {{at the site of}} the beacon-house, at which every possible opportunity was embraced, till this essential art of the operations should be completed.|$|E
60|$|They {{found the}} negro {{fisherman}} waiting for them, smoking his pipe in {{the stern of}} his skiff, which was moored {{just in front of}} his little cabin. A <b>pick-axe</b> and spade were lying {{in the bottom of the}} boat, with a dark lanthorn, and a stone jug of good Dutch courage, in which honest Sam no doubt, put even more faith than Dr. Knipperhausen in his drugs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shame on ye all!" [...] cried De Bracy to the {{soldiers}} around him; [...] "do ye call yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their station under {{the walls of the}} castle?--Heave over the coping stones from the battlements, an better may not be--Get <b>pick-axe</b> and levers, and down with that huge pinnacle!"

60|$|After dinner, {{which was}} eaten hurriedly, {{most of the}} miners {{returned}} to their work, and Ned with his friend; {{under the guidance of}} McLeod, went down to the river to be initiated into the mysteries of gold-digging and washing. As they approached several of the claims which their owners were busy working, a Yankee swaggered up to them with a cigar in his mouth, an impudent expression on his face, and a <b>pick-axe</b> on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|After this {{he saw an}} Arab-looking man {{finding the}} stone amongst the {{crumbling}} remains of a brick wall that showed signs of having been burnt, which wall he was knocking down with a <b>pick-axe</b> to allow water to flow down an irrigation channel on his garden. Presently a person who wore a turban and was girt about with a large scimitar, rode by, and to him the man showed, and finally presented the stone, which the Saracen placed {{in the folds of}} his turban.|$|E
60|$|Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings {{about the}} island, {{had found the}} skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; {{he had found the}} treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his <b>pick-axe</b> that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the {{north-east}} angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I was {{in another}} ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and <b>pick-axe.</b> You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{as good as}} Robinson Crusoe any day!" [...] cries father, panting {{and wiping}} his bald forehead. [...] "What a stone! I can't budge it." [...] He stoops again, to conquer, if possible; but the great {{difficulty}} with father is, that the water comes so near to his tucked-up trousers that he cannot put forth his full strength without wetting them; and mother insists that this must not be done. [...] "Come, George and Fred, bring the <b>pick-axe</b> and the iron lever, we must have this fellow out, he's {{right in the middle}} of the pool. Now, then, heave!" ...|$|E
60|$|After pausing here a moment, {{he moved}} on, and {{observed}} a man {{over the way}} standing still and watching him. Instantly Israel was reminded that he had on the dress of an English sailor, {{and that it was}} this probably which had arrested the stranger's attention. Well knowing that his peculiar dress exposed him to peril, he hurried on faster to escape the village; resolving at the first opportunity to change his garments. Ere long, in a secluded place about a mile from the village, he saw an old ditcher tottering beneath the weight of a <b>pick-axe,</b> hoe and shovel, going to his work; the very picture of poverty, toil and distress. His clothes were tatters.|$|E
60|$|Wolfert's heart leaped {{with joy}} at having met with so learned and able a coadjutor. Every thing went on secretly, but swimmingly. The doctor had many {{consultations}} with his patient, {{and the good}} women of the household lauded the comforting effect of his visits. In the meantime, the wonderful divining rod, that great key to nature's secrets, was duly prepared. The doctor had thumbed over all his books of knowledge for the occasion; and Mud Sam was engaged to take them in his skiff {{to the scene of}} enterprise; to work with spade and <b>pick-axe</b> in unearthing the treasure; and to freight his bark with the weighty spoils they were certain of finding.|$|E
60|$|Why, Mrs. Piper has a {{good deal}} to say, chiefly in {{parentheses}} and without punctuation, but not much to tell. Mrs. Piper lives in the court (which her husband is a cabinet-maker), and {{it has long been}} well beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but one before the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live such was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums) as the plaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was reported to have sold himself. Thinks it was the plaintive's air in which that report originatinin. See the plaintive often and considered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family). Has seen the plaintive wexed and worrited by the children (for children they will ever be and you cannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be Methoozellers which you was not yourself). On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a <b>pick-axe</b> from his pocket and split Johnny's head (which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after him close at his eels). Never however see the plaintive take a <b>pick-axe</b> or any other wepping far from it. Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not partial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor grown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing down the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here would tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent).|$|E
60|$|So he went; {{but still}} {{followed}} by Hendrika and Indaba-zimbi, we turned, and, {{walking along the}} bank {{of one of the}} rivers, passed up behind the marble kraals, and came to the quarry, whence the material of which they were built had been cut in some remote age. The pit opened up a very thick seam of the whitest and most beautiful marble. I know another like it in Natal. But by whom it had been worked I cannot say; not by natives, that is certain, though the builders of these kraals had condescended to borrow the shape of native huts for their model. By the way, the only relic of those builders that I ever saw was a highly finished bronze <b>pick-axe</b> which Stella had found one day in the quarry.|$|E
