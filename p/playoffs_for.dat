5|$|Cleveland {{managed to}} right {{the ship in}} 1994. While the quarterback {{situation}} had not stabilized, the defense {{led the league in}} fewest points allowed. The Browns finished 11–5, making the <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in five}} years. The Browns beat the Patriots in a wild-card game, but arch-rival Pittsburgh won a 29–9 victory in the divisional playoff, ending the Browns' season.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the defeat, Gibson was fired, and the Giants lost three out of their last four games to finish out of the <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> the 15th straight season, leading them to let coach John McVay go as well.

5|$|Kiprusoff's play {{remained}} strong {{upon his}} return, {{as he was}} counted on to lead the Flames to the <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in}} eight years. A 1–0 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes clinched a berth in the 2004 <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> the Flames, an achievement which earned Kiprusoff a standing ovation from the Calgary fans. He finished the regular season with a modern NHL record-low GAA of 1.69. His stellar play continued into the playoffs, as he won 15 games, five of them via shutout, leading the Flames to within one victory of a Stanley Cup championship. He was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, awarded to the best goaltender in the League, and was given a one-year, $2.95 million contract for 2004–05 by an arbitrator, an increase in salary of nearly four times his previous contract.|$|E

5|$|The Panthers {{won their}} {{division}} during the 2015–16 season {{and returned to}} the <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> the second time in 16 years, due in part to Luongo's strong play.

Much of the team's success throughout the 2000s was attributed to the trio of general manager Bill Polian, coach Dungy, and quarterback Peyton Manning.|$|E

His 15 points on the year were the third-lowest of his career and his lowest since 2006–07.
