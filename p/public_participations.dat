40|$|MArt et Scien (Urban and Regional Planning), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to describe a pro-active process of <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> in urban planning, motivated {{by a lack of}} planning theory and also available South African legislation to describe how pro-active <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> is achieved in planning practice. Communicative planning theory advises on and describes <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> as being meaningful focussing on consensus between stakeholders. Empirical evidence of such <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> is however scarce, and also a critique against communicative planning theory. South African legislation supports and uses the concept of pro-active <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> but has few practical guidelines to facilitate such a <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> process in planning. The context of <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> in South Africa, in specifically two communities (Khuma and Stilfontein) in the North-West Province was the primary focus in describing a pro-active process of <b>public</b> <b>participation.</b> These two communities that had participated in a previous project where <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> was conducted and most importantly documented were specifically chosen because they represent two different community contexts, with Stilfontein being a community primarily consisting of retired mineworkers and Khuma a community that came into being as a result of forceful removals during the apartheid era. Furthermore the process of <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> that was followed was unique in this project as methods from community psychology were applied to guide communication. The importance of context and communication were identified as the most important aspects when conducting <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> pro-actively. The importance of communication and context should be considered if a pro- active process of <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> is to be conducted. It is a timeous process to consider the context of community members when conducting <b>public</b> <b>participation,</b> but it must be considered by spatial planners. The possibility of multidisciplinary teams facilitating <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> processes in planning should be considered. In this way planners can be assisted when conducting <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> processes. The refinement of legislation describing <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> may also be helpful in attempts to enhance pro-active processes in <b>public</b> <b>participation.</b> Master...|$|R

40|$|From post normal science we have {{learn that}} complex {{environmental}} problems, {{characterized by the}} presence of uncertain outcomes, conflict of values, multiple spatial and temporal scales, and non-equivalent descriptions require the inclusion of some form of public participation in the decision making process, to deal with the existence of multiple legitimate and often confronted perspectives in society. In this context, the combination of multi-criteria evaluation with participatory approaches has emerged as a promising framework for dealing with complex socio-ecological systems. Nevertheless, the inclusion of different standpoints in this framework is still controversial and the issue of weights (i. e. prioritization of criteria) requires further attention. In this paper we analyze the issue of weights in the context of SMCE framework and present a new proposal that permits the search of a sound decision in the presence of incommensurability of values. We apply this approach in a real case study, that assesses alternative manage options for a Biosphere Reserve located in the Basque Country (North of Spain) Finally based in the lessons learned from this experience, we propose and steep forward for incorporating different weights in the designee and evaluation of public policies for sustainability.

40|$|Rapid {{development}} and transformation {{are the main}} causes for declining urban natural landscapes {{as well as its}} physical and environmental qualities. Currently, rehabilitation and preservation actions cause tough pressures to cities, which lead to serious damages on urban natural landscapes. These fragmentations, particularly in historical heritage cities, cause the riverscapes to lose their sustainability qualities. People’s sense of attachment, satisfaction, and social bonding with riverscapes are also being deteriorated. This subject {{has become one of the}} most challenging issues for the Malaysian government and its local authorities. This research aimed to establish the sustainable riverscape rehabilitation strategy framework for Malaysia’s historical heritage cities from the urban design and planning perspectives. The research methodology was designed in two phases. Phase one has developed the sustainable riverscape rehabilitation strategy framework for Malaysia’s historical heritage cities by applying the goal-oriented method. The second phase has validated the framework application using the Grounded Group Decision Making (GGDM) method. For validation, the feasibility study shows the expert input has reached more than 70 % saturation for all feasibility assessment factors, except technical aspects of the factor project potential for extension, which has received 45 % saturation. This strategy framework involves sustainability domains; social benefits, environmental quality, and economic growth. Moreover, this strategy framework formulates a sustainable riverscape rehabilitation index score for promoting riverscape preservation. It integrates the Malaysian government, stakeholders, and <b>public</b> <b>participations</b> in riverscape rehabilitation activities...|$|E
30|$|The {{analytic}} {{distinction of}} risk characteristics—complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity—helps to facilitate an integrated approach to risk governance and urban risk management. Whereas {{the analysis of}} simple and—to some degree—complex problems is better served by relying on the physical understanding of risks, uncertain and ambiguous problems demand the integration of social constructions and mental models for both understanding and managing these problems since the risk conditions in urban areas affect the livelihood of people with all their beliefs, expectations, and emotions. The distinction of risks according to risk characteristics not only highlights deficits in our knowledge concerning adequate risk handling in urban contexts, but also points the way forward for the selection of management options. Thus, the risk governance framework attributes an important function to public and stakeholder participation, as well as risk communication, in the risk governance process. The framework suggests efficient and adequate public or stakeholder participation procedures. The concerns of stakeholders and/or the public are integrated in the risk appraisal phase via concern assessment. Furthermore, stakeholder and <b>public</b> <b>participations</b> are an established part of risk management. The optimum participation method depends {{on the characteristics of}} the risk issue. In this respect, all aspects that matter to people in urban risk governance are taking into account in the various discourses through the images that the participants bring into the discussions. The need for finding an agreement on the respective time and space boundaries, underlines the necessity to understand and comprehend the various concepts and images that people associate with quality of life in urban environments.|$|E

40|$|Afforestation in China at the nation-scale {{has been}} {{promoted}} by the government since 1999 with the provision of subsidies to buy environmental amenities. The article concerned with the impact on local communities according to household survey data in Dunhua County, Northeast China. Forty-two of the families involved in reforestation led a worse life after the program. In particular, {{it was important to}} understand what types of families were adversely affected and what kind of factors contributed to changes in the farmers' quality of life. It was found that 58. 3 % of the farmers perceived that converting cropland to forest was a volunteer action, and 39 % of the farmers were worried about their future after 8 years of government subsidies. The survey showed that there was an increase of non-farm income and the economic crop income in Dunhua County. This implied that some of the farmers could find alternative income resources so that the household could remain high income even when they no longer receive program subsidies. However, {{it is important to note}} that some farmers led a worse life after reforestation. When the subsidy ended, 16 % of the farmers plan to re-cultivate the land. Their intention clearly has implications for the sustainability of the program's environmental benefits. It was suggested that the government should pay more attention on the quality of reforestation instead of the ambitious scale.

40|$|The {{effects of}} rapid {{development}} have increased pressures on these places {{exacerbated by the}} competition between two key industry sectors, commercial base and tourism development. This, in supplement with urbanisation and industrialisation, has posted a high demand for the uses of these spaces. The political scenario and lack of adaptation on ecological principles and <b>public</b> <b>participations</b> in its design approach have sparked stiff environmental, historical and cultural constraint towards its landscape character {{as well as the}} ecological system. Therefore, a holistic approach towards improving the landscape design process is extremely necessary to protect human well being, cultural, environmental and historical values of these places. Limited research also has been carried out to overcome this situation. This further has created an urgent need to explore better ways to improve the landscape design process of Malaysian heritage urban river corridor developments that encompass the needs and aspirations of the Malaysian multi-ethnic society without making any drastic changes to the landscape character of the rivers. This paper presents a methodology to develop an advanced Landscape Character Assessment (aLCA) framework for evaluating the landscape character of the places, derived from the perception of two keys yet oppositional stakeholders: urban design team and special interest public. The triangulation of subjectivist paradigm methodologies: the psychophysical approach; the psychological approach; and, the phenomenological approach will be employed. The outcome will be used to improve the present landscape design process for future development of these places. Unless a range of perspectives can be brought to bear on enhancing the form and function of their future development and management, urban river corridors in the Malaysian context will continue to decline. ...|$|E
40|$|MM thesis - P&DMThe {{extent of}} public {{influence}} in the decisions that government and government agencies take {{is an issue of}} contentious discussion. There are varying views on the importance of public participation in decision-making in state institutions and public policy. There are those who support a soft approach to public participation while others believe that the public must be fully engaged and should contribute meaningfully to the decision-making process. It is not yet clear whether public participation processes in South Africa are influencing decision-making and policy direction. There appears to be more emphasis on conducting public participation with a purpose to comply to legislative requirements instead of the public participation enhancing the quality of the decisions that are taken by the public officials. NERSA conducts public participation prior to taking decisions on the price of electricity. People participating in these <b>public</b> <b>participations</b> hold a view that NERSA does not consider their submissions when taking decisions on electricity tariffs. This view is created by the public‟s perception that NERSA seems to take decisions contrary to what the public has advised them on. The main objective of this research was to determine whether public inputs have any {{influence in the}} decisions that NERSA takes regarding electricity tariff increases. The overall finding in the study showed that NERSA does handle all public comments and inputs fairly and with great thought. The process of gaining public input was found to be fair but not effective. It was discovered that the general public does not influence NERSA decisions to a great extent.

Good air quality can avoid many environmental issues which are regarding air problems. At least, reduce environmental impacts efficiently in some extent. Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulate matter (PM) are the common elements of air pollution. Topography, weather, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of pollutants and emission sources are also accomplices of air pollution. Östersund was a case study in this thesis because it has satisfactory air quality and won the European Mobility Week Award in 2014. Weather, winds, transportation and heating systems are the factors that influence urban air quality in Östersund. Green Traffic, Green Energy, and Green Highway are efficient projects in connection with air quality improvement in Östersund. Through successful technical application and institutional management, Östersund became one of the best climate cities in Sweden.

40|$|The {{population}} growth, the highspeed {{economic growth}} and urbanization in China has caused severe housing issues. The goal of the paper is to investigate {{the effectiveness of these}} programs from the recipients' standpoint. The investigation will focus on the shantytown resettlement project in Datong and the Economical and Comfortable Housing Proggram which funded it. Datong {{played a key role in}} coal mining and coal mining related industries in modern China. Thousands of coal mine workers and their families are migrants from both cities and rural areas in the surrounding region. As coal mines developed rapidly, they settled first near the mines, but without much infrastucture. Most of their houses are self-built by using 'poor' building materials and there is no public sewage and water supply system. There are some homes are even severely damaged by the coal mining activies. This paper aims to understand the concept and practice of development employed in the development of public housing in Detong. Through literature review, it derives a set of criteria to measure the success of a low income housing project. Then, it employs a survey from 2010 of the residents of the low-income housing project to evaluate the accomplishments based on the project's own objectives. Third, it will discuss the follow up study carried out in 2013 to observe the changes over three years and the success of the project from the residents' standpoint. Connecting these two, the paper will then investigate the potential and limitations of the project. Finally, it will derive lessons from the project. The paper is important is because it addresses housing not as a market product. It discusses the social part of housing which usually is missing in housing issues. From the 2010 survey, we found that the project achieved most of its objectives in terms of improving housing conditions; we also found some negative impacts of the project, including the increase in cost of living, the break-up of old community atmosphere and neighborhood relationships, and the lack of <b>public</b> <b>participations.</b> In a broad sense, the study revealed the shortcomings of the government being the sole provider of housing for low income people and the need to expand it beyond just the government. It is also necessary to rethink about the housing issue more holistically and develop some new ideas about solving the housing issue without directly providing housing which destroys community and its social capital. It recommends the encouragement of more civic participation and creating a user oriented approach to public housing. Department of Urban PlanningThesis (M. U. R. P. ...|$|E

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 - IntroductionTrust {{is considered}} {{as the most}} important factor in order paradigm and it plays a central role in the thoughts of such sociologists as Durkheim and Tunis. In micro and macro levels, it may make people’s negative and positive feelings evident. It is the most significant factor of social order and is deemed as one of the pillars of social property. Furthermore, the empirical study of trust in a society may be a feasible solution in order to achieve the higher culture of citizenship. So far, sociologists and philosophers have been concerned about the issue of stability or change in human societies. In every society, stability has an interwoven relationship with social solidarity and social solidarity could be understood in the relationship with change’s factors and paths. The presence of trust among different social organizations, groups and people is of important and effective factors in society’s solidarity and harmony. If social trust gets hurt through the effects of different factors, social order and solidarity face some challenges too. Among issues related to cities and citizens, creating trust to municipalities is of the main concerns in the realm of urban planning. As an important public and social institute in the cities, municipalities playing the role of planning, managing and delivering public services should act in such a way that people believe that they are useful and available. On the other hand, because of supplying financial resources and collecting <b>public</b> <b>participations,</b> municipalities should protect their public popularity and legitimacy so that they may attract the trust of all people in the societies. Therefore, due to the importance of trust in the presence of order, solidarity and participation in the societies, their institutes and organizations, the current study attempts at investigating the extent of citizens’ trust to the Neishabur Municipality and finding out the factors effective on it. 2 - MethodologyThe current research is of descriptive-analytical type which has been carried out through library research and field study. The main part of this study is survey which data is gathered by questionnaires and interviews with citizens. Research population consists of families residing in Neishabur. Sampling base is family unit. People included in our sample are chosen by regular multilevel clustering. For so doing, we consider urban districts as clusters; then, several blocks are randomly chosen in every block; ultimately, several families are sampled by systematic random method and interviewed. To analyze and describe data collected, SPSS, Pearson correlation coefficient, variance analysis, t-test and multivariate regression are used. 3 - DiscussionAmong understudy individual variables (education, marital status, occupation type, gender, age, and income), only respondents’ marital status and age have significant relationship with the extent of their trust to municipality and hypotheses related to these two variables are confirmed. However, there is a converse relationship between age and the extent of individuals’ trust to municipality in such a way that the higher the age of people, the lower their trust to the municipality. Furthermore, there is a significant relationship between prejudice experience, institutional trust, security feeling, bureaucratic corruption, needs satisfaction expectancy, membership in official groups and membership in unofficial groups and the extent of trust to the municipality. Therefore, hypotheses related to these variables are confirmed. Prejudice experience, institutional trust, security feeling, bureaucratic corruption, needs satisfaction expectancy and membership in unofficial groups are entered in multivariate analysis model and they account for 86 % of variance of dependent variable (trust to the municipality). Furthermore, membership in unofficial groups, age, gender, marital status, income and occupation are put way from the model. 4 - ConclusionsFindings indicate that in the sample investigated, 30 % of respondents have low, 50 % medium and 20 % high trust to the municipality. Therefore, it can be said that most of the respondents have medium trust to the municipality. In multivariate analysis, corruption and prejudice experience have a converse relationship with trust to the municipality, indicating that some respondents has seen some cases of bribery and injustice and/or some people have heard some things through other people, which has been affected their trust to the municipality. It should be recognized that as a social institute, municipalities may perform their roles if they involve sufficiently in trust-creating process and enjoy trustful atmosphere, or else, they would lose their time and energy in a trustless atmosphere and they would also lose their social reputation, social support and social popularity. Therefore, municipalities should try to increase their legitimacy, popularity and citizens’ trust from medium to high level and should consider the continuance of legitimacy and trust. They should pay special attention to justice, equality and efficiency for the observance of citizenship rights and the attraction of their trust are considered {{as the most important}} property of municipality social institute. In order to promote citizens’ trust to themselves, municipalities and other public institutes should correctly perform their tasks through positive performances and timely services.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the ability of}} the famous social network called "Facebook" in enhancing the inalienable rights "freedom of speech and expression" in Palestine. It will concentrate on the new sphere Facebook is creating "the sphere of freedom". Considering Palestine to be a third world country where its governmental laws are not completely applied. Many opposing opinions have emerged regarding "social networks and freedom". Some believe that social networks can empower oppositional political movements, while others see it as a tool of suppression held against citizens especially in autocratic countries like Iran,, where the internet is highly monitored by the government. Palestine {{was one of the first}} Arab countries to introduce electronic press to its people, because of the belief that the internet can help Palestinians convey the reality of the Palestinian issue to the world, and fight the information war declared by Israel. Another reason for the quick internet progress is due to fact that, the Israeli institutions supply their country with huge advanced services in this field, and therefore Palestinians should cope with that. Palestine has its special case with internet monitoring, because there are no restrictions or control over the internet by the Palestinian authority, there are also no constitutional laws which organize information technology. Facebook overview:Facebook is "a web-based service that allows individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system". It is the world's largest social media service, launched in February 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg. In October 2011, Facebook was reported to have more than 800 million active users. The total number of users in the Arab world stands at 32 million (as in august 2011), at a 50 % growth since the beginning of 2011. "According to the social networking statistics; Facebook penetration in Palestine is 25. 74 % of the country's population and 82 % in relation to number of Internet users. The total number of Facebook users in Palestine is reaching 647 280 and grew by more than xml:namespace prefix = st 1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /> 48 860 in the last 6 months (April-October 2011). They also indicate, that the largest age group of users is between 18 - 24, with a total number of 291 276 users, followed by the users in the age of 25 - 34. Stats also show that 72 % of the users in Palestine are males and only 28 % are females. Where globally the ratio is 1 : 1 (males to females) " Upon the most popular modules users can add to their profiles are "Facebook groups",which "are a shared space where members can participate in communal activities like group chat, e-mail lists, document sharing and group photo-tagging" Facebook members can create groups and join others based on common interests or activities. Thus allowing for exchange of views and thoughts, leading to civic and political impacts upon users. The other most popular module on Facebook is a "Facebook page" which is a public profile specifically created for businesses, brands, celebrities, causes, and other organizations. Pages can gain an unlimited number of fans. A page owner can promote his/her ideas through posting status updates (similar to blog posts). Fans can comment and like the statuses and also post on the page expressing and sharing their thoughts. Research Questions: 1. what kinds of Palestinian popular groups are there on Facebook and what subjects are frequently brought up? 2. How is Facebook used in Palestine?New media and public spheresThe main reason for addressing the question of the role of Facebook in enhancing the inalienable rights in Palestine refers to the definition of new media as it offers on-demand access to content anytime, anywhere, on any digital device, as well as interactive user feedback, creative participation and community formation around the media content. So, the concept of public sphere fits this kind of research depending on its definition of this concept, as it is an arena where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political, social [...] action. (Meyer and Moors, 2006, 7). Therefore, this paper is built on this concept as an attempt to diagnose and explain the nature of Facebook uses in Palestine. Literature review:Facebook usage is still new in Palestine; this explains the lack of the researches relating to the subject of this study. "The relationship between the new media and freedom of speech and expression in Palestine, taking Facebook as an example" is the title of the new book published in Palestine, written by Mahmoud Al-fatafta and Dr. Walid Alshorafa. This book discusses the effects of Facebook upon the Palestinian media and its impact on civil and press freedoms. It provides a critical reading of the concept new media "a reflection of social mobility, which reduces areas of expulsion in Arab societies such as suppression, repression and sex". These lacks are compensated trough the virtual world and the public sphere, where an individual can freely express him/herself and practice his/her inalienable rights without limits. Alfatafta and Al-shorafa book concentrates on the theoretical aspects of the subject, however, in the present research content analysis will determine inalienable rights on Palestinian Facebook pages and groups. The study will explore these forms of <b>public</b> <b>participations</b> in practical manners. Methodology:In this paper, we try to analyze the contents of three of the Palestinian pages and groups on Facebook, precisely the most popular ones, in terms of members. There are a number of Facebook pages and groups in Palestine concentrating on (political, social, cultural, entertainment and religion, however, it appeared through the research that the chosen pages and groups are the most popular among Palestinian Facebook users. The kinds of participations and the analysis are aimed to discover how it can the new public sphere contribute in enhancing civic rights. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be adopted in this paper, quantitative data will be collected from the Facebook pages and groups itself such as the number of the members, post subject, Gender of the participant [...] . etc, yet, the qualitative analysis will enhance the research environment in Palestine regarding the inalienable rights and active participation. This analysis will depend on types of subjects, language use and interactivity. The reason for choosing this type of methodology aims at indicating the power of different types of discourse and their impact on different categories within public members in the community. Thus, the period in which analysis will take place will be for one week examining the posts, comments within the chosen sample (hundreds of posts and comments). Le rôle de Facebook dans l'amélioration des droits inaliénables en Palestine Cette étude examine la capacité du réseau social célèbre appelé "Facebook" dans l'amélioration des droits inaliénables de la "liberté de parole et d'expression" en Palestine. Il se concentrera sur la nouvelle sphère que Facebook est de créer "la sphère de la liberté". Considérant la Palestine comme un pays du tiers monde où les lois gouvernementales ne sont pas complètement appliquées. Beaucoup d'opinions opposées ont émergé concernant les "réseaux sociaux et la liberté". Certains croient que les réseaux sociaux peut renforcer les mouvements politiques oppositionnels, tandis que d'autres y voient un outil de suppression contre les citoyens notamment dans les pays autocratiques comme l'Iran, où l'Internet est très bien surveillé par le gouvernement. La Palestine était l'un des premiers pays arabes à introduire la presse électronique à son peuple, en croyant que l'Internet peut aider les Palestiniens à faire connaitre la réalité de la cause palestinienne dans le monde, et lutter contre la guerre de l'information déclarée par Israël. Une autre raison pour le progrès rapide de l'internet est dû au fait que, les institutions israéliennes ont fournit leur pays des services énormes avancés dans ce domaine, et donc les Palestiniens devraient faire face à cela. La Palestine a son cas particulier à la surveillance d'Internet, car il n'existe aucune restriction ou de contrôle sur l'internet par l'autorité palestinienne, il ya aussi pas de lois constitutionnelles qui organisent la technologie de l'information. Cela revient au fait que le gouvernement israélien fournit des services d'Internet en Palestine, ainsi, Israël maintien le contrôle total sur elle. Basé sur les informations ci-dessus, le document présent tente de exprimer à quel degré la nouvelle sphère publique améliorera l'expression et la liberté d'expression en Palestine, en mettant en considération le fait que la Palestine est un pays du tiers monde qui est encore en cours de formation, comme mentionné précédemment. Facebook a été signalé pour avoir plus de 800 millions d'utilisateurs actifs. Le nombre total d'utilisateurs dans le monde arabe s'élève à 32 millions (comme en août 2011), à une croissance de 50 % depuis le début de 2011. "Selon les statistiques du réseau social; la la pénétration de Facebook en Palestine constitue 25, 74 % de la population du pays et 82 % par rapport au nombre d'utilisateurs d'Internet. Le nombre total d'utilisateurs de Facebook en Palestine est d'atteindre 647 280 et d'une croissance de plus de 48 860 dans les six derniers mois (Avril-Octobre 2011). Il est indiqué également, que le groupe d'âge le plus utilisateurs se situe entre 18 - 24, avec un nombre total de 291 276 utilisateurs, suivis par les utilisateurs parmi l'âge de 25 - 34. Les statistiques montrent aussi que 72 % des utilisateurs sont des hommes en Palestine et seulement 28 % sont des femmes où globalement le ratio est de 1 : 1 (mâles pour les femelles). Questions de recherche: 1. Quels types de groupes palestiniens populaires sont là sur Facebook et quels sujets sont fréquemment mis en place? 2. Comment est utilisé Facebook en Palestine?Les nouveaux médias et les sphères publiquesLa raison principale pour aborder la question du rôle de Facebook dans l'amélioration des droits inaliénables en Palestine se réfère à la définition des nouveaux médias comme il offre un accès sur demande au contenu n'importe quand, n'importe où, sur n'importe quel appareil numérique, ainsi que les commentaires des utilisateurs interactifs, une participation créative et formation d'une communauté autour du contenu des médias. Ainsi, le concept de sphère publique correspond à ce type de recherche en fonction de sa définition de ce concept, car il est une arène où les individus peuvent se réunir pour discuter librement et d'identifier les problèmes sociétaux, et grâce à qui influencent le débat politique, social [...] d'action. (Meyer et Moors, 2006, 7). Par conséquent, ce document est construit sur ce concept comme une tentative de diagnostiquer et d'expliquer la nature d'usage de Facebook en Palestine. Revue de la littérature: L'utilisation de Facebook est encore récente en Palestine, ce qui explique le manque de recherches relatives au sujet de cette étude. Cependant, il semble y avoir un livre récent sur la liberté de parole et Facebook, plus d'autres articles publiés dans les journaux et les sites Web relatifs à cette question, certains d'entre eux seront examinées dans cette étude. "La relation entre les nouveaux médias et la liberté de parole et d'expression en Palestine, en prenant comme un exemple Facebook" est le titre du nouveau livre publié en Palestine, écrit par Mahmoud Al-fatafta et Dr. Walid Al-shorafa. Ce livre traite des effets de Facebook sur les médias palestiniens et son effet sur les libertés civiles et de presse. Il offre une lecture signifiante du concept des médias nouveau t "un reflet de la mobilité sociale, ce qui réduit les zones d'expulsion dans les sociétés arabes tels que la suppression, la répression et le sexe". Ces manques sont récompensés par le monde virtuel et la sphère publique, où une personne peut librement exprimer son / elle-même et la pratique de son / ses droits inaliénables sans limites. Le livre d'Alfatafta et Al-shorafa se concentre sur les aspects théoriques du sujet, cependant, dans l'analyse de contenu de la recherche actuelle permettra de déterminer les droits inaliénables sur les pages Facebook et les groupes palestiniens. L'étude se penchera sur ces formes de participations publiques dans les manières pratiques. Méthodologie : Dans cette recherche, nous essayons d'analyser le contenu de trois des pages palestinienne et des groupes sur Facebook, justement les plus populaires, en termes de membres. Il ya un certain nombre de pages Facebook et des groupes en Palestine se concentrant sur (politiques, sociaux, culturels, de divertissement et de la religion, cependant, il est apparu à travers la recherche que les pages choisies et les groupes sont les plus populaires parmi les utilisateurs de Facebook palestinien. Les types de participations et les analyses sont destinées à découvrir comment il peut la nouvelle sphère publique contribuent à renforcer les droits civiques. Les méthodes qualitatives et quantitatives qui seront adoptées dans ce document, les données quantitatives seront recueillies à partir des pages Facebook et les groupes eux même come le nombre des membres, l'objet de posts, le sexe du participant, [...] . etc, et pourtant, l'analyse qualitative permettra d'améliorer l'environnement de la recherche en Palestine concernant les droits inaliénables et de participation active. Cette analyse se dépendra sur les types de sujets, utiliser un langage et d'interactivité. La raison du choix de ce type de méthodologie vise à indiquer la puissance de différents types de discours et de leur impact sur les différentes catégories au sein des membres du public dans la communauté. Ainsi, la période dans laquelle l'analyse aura lieu sera pendant une semaine en examinant des messages, des commentaires au sein de l'échantillon choisi (des centaines de messages et commentaires) ...|$|E
