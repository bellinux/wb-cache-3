5|$|Historically, {{manganese}} {{is named}} for <b>pyrolusite</b> and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used <b>pyrolusite</b> to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that <b>pyrolusite</b> (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but {{they were unable to}} isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{comprises}} about 1000ppm(0.1%) of the Earth's crust, the 12th {{most abundant}} of the crust's elements. Soil contains 7–9000ppm of manganese {{with an average}} of 440ppm. Seawater has only 10ppm manganese and the atmosphere contains 0.01µg/m3. Manganese occurs principally as <b>pyrolusite</b> (MnO2), braunite, (Mn2+Mn3+6)(SiO12), psilomelane (Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10, {{and to a lesser extent}} as rhodochrosite (MnCO3).|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} manganese ore is <b>pyrolusite</b> (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial {{relation to the}} iron ores. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as <b>pyrolusite</b> or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E
25|$|In 1659, Johann Rudolf Glauber fused {{a mixture}} of the mineral <b>pyrolusite</b> (manganese dioxide, MnO2) and {{potassium}} carbonate to obtain a material that, when dissolved in water, gave a green solution (potassium manganate) which slowly shifted to violet and then finally red.|$|E
500|$|The element {{was first}} studied {{in detail in}} 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and he is {{credited}} with the discovery. He called it [...] "dephlogisticated muriatic acid air" [...] since it is a gas (then called [...] "airs") and it came from hydrochloric acid (then known as [...] "muriatic acid"). He failed to establish chlorine as an element, mistakenly thinking {{that it was the}} oxide obtained from the hydrochloric acid (see phlogiston theory). He named the new element within this oxide as muriaticum. Regardless of what he thought, Scheele did isolate chlorine by reacting MnO2 (as the mineral <b>pyrolusite)</b> with HCl: ...|$|E
500|$|This uplift created {{vertical}} joints, which {{over time}} were preferentially eroded. The soft Pink Cliffs of the Claron Formation were eroded to form freestanding pinnacles in badlands called hoodoos, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths. The brown, pink and red colors are from hematite (iron oxide; [...] ); the yellows from limonite and the purples are from <b>pyrolusite</b> (...) [...] [...] Also created were arches, natural bridges, walls, and windows. Hoodoos {{are composed of}} soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder, less easily eroded stone that protects the column from the elements. Bryce Canyon {{has one of the}} highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Scheele {{made one}} other very {{important}} scientific discovery in 1774, arguably more revolutionary than his isolation of oxygen. [...] He identified lime, silica, and iron in a specimen of <b>pyrolusite</b> (impure manganese dioxide) {{given to him}} by his friend, Johann Gottlieb Gahn, but could not identify an additional component (this was the manganese, which Scheele recognized was present as a new element, but could not isolate). When he treated the <b>pyrolusite</b> with hydrochloric acid over a warm sand bath, a yellow-green gas with a strong odor was produced. [...] He found that the gas sank to the bottom of an open bottle and was denser than ordinary air. He also noted that the gas was not soluble in water. It turned corks a yellow color and removed all color from wet, blue litmus paper and some flowers. He called this gas with bleaching abilities, [...] "dephlogisticated muriatic acid" [...] (dephlogisticated hydrochloric acid, or oxidized hydrochloric acid). Eventually, Sir Humphry Davy named the gas chlorine.|$|E
2500|$|A {{specialized}} use of {{manganese dioxide}} is as oxidant in organic synthesis. The {{effectiveness of the}} reagent depends on the method of preparation, a problem that is typical for other heterogeneous reagents where surface area, among other variables, is a significant factor. The mineral <b>pyrolusite</b> makes a poor reagent. Usually, however, the reagent is generated in situ by treatment of an aqueous solution [...] with a Mn(II) salt, typically the sulfate. [...] oxidizes allylic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones: ...|$|E
2500|$|Manganese(IV) oxide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula [...] This blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral <b>pyrolusite,</b> {{which is the}} main ore of manganese and a component of manganese nodules. The principal use for [...] is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc-carbon battery. [...] is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as [...] [...] It {{is used as a}} reagent in organic synthesis, for example, for the oxidation of allylic alcohols. [...] in the α polymorph can incorporate a variety of atoms (as well as water molecules) in the [...] "tunnels" [...] or [...] "channels" [...] between the manganese oxide octahedra. There is considerable interest in [...] as a possible cathode for lithium ion batteries.|$|E
2500|$|Oxide {{minerals}} {{are divided}} into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O2− as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The periclase group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include cuprite (Cu2O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as corundum (Al2O3), and hematite (Fe2O3). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO2) is the chief ore of titanium; other examples include cassiterite (SnO2; ore of tin), and <b>pyrolusite</b> (MnO2; ore of manganese). [...] In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH−. Bauxites are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals diaspore, gibbsite, and bohmite; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions). [...] Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the spinels, with a general formula of X2+Y3+2O4. Examples of species include spinel (MgAl2O4), chromite (FeCr2O4), and magnetite (Fe3O4). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two oxidation states (Fe2+Fe3+2O4), {{which makes it a}} multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyrolusite</b> and romanechite {{are among}} the most common {{manganese}} minerals. <b>Pyrolusite</b> occurs associated with manganite, hollandite, hausmannite, braunite, chalcophanite, goethite and hematite under oxidizing conditions in hydrothermal deposits. It also occurs in bogs and often results from alteration of manganite.|$|E

50|$|The metal is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} the oxide with sodium, magnesium, aluminium, or by electrolysis. <b>Pyrolusite</b> is extensively used for the manufacture of spiegeleisen and ferromanganese and of various alloys such as manganese-bronze. As an oxidizing agent it {{is used in the}} preparation of chlorine; indeed, chlorine gas itself was first described by Karl Scheele in 1774 from the reaction products of <b>pyrolusite</b> and hydrochloric acid. Natural <b>pyrolusite</b> has been used in batteries, but high-quality batteries require synthetic products. <b>Pyrolusite</b> is also used to prepare disinfectants (permanganates) and for decolorizing glass. When mixed with molten glass it oxidizes the ferrous iron to ferric iron, and so discharges the green and brown tints (making it classically useful to glassmakers as a decolorizer). As a coloring material, it is used in calico printing and dyeing; for imparting violet, amber, and black colors to glass, pottery, and bricks; and in the manufacture of green and violet paints.|$|E

5000|$|At Charco Redondo in Oriente Province, Cuba, fibrous todorokite {{has been}} found with fibers to 10 cm in length. It is dark {{brownish}} black with a weak silky sheen on fracture surfaces, otherwise the luster is dull. It is difficult to measure the specific gravity because of the fibrous structure; measured values between 3.1 and 3.4 are probably too low. Hardness is low but cannot be measured accurately. [...] Commonly associated minerals are <b>pyrolusite,</b> cryptomelane, manganite, psilomelane, quartz, feldspar and calcite. The manganese ores are interbedded with volcanic tuff, jasper and limestone. The todorokite has been altered near the surface and along faults or fissures to <b>pyrolusite,</b> and perhaps to manganite. The source of the manganese was probably hot springs.|$|E
50|$|Manganite {{occurs with}} other {{manganese}} oxides in deposits formed by circulating meteoric {{water in the}} weathering environment in clay deposits and laterites.

50|$|The Iron King, Empire, and Brush Heap {{were some}} of the first mines in the area. Most {{production}} was within 460 feet of the surface in the supergene zone. Ore minerals included cerargyrite, native silver, polybasite, and argentiferous galena. From 1952 to 1959, 5,689 tons of manganese ore were produced from the Fusselman Dolomite, mainly from the Iron King Mine. <b>Pyrolusite</b> is the main manganese ore mineral.|$|E
5000|$|Generally more {{expensive}} than ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals are used because of desirable properties such as low weight (e.g. aluminium), higher conductivity (e.g. copper), [...] non-magnetic property or resistance to corrosion (e.g. zinc).

He patented this solution, and marketed it as 'Condy's Fluid'. Although effective, the solution was not very stable. This was overcome by using potassium hydroxide (KOH) rather than NaOH. This was more stable, and had the advantage of easy conversion to the equally effective potassium permanganate crystals. This crystalline material was known as 'Condy's crystals' or 'Condy's powder'. Potassium permanganate was comparatively easy to manufacture, so Condy was subsequently forced to spend considerable time in litigation to stop competitors from marketing similar products.|$|E
