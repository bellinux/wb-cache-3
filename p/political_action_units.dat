In this paper, we report our investigation on the semantic relationships of facial <b>action</b> <b>units</b> and introduce a novel method for facial <b>action</b> <b>unit</b> recognition based on <b>action</b> <b>unit</b> classifiers and a Bayes network called Facial <b>Action</b> <b>Unit</b> Association Network (FAUAN). Compared with other methods, the proposed method attempts to identify a set of facial <b>action</b> <b>units</b> of a face image simultaneously. We achieve this goal by three steps. At first, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is extracted as features and after that, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is trained for the preliminary detection of each individual facial <b>action</b> <b>unit.</b> At last, FAUAN fuses the responses of all the facial <b>action</b> <b>unit</b> classifiers to determine a best set of facial <b>action</b> <b>units.</b> The proposed method achieves a promising performance on the extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset. Experimental results also show that when the individual unit classifiers are not so good, the performance could improve by nearly 10 % in some cases when FAUAN is used.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} three independent {{lines of}} investigation {{on the social}} psychology of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. Rather than developing a grand theory, I focus on adapting current perspectives in the social psychology of emotion, automaticity, goals and mental simulation {{to the study of}} <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. The approach taken is eclectic both theoretically and methodologically. In Chapter 1, I review the social psychology of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. In doing so, I conceptualise <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change and explore current explanations of these phenomena. I also introduce moral emotions, automaticity and imagination in order to mark the way for the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, I examine the role of the moral emotions in <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. Specifically, I explore the antecedents and consequences of anger, sympathy, and admiration. Drawing on theories of intergroup relations and emotion, I show that legitimate status, competence, and warmth all elicit admiration. Notably, admiration towards the authorities and centres of group power inhibits <b>political</b> <b>action</b> aimed at challenging the social order. However, when the target of admiration is a subversive hero or “martyr”, admiration uniquely predict willingness to challenge the status quo. In Chapter 3 I investigate the role of automaticity in <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> More specifically, I develop a dual process account of <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> I demonstrate that controlled (vs. automatic) processes lead to an increase in <b>political</b> <b>action</b> tendencies in members of a disadvantaged group. Notably, automatic protest attitudes influence <b>political</b> <b>action</b> through anger. That is, the more positive one’s automatic protest attitudes are the more anger they feel in relation to group grievances. Notably, automatic attitudes are more likely to predict <b>political</b> <b>action</b> when one is low in the motivation and ability to deliberate on political issues. In Chapter 4 I examine the role of imagination in <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change. I demonstrate that being able to imagine a particular social change goal (e. g., revolution or reform) uniquely predict <b>political</b> <b>action</b> tendencies aimed at that goal. Notably, imagination also qualifies the influence of efficacy and anger on politic action tendencies. Put simply, anger only predicts <b>political</b> <b>action</b> for collective mobility when group members can imagine this social change goal. In addition, efficacy only predicts action aimed at revolution when one can imagine an alternative social system (e. g., economy). In Chapter 5 I draw some conclusions, and discuss the limitations and issues that arise from the work presented here. Finally, I propose some avenues for future research. In iii addition, I put forward a typology of social change in the hope that it will engender future work on the social psychology of <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and social change...|$|R

40|$|The {{political}} {{psychology of}} <b>political</b> <b>action</b> provides {{the potential for}} building bridges between scholars from different fields. The main aim {{of this article is}} to set some baby steps toward building two conceptual bridges by bringing together a core motivation approach to <b>political</b> <b>action</b> with core features of the social structure that embeds those core motivations. The first conceptual bridge relies on considering a broader motivational model than provided by rational actor or social identity approaches, whereas the second bridge relies on considering core features of the social structure as potentiating these core motivations for <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> More specifically, I first discuss definitions of <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> Second, I identify four converging themes across different literatures on collective action, social movement participation, and voting turnout, resulting in a taxonomy of core motivations for <b>political</b> <b>action</b> (i. e., personal or group-based identity, efficacy, emotion, and moral motivations). Third, in a more explorative fashion I identify four core features of the social structure (ingroup, outgroup, interpersonal network, and institutional features), which I tentatively connect with the taxonomy of core motivations. Finally, I discuss the theoretical, empirical, and practical implications of this generalist, generative, and integrative perspective on <b>political</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R
