40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{research}} of applicability of gluten-free flours from cereal crops and from by-products of cereal crop processing - ground crumbs sifted out in a process of flake production from rice, corn and millet during the production of biscuit <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products.</b> Taking into account that viscosity is an important technological characteristic of foam-like biscuit dough, as it determines foam strength and dispersed medium stability, the influence of gluten-free flours on the structural and rheological properties of biscuit dough was studied. It is determined that the substitution of wheat flour for cereal flours leads to viscosity reduction of the dough as a consequence of absence of gluten-forming proteins in them. A comparative analysis of changes in viscous properties of biscuit dough based on flour from flakes crumb while warming it up to 60 °C with dough based on cereal flours and dough based on wheat flour was held. It is shown that the presence of partially gelatinized starch granules in flour from flake crumb, as a result of technological peculiarities of their extraction, promotes greater demonstration of thickening properties already at the initial stage of baking than in cereal flours. This leads to an increase of dough viscosity and formation of desired rheological characteristics, which provide the porous structure of finished products. To provide the high quality of gluten-free biscuit <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products,</b> the recipe composition of gluten-free biscuit <b>semi-finished</b> <b>product,</b> based on flour mixture from millet flakes crumb, corn and rice flour, was optimized by using the method of mathematical design of experiments.  The porosity indicator was chosen as the criteria for the evaluation of influence of proportion of gluten-free flours on the quality of biscuit <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products.</b> The response surfaces of dependency of biscuit porosity from mass ratio of recipe components in the composite mixture were obtained. It was confirmed experimentally that the use of pre-gelatinized acetylated modified starches during the production of gluten-free biscuit <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products,</b> facilitates the stabilization of the structural and rheological properties of foam structure - viscosity growth of biscuit dough because of foam-stabilizing property, which is particular to them. It was demonstrated that the obtained gluten-free biscuit <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products</b> based on flour composite mixtures with addition of modified starches, had high quality indicators. Based on the results of the research conducted, the recipe was formulated, technological parameters of production of new types of gluten-free biscuit <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products</b> were determined.

40|$|For {{efficiency}} reasons {{many buildings}} are realized {{by using the}} lightweight design principles. The combination of fabric and lightweight structure plays a significant role. Although most lightweight materials, such as aluminum, are {{more expensive than the}} conventional materials concrete and structural steel, savings result due to the comprehensive cost analysis over the lifetime of a building. For example cost advantages can be achieved during the transport to the building site and in the dimensioning of the basement. Semi-finished aluminum foams, especially sandwiches are excellent for lightweight constructions. The applicability has already been proven in several serial applications for machine tools. In the building industry aluminum foam is still an almost unknown material. Due to ist cellular structure aluminum foam is very light. The material has also a high vibration damping capacity. <b>Semi-finished</b> <b>products</b> made from or made with aluminum foam are usually offered in shape of pure foam plates, sandwiches and foam-filled hollow structures. Large structures can excellently be produced by using prefabricated semi-finished aluminum foam. In this lecture the fabrication of the foams, their properties, available composite materials and opportunities for the machinability of the foams and their <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products</b> are shown and principles of lightweight design that can be realized with the new materials will be presented.
