40|$|Individualized {{treatment}} packages {{were developed}} for 3 children with high-rate severe pica using a discrimination training paradigm and a behavioral assessment-based procedure known as empirically derived consequences.

These results suggest that treatment effectiveness may be enhanced when behavioral assessment data are used to identify potent consequences...|$|R
