5|$|After 1971, {{particularly}} {{after the release}} of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band, who had not had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell.

On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe discuss various {{configurations}} of <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> PG(5, 2). The supporting point-sets {{of most of}} the configurations, or else the complements of these point-sets, have cubic equations and are of elliptic or hyperbolic type. In our discussion of conclaves of eight <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> PG(5, 2) we introduce a second addition upon the space V(6, 2) =X⊕X∗, where X∗ is the dual of X. We show that the 8 planes of a conclave lying on a hyperbolic quadric for one addition mutate into the 8 Conwell heptads lying off a hyperbolic quadric for the other addition. In our discussion of double-seven of <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> PG(5, 2) we also consider their relation with the double-seven of <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> PG(8, 2) which is supported by the Segre variety S 2, 2 over GF(2) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of fracturing in LiFePO{sub 4 } particles {{as a function}} of the particle morphology and history is presented. Two types of samples, one subjected to electrochemical cycling and another to chemical delithiation are compared. We observe the formation of micro fractures parallel to low indexed lattice <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> both samples. The fracture surfaces are predominantly parallel to (100) <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> the chemically delithiated powder and (100) and (010) <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> the electrochemically cycled powder. A consideration of the threshold stresses for dislocation glide shows that particle geometry plays an important role in the observed behavior...|$|R

5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a <b>plane.</b> <b>In</b> the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E

5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack the <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers did not realize that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Captain Robert L. Cardenas, USAAF, {{served as}} a B-24 {{aircraft}} pilot in the European Theater of Operations with the 506th Bombardment Squadron. He was awarded the Air Medal and two oak leaf clusters for bombing missions before being shot down over Germany in March 1944. Despite head wounds from flak, {{he made his way}} back to Allied control. On October 14, 1947, Cardenas flew the B-29 launch aircraft that released the X-1 experimental rocket <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> which Charles E. Yeager became the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound. Cardenas retired as brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat and wrecked the <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> an unexpected belly landing. Due to additional training on new intercept methods and the vagaries of squadron transfers, the war ended before he would be deployed to any combat theater.|$|E

5|$|During the summer, Baker was {{transferred}} to the 13th Aero Squadron after its commander, Captain Charles Biddle, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though reluctant to leave the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German <b>plane.</b> <b>In</b> August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the 141st Aero Squadron, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed behind the front line, where they had to wait for equipment to arrive before leaving for the front.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, Stone was aboard an {{airplane}} which skidded off a snowy runway at O'Hare Airport in Chicago; {{there were no}} injuries. Stone began piloting ultra-light airplanes as a hobby in 1999 and 2000. In March 2000, he suffered a broken left ankle, cracked rib, concussion, and bruised kidney after crashing his <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> Robertson County, Tennessee, and was briefly hospitalized before he resumed touring. Stone later said that the accident made him decide to quit flying planes. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, rumors circulated that Stone had been {{on one of the}} hijacked planes; a spokeswoman for the singer confirmed that he was at home with his family that day.|$|E
5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E

5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|E

In the UK, Sikorski received honoris causa degrees from the University of Liverpool and University of St Andrews. In 1981, a commemorative plaque was revealed at Hotel Rubens in London, where during the war Polish Military Headquarters, including Sikorski's office, were located. He is commemorated in London's Portland Place, near the Embassy of Poland, with a larger than life statue, unveiled in 2000.

5|$|Rough waves {{destroyed}} {{four and}} damaged two deep-water communication cables between Oahu and Kauai. In Oahu, damage from wind and surf was heaviest {{on the southwest}} coast between Nānākuli and Mākaha. The storm surge washed sand into streets in Waikīkī and flooded cars in areas of basement parking. Wind damage was greatest in areas where winds blew from southerly directions off of mountains. The winds damaged several small aircraft and a Douglas DC-3 <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> Honolulu. Gusty winds shattered glass windows in the Honolulu International Airport, injuring several passengers. Some flights {{in and out of}} the Honolulu airport were delayed, while other domestic airports were temporarily closed. The passage of the hurricane damaged at least 6,391 homes, 21 hotels, and two condominium buildings on the island. Additionally, 418buildings, including 30 businesses, were destroyed on Oahu.|$|E
