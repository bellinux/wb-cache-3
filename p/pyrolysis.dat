5|$|Another energy-from-waste centre using <b>pyrolysis</b> {{technology}} has been granted planning permission at Washwood Heath.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{the removal}} of {{chloroform}} by vacuum <b>pyrolysis</b> of d adducts was used by Wanzlick in his early attempts to prepare dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes but this method is not widely used. The Enders laboratory has used vacuum <b>pyrolysis</b> of a c adduct to generate a triazolium-5-ylidene c.|$|E
5|$|By process principles: Based on the {{treatment}} of raw oil shale by heat and solvents the methods are classified as <b>pyrolysis,</b> hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Wanzlick and {{co-workers}} conjectured that carbenes derived from dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene were produced by vacuum <b>pyrolysis</b> of the corresponding 2-trichloromethyl dihydroimidazole compounds {{with the loss}} of chloroform.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} boranes are diborane B2H6 {{and two of}} its <b>pyrolysis</b> products, pentaborane B5H9 and decaborane B10H14. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. 2−.|$|E
5|$|Another {{family of}} {{persistent}} carbenes {{are based on}} the 1,2,4-triazole ring, with the unfilled orbitals in carbon 5 of this ring. The triazol-5-ylidenes pictured below were first prepared by Enders and co-workers by vacuum <b>pyrolysis</b> through loss of methanol from 2-methoxytriazoles. Only a limited range of these molecules have been reported, with the triphenyl substituted molecule being commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{can be made}} by slow <b>pyrolysis</b> of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln. The {{carefully}} stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe {{synthesised}} {{acetic acid}} from inorganic compounds {{for the first}} time. This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride, followed by <b>pyrolysis</b> to tetrachloroethylene and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|Shale oil {{extraction}} process decomposes oil shale and converts its kerogen into shale oila petroleum-like synthetic crude oil. The process is conducted by <b>pyrolysis,</b> hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution. The efficiencies of extraction processes are often evaluated by comparing their yields {{to the results}} of a Fischer Assay performed on a sample of the shale.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} <b>pyrolysis</b> of {{extruded}} {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{is used as}} {{a drawing}} {{material}} in artwork, barbecue grilling, iron smelting, and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry, and industrial diamonds are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and carbon fiber, made by <b>pyrolysis</b> of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite materials.|$|E
5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of <b>pyrolysis</b> {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 {{million to}} eight {{companies}} {{to advance the}} development of commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel. The FAA is assisting {{in the development of}} a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as <b>pyrolysis</b> oils) that can be “dropped in” to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure. The research will test how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray <b>pyrolysis,</b> etc.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by <b>pyrolysis</b> of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyrolysis</b> is {{a process}} of thermo-chemical {{decomposition}} of organic materials by heat in the absence of oxygen which produces various hydrocarbon gases. During <b>pyrolysis,</b> the molecules of object are subjected to very high temperatures leading to very high vibrations. Therefore, every molecule in the object is stretched and shaken to an extent that molecules starts breaking down. The rate of <b>pyrolysis</b> increases with temperature. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430°C (800°F). Fast <b>pyrolysis</b> produces liquid fuel for feedstocks like wood. Slow <b>pyrolysis</b> produces gases and solid charcoal. <b>Pyrolysis</b> hold promise for conversion of waste biomass into useful liquid fuel. <b>Pyrolysis</b> of waste plastics can produce millions of litres of fuel. Solid products of this process contain metals, glass, sand and <b>pyrolysis</b> coke which cannot be converted to gas in the process.|$|E
25|$|These are {{distinct}} from processes using dry materials to depolymerize, such as <b>pyrolysis.</b> The term Thermochemical Conversion (TCC) {{has also been}} used for conversion of biomass to oils, using superheated water, although it is more usually applied to fuel production via <b>pyrolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the usage}} of {{dedicated}} pyrolyzers, <b>pyrolysis</b> GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30°C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650°C. This is sufficient for some <b>pyrolysis</b> applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and <b>pyrolysis</b> can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyrolysis</b> oil {{is another}} type of fuel derived from the {{lignocellulosic}} fraction of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen (<b>pyrolysis),</b> a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable bio-oil. As opposed to other biofuels, <b>pyrolysis</b> oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors. This same reaction is known to have come from harvesting unicorn blood (although very hard to find).|$|E
25|$|Phenol {{is also a}} {{recoverable}} {{byproduct of}} coal <b>pyrolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dry {{distillation}} or destructive distillation, {{despite the}} name, is not truly distillation, {{but rather a}} chemical reaction known as <b>pyrolysis</b> in which solid substances are heated in an inert or reducing atmosphere and any volatile fractions, containing high-boiling liquids and products of <b>pyrolysis,</b> are collected. The destructive distillation of wood to give methanol {{is the root of}} its common name – wood alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is {{the process}} for producing ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called <b>pyrolysis</b> gasoline. <b>Pyrolysis</b> gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes).|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to <b>pyrolysis</b> is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).|$|E
25|$|Biochar {{is created}} by the <b>pyrolysis</b> of biomass, and is under {{investigation}} {{as a method of}} carbon sequestration.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, the French chemist E. Caventou {{isolated}} {{a previously}} unknown hydrocarbon from the <b>pyrolysis</b> of amyl alcohol. This hydrocarbon {{was identified as}} butadiene in 1886, after Henry Edward Armstrong isolated it from among the <b>pyrolysis</b> products of petroleum. In 1910, the Russian chemist Sergei Lebedev polymerized butadiene and obtained a material with rubber-like properties. This polymer was, however, found to be too soft to replace natural rubber in many applications, notably automobile tires.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyrolysis</b> is {{the thermal}} {{decomposition}} of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample {{is put into}} direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600–1000°C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. <b>Pyrolysis</b> GC chromatograms are typically complex because {{a wide range of}} different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the GC/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information. To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before <b>pyrolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fly ash, when {{treated with}} sodium hydroxide, appears to {{function}} {{well as a}} catalyst for converting polyethylene into substance similar to crude oil in a high-temperature process called <b>pyrolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|ILs, {{especially}} imidazolium-based ILs {{have been}} found effective in pretreatment of coal before use in applications such as <b>pyrolysis</b> and gasification. Pretreatment with ionic liquids causes 'swelling' of the coal structure, allowing better gasification.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyrolysis</b> gas {{chromatography}} mass spectrometry {{is a method}} of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by {{gas chromatography}} and detected using mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|Biochar {{stability}} {{as a form}} {{of charcoal}} is due to its formation. The process of <b>pyrolysis,</b> the burning of organic material at high temperatures, and very low oxygen levels results in a porous char rich and ash poor product.|$|E
25|$|La2O3 films can be {{deposited}} by {{many different}} methods, including: chemical vapor disposition, atomic layer deposition, thermal oxidation, sputtering, and spray <b>pyrolysis.</b> Depositions {{of these films}} occur in a temperature range of 250–450°C. Polycrystalline films are formed at 350°C.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to waste reduction and recycling strategies, {{there are various}} alternatives to landfills, including waste-to-energy incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting, mechanical biological treatment, <b>pyrolysis</b> and plasma arc gasification. Depending on local economics and incentives, these can be made more financially attractive than landfills.|$|E
25|$|An alcohol {{may also}} be {{converted}} to a better leaving group (e.g., xanthate), so as to allow a milder syn-elimination such as the Chugaev elimination and the Grieco elimination. Related reactions include eliminations by β-haloethers (the Boord olefin synthesis) and esters (ester <b>pyrolysis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen cyanide is {{produced}} by the combustion or <b>pyrolysis</b> of certain materials under oxygen-deficient conditions. For example, it can be detected in the exhaust of internal combustion engines and tobacco smoke. Certain plastics, especially those derived from acrylonitrile, release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.|$|E
25|$|An {{adaption}} of {{this method}} {{is to determine the}} non-exchangeable (C-H) and exchangeable hydrogen (bounds to other elements, e.g. O, S and N) in organic matter. The samples are equilibrated with water in sealed autosampler carousels at 115 oC and then transferred into <b>pyrolysis</b> EA followed by IRMS measurement.|$|E
25|$|GC-interface (combustion or <b>pyrolysis)</b> is also {{an online}} {{preparation}} method followed by IRMS detection. This is a 'compound-specific' method, allowing separation of analytes prior to measurement and thus providing information about the isotopic composition of each individual compound. Following GC separation, samples are converted to smaller gaseous molecules for isotope measurements. GC/pyrolysis uses the <b>pyrolysis</b> interface between GC and IRMS for the conversion of H and O in the molecules into H2 and CO. GC-IRMS was first introduced by Matthews and Hayes in the late 1970s, and was later used for δ13C, δ15N, δ18O and δ34S. Helium is used as the carrier gas in the GC systems. However, the separation of DH (m/z=3) signal from the tail of 4He+ beam was problematic due to the intense signal of 4He+. During the early 1990s, intense efforts were made in solving the difficulties to measure δD by GC/pyrolysis-IRMS. In 1999, Hilkert et al. developed a robust method by integrating the high temperature conversion (TC) into GC-IRMS and adding a pre-cup electrostatic sector and a retardation lens {{in front of the}} m/z=3 cup collector. Several different groups were working on this at the same time. This GC/pyrolysis-IRMS based on TC has been widely used for δD measurement nowadays. The commercial products of GC-IRMS include both combustion and <b>pyrolysis</b> interfaces so that δ13C and δD can be measured simultaneously.|$|E
