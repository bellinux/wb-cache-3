40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{descriptive}} survey research was to identify and prioritize the <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> of Jordanian vocational secondary teachers based on perceptions of current vocational secondary teachers, principals, and supervisors. The secondary purposes of this research were: (1) to identify differences in perceptions among current vocational secondary teachers, principals, and supervisors pertaining to the <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> of vocational secondary teachers, and (2) to verify differences in perceptions among current vocational secondary teachers with regard to selected demographic characteristics (gender, experience, qualification, specialization, secondary education, graduation country, and geographical region). ^ A survey questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire included 95 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> and seven questions regarding demographic characteristics. Two panels of experts from the U. S. A. and Jordan established content validity of the questionnaire. Reliability of the questionnaire was computed by Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha coefficient. The questionnaire was administered {{to a total of}} 213 vocational secondary teachers, principals, and supervisors. ^ Using a five-point Likert-type scale, participants rated the importance and performance level of the 95 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies.</b> In addition, participants provided information regarding seven demographic characteristics. Descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as two needs assessment models, were utilized to analyze the data. ^ Major findings were: (1) all 95 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> were rated as being “important” or “very important” to the success of vocational secondary teachers by vocational secondary teachers, principals, and supervisors, (2) the three groups contrasted in terms of rating the ability of vocational secondary teachers to perform the 95 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies,</b> (3) the perceptions of the three groups differed statistically on the 95 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies,</b> and (4) the demographic characteristics of vocational secondary teachers did not statistically influence their perceptions of the 95 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies.</b> Based on these findings, it was recommended that the sequence of 95 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> should form the basis for developing vocational teacher education programs in Jordan. In addition, the <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> rated as having high discrepancy scores between importance level and performance level should form the priorities for in-service training programs of vocational secondary teachers in Jordan. ...|$|R

40|$|Active {{learning}} is a popular concept for motivating learning. Learning agreements are one strategy towards this goal. They {{can be used to}} aid the students to take ownership of their learning and in becoming more active in a course. Learning Agreements are especially useful tools for scaffolding learning in courses with a focus on developing the <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> of students, such as in Open Ended Group Projects, Work Integrated Learning or other authentic learning contexts. Such educational contexts are complex and we have found it necessary to scaffold student learning using agreements based on <b>professional</b> <b>competencies.</b> This has led to a pedagogical framework, which has found successful application in a number of contexts. This framework has been built based on discussions with students, and has involved the development of a supporting wiki which contains descriptions of the different <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> involved in the learning agreement. The IT based framework has been iteratively developed together with the students taking the course in the fall of 2015. The development and assessment of this framework is contrasted in the context of two courses using learning agreements, one (in Sweden) with a focus on development of <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> and the other (in New Zealand) addressing a mix of <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> and subject knowledge in a work integrated learning setting...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of structure {{and importance of}} <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> of teachers has been addressed {{by a number of}} pedagogues. The matter has been approached from different perspectives and numerous models were generated. Though a uniform definition has not been reached so far, in essence, all the models express the same fact: the preparedness and readiness of teachers for their profession. The aim of the thesis is to point out the possibility of changes in the perception of <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> of teachers in kindergarten with age and length of their professional experience. The theoretical part deals with the concept of <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> of kindergarten teachers in the current changing role of pre-school teachers. It mainly introduces the general concept of competence, professional competence and features their definition, meaning and structure. Concurrently it presents several models of <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> by leading experts. It further describes the formation process of these skills during the preparation of pre-school teachers to their profession. Subsequently, it warns against the routine practices carried out in the kindergartens and outlines the main skills that could help preventing them. The practical part is processed using the method of questionnaire survey of kindergarten teachers. The questionnaire aims to determine how the <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> are perceived by the teachers in relation to their age and length of practice and to map and describe some routine practices that tend to persist in the Czech kindergartens...|$|R

40|$|Background: For {{more than}} a decade, the {{development}} of <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> {{has been at the}} heart of curriculum reforms in Education and Health care training worldwide. Reference documents of competencies have been developed in Australia (Brownie, Thomas, McAllister, & Groves, 2014), Canada (Boucher & Ste-Marie, 2013; Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, 2005), United-States (Hurd & Buschbom, 2010), and in Europe (Battel-Kirk, Van der Zanden & al., 2012). In most of these reference documents, the number of <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> that a <b>professional</b> must acquire does not exceed twenty. However, in the field of kinesiology, the College of Kinesiologists of Ontario (CKO) (2013) has defined 54 <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> required for admittance to the College. Objective: The purpose of this research project aims to identify, from the standpoint of university instructors who teach in a kinesiology program, the <b>professional</b> <b>competencies</b> that are considered the 17 most relevant from those suggested by CKO. Methodology: Participants (N= 23) were required to complete an online survey on the domain www. SurveyMonkey. com {{in order to determine the}} competencies deemed most important by them. Results: The quantitative data obtained through the use of the surveys allowed for a list of 17 competencies to be retained at the end of the study. The qualitative data provided by the participants supported and complemented the quantitative data.
