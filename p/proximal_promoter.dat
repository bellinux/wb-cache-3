RESULTS: We describe a word-counting-based tool for de novo tissue-specific {{transcription factor}} binding site discovery using expression information in addition to sequence information. We incorporate tissue-specific gene expression through gene classification to positive expression and repressed expression. We present a direct statistical approach to find overrepresented transcription factor binding sites in a foreground promoter sequence set against a background promoter sequence set. Our approach naturally extends to synergistic transcription factor binding site search. We find putative transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of liver-specific genes relative to <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of liver-independent genes. Our results indicate that binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factors (especially HNF- 1 and HNF- 4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPbeta) are the most overrepresented in <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of liver-specific genes. Our results suggest that HNF- 4 has strong synergistic relationships with HNF- 1, HNF- 4 and HNF- 3 beta and with C/EBPbeta. AVAILABILITY: Programs are available for use over the Web at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Transposable {{elements}} are potent agents of genomic change during evolution, but require access to chromatin for insertion-and not all genes provide equivalent access. To test whether the regulatory features of heat-shock genes render their <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> especially {{susceptible to the}} insertion of transposable elements in nature, we conducted an unbiased screen of the <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of 18 heat-shock genes in 48 natural populations of Drosophila. More than 200 distinctive transposable elements had inserted into these promoters; greater than 96 % are P elements. By contrast, few or no P element insertions segregate in natural populations in a "negative control" set of <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> lacking the distinctive regulatory features of heat-shock genes. P element transpositions into these same genes during laboratory mutagenesis recapitulate these findings. The natural P element insertions cluster in specific sites in the promoters, with up to eight populations exhibiting P element insertions at the same position; laboratory insertions are into similar sites. By contrast, a "positive control" set of promoters resembling heat-shock promoters in regulatory features harbors few P element insertions in nature, but many insertions after experimental transposition in the laboratory. We conclude that the distinctive regulatory features that typify heat-shock genes (in Drosophila) are especially prone to mutagenesis via P elements in nature. Thus in nature, P elements create significant and distinctive variation in heat-shock genes, upon which evolutionary processes may act...|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive {{identification}} of cis-regulatory elements {{is necessary for}} accurately reconstructing gene regulatory networks. We studied <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of human and mouse genes with differential expression across 56 terminally differentiated tissues. Using in silico techniques to discover, evaluate, and model interactions among sequence elements, we systematically identified regulatory modules that distinguish elevated from inhibited expression in the corresponding transcripts. We used these putative regulatory modules to construct a single predictive model {{for each of the}} 56 tissues. These predictors distinguish tissue-specific elevated from inhibited expression with statistical significance in 80 % of the tissues (45 of 56). The predictors also reveal synergy between cis-regulatory modules and explain large-scale tissue-specific differential expression. For testis and liver, the predictors include computationally predicted motifs. For most other tissues, the predictors reveal synergy between experimentally verified motifs and indicate genes that are regulated by similar tissue-specific machinery.

40|$|The pregnane X {{receptor}} (PXR) {{is known}} as the xenosensing re-ceptor responsible for coordinated regulation of metabolic genes in response to diverse xenobiotic challenges. In particular, the ability of the PXR to regulate CYP 3 A 4, the enzyme capable of metabolizing more than 60 % of all pharmaceuticals, defines its metabolic impor-tance. Currently the list of PXR ligands and target genes is extensive, yet investigations into the regulation and expression of PXRs are few. After an initial review of available sequence data, we discovered discrepancies in the 5 untranslated region (UTR) and transcriptional start site (TSS) characterizations of the human PXR gene and subsequently endeavored to define TSSs and <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> for isoforms PXR 1 and PXR 2. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and primer extension experiments performed on RNA from human liver identified two TSSs for each receptor iso-form. These results extended the 5 UTR sequence of each isoform and defined new <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> for both. Candidate response elements for liver-enriched transcription factors and other recep-tors were found in both <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters.</b> Quantitative PCR from human liver illustrated a highly variable expression profile for total PXRs; yet PXR 2 expression represented a consistent 2 to 5 % of total PXR expression, despite the observed variability. Transfec-tion experiments demonstrated that PXR 1 and PXR 2 had compa-rable abilities to transcriptionally activate the CYP 3 A 4 promoter. Collectively, comparable function, consistent expression, and in-dependent regulation suggest that PXR 2 is capable of contributing to the cumulative function of PXRs and {{should be included in the}} larger investigations of PXR expression and regulation.

We found several conserved cis elements in the frog CRF genes including a cAMP response element (CRE), activator protein 1 binding sites, and glucocorticoid response elements.

50|$|Regulatory {{sequences}} {{are located}} at the extremities of genes. These sequence regions can either be next to the transcribed region (the promoter) or separated by many kilobases (enhancers and silencers).

The core promoter marks the start site for transcription by binding RNA polymerase and other proteins necessary for copying DNA to RNA.

Genes may be regulated by multiple enhancer and silencer sequences that further modify the activity of promoters by binding activator or repressor proteins.

Galactoglucan (EPS II) is produced under phosphate starvation {{but also in the}} presence of extra copies of the transcriptional regulator WggR (ExpG) or as a consequence of a mutation in mucR. The galactoglucan biosynthesis gene cluster contains the operons wga (expA), wge (expE), wgd (expD), and wggR (expG). Two promoters, differentially controlled by WggR, PhoB, and MucR, were identified upstream of each of these operons. The <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of the wga, wge, and wgd transcription units were constitutively active when separated from the upstream regulatory sequences.

40|$|Treatment of 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes with {{differentiation}} inducers {{triggers a}} cascade in which C/EBPβ is rapidly expressed, followed by C/EBPα and PPARγ. C/EBPα and PPARγ then activate {{the expression of}} adipocyte genes that produce the differentiated phenotype. Circumstantial evidence indicates that C/EBPβ activates transcription of the C/EBPα and PPARγ genes, both of which possess C/EBP regulatory elements in their <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters.</b> Although C/EBPβ is expressed immediately upon induction of differentiation, acquisition of DNA binding activity is delayed for ∼ 14 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis conducted 24 h after induction revealed that C/EBPβ binds to C/EBP regulatory elements in the <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of the C/EBPα and PPARγ genes. After an additional delay ChIP analysis showed that C/EBPα binds to its own promoter and to the promoters of the PPARγ and 422 /aP 2 genes.

Whereas proalpha 1 (I) and proalpha 2 (I) collagen RNAs were present in BALB/ 3 T 3 fibroblasts and primary fibroblasts, these RNAs could not be detected in the three other cell lines.

In contrast, in vivo footprints over these <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> were cell-specific, occurring only in fibroblast cells and not in the other three cell types. The in vivo footprints were generally located within the in vitro footprinted regions. Our results suggest that although all cell types tested contained nuclear proteins that can bind to the proximal proalpha 1 (I) and proalpha 2 (I) collagen promoters in vitro, it is only in fibroblasts that these proteins bind to their cognate sites in vivo.

Evidence suggests that the SCPx protein is a peroxisome-associated thiolase that is involved in the oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, while the SCP2 protein is thought to be an intracellular lipid transfer protein. Alternative splicing of this gene produces multiple transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms. The full-length nature of all transcript variants has not been determined.|$|E

Promoters are sequences of DNA that allows proteins such as transcription factors to bind for gene expression, and when the sequences are modified, the proteins no longer bind as effectively, resulting in depressed level of gene expression. APOM is partly responsible for producing pre beta-high-density lipoprotein and cholesterol, and APM1 is responsible for regulating glucose level in blood and fatty acid. Decreasing the level these gene products reduce the body's ability to handle glucose, which leads to the increased risk of diabetes.|$|E

40|$|Assessing the {{contribution}} of promoters and coding sequences to gene evolution {{is an important step}} toward discovering the major genetic determinants of human evolution. Many specific examples have revealed the evolutionary importance of cis-regulatory regions. However, the relative contribution of regulatory and coding regions to the evolutionary process and whether systemic factors differentially influence their evolution remains unclear. To address these questions, we carried out an analysis at the genome scale to identify signatures of positive selection in human <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters.</b> Next, we examined whether genes with positively selected promoters (Prom+ genes) show systemic differences with respect to a set of genes with positively selected protein-coding regions (Cod+ genes). We found that the number of genes in each set was not significantly different (8. 1 % and 8. 5 %, respectively). Furthermore, a functional analysis showed that, in both cases, positive selection affects almost all biological processes and only a few genes of each group are located in enriched categories, indicating that promoters and coding regions are not evolutionarily specialized with respect to gene function. On the other hand, we show that the topology of the human protein network has a different influence on the molecular evolution of <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> and coding regions. Notably, Prom+ genes have an unexpectedly high centrality when compared with a reference distribution (P = 0. 008, for Eigenvalue centrality).

40|$|Tight {{regulation}} of MHC class I gene expression {{is critical for}} CD 8 T cell activation and host adaptive-immune responses. The promoters of MHC class I genes contain a well-conserved core module, the W/S-X-Y motif, which assembles a nucleoprotein complex termed MHC enhanceosome. A member of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein family, NLRC 5, is a newly identified transcriptional regulator of MHC class I genes. NLRC 5 associates with and transactivates the <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> of MHC class I genes, although the molecular mechanism of transactivation has not been understood. In this article, we show that NLRC 5 -mediated MHC class I gene induction requires the W/S and X 1, X 2 cis-regulatory elements. The transcription factors RFX 5, RFXAP, and RFXANK/B, which compose the RFX protein complex and associate with the X 1 box, cooperate with NLRC 5 for MHC class I expression. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that NLRC 5 specifically interacts with the RFX subunit RFXANK/B via its ankyrin repeats. In addition, we show that NLRC 5 can cooperate with ATF 1 and the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p 300 and general control nonderepressible 5, which display histone acetyltransferase activity. Taken together, our data suggest that NLRC 5 participates in an MHC class I-specific enhanceosome, which assembles on the conserved W/S-X-Y core module of the MHC class I <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters,</b> including the RFX factor components and CREB/ATF 1 family transcription factors, to promote MHC class I gene expression.

50|$|CYP3A4 is {{induced by}} {{a wide variety of}} ligands. These ligands bind to the pregnane X {{receptor}} (PXR). The activated PXR complex forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which binds to the XREM region of the CYP3A4 gene. XREM is a regulatory region of the CYP3A4 gene, and binding causes a cooperative interaction with <b>proximal</b> <b>promoter</b> regions of the gene, resulting in increased transcription and expression of CYP3A4. Activation of the PXR/RXR heterodimer initiates transcription of the CYP3A4 promoter region and gene. Ligand binding increases when in the presence of CYP3A4 ligands, such as in the presence of aflatoxin B1, M1, and G1. Indeed, due to the enzyme's large and malleable active site, it is possible for the enzyme to bind multiple ligands at once, leading to potentially detrimental side effects.|$|E

Nonetheless, though both genes possess ten exons and nine introns, the sizes of their introns may differ by ~2 kb, with the largest intron in PCK2 spanning 2.5 kb. Altogether, the total length of the PCK2 gene spans ~10 kb. Another difference {{is the presence of}} Alu sequences in its introns that are absent in PCK1.

In the general population this level varies from about 1. 5 to 3. 5 g/l. This variation between individuals is influenced by genotype, suggesting there are genetic variants contributing to fibrinogen levels which reside in fibrinogen regulatory loci. A complete picture of how fibrinogen genes are regulated will therefore point towards novel sources of regulatory variants. In this review we discuss regulation of the fibrinogen genes from <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters</b> and enhancers, the influence of acute-phase stimulation, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs and functional regulatory variants identified in genetic studies.

Here, we demonstrate that, in transformed hematopoietic cells, STAT 5 and p 53 must be synergistically bound to chromatin for induction of LPP/miR- 28 transcription. Genome-wide association studies show that both STAT 5 and p 53 are co-localized on the chromatin at 463 genomic positions in <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters.</b> Chromatin binding of p 53 is dependent on persistent STAT 5 activation at these <b>proximal</b> <b>promoters.</b> The transcriptional activity of selected promoters bound by STAT 5 and p 53 was significantly changed upon STAT 5 or p 53 inhibition.
