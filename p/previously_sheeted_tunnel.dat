30|$|Coal mining in the Bowen Basin has massively {{altered the}} {{structure}} of this landscape, particularly {{over the course of}} mounding large quantities of spoil material across tens of thousands of hectares where there was once relatively flat country. Some of the notable dilemmas faced by rehabilitation practitioners working in this environment are that the soils and spoils of the region are often dispersive and require a rapid vegetation cover to ensure that they are protected from erosion forces, particularly heavy rainfall events during summer (Carroll and Tucker 2000; Arnold et al. 2013). The use of fast growing exotic species as vegetation cover, such as buffel and Rhodes grasses (C. gayana), combined with high dosage applications of N/P fertiliser at most sites in the Bowen Basin (Roe et al. 1996) has ensured that these species provide some level of erosion protection at the expense of slower growing native species, and, of course, to the detriment of mine closure expectations that require re-instatement of natural/native ecosystems. Even with these measures, uniformly and steeply sloped landforms, poorer soil chemical properties, combined with the unknown traits of the underlying spoil material, make the stability of most of these landforms uncertain. As erosion {{has proven to be a}} challenging parameter to measure consistently (Evans et al. 2000 a, b) this analysis could not effectively examine efforts that have been attempted at different mine sites. Nevertheless, gully, <b>sheet,</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and pipe erosion were regularly documented (also illustrated in Figures  3 d,e) and the consequences of active erosion regularly requires maintenance at most sites (CMLR 20002002, 2003; Tuck et al. 2006).|$|R

40|$|Why is it {{difficult}} to refold a <b>previously</b> folded <b>sheet</b> of paper? We show that even crease patterns with only one designed folding motion inevitably contain an exponential number of `distractor' folding branches accessible from a bifurcation at the flat state. Consequently, refolding a sheet requires finding the ground state in a glassy energy landscape with an exponential number of other attractors of higher energy, much like in models of protein folding (Levinthal's paradox) and other NP-hard satisfiability (SAT) problems. As in these problems, we find that refolding a sheet requires actuation at multiple carefully chosen creases. We show that seeding successful folding in this way can {{be understood in terms}} of sub-patterns that fold when cut out (`folding islands'). Besides providing guidelines for the placement of active hinges in origami applications, our results point to fundamental limits on the programmability of energy landscapes in sheets.

40|$|Groups {{of animals}} often tend to arrange {{themselves}} in flocks that have characteristic spatial attributes and temporal dynamics. Using a dynamic continuum {{model for a}} flock of individuals, we find equilibria of finite spatial extent where the density goes continuously to zero at a well-defined flock edge, and we discuss conditions on the model that allow for such solutions. We also demonstrate conditions under which, as the flock size increases, the interior density in our equilibria tends to an approximately uniform value. Motivated by observations of starling flocks that are relatively thin in a direction transverse to the direction of flight, we investigate the stability of infinite, planar-sheet flock equilibria. We find that long- wavelength perturbations along the sheet are unstable for the class of models that we investigate. This has the conjectured consequence that sheet-like flocks of arbitrarily large transverse extent relative to their thickness do not occur. However, we also show that our model admits approximately sheet-like, 'pancake-shaped', three-dimensional ellipsoidal equilibria with definite aspect ratios (transverse length- scale to flock thickness) determined by anisotropic perceptual/response characteristics of the flocking individuals, and we argue that these pancake-like equilibria are stable to the <b>previously</b> mentioned <b>sheet</b> instability.

The lake occupies a lateral valley, dammed by the westernmost flow band of Skeiðarárjökull, {{one of the largest}} outlets of Vatnajökull ice cap. During the period of investigation Skeiðarárjökull was affected by three flood events draining subglacially under this outlet: Two jökulhlaups originating from Grímsvötn (29 / 10 until 07 / 11 / 2004 and 04 / 03 - 14 / 03 / 2005) and a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) of Grænalón (07 / 08 – 14 / 08 / 2005). It was found that changes of the lake surface area and the calving front position are in phase during the two jökulhlaups originating from Grímsvötn. Therefore it seems likely, that lake Grænalón and the western flow band of Skeiðarárjökull are affected by such phenomena.

We {{present results}} of our wide-field {{redshift}} survey of galaxies in a 285 square degree region of the Shapley Supercluster (SSC), based {{on a set of}} 10529 velocity measurements (including 1201 new ones) on 8632 galaxies obtained from various telescopes and from the literature. Our data reveal that the main plane of the SSC (v ≈ 14500 kms − 1) extends further than previous estimates, filling the whole extent of our survey region of 12 degrees by 30 degrees on the sky (30 × 75 h − 1 Mpc). There is also a connecting structure associated with the slightly nearer Abell 3571 cluster complex (v ≈ 12000 kms − 1). These galaxies seem to link two <b>previously</b> identified <b>sheets</b> of galaxies and establish a connection with a third one at v = 15000 km s − 1 near R. A. = 13 h. They also tend to fill the gap of galaxies between the foreground Hydra-Centaurus region and the more distant 2 D. Proust et al. : Shapley Supercluster SSC. In the velocity range of the Shapley Supercluster (9000 kms − 1 < cz < 18000 km s − 1), we found redshift-space overdensities with bj < 17. 5 of ≃ 5. 4 over the 225 square degree central region and ≃ 3. 8 in a 192 square degre...|$|R
40|$|In {{present study}} bioassays {{conducted}} on Helicoverpa armigera neonates (F 2). Pupae surviving from each host specific colony were maintained as <b>previously</b> described. Egg <b>sheets</b> were harvested daily and placed into plastic bags. Upon eclosion, 200 F 2 Helicoverpa armigera 90 neonates were offered leaves (< 5 cm) harvested from Bollgard ® and conventional cotton plant terminals {{and held in}} petri dishes. Treatment was arranged in a randomized complete block design where d of larval eclosion constituted blocks. All Helicoverpa armigera developmental stages were maintained at 27 ± 2 o C and 85 ± 5 % relative humidity. Helicoverpa armigera larval mortality on Bollgard ® and conventional cotton plants was compared among the different host specific colonies 96 hrs after exposure to cotton tissue. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was made by using IBM ® SPSS, also means were separated according to Tukey’s Studentized Range Test...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} an innovative method for the hydrophobization of cellulosic material by impregnation with an enzymatically obtained functionalization solution (FS). Application of FS {{to the surface}} of <b>previously</b> formed cellulose <b>sheets</b> was found to confer them hydrophobic properties. The absorbance of functionalized sheets was assessed with the water-drop test (WDT), and their hydrophobicity from their contact angle (WCA) and the surface free energy (SFE) as determined with a goniophotometer. The proposed method is an effective choice for the hydrophobization of paper sheets, with absorption times of up to 4000 s and WCA values around 130 °. Treating eucalyptus paper sheets dramatically decreased SFE (from 55 to 10 mJ/m 2), and evidences on the grafting of the FS onto the cellulosic sheets were assessed by using ATR-FTIR. The stability of FS and the control solutions was characterized in terms of Z potential and light scattering measurementsPostprint (published version...|$|R
