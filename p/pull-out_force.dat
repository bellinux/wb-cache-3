40|$|The <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> of some {{outer walls}} against other inner walls in {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was systematically studied by molecular mechanics simulations. The obtained results {{reveal that the}} <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> {{is proportional to the}} square of the diameter of the immediate outer wall on the sliding interface, which highlights the primary contribution of the capped section of MWCNT to the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force.</b> A simple empirical formula was proposed based on the numerical results to predict the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> for an arbitrary pull-out in a given MWCNT directly from the diameter of the immediate outer wall on the sliding interface. Moreover, tensile tests for MWCNTs with and without acid-treatment were performed with a nanomanipulator inside a vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to validate the present empirical formula. It was found that the theoretical pull-out forces agree with the present and some previous experimental results very well...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{address the}} growing {{incidence}} of hip replacement revision, this project aimed {{to find a}} stem that would fulfil three criteria. First, solid osteointegration and long survival of the implant. Second, easy removal, if deemed necessary. Third, little or no bone loss {{at the time of}} revision to facilitate the implantation of the revision stem. Methods: A stem of our own design was implanted in two animal series. Study 1 was performed in 2006, and 12 goats were operated upon. Study 2 was performed in 2008 and included 35 goats. In both studies, the goats were observed for 6 months, and full weight-bearing was permitted. After the goats were euthanised, the stems were randomised to drilling or no drilling of the area of osteointegration and tested biomechanically for differences in <b>pull-out</b> <b>force.</b> In Study 1, the implants were coated with calcium phosphate (CP); in Study 2, hydroxyapatite (HA) was used instead. Histological analysis was performed in both studies. Results: A significantly lower <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> was observed in Study 2 after drilling in the area of osteointegration (mean, 1526 N vs. 2033 N, p = 0. 028). The calcium phosphate coating was inferior in performance to hydroxyapatite regarding bone apposition and <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> (CP mean, 174 N vs. HA 1526 N, p = 0. 003). No correlation of the bone apposition evaluated by histology and <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> was observed. In addition, there were no signs of inflammation. Conclusion: A significant effect of drilling longitudinally orientated grooves in a femoral stem in goats to reduce <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> was observed. The hydroxyapatite coating appears preferable to calcium phosphate on TiAl 6 V 4 -loaded implants with respect to bone apposition and <b>pull-out</b> <b>force.</b> Bone growth towards the femoral stem was not correlated with the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> of the implant. </p...|$|E

40|$|Study Design. The {{insertion}} {{torque and}} <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> after cyclic loading of the bicortical sacral pedicle screw through the S 1 endplate were tested using human cadaveric specimens. Objectives. The {{purpose of this}} study was to (1) evaluate the effect of cyclic loading on the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> of two different techniques of bicortical sacral pedicle screw fixation and (2) to correlate the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> after cyclic loading with the screw insertion torque. Summary of Background Data. Biomechanical studies using conventional sacral pedicle screw fixation techniques have demonstrated reduction in stiffness and strength after cyclic loading. Technical difficulties with anterior sacral cortex penetration and frequent screw loosening have been reported in clinical studies. In the authors' center, a new method of sacral pedicle screw fixation bicortically through the S 1 endplate has been used successfully in the clinical setting. However, the mechanical stability of this new technique after undergoing cyclic loading has not been documented in the literature. Methods. Seven-millimeter compact Cotrel-Dubousset sacral screws were randomly assigned by side (left vs. right) and inserted bicortically either anteromedially through the anterior sacral cortex or superiorly through the S 1 endplate of 17 fresh frozen human sacrum. The tk; 4 maximum insertion torque for each screw was measured. Cyclic loading from 40 N to 400 N was applied to each screw at a frequency of 2 Hz for 20, 000 cycles. Pull-out tests were conducted after completion of the cyclic tests. Results. The mean maximum insertion torque and mean <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> following cyclic loading were significantly higher for bicortical fixation through the S 1 endplate (mean 3. 17 N·m and 1457 N) than bicortical fixation through the anterior sacral cortex (mean 1. 98 N·m and 1122 N). Both S 1 endplate and anterior cortical fixation techniques demonstrated significant correlations between insertion torque and <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> following cyclic loading. Conclusions. In sacral pedicle screw fixation, screw trajectory through the S 1 endplate was significantly stronger than screws penetrating the anterior sacral cortex. Insertion torque was a good intraoperative indicator of screw <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> after cyclic loading. © 2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND While {{convergent}} {{placement of}} pedicle screws in the axial plane {{is known to}} be more advantageous biomechanically, surgeons intuitively aim toward a parallel placement of screws in the sagittal plane. It is however not clear whether parallel placement of screws in the sagittal plane is biomechanically superior to a non-parallel construct. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} sagittal non-parallel pedicle screws do not have an inferior initial pull-out strength compared to parallel placed screws. METHODS The established lumbar calf spine model was used for determination of pull-out strength in parallel and non-parallel intersegmental pedicle screw constructs. Each of six lumbar calf spines (L 1 -L 6) was divided into three levels: L 1 /L 2, L 3 /L 4 and L 5 /L 6. Each segment was randomly instrumented with pedicle screws (6 / 45 mm) with either the standard technique of sagittal parallel or non-parallel screw placement, respectively, under fluoroscopic control. CT was used to verify the intrapedicular positioning of all screws. The maximum <b>pull-out</b> <b>forces</b> and type of failure were registered and compared between the groups. RESULTS The <b>pull-out</b> <b>forces</b> were 5, 394 N (range 4, 221 N to 8, 342 N) for the sagittal non-parallel screws and 5, 263 N (range 3, 589 N to 7, 554 N) for the sagittal-parallel screws (p[*]=[*] 0. 838). Interlevel comparisons also showed no statistically significant differences between the groups with no relevant difference in failure mode. CONCLUSION Non-parallel pedicle screws in the sagittal plane have at least equal initial fixation strength compared to parallel pedicle screws in the setting of the here performed cadaveric calf spine experiments...|$|R
30|$|TPSF of the {{cervical}} spine {{was proposed}} {{because of the}} limited biomechanical stability of the commonly used posterior plating techniques. The preferred site of screw placement for posterior plating is the lateral mass [14]. The small amount of bony purchase available in the lateral mass results in biomechanical instability leading to loosening or avulsion of the screw [3]. A significantly higher resistance to <b>pull-out</b> <b>forces,</b> lower rate of loosening and higher strength after fatigue testing were observed with cervical pedicle screws compared to lateral mass screws during biomechanical investigations [3, 15]. In addition, screw-related complications, such as screw loosening, loss of reduction, pseudarthrosis and revision surgery were more commonly reported with lateral mass screws in the subaxial spine [16]. Accordingly, TPSF is being commonly used nowadays.|$|R

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Sclerostin is {{produced}} by osteocytes and is an inhibitor of bone formation. Thus, inhibition of sclerostin by a monoclonal antibody increases bone formation and improves fracture repair. Sclerostin expression is upregulated in unloaded bone and is downregulated by loading. We wanted to determine whether an anti-sclerostin antibody would stimulate metaphyseal healing in unloaded bone in a rat model. Methods 10 -week-old male rats (n = 48) were divided into 4 groups, with 12 in each. In 24 rats, the right hind limb was unloaded by paralyzing the calf and thigh muscles with an injection of botulinum toxin A (Botox). 3 days later, all the animals had a steel screw inserted into the right proximal tibia. Starting 3 days after screw insertion, either anti-sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) or saline was given twice weekly. The other 24 rats did not receive Botox injections and they were treated with Scl-Ab or saline to serve as normal-loaded controls. Screw <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> was measured 4 weeks after insertion, {{as an indicator of}} the regenerative response of bone to trauma.

40|$|Abstract Systematic atomic {{simulations}} {{based on}} molecular mechanics {{are carried out}} to investigate the pull-out behavior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in CNT-reinforced nanocomposites. In contrast with open-ended CNT, capped CNT is incorporated into the current computational model to explore {{the effect of the}} CNT cap for the first time. Two common cases are discussed: the pull-out of a whole CNT from a polymer matrix in a CNT/Polymer nanocomposite, and the pull-out of the broken outer walls against the intact inner walls of a CNT (i. e., sword-in-sheath mode) in a CNT/Alumina nanocomposite. By analyzing the obtained relationship between energy increment and pull-out displacement, a set of simple empirical formulae is proposed to predict the corresponding <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> from the nanotube diameter. The obtained <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> agrees well with experimental measurement.

30|$|During the ACL {{reconstruction}} surgery, usually smaller tunnel diameter {{than the}} screw diameter is drilled into the bone to provide better fixation strength. In fact, the frictional force between the peripheral {{surface of the}} screw thread and the inner surface of tunnel {{plays an important role}} for this purpose. In this study, for the 10  mm diameter produced screw, different tunnel diameters including 7, 8, 9 and 10  mm were selected and drilled into the PU foams to evaluate the best condition for fixation strength. As it can be seen in Fig.  3 b, it seems that there is an optimum condition for <b>pull-out</b> <b>force.</b> When the tunnel diameter was changed from 10 to 9  mm, the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> has increased to about 12  %, which is probably due to the aforementioned frictional forces, but by mostly reducing the tunnel diameter to 8 and 7  mm, the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> reduced to 16 and 50  % for 8 and 7  mm tunnel diameter, respectively. It seems that low density and low mechanical properties of PU test blocks have resulted in dilation of holes during insertion of screws in smaller holes and so unexpectedly have reduced the pull-out forces. In addition, the screw dislocation in the test blocks can affect the value of <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> during insertion. On the other hand, as it can be seen in Fig.  3 a, with increasing the tunnel diameter the insertion torque has decreased. It seems that any parameter that decreases the frictional force in screw insertion will decrease the insertion torque (Battula et al. 2008).|$|E

The present study investigated the impact performance of five styles of Kevlar fabrics K 310, K 706, K 720, K 745 and K 779 from Hexcel. The fabrics are different in many aspects, i. e., weight per square meter, yarn counts, yarn size, Kevlar fiber type, friction and breaking strength. Silica nanoparticles were impregnated into the fabric to enhance the ballistic impact performance. The fabric impregnated with nanoparticles exhibit significant enhancement in impact performance over their neat counterparts. Fabrics experience large deformation under impact. More or less yarn pull-out was observed on all the fabrics. The in-plane yarn <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> has good correlation to the impact performance: fabrics with higher <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> performed better in impact tests. A two-dimensional finite element model was proposed to simulate the single yarn pull-out procedure and predict the maximum <b>pull-out</b> <b>force.</b> The most important fabric features are included in this model: yarn count, yarn size, fabric thickness, yarn waviness, fiber modulus, fiber diameter and coefficients of friction et al.

40|$|Stimulation of bone {{formation}} by PTH {{is related to}} mechanosensitivity. The response to PTH treatment in intact bone could therefore be blunted by unloading. We studied the effects of mechanical loading on the response to PTH treatment in bone healing. Most fractures occur in the metaphyses, therefor we used a model for metaphyseal bone injury. One hind leg of 20 male SD rats was unloaded via intramuscular botulinum toxin injections. Two weeks later, the proximal unloaded tibia had lost 78 % of its trabecular contents. At this time-point, the rats received bilateral proximal tibiae screw implants. Ten of the 20 rats were given daily injections of 5 μg/kg PTH (1 - 34). After two weeks of healing, screw fixation was measured by pull-out, and microCT of the distal femur cancellous compartment was performed. <b>Pull-out</b> <b>force</b> provided an estimate for cancellous {{bone formation}} after trauma. PTH more than doubled the <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> in the unloaded limbs (from 14 to 30 N), but increased it by less than half in the loaded ones (from 30 to 44 N). In relative terms, PTH had a stronger effect on <b>pull-out</b> <b>force</b> in unloaded bone than in loaded bone (p= 0. 03). The results suggest that PTH treatment for stimulation of bone healing does not require simultaneous mechanical stimulation...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanical}} interface behavior of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{embedded in a}} noble metal, we performed CNTmetal pull-out tests with in situ scanning electron microscope experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to predict forcedisplacement data during <b>pull-out,</b> providing critical <b>forces</b> for failure of the system. In MD simulations, we focused {{on the influence of}} carboxylic surface functional groups (SFGs) covalently linked to the CNT. Experimentally obtained maximum forces between 10 and 102 nN in palladium and gold matrices and simulated achievable pulling forces agree very well. The dominant failure mode in the experiment is CNT rupture, although several pull-out failures were also observed. We explain the huge scatter of experimental values with varying embedding length and SFG surface density. From simulation, we found that SFGs act as small anchors in the metal matrix and significantly enhance the maximum forces. This interface reinforcement can lead to tensile stresses sufficiently high to initiate CNT rupture. To qualify the existence of carboxylic SFGs on our CNT material, we performed analytical investigation by means of fluorescence labeling of surface species and discuss the results. With this contribution, we focus on a synergy between computational and experimental approaches involving MD simulations, nano scale testing, and analytics (1) to predict to a good degree of accuracy maximum <b>pull-out</b> <b>forces</b> of single-walled CNTs embedded in a noble metal matrix and (2) to provide valuable input to understand the underlying mechanisms of failure with focus on SFGs. This is of fundamental interest for the design of future mechanical sensors incorporating piezoresistive single-walled CNTs as the sensing element...|$|R
40|$|A {{wire netting}} fence {{supported}} with zinked steel pipe trusses was blown {{down by a}} typhoon (1985, 13). The cause of the failure {{was thought to be}} that bond between the mortar used for the bases of the fence and the steel pipes was not sufficient to resist the <b>pull-out</b> <b>forces</b> of the wind. In order to examine the bond strength between mortar and steel pipes, pull-out and push-down tests were conducted. The embedded lengths of the pipe in the mortar are 800 mm for the pull-out test and from 50 to 150 mm for the push-down test. The strength of mortar varied in each test. The pull-out test results was compared with those of the push-down test and {{it was found that the}} bond strength for the deeply embedded pipes in the pull-out test is about fifty percent of that for the pipes embedded from 50 to 150 mm in the push-down test. And a comparison with the push-down test and previous test results shows that the bond strength between the zinked steel pipe and mortar is very similar to that between steel plate and concrete. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{establish}} {{the methods of}} demonstrating early fixation of metal implants to bone, {{one side of a}} Cobalt-Chromium (CoCr) based alloy implant surface was seeded with rabbit marrow mesenchymal cells and the other side was left unseeded. The mesenchymal cells were further cultured in the presence of ascorbic acid, β-glycerophosphate and dexamethasone, resulting in the appearance of osteoblasts and bone matrix on the implant surface. Thus, we succeeded in generating tissue-engineered bone {{on one side of the}} CoCr implant. The CoCr implants were then implanted in rabbit bone defects. Three weeks after the implantation, evaluations of mechanical test, undecalcified histological section and electron microscope analysis were performed. Histological and electron microscope images of the tissue engineered surface exhibited abundant new bone formation. However, newly formed bone tissue was difficult to detect on the side without cell seeding. In the mechanical test, the mean values of <b>pull-out</b> <b>forces</b> were 77. 15 N and 44. 94 N for the tissue-engineered and non-cell-seeded surfaces, respectively. These findings indicate early bone fixation of the tissue-engineered CoCr surface just three weeks after implantation. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 552...|$|R
