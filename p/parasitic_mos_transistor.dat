[...] In 1968 the MOS industry was prevalently using aluminum gate transistors with high-threshold voltage and desired to have a low threshold voltage MOS process {{in order to increase}} the speed and reduce the power dissipation of MOS integrated circuits. Low threshold voltage transistors with aluminum gate demanded the use of 100 silicon orientation, which however produced too low a threshold voltage for the <b>parasitic</b> <b>MOS</b> <b>transistors</b> (the <b>MOS</b> <b>transistors</b> created when aluminum over the field oxide would bridge two junctions). To increase the parasitic threshold voltage beyond the supply voltage, it was necessary to increase the N-type doping level in selected regions under the field oxide, and this was initially accomplished {{with the use of a}} so-called channel-stopper mask, and later with ion implantation.|$|R

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{operation}} of the modern Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (<b>MOS)</b> <b>transistor</b> was first described by Lilienfield in 1930 [l], it was not until 1960 that the first <b>MOS</b> <b>transistor</b> using silicon as the semiconductor material was reported by Kang and Atalla [2]. The MOS technology became viable only after methods of routinely growing reliable oxides were developed and reported by Snow, Grove, Deal and Sah in 1964 [3]. Since that time the MOS industry has expanded very quickly. Today MOS integrated circuits (ICs) have emerged as the dominant technology in the semiconductor industry. The exponential {{growth in the number of}} com-ponents per chip and projections for the future are shown in Figure 1. 1 [4]. Also shown is the minimum feature size that can be produced on a chip. The dotted lines are projections for the future. Clearly with this technology it is now possible to have more than a million transistors on a single chip. All this has been possible due to the fact that the basic <b>MOS</b> <b>transistor</b> size has shrunk by a factor of about 20 during the last two decades, from a feature size of 20 pm to less than a micron. Much of this shrinkage can be attributed to advances in lithography, the use of ion implantation, and low temperature annealing [4]. During the early days of MOS technology, aluminum (Al) gate p-channel <b>MOS</b> <b>transistors</b> were the workhorse technology. In the late sixties poly-silicon replaced A 1 as the material for the <b>MOS</b> <b>transistor</b> gate [S]. The next major milestone was the LOCOS (Localized Oxidation of Silicon) isolation technique [6]. Commercially successful products using the NMOS process (all n-channel <b>MOS</b> <b>transistors)</b> with LOCOS isolation were developed in the mid seventies. NMOS device technology became the driving force of the 1970 s because of its reliability, reasonable manufacturing cost, and scalability. During the last decade, <b>MOS</b> <b>transistors</b> have been scaled down in dimensions both vertically and horizontally. Rules of this scaling were originally formulated by Dennard et al. [7] in 1974 and subsequently other schemes of scaling were proposed 181 (see Section 3. 3) ...|$|R
