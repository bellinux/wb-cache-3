In some cases, there is no maturity date (i.e. perpetual), this is often the case with preferred convertibles (e.g. US0605056821).|$|E
25|$|Wonga {{was founded}} by Errol Damelin (chief {{executive}} officer) in October 2006 and he linked up with software engineer Jonty Hurwitz in January 2007. Both Damelin and Hurwitz had previous internet start-up experience; neither had any experience of retail banking. When the company first started looking for funding, potential investors saw the short-term, small-loans business as an unprofitable, risky backwater. After being denied funding by UK banks, Wonga secured venture capital through Balderton Capital. The first place of business was in a shared office space in St. John's Wood, London. After a year of software development a beta website was launched in 2007. In interviews, Damelin {{has said that the}} goal was to disrupt the short-term credit industry by providing transparency, exact control of amount and <b>payment</b> <b>date,</b> immediate access to funds, and no faxing or emailing documents. The business model of lending only to those who could pay back reliably, as opposed to the much wider catchment practice of payday loans required an algorithm that could fully determine risk in an automated manner – something they had difficulty developing in the early stages. To get funds directly to customer's bank accounts as quickly as possible, co-operation from leading banks was required. Banks were reportedly dismissive of Wonga's plan saying they would not be totally satisfied with customer identity without physical documentation.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{illustrated}} in the following tree diagram where at each <b>payment</b> <b>date</b> either the contract has a default event, in which case it ends with a payment of [...] shown in red, where [...] is the recovery rate, or it survives without a default being triggered, in which case a premium payment of [...] is made, shown in blue. At {{either side of the}} diagram are the cashflows up to that point in time with premium payments in blue and default payments in red. If the contract is terminated the square is shown with solid shading.|$|E
5000|$|For these larger 'special dividends', the {{ex-dividend}} date {{is generally}} one stock trading {{day after the}} dividend <b>payment</b> <b>date.</b> The dividend <b>payment</b> <b>date</b> occurs sometime after the dividend record date. The stock will trade on an ex-distribution basis (adjusted {{for the amount of}} the dividend paid) on the trading day after the dividend <b>payment</b> <b>date,</b> and thereafter.|$|E
50|$|In finance, a day count {{convention}} {{determines how}} interest accrues over {{time for a}} variety of investments, including bonds, notes, loans, mortgages, medium-term notes, swaps, and forward rate agreements (FRAs). This determines the number of days between two coupon payments; thus, calculating the amount transferred on <b>payment</b> <b>dates</b> and also the accrued interest for <b>dates</b> between <b>payments.</b> The day count is also used to quantify periods of time when discounting a cash-flow to its present value. When a security such as a bond is sold between interest <b>payment</b> <b>dates,</b> the seller is eligible to some fraction of the coupon amount.|$|R
50|$|Federal {{income tax}} was {{introduced}} with the Revenue Act of 1861 {{to help fund}} the Civil War, and subsequently repealed, re-adopted, and held unconstitutional. The early taxes were based on assessments, not voluntary tax returns. Tax <b>payment</b> <b>dates</b> varied by act.|$|R
50|$|IRSs are bespoke {{financial}} products whose customisation {{can include}} changes to <b>payment</b> <b>dates,</b> notional changes (such {{as those in}} amortised IRSs), accrual period adjustment and calculation convention changes (such as a day count convention of 30/360E to ACT/360 or ACT/365).|$|R
50|$|Modified {{following}} business day: the <b>payment</b> <b>date</b> is {{rolled to}} the next business day, unless doing so would cause the payment {{to be in the}} next calendar month, in which case the <b>payment</b> <b>date</b> is {{rolled to the}} previous business day.

50|$|In June 1987 Welwyn Hatfield District Council {{had entered}} into a 10-year {{interest}} rate swap agreement with Morgan Grenfell based upon a notional principal amount of £25 million. The swap made the usual provisions for netting, with only the balance due being payable by either party on the <b>payment</b> <b>dates.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The premium {{payments}} are generally quarterly, with maturity dates (and likewise premium <b>payment</b> <b>dates)</b> falling on March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20. Due to the {{proximity to the}} IMM dates, which fall on the third Wednesday of these months, these CDS maturity dates are {{also referred to as}} [...] "IMM dates".|$|R

50|$|An annuity is {{a series}} of {{payments}} made at equal intervals. Examples of annuities are regular deposits to a savings account, monthly home mortgage payments, monthly insurance payments and pension payments. Annuities can be classified by the frequency of <b>payment</b> <b>dates.</b> The <b>payments</b> (deposits) may be made weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or at any other regular interval of time.|$|R
5000|$|For {{irregular}} coupon periods, {{the period}} {{has to be}} divided into one or more quasi-coupon periods (also called notional periods) that match the normal frequency of <b>payment</b> <b>dates.</b> The interest in each such period (or partial period) is then computed, and then the amounts are summed over the number of quasi-coupon periods. For details, see [...] or the ISDA paper.|$|R
30|$|A {{major threat}} to our {{identification}} strategy is that the dummy variables denoting the distance between <b>payment</b> and interview <b>dates</b> may be capturing other factors {{not related to the}} cash transfer, but to the specific <b>date</b> of the <b>payment.</b> For instance, it could be the case that <b>payment</b> <b>dates</b> are established on days when the labor supply is low for a different reason than the transfer (e.g., holidays). This potential correlation between dates and unobservable variables that affect hours of work would invalidate our strategy. To check {{that this is not the}} case, we perform a falsification test using available data from non-beneficiaries. If the dummy variables representing the distance between <b>payment</b> and interview <b>dates</b> were correlated with other variables that affect labor supply, they should also have an impact on the hours of work of non-beneficiaries.|$|R

30|$|When {{observing a}} {{municipality}} {{with more than}} one pay date, we use the earliest pay date to define the distance between payments and interviews. Though this criterion may introduce measurement bias, we also perform additional regressions using the last pay date within the municipalities to re-define temporal distance between payments and interviews. In Section 5.3, however, we perform an additional sensitivity analysis to check whether results hold when using exact <b>payment</b> <b>dates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Marois and her caucus aggressively {{pursued the}} Liberal {{government}} over allegations surfacing {{in the media}} of corruption, collusion and illegal political financing related to provincial and municipal contracts; at one point her caucus donned white scarves to demand an inquiry, forcing the government {{to set up a}} public inquiry in the fall of 2011, the Charbonneau Commission. This commission has revealed a pattern of illegal <b>payments</b> <b>dating</b> back several decades and involving all political parties.|$|R
5000|$|As OTC instruments, cross-currency swaps (XCSs) can be {{customised}} in {{a number}} of ways and can be structured to meet the specific needs of the counterparties. For example; <b>payment</b> <b>dates</b> could be irregular, the notional of the swap could be amortized over time, reset dates (or fixing dates) of the floating rate could be irregular, mandatory break clauses may be inserted into the contract, FX notional payments and FX rates my be manually specified etc.|$|R
