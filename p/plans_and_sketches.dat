60|$|Landing at Santa Cruz, a long dull line of glaring masonry, {{smokeless}} and shadeless, {{was to me}} intensely saddening. A {{score of}} years had carried off all my friends. Kindly Mrs. Nugent, called 'the Admiral,' and her amiable daughter are in the English burial-ground; the hospitable Mr. Consul Grattan had also faded {{from the land of}} the living. The French Consul, M. Berthelot, who published [Footnote: Histoire naturelle des Iles Canaries, par MM. P. Barker Webb et Sabin Berthelot, ouvrage publié sous les auspices de M. Guizot, Ministre de l'Instruction Publique, Paris, 1839. Seven folio vols., with maps, <b>plans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sketches,</b> all regardless of expense.] by favour of the late Mr. Webb, went to the many in 1880. One of the brothers Richardson had died; the other had subsided into a clerk, and the Fonda Ingleza had become the British Consulate. The new hotel kept by Señor Camacho and his English wife appeared comfortable enough, but it had none of those associations which make the old familiar inn a kind of home. En revanche, however, I met Mr. Consul Dundas, my successor at the port of Santos, whence so few have escaped with life; and his wife, the daughter of an Anglo-Brazilian friend.|$|E

5000|$|Richards {{was known}} best for his portraiture, {{but he also}} painted landscapes. Some of his murals are {{featured}} inside the Utah Capital Building. He worked alongside Alma B.

These portraits included governors William Spry, Charles Rendell Mabey, and Herbert Brown Maw. The Rotunda in the Utah capital building was left unfinished for many years until the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) funded art commissions for the Capitol. Richards <b>planned</b> <b>and</b> <b>sketched</b> the paintings, <b>and</b> then worked with artists Gordon Cope and Henry Rasmussen to complete the project. The paintings were completed in 1934 and installed in the Capitol the following year to mark {{the opening of the}} Utah Arts Institute annual exhibition. Richards painted portraits of many presidents and leaders of the LDS Church, a number of which are now displayed in the Church History Museum in Salt Lake City, murals for the Cardston Alberta Temple, and one for the Mesa Arizona Temple.

60|$|At Shuwák {{we allowed}} the camels {{a day of}} rest, whilst we <b>planned</b> <b>and</b> <b>sketched,</b> dug into, <b>and</b> {{described}} the ruins. A difficulty about drinking-water somewhat delayed us. The modern wells, {{like those of the}} Haurán, are rudely revetted pits in a bald and shiny bit of clay-plain below the principal block of ruins: only one in the dozen holds water, and that has been made Wahsh ("foul") by the torrent sweeping into it heaps of the refuse and manure strewed around. The lower folds of the Sáni' block also supply rain-pools; but here, again, the Arabs and their camels had left their marks. The only drinkable water lies a very long mile down the southern (left) bank, above the old aqueduct, in a deep and narrow gorge of trap. The perennial spring, still trickling down the rocks, was dammed across, as remnants of cement show us, in more places than one. There are also signs of cut basins, which the barrages above and below once divided into a series of tanks. Up the rough steps of the bed the camel-men drove their beasts; and the name of a Gujráti maker, printed upon a sack of Anglo-Indian canvas, had a curious effect among such Bedawi surroundings.|$|R
