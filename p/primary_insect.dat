5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their <b>primary</b> <b>insect</b> predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European earwigs.|$|E

However, increases in spider mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) populations {{have been reported in}} fields of transgenic cotton. The objectives of our laboratory experiments were (i) to determine host plant preference (transgenic or non-transgenic cotton) of T. turkestani females and (ii) to compare the life table parameters of T. turkestani females reared on transgenic or non-transgenic cotton. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicated that T. turkestani females reared on transgenic cotton leaves contained 14. 9 ± 0. 23 μg Bt toxic protein per gram fresh weight, about 57. 4 % toxin in the transgenic cotton leaves. Results of dual-choice disc tests showed that T. turkestani females preferred to feed and lay eggs on non-transgenic cotton. Food source (transgenic or non-transgenic cotton) had no significant effect on the life table parameters of T. turkestani females. We conclude that increases in the population of spider mites in fields of transgenic cotton cannot be attributed to host plant preference or to the effects of Bt toxic protein on the non-targeted arthropods life cycle. Additional studies should be done to determine if the increases are due to less insecticide application or less competition with <b>primary</b> <b>insects</b> in transgenic cotton fields...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} human disturbance and attitudes on {{the density of the}} tree agama Acanthocercus atricollis atricollis in a densely populated rural settlement in South Africa. In this environment agamas live on trees that are harvested for firewood or maintained for fruit production.

Although local residents viewed tree agamas negatively (50 % of interviewees claimed to have killed an agama) and acted to exclude them from their environment, tree agama density in villages was higher than that of adjacent communal rangelands and than a previously reported density estimate in a nearby protected area. We suggest three major factors that could explain why tree agamas are favoured in this peri-urban landscape in the face of human persecution: firstly, predators such as snakes and raptors are likely to occur at a much lower density in peri-urban areas; secondly, their <b>primary</b> prey (<b>insects)</b> may be more abundant or accessible in this landscape; thirdly, they may experience less competition for resources. 5 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|The {{exoskeleton}} or integument {{of insects}} {{acts as an}} impermeable, protective layer against desiccation.

40|$|Eighty {{three percent}} of the {{strawberries}} consumed in North America are grown in California, where {{the widespread use of}} insecticides has become hazardous to public health. The intensive use of pesticides for growing strawberries causes serious health risks to farm workers, in addition to contaminating the soil and groundwater. The cost to the environment and public health in the United States is estimated at $ 12 billion annually. Finding effective nontoxic management strategies for insect pests has become essential for long term sustainability. One strategy strawberry producers can use to promote sustainability is to increase the effectiveness of biological control techniques. Field experiments in other crops suggest that arachnid diversity and abundance may provide such a role in controlling insect pests and that agroecosystem diversification can enhance arachnid populations. This study therefore evaluated the composition, abundance, and pest control potential of arachnid communities in an organic strawberry field in California. The study found that by integrating alfalfa trap crops into organic strawberries, arachnid populations were substantially increased. Results reflected substantial increases in both male and female arachnid populations in and near alfalfa strip crops, with spider and harvestman arachnid families increasing most dramatically. Preliminary data suggest that an increase in alfalfa trap crops may lead to a reduction of the <b>primary</b> strawberry <b>insect</b> pest, Lygus hesperus, which is consumed by arachnids.

40|$|The {{history of}} insect control on cotton since World War II {{can be divided}} into three periods based on the types of {{insecticides}} used to control the major cotton insect pests such as the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), the bollworm, Helicove 1 pa zea (Boddie) and the boll weevil Anthonomus grcmdis grandis Boheman. The first period was the DDT and organochlorine period, lasting from their introduction just after World War II to the mid- 1960 s when widespread resistance and environmental concems began to outweigh benefits derived from their continued use (Sparks, 1981; also see Chapter 13). The second period was that of the organophosphoms insecticides as exemplified by methyl parathion which came into prominent use as the utility of DDT and other organochlorines declined during the mid- 1960 s. Although still widely used for control of some cotton insect pests, the organophosphoms insecticide pe 1 iod of predominance declined during the late 1 970 s when the tobacco bud worm developed resistance to many of the organophosphoms insecticides then in use (Sparks, 1981; Sparks eta/., 1993 a) and the third period, that of the pyrethroid insecticides, began.

In this review, we list the <b>primary</b> <b>insect</b> pests at each point of the marketing system, and indicate which sampling methods and control strategies are most appropriate.

Resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides, in particular imidacloprid, has been reported as an increasing constraint in recent years. In order to investigate the extent of resistance, 24 samples of N. lugens were collected from China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam during 2005 and 2006. Their responses to two diagnostic doses of imidacloprid (corresponding approximately to the LC 95 and 5 x LC 95 of a susceptible strain) were examined. RESULTS: Ten of the 12 samples collected during 2005 {{were found to be}} susceptible to imidacloprid, but two late-season samples from India showed reduced mortality at both diagnostic doses. All 13 strains collected in 2006 showed reduced mortality at both doses when compared with the susceptible strain.

40|$|AbstractIn {{consequence}} of the extreme flood at Lake Constance in 1999 the reed belts showed a severe loss in vitality so that a permanent damage could be expected. The monitoring project presented here focuses the documentation of the damage following the disturbance event, the identification of co-factors, and is designed to find out significant stressors that may impede {{the recovery of the}} reeds. The monitoring is based on CIR aerial photo interpretation, quantitative GIS-analyses and field data. The design of the study implies the definition of five degrees of damage using the interpretation of CIR aerial photo series from July 2000. The aquatic reed beds were digitised and areal sums were calculated. These data were compared with the corresponding data from 1999 and 1993. Stand structural and biomass attributes were investigated in 50 randomly distributed permanent plots covering all site types and damage degrees. The results showed a loss of about 24 hectares of aquatic reeds at Lake Constance Untersee alone. The stands which had survived showed a great patchiness in terms of culm density, shoot population composition, culm architecture, and aboveground biomass production. Severely damaged stands were mainly composed of secondary shoots, whereas <b>primary</b> and <b>insect</b> infested shoots dominated in less damaged stands. One co-factor which explained the patchiness was the vertical position of the stand, i. e. the probability of being severely damaged increased with increasing distance below mean water level.

40|$|ABSTRACT CHAPTER 1 Striped {{cucumber}} beetle, Acalymma vittatum F., is the <b>primary</b> <b>insect</b> pest of cucurbit {{crops in}} the Northeastern United States. Adult beetles colonize squash crops from field borders, causing feeding damage at the seedling stage and transmitting the bacteria Erwinia tracheiphila Hauben et al. Conventional control methods rely on insecticide applications {{to the entire}} field, but surrounding main crops with a more attractive perimeter could reduce reliance on insecticides. Acalymma vittatum demonstrates a marked preference for Blue Hubbard squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne) over butternut squash (C. moschata Duchesne). Given this preference, Blue Hubbard squash {{has the potential to}} be an effective perimeter trap crop. We evaluated this system in commercial butternut fields in 2003 and 2004, comparing fields using perimeter trap cropping with Blue Hubbard to conventionally managed fields. In 2003 we used a foliar insecticide to control beetles in the trap crop borders, and in 2004 we compared systemic and foliar insecticide treatments for the trap crop borders. We found that using a trap crop system reduced or eliminated the need to spray the main crop area, reducing insecticide use by up to 94...|$|E
40|$|Although {{heritable}} microorganisms {{are increasingly}} recognized as widespread in insects, no systematic screens for such symbionts {{have been conducted}} in Drosophila species (the <b>primary</b> <b>insect</b> genetic models for studies of evolution, development, and innate immunity). Previous efforts screened relatively few Drosophila lineages, mainly for Wolbachia. We conducted an extensive survey of potentially heritable endosymbionts from any bacterial lineage via PCR screens of mature ovaries in 181 recently collected fly strains representing 35 species from 11 species groups. Due to our fly sampling methods, however, {{we are likely to}} have missed fly strains infected with sex ratio-distorting endosymbionts. Only Wolbachia and Spiroplasma, both widespread in insects, were confirmed as symbionts. These findings indicate that in contrast to some other insect groups, other heritable symbionts are uncommon in Drosophila species, possibly reflecting a robust innate immune response that eliminates many bacteria. A more extensive survey targeted these two symbiont types through diagnostic PCR in 1225 strains representing 225 species from 32 species groups. Of these, 19 species were infected by Wolbachia while only 3 species had Spiroplasma. Several new strains of Wolbachia and Spiroplasma were discovered, including ones divergent from any reported to date.

40|$|Kynurenines are {{endogenous}} metabolites of tryptophan, {{which are}} studied extensively in vertebrates {{with respect to}} their etiological role in the pathology of various neurodegenerative disorders. In insects, metabolites of the kynurenic pathway are present in peak concentrations in the hemolymph of holometabolic species during pupation and just before eclosion.

Adult flesh flies were injected with various concentrations of these endogenous toxins and the effects on motor function were assessed. For tryptophan, L-kynurenine, 3 -hydroxy-kynurenine, and anthranilic acid, the effects ranged from reversible to irreversible motor dysfunction, to instant paralysis and death. 3 -Hydroxy-anthranilic acid could induce a tetanus like spasm of the wings. Tryptophan, 3 -hydroxykynurenine, and 3 -hydroxy-anthranilic acid were toxic to <b>primary</b> cultures of <b>insect</b> neurons. It is possible that some of these metabolites have a distinct role in larvae during the apoptotic events related to neurometamorphosis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic {{crops that}} contain Cry genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{have been adopted}} by farmers over the last 17 years. Unlike {{traditional}} broad spectrum chemical insecticides, Bt's toxicity spectrum is relatively narrow and selective, which may indirectly benefit secondary insects that may become important pests. The economic damage caused {{by the rise of}} secondary pests could offset {{some or all of the}} benefits associated with the use of Bt varieties. We develop a bioeconomic model to analyze the interactions between <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>insect</b> populations and the impact of different management options on insecticide use and economic impact over time. Results indicate that some of the benefits associated with the adoption of genetically engineered insect resistant crops may be eroded when taking into account ecological dynamics. It is suggested that secondary pests could easily become key insect pests requiring additional measures - such as insecticide applications or stacked traits – to keep their populations under the economic threshold...|$|R
