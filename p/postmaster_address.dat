5000|$|Since most domains have a <b>postmaster</b> <b>address,</b> it is {{commonly}} targeted by spamming operations. Even if not directly spammed, a <b>postmaster</b> <b>address</b> may be sent bounced spam from other servers that mistakenly trust fake return-paths commonly used in spam.|$|E
50|$|In {{computers}} and technology, postmaster {{is a term}} used to identify the administrator of a mail server. Nearly every domain should have the e-mail address postmaster@example.com where errors in e-mail processing are directed. Error e-mails automatically generated by mail servers’ MTAs usually {{appear to have been}} sent to the <b>postmaster</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
50|$|Every domain that {{supports}} the SMTP protocol for electronic mail is required by RFC 5321 and, as early as 1982, by RFC 822, to have the <b>postmaster</b> <b>address.</b> The rfc-ignorant.org website used to maintain a list of domains that do not comply with the RFC based on this requirement, but was shut down in November 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, Postmaster General Montgomery Blair cut off {{mail service}} to any state in rebellion. Confederate postage was not {{recognized}} by U.S. post offices, and <b>postmasters</b> forwarded mail <b>addressed</b> into the Confederacy to the Dead Letter Office, {{to be returned}} to senders.|$|R

40|$|The United States Postal Service is a {{government}} agency created with {{the foundation of the}} United States of America. Today, the Internet has become its biggest competition, taking significant revenue away from the Postal Service and sending it on a path towards bankruptcy. This research seeks to answer the question, “How can the United States Postal Service adapt as a bureaucratic agency to the increasing use of the Internet in today’s information age?” Extensive analysis of the four traditional rationales for the existence of the USPS—universal service/access, economies of scale and scope, monopoly, and networks/positive externalities—shines light on efficiency and political issues that, if addressed, would require both a change in mission and cost structure for the United States Postal Service. While virtually all citizens have access to the USPS, two thirds of Americans have Internet access. By providing the remaining third of the American population with Internet access and offering subsidies for online story creation, the Internet will function as <b>Postmaster.</b> After <b>addressing</b> package delivery and other retail/service opportunities within the USPS, along with negotiating fair wage terms and fringe benefits for employees, the United States Postal Service will remain a successful bureaucratic agency with a new direction. The following research supports the notion that bureaucratic agencies can survive the Information Age by focusing on what citizens need, seeking advantages in the trusted relationships built between citizens and the government, harnessing the power of strategic alliances, and accepting constantly evolving technologies as an agent for change not only in society but in the bureaucracy itself...|$|R
5000|$|Servers that reject all bounce mails (contrary to the RFC 1123, {{a part of}} STD 3). To {{work around}} this problem, postfix, for example, uses either the local <b>postmaster</b> <b>address</b> or an address of [...] "double-bounce" [...] in the MAIL FROM part of the callout. This workaround, however, has two problems: first, it can cause a {{verification}} loop; secondly it will fail if Bounce Address Tag Validation is used to reduce backscatter. So, this work around should not be used. Callback verification can still work if rejecting all bounces happens at the DATA stage instead of the earlier MAIL FROM stage, while rejecting invalid e-mail addresses remains at the RCPT TO stage instead of also being moved to the DATA stage.|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] Mar 16, 1943 Bryant Service Club: I believe another {{acknowledgement}} is in order. Your package {{arrived at}} a very opportune time as we are still awaiting pay for February. So all the Profs are getting their commissions. Rather nice for them, but it must leave Bryant rather under-staffed. You can’t realize how the comfort of a barrack appear as luxuries {{after a few weeks}} in the mountains. Those maneuvers certainly make one appreciate civilization once more. Our <b>postmaster</b> <b>address</b> is kept in order to prevent confusion when we change camps. All packages are required to be mailed only within the states unless accompanied by a request signed by the Enlisted Man’s C. O. Bryant {{is one of the few}} colleges with any such organization and it’s a very happy occasion, indeed, when we hear from you. Thank you and keep up the good work. Sincerely Bert Pinsonnault P. S.
