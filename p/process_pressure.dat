As soon as the <b>process</b> <b>pressure</b> raises above the nitrogen pressure, the product in the line forces the rubber boot away from the barrier and allows product {{to pass through the}} valve.

50|$|Piston-style gas-loaded surge {{relief valves}} {{operate on the}} {{balanced}} piston design {{and can be used}} in a variety of applications because it can handle high and low viscosity products while maintaining a fast speed of response. An inert gas, most commonly nitrogen, is loaded on the back side of the piston forcing the valve closed. The nitrogen pressure on the back side of the piston is actually what determines the valves set point. These valves will remain closed until the inlet pressure exceeds the set point/nitrogen pressure, at which time the valve will open from the high pressure and remain open as long as the <b>process</b> <b>pressure</b> is above the nitrogen pressure. Once the <b>process</b> <b>pressure</b> starts to decay, the valve will start to close. Once the <b>process</b> <b>pressure</b> is below the nitrogen pressure, the valve will go closed again.|$|E

50|$|Spring-loaded {{pressure}} {{safety valves}} use a compressed spring {{to hold the}} valve closed. The valve will remain closed until the <b>process</b> <b>pressure</b> exceeds the set point of the spring pressure. The valve will open 100% when the set point is reached and will remain open until a certain blow down factor is reached. Oftentimes the blow down is {{a percentage of the}} set point, such as 20% of the set point. That means that the valve will remain open until the <b>process</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases to 20% below the set point of the spring-loaded relief valve.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decrease}} of temperature {{is based on}} the increase of bonding strength using plasma activation on clean wafer surfaces. Further, the increase is caused by elevation in amount of Si-OH groups, removal of contaminants on the wafer surface, the enhancement of viscous flow of the surface layer and the enhanced diffusivity of water and gas trapped at the interface. Based on ambient pressure, two main surface activation fields using plasma treatment are established for wafer preprocessing to lower the temperatures during annealing. To establish maximum surface energy at low temperatures (< 100 Â°C) numerous parameters for plasma activation and annealing need to be optimized according to the bond material.Plasma activated bonding is based on <b>process</b> <b>pressure</b> divided into: ...|$|E
50|$|The second method, {{membrane}} filtration, {{typically a}} combination of microfiltration and ultrafiltration, uses molecular size {{as the basis for}} separating components from the whey stream. In the <b>process,</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied across a membrane surface which forces smaller molecules through the membrane while larger molecules are retained. Both methods yield a very high protein to non-protein product ratio, although membrane filtration is somewhat less selective allowing any molecule within a size range to be retained. One compositional difference between whey protein isolates made from cheese whey via membrane filtration compared to ion exchange is that membrane filtration includes significant levels of the casein fragment caseino-glycomacropeptide (cGMP). This fragment has a less complete amino acid profile and is low in branched chain amino acids.|$|E
