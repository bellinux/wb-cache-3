40|$|Abstract: New {{embedded}} {{predictive control}} applications {{call for more}} efficient ways of solving quadratic programs (QPs) {{in order to meet}} demanding real-time, power and cost requirements. A single precision QP-on-a-chip controller is proposed, implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with an iterative linear solver at its core. A novel offline scaling procedure is introduced to aid the convergence of the reduced precision solver. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental setup where an ML 605 FPGA board controls a nonlinear model of a Boeing 747 aircraft running on a desktop PC through an Ethernet link. Simulations show that the quality of the closed-loop control and accuracy of individual solutions is competitive with a conventional double <b>precision</b> <b>controller</b> solving linear systems using a Riccati recursion. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nonlinearity characteristics, such as backlash, {{in various}} mechanisms, limit the perfor-mance of {{feedback}} systems by causing delays, undesired oscillations and inaccuracy. Backlash in uence analysis and modeling {{is necessary to}} design a <b>precision</b> <b>controller</b> for this nonlinearity. Backlash between meshing gears in an electromechanical system is modeled {{by the use of}} dierential equations and a nonlinear spring-damper. According to this model, the paper shows that oscillations and delays cannot be compensated by a state feedback controller. Therefore, an adaptive algorithm is designed, based on dierent regions of the system angular position error. Since this controller needs an estimation of the backlash value, it is estimated by a learning unit in the adaptive controller. Simulations show that the presented adaptive controller can eliminate backlash oscillations properly, in accordance with previous works...|$|E

A HRG {{can be used}} as a rate gyro or integrating gyro without structural modification by simply changing the control scheme. In this paper, differential control algorithms are designed for a 2 -piece HRG. To design a <b>precision</b> <b>controller,</b> the electromechanical modelling and signal processing must be pre-performed accurately. Therefore, the equations of motion for the HRG resonator with switched harmonic excitations are derived with the Duhamel Integral method. Electromechanical modeling of the resonator, electric module and charge amplifier is performed by considering the mode shape of a thin hemispherical shell. Further, signal processing and control algorithms are designed. The multi-flexing scheme of sensing, driving cycles and x, y-axis switching cycles is appropriate for high precision and low maneuverability systems. The differential control scheme is easily capable of rejecting the common mode errors of x, y-axis signals and changing the rate integrating mode on basis of these studies. In the rate gyro mode the controller is composed of Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), amplitude, quadrature and rate control loop. All controllers are designed on basis of a digital PI controller. The signal processing and control algorithms are verified through Matlab/Simulink simulations. Finally, a FPGA and DSP board with these algorithms is verified through experiments...|$|E
