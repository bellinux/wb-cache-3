5|$|As {{the series}} <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PS-2 gun was delayed, the Main Artillery Agency of the RKKA gave {{preference}} {{to a new}} gun. It {{was developed by the}} Artillery Design Office of the Bolshevik Factory, constructed from parts taken from the previously purchased German 37mm anti-tank gun developed by Rheinmetall and the PS-2 gun. This system was successfully tested and the Artillery Factory No. 8 named after M. Kalinin started its series production under the designator B-3 (5K). The B-3 gun had less recoil and a smaller breech compared to the PS-2, so it could be easily mounted in the normal machine gun turret of the T-26. The first twin-turreted T-26 was armed with a B-3 gun in the right turret in late 1931. Unfortunately, series <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B-3 gun proceeded slowly due to poor production standards (none of 225 guns produced in 1931 were accepted by army representatives; it took until 1933 to complete the original order for 300 guns placed in August 1931). Completed B-3 guns were mounted on BT-2 light tanks after mid-1932. This meant that twin-turreted T-26 tanks continued to be equipped with old 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) guns. As <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PS-1 gun had ended, some guns were taken from military supply depots and scrapped MS-1(T-18) tanks.|$|E
