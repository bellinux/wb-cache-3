40|$|There {{were taken}} in study a total of 4 species of {{perennial}} leguminous pastures namely: red clover Select 2 variety, alfalfa Satelit variety, sainfoin Vlamar variety and trefoil Dacia 1 variety. For these species we made studies on how the seedbed preparation for sowing using annular or flat roller {{and the influence of}} this work on the production of seed lots. To prepare the seedbed for establishing perennial leguminous seed lots using the ring roller before sowing and the flat roller after sowing favors a better rising for clover, alfalfa, sainfoin and for trefoil the optimum variant is when using the annular roller before and after sowing. In the first year of vegetation the using of the ring roller before seeding to alfalfa and trefoil favors the obtaining of significant increases of dry matter, while the biggest increases of sainfoin dry matter is obtained by using the ring roller before and after sowing. In the second year of vegetation using the roller for perennial leguminous, the seedbeed lots are influenced differently for the dry production of the first scythe. Therefor, at trefoil and red clover the maximum quantity of dry matter was obtained when using the ring roller before sowing and the plain one after sowing, while for sainfoin and alfalfa the maximum production was obtained in the case of using the ring roller both before and after sowing. The use of roller at seedbed preparation for the perennial leguminous brings significant increases of seed production. The best option for preparing a good seedbed perennial leguminous seed is when using the ring roller both before and after sowing for trefoil and the <b>plain</b> <b>roller</b> for alfalfa and red clover, respectively before and after sowing for sainfoin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{calculation}} model for fatigue lifetime determination of a three-row roller slewing bearing raceway is presented. First, the contact force distribution between the roller and the raceway is analytically determined from the basic bearing geometry and the external loads {{acting on the}} bearing assembly. Then a numerical model is employed to calculate subsurface stress distribution in the raceway {{as a result of}} the contact force between the roller and the raceway. Numerically calculated subsurface stress field serves as an input for the fatigue calculation of the raceway, which is done according to the stress-life approach. Two different types of <b>rollers</b> are investigated: <b>plain</b> cylindrical <b>roller</b> and a profiled roller. Finally, the influence of the roller geometry on the fatigue life is pointed out...|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the initial batch of {{production}} locomotives resulted in Voroshilovgrad Works beginning mass production of class LV locomotives in 1955. Locomotives 0011-0112 were produced in the first year, with another 400 locomotives numbered 0113-0522 completed in 1956. Some changes were made {{during the course of}} the production run. Different combinations of <b>plain</b> bearings and <b>roller</b> bearings were produced, and starting with number 0026 a six-axle tender was substituted for the four-axle tender used with earlier locomotives. The drawbar connection between the locomotive and tender was also strengthened at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Alco's RS-1 was {{the first}} {{successful}} example of the type, and virtually all modern hood units are {{laid out in a}} similar fashion (long hood for all propulsion equipment, short hood for crew accommodations including a toilet). The RS-1, being the first example of a road switcher, and having been initially developed when plain bearings were still common (although not on cab-type road units), often were equipped with <b>plain</b> bearings. Subsequently, <b>roller</b> bearing conversions were implemented, and new units were generally ordered with roller bearings. The RS-1 had a very long manufacturing history, so most 1940s units might be initially ordered with plain bearings (and subsequently converted to roller bearings), but most 1960s units might be ordered with roller bearings.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{increased}} {{efficiency of}} power plants, {{there was an}} increase in efficiency (between 1950 and 1973) of the railway utilization of this electricity with energy-intensity dropping from 218 to 124 kwh/10,000 gross tonne-km (of both passenger and freight trains) or a 43% drop. Since energy-intensity is the inverse of energy-efficiency it drops as efficiency goes up. But most of this 43% decrease in energy-intensity also benefited diesel traction. The conversion of wheel bearings from <b>plain</b> to <b>roller,</b> increase of train weight, converting single track lines to double track (or partially double track), and the elimination of obsolete 2-axle freight cars increased the energy-efficiency of all types of traction: electric, diesel, and steam. [...] However, there remained a 12-15% reduction of energy-intensity that only benefited electric traction (and not diesel). This was due to improvements in locomotives, more widespread use of regenerative braking (which in 1989 recycled 2.65% of the electric energy used for traction,) remote control of substations, better handling of the locomotive by the locomotive crew, and improvements in automation. Thus the overall efficiency of electric traction as compared to diesel more than doubled between 1950 and the mid-1970s in the Soviet Union. But after 1974 (thru 1980) there was no improvement in energy-intensity (wh/tonne-km) in part due to increasing speeds of passenger and freight trains.|$|R
