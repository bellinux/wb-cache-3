Professor Harris suggested higher returns would accrue to investments in de-mining technology, while aid funds for landmine clearance should be reallocated to meet other development objectives. However, the methodology used massively overstates {{the present value of}} de-mining costs while the estimated benefits are far too low. More fundamentally, the specification of the model makes it suitable only for an 'all-or-nothing' decision whether to rid Cambodia entirely of landmine contamination, and does not allow the analysis of targeted clearance of priority land.

Second, "non-genuine" discounting in the sense of taking into account opportunity costs, i. e. the fact that alternative investments to climate mitigation measures have <b>positive</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> too, is justified. In addition, it is argued that normative reasoning cannot be escaped in the debate on discounting.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fast pace}} of {{development}} in China's coal industry created bottlenecks in its transportation infrastructure. These bottlenecks likely affected not only China's domestic coal market, but also global coal markets. In this paper, we estimate the costs and consequences of these bottlenecks using a production and multimodal transportation model. We find that coal transportation inefficiencies increased the price of Chinese domestic coal at coastal locations and thereby influenced global seaborne coal prices. According to our model results, the resulting extra costs of coal supplied to the Chinese economy totaled 228 billion renminbi (RMB) in 2011 and 105 in 2013. The subsequent debottlenecking, on the other hand, has reduced the price of Chinese domestic coal delivered to coastal regions {{and contributed to the}} reduction in global seaborne coal prices since 2011. Our analysis also suggests that current tariffs for coal transport, with their embedded taxes to cover investments in rail capacity, result in economic efficiencies similar to charging marginal transportation costs and that planners have not introduced distortions that impose significant additional costs on the Chinese economy. Many projects that expanded transport capacity delivered strongly <b>positive</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> However, some have poor or negative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> which can reflect either overinvestment or preinvestment in future needs...|$|R

Particular attributes of banks including the parent bank's size, early entry {{and the number of}} branches the bank has in China are found to reduce time to profitability. Market conditions in Shanghai, captured by levels of foreign direct investment and Eurodollar interest rates, are also found to have significant effects. A number of managerial implications are drawn from the analysis in light of the greater access to the Chinese banking markets following China's accession to the WTO. To ensure long-term profitability in Shanghai, the foreign bank needs to contain costs and risks in the new markets, formulate an effective market penetration strategy, identify appropriate customer target groups, attract businesses from firms of different countries, seek early entry and undertake more fee-income generating businesses.

The recent Mega Millions and Powerball lottery {{jackpots}} of more than $ 300 million have made us wonder: When, if ever, {{is it a good}} idea to buy lottery tickets? Some lottery drawings do indeed have a <b>positive</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> We use a little elementary calculus to give general criteria for lotteries to have positive or negative rates of return. We then use a little economic theory to show that buying lottery tickets is generally not a good investment, even when the rate of return is spectacularly good. Everybody knows that the lottery is a bad investment. But do you know why? How do you know? For most lotteries, the obvious answer is obviously correct: lottery operators are running a business, and we can assume they have set up the game so that they make money. If they make money, they must be paying out less than they are taking in; so on average, the ticket buyer loses money. This reasoning applies, for example, to the policy games formerly run by organized crime described in [13] an...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the long-term fiscal consequences of {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) on the German government and social insurance system based on differences in educational attainment and the resulting differences in lifetime earnings compared with non-ADHD cohorts. Methods: Differences in educational attainment between ADHD and non-ADHD cohorts were linked to education-specific earnings data. Direct and indirect tax rates and social insurance contributions were linked to differences in lifetime, education-specific earnings to derive lost tax revenue in Germany associated with ADHD. For ADHD and non-ADHD cohorts we derived the age-specific discounted net taxes paid by deducting lifetime transfers from lifetime gross taxes paid. Results: The lifetime net tax revenue for a non-ADHD individual was approximately 80, 000 higher compared to an untreated ADHD individual. The fiscal burden of untreated ADHD, based on a cohort of n= 31, 844 born in 2010, was estimated at 2. 5 billion in net tax revenue losses compared with an equally-sized non-ADHD cohort. ADIAD interventions providing a small improvement in educational attainment resulted in fiscal benefits from increases in lifetime tax gains. Conclusions: ADHD results in long-term financial loss due to lower education attainment and lifetime reduced earnings and resulting lifetime taxes and social contributions paid. Investments in ADHD interventions allowing more children to achieve their educational potential may offer fiscal benefits generating a <b>positive</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return...</b>|$|E

40|$|Although college {{enrollment}} {{rates have}} increased substantially {{over the last}} several decades, socioeconomic inequalities in college completion have actually widened over time. A critical question, therefore, is how to support low-income and first-generation students to succeed in college after they matriculate. We investigate the impact of the Dell Scholars Program which provides a combination of generous financial support and individualized advising to scholarship recipients before and throughout their postsecondary enrollment. The program's design is motivated by a theory of action that, in order to meaningfully increase the share of lower-income students who earn a college degree, it is necessary both to address financial constraints students face and to provide ongoing support for the academic, cultural and other challenges that students experience during their college careers. We isolate the unique impact of the program on college completion by capitalizing on an arbitrary cutoff in the program's algorithmic selection process. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that although being named a Dell Scholar has no impact on initial college enrollment or early college persistence, scholars at the margin of eligibility are significantly more likely to earn a bachelor's degree on-time or six years after high school graduation. These impacts are sizeable and represent a nearly 25 percent or greater increase in both four- and six-year bachelor's attainment. The program is resource intensive.

The net profit generated ignoring labour costs, {{gives rise to}} a small <b>positive</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> Once any reasonable estimate of labour costs is added to costs, the rate of return is a large negative number. The authors conclude that households holding this type of assets do not behave according to the tenets of capitalism. A variety of explanations, typically appealing to religious or cultural factors have been invoked for such a puzzling fact. In this note, we point to a simple explanation that is fully consistent with rational behaviour on the part of Indian farmers. In computing the return on cows and buffaloes, the authors used data from a single year. Cows are assets whose return varies through time. In drought years, when fodder is scarce and expensive, milk production is lower and profits are low. In non-drought years, when fodder is abundant and cheaper, milk production is higher and profits can be considerably higher. The return on cows and buffaloes, like that of many stocks traded on Wall Street, is positive in some years and negative in others. We report evidence from three years of data on the return on cows and buffaloes in the district of Anantapur and show that in one of the three years returns are very high, while in drought years they are similar to the figures obtained by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the relationship between}} the protection of foreign investors' investments under international investment law and the domestic law of host states. Two questions arise in this connection. First, is the promotion and protection of investments comprised in investment agreements compatible with states' domestic law? Second, public policies of host states may appear to be in contradiction with an increased international security of investments. When such a conflict is challenged by foreign investors, what are the consequences for both parties? In general, investments are transactions that are private in nature, whose aim is to generate a <b>positive</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> Investments can have pervasive consequences on countries' welfare, including, for example, the consequences on sustainable development; the use and protection of natural resources; and employment, to name a few. It {{is the role of the}} governments to balance these sometimes conflicting public and private interests. As of today, it seems that the regime established according to investment treaties does not strike an appropriate balance between the various interests concerned. After a brief look at the legal framework protecting foreign investments, the conflict areas between investment treaty provisions and domestic public policies of host states are explored through an empirical analysis of some case studies and recent arbitrations. Finally, this dissertation holds that, at a substantive level, investment law is a part of international law. Thus it must be consistent with its norms and it has to be interpreted in accordance with customary rules of treaty interpretation. The dissertation concludes by suggesting the creation of a state-investor relationship and advocates, in part, the establishment of development objectives in investment treaties as well as the inclusion of rights and obligations for all parties involved...|$|E
