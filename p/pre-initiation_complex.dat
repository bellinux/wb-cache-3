2500|$|Eukaryotic DNA is {{bidirectional}}. Here {{the meaning}} of the word bidirectional is different. Eukaryotic linear DNA has many origins (called O) and termini (called T). [...] "T" [...] is present to the right of [...] "O". One [...] "O" [...] and one [...] "T" [...] together form one replicon. After the formation of <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complex,</b> when one replicon starts elongation, initiation starts in second replicon. Now, if the first replicon moves in clockwise direction, the second replicon moves in anticlockwise direction, until [...] "T" [...] of first replicon is reached. At [...] "T", both the replicons merge to complete the process of replication. Meanwhile, the second replicon is moving in forward direction also, to meet with the third replicon. This clockwise and counter-clockwise movement of two replicons is termed as bidirectional replication. On the other hand, in prokaryotes, replication is unidirection; and occurs only in clockwise direction.|$|E

The interactions of eIF3 with other initiation factors can vary amongst species; for example, mammalian eIF3 directly interacts with the eIF4F complex (via eIF4G), while budding yeast lacks this connection. However, both mammalian and yeast eIF3 independently bind eIF1, eIF4B, and eIF5.|$|R

25|$|The TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is {{required}} for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerases I, II and III, from promoters with or without a TATA box. In the presence of a TATA-less promoter, TBP binds with the help of TBP-associated factors (TAFs). TBP associates with a host of factors, including the general transcription factors TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, and -H, to form huge multi-subunit <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes</b> on the core promoter. Through its association with different transcription factors, TBP can initiate transcription from different RNA polymerases. There are several related TBPs, including TBP-like (TBPL) proteins.|$|R

To elucidate their mode of action, the effect of DuP 721 on individual steps of protein translation was studied. The drug does not interfere with translation initiation at the stage of mRNA binding or formation of 30 S <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes.</b> However, it inhibits the puromycin-mediated release of [35 S]formyl-methionine from 70 S initiation complexes in a dose-dependent manner.

5000|$|... lWhile pre-RC {{complexes}} mark potential {{sites for}} origin activation, further proteins and complexes must assemble at these sites to activate replication (origin firing). The following events must occur {{in order to}} activate the origin: the DNA helix has to open, the helicase must be activated, and DNA polymerases {{and the rest of}} the replicative machinery have to load onto the DNA. These events depend on the assembly of a several proteins to form the <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complex</b> at the replication origins loaded with pre-replicative complexes. Assembly of the <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complex</b> depends on the activities of S-Cdks and the protein kinase Cdc7. The <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complex</b> activates the Mcm helicase and recruits DNA polymerase.When the cell commits to a new cell cycle, after passing through the Start checkpoint, G1 and G1/S cyclin CDK complexes are activated. These activate the expression of the replicative machinery and of S-Cdk cylin complexes. S-Cdks and G1/S Cdks act to activate replication origins. At the same time, S-Cdks suppress formation of new pre-RCs during S phase, G2 and early M, when S cyclin levels remains high. Cdc7 is activated in late G1 and is required throughout S phase for origin firing. Mutations in this protein in budding yeast, and in its homolog in fission yeast block initiation of replication. Cdc7 is highly conserved - related proteins have been identified in frogs and humans. DNA replication is inhibited when Cdc7 homologs are inhibited with antibodies in frog or human cells. It is not known whether CDKs and Cdc7 just regulate protein assembly at origins, or whether they directly activate components of the <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E

5000|$|What do {{the repressive}} and {{permissive}} states represent? An attractive {{idea is that}} the repressed state is a closed chromatin conformation whilst the permissive states are more open. Another hypothesis is that the fluctuations between states reflect reversible transitions in the binding and dissociation of <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes.</b> Bursts may also result from bursty signalling, cell cycle effects or movement of chromatin to and from transcription factories. Bursting dynamics have been demonstrated to be influenced by cell size and the frequency of extracellular signalling. [...] Recent data suggest different degrees of supercoiling distinguish the permissive and inactive states.|$|R
40|$|Translation {{initiation}} factor eIF 3 {{acts as the}} key orchestrator of the canonical initiation pathway in eukaryotes, yet its structure is greatly unexplored. We report the 2. 2 [*]Å resolution crystal structure of the complex between the yeast seven-bladed β-propeller eIF 3 i/TIF 34 and a C-terminal α-helix of eIF 3 b/PRT 1, which reveals universally conserved interactions. Mutating these interactions displays severe growth defects and eliminates association of eIF 3 i/TIF 34 and strikingly also eIF 3 g/TIF 35 with eIF 3 and 40 S subunits in vivo. Unexpectedly, 40 S-association of the remaining eIF 3 subcomplex and eIF 5 is likewise destabilized resulting in formation of aberrant <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes</b> (PICs) containing eIF 2 and eIF 1, which critically compromises scanning arrest on mRNA at its AUG start codon suggesting that the contacts between mRNA and ribosomal decoding site are impaired. Remarkably, overexpression of eIF 3 g/TIF 35 suppresses the leaky scanning and growth defects most probably by preventing these aberrant PICs to form. Leaky scanning is also partially suppressed by eIF 1, {{one of the key}} regulators of AUG recognition, and its mutant sui 1 G 107 R but the mechanism differs. We conclude that the C-terminus of eIF 3 b/PRT 1 orchestrates co-operative recruitment of eIF 3 i/TIF 34 and eIF 3 g/TIF 35 to the 40 S subunit for a stable and proper assembly of 48 S <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes</b> necessary for stringent AUG recognition on mRNAs...|$|R

These elements are transcribed as ncRNAs by RNAP III in response to environmental stresses such as heat shock, where they then bind to RNAP II with high affinity and prevent the formation of active <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes.</b> This allows for the broad and rapid repression of gene expression in response to stress.|$|R

We have reproduced this effect by addition of purified, full-length VP 16 and the DNA-binding 'POU' domain of Oct- 1 (Oct- 1 /POU) to a HeLa cell in vitro transcription system. Stimulation of transcription was dependent on the IE-specific element, TAATGARAT. In agreement with earlier observations from electrophoretic mobility shift assays, activation was not observed when Oct- 2 /POU, the DNA-binding domain from the Oct- 2 protein, was substituted for Oct- 1 /POU. Single round transcription assays revealed that, together, VP 16 and Oct- 1 /POU facilitate the assembly of <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes</b> at target gene promoters...|$|R

40|$|A central {{hallmark}} of epigenetic inheritance is the parental transmission {{of changes in}} patterns of gene expression to progeny without modification of DNA sequence. Although, the trans-generational conveyance of this molecular memory has been traditionally linked to covalent modification of histone and/or DNA, recent studies suggest a role for proteins that persist or remain bound within chromatin to "bookmark" specific loci for enhanced or potentiated responses in daughter cells immediately following cell division. In this report we describe a role for p 300 in enabling gene bookmarking by <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes</b> (PICs) containing RNA polymerase II (pol II), Mediator and TBP.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how archaeal viruses perturb the {{transcription}} machinery of their hosts. Here we provide the first example of an archaeo-viral transcription factor that directly targets the host RNA polymerase (RNAP) and efficiently represses its activity. ORF 145 from the temperate Acidianus two-tailed virus (ATV) forms a high-affinity complex with RNAP by binding inside the DNA-binding channel where it locks the flexible RNAP clamp in one position. This counteracts the formation of transcription <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes</b> in vitro and represses abortive and productive transcription initiation, as well as elongation. Both host and viral promoters are subjected to ORF 145 repression. Thus, ORF 145 has the properties of a global transcription repressor and its overexpression is toxic for Sulfolobus.

40|$|Transcription is a {{multi-stage}} {{process that}} coordinates several steps within the transcription cycle including chromatin reorganization, RNA polymerase II recruitment, initiation, promoter clearance and elongation. Recent advances {{have identified the}} super elongation complex, containing the eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukaemia (ELL) protein, as a key regulator of transcriptional elongation. Here we show that ELL has a diverse and kinetically distinct role before its assembly into the super elongation complex by stabilizing Pol II recruitment/initiation and entry into the pause site. Loss of ELL destabilizes the <b>pre-initiation</b> <b>complexes</b> and results in disruption of early elongation and promoter proximal chromatin structure before recruitment of AFF 4 and other super elongation complex components. These changes result in significantly reduced transcriptional activation of rapidly induced genes.
