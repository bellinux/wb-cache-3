25|$|Many mass spectrometers work {{in either}} {{negative}} ion mode or <b>positive</b> <b>ion</b> mode.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{atmospheric}} positivity on the electrical properties of interfacial water was explored. Interfacial, or exclusion zone (EZ) water {{was created in}} the standard way, next to a sheet of Nafion placed horizontally {{at the bottom of a}} water-filled chamber. <b>Positive</b> atmospheric <b>ions</b> were created from a high voltage source placed above the chamber. Electrical potential distribution in the interfacial water was measured using microelectrodes. We found that beyond a threshold, the <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> diminished the magnitude of the negative electrical potential in the interfacial water, sometimes even turning it to <b>positive.</b> Additionally, <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> produced by an air conditioner were observed to generate similar effects; i. e., the electrical potential shifted in the positive direction but returned to negative when the air conditioner stopped blowing. Sometimes, the effect of the <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> from the air conditioner was strong enough to destroy the structure of interfacial water by turning the potential decidedly positive. Thus, <b>positive</b> air <b>ions</b> can compromise interfacial water negativity and may explain the known negative impact of <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> on health...|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of water in}} a solution of sodium chloride must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding gaseous oxygen in the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Cl− ions, cation, which is the <b>positive</b> <b>ion,</b> will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the sodium ion. The anion will then be attracted to the anode (+) oxidizing chloride ion.|$|E
25|$|Signal {{intensity}} may {{be dependent}} on many factors, especially {{the nature of the}} molecules being analyzed and how they ionize. The efficiency of ionization varies from molecule to molecule and from ion source to ion source. For example, in electrospray sources in <b>positive</b> <b>ion</b> mode a quaternary amine will ionize exceptionally well whereas a large hydrophobic alcohol will most likely not be seen no matter how concentrated. In an EI source these molecules will behave very differently. Additionally there may be factors that affect ion transmission disproportionally between ionization and detection.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} classes of {{components}} for oxide glasses: network formers, intermediates, and modifiers. The network formers (silicon, boron, germanium) form a highly cross-linked network of chemical bonds. The intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) {{can act as}} both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition. The modifiers (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge {{to compensate for the}} <b>positive</b> <b>ion</b> nearby. Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a network former (Pb4+ replacing Si4+), or as a modifier.|$|E
50|$|The {{process by}} which anode rays are formed in a gas {{discharge}} anode ray tube is as follows. When the high voltage {{is applied to the}} tube, its electric field accelerates the small number of ions (electrically charged atoms) always present in the gas, created by natural processes such as radioactivity. These collide with atoms of the gas, knocking electrons off of them and creating more <b>positive</b> <b>ions.</b> These ions and electrons in turn strike more atoms, creating more <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> in a chain reaction. The <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> are all attracted to the negative cathode, and some pass through the holes in the cathode. These are the anode rays.|$|R

25|$|Pigments appear {{the colors}} they are because they {{selectively}} reflect and absorb certain wavelengths of visible light. White light is a roughly equal {{mixture of the}} entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a range from about 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780nm. When this light encounters a pigment, parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the molecules or ions of the pigment. In organic pigments such as diazo or phthalocyanine compounds the light is absorbed by the conjugated systems of double bonds in the molecule. Some of the inorganic pigments such as vermilion (mercury sulfide) or cadmium yellow (cadmium sulfide) absorb light by transferring an electron from the negative ion (S2−) to the <b>positive</b> <b>ion</b> (Hg2+ or Cd2+). Such compounds are designated as charge-transfer complexes, with broad absorption bands that subtract most of {{the colors of the}} incident white light. The other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered. The new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color. Pigments, unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances, can only subtract wavelengths from the source light, never add new ones.|$|E
25|$|While {{the third}} {{generation}} of tubes were fundamentally {{the same as the}} second generation, they possessed two significant differences. Firstly, they used a GaAs—CsO—AlGaAs photocathode, which is more sensitive in the 800nm-900nm range than second-generation photocathodes. Secondly, the photocathode exhibits negative electron affinity (NEA), which provides photoelectrons that are excited to the conduction band a free ride to the vacuum band as the Cesium Oxide layer {{at the edge of the}} photocathode causes sufficient band-bending. This makes the photocathode very efficient at creating photoelectrons from photons. The Achilles heel of third generation photocathodes, however, is that they are seriously degraded by <b>positive</b> <b>ion</b> poisoning. Due to the high electrostatic field stresses in the tube, and the operation of the MicroChannel Plate, this led to the failure of the photocathode within a short period - as little as 100 hours before photocathode sensitivity dropped below Gen2 levels. To protect the photocathode from positive ions and gases produced by the MCP, they introduced a thin film of sintered aluminium oxide attached to the MCP. The high sensitivity of this photocathode, greater than 900 µA/lm, allows more effective low light response, though this was offset by the thin film, which typically blocked up to 50% of electrons.|$|E

Potassium {{is the major}} cation (<b>positive</b> <b>ion)</b> inside animal cells , while sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid [...] In the kidneys, about 180liters of plasma is filtered through the glomeruli and into the renal tubules per day. This filtering involves about 600g of sodium and 33g of potassium. Since only 1–10g of sodium and 1–4g of potassium {{are likely to be}} replaced by diet, renal filtering must efficiently reabsorb the remainder from the plasma.|$|E

40|$|After {{a general}} {{discussion}} of electron drift in a gas volume with electric and magnetic fields, distortions in the r and r phi coordinates arising from inhomogeneities {{of the electric}} and magnetic fields in the HARP TPC are calculated. Inhomogeneities of the electric field arise from i) <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> released by cosmic rays, ii) <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> released by interaction secondaries, iii) <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> released by beam muons, iv) <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> released from beam particles downstream of the inner field cage, and v) a high voltage misalignment between the outer and inner field cages. Also, distortions arising from the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field are calculated. These effects resolve the controversy on unphysical numbers of 'wrong-charge' TPC tracks. The bad news are that effects are too big to be neglected. The good news are that, with enough sweat and tears, they can be adequately corrected...|$|R

The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function.

Potassium chloride is used in the United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E

The C- 1, C- 2, C- 3, C- 4 and C- 5 <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> were found in the ETFE spectrum, while only the C- 1, C- 2 and C- 3 <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> were found in the PVDF spectrum. These results indicate that ETFE can be distinguished from PVDF by the presence of its characteristic C- 4 and C- 5 <b>positive</b> <b>ions.</b> Even though both ETFE and PVDF produce some of the same C- 3 <b>positive</b> <b>ions,</b> these <b>positive</b> <b>ions</b> come from different sequence structures. The negative ToF SIMS spectra of both ETFE and PVDF are totally dominated by F- (m/z = 19) because F- is very stable, due to its largest electronegative value, and fluorine concentration in ETFE and PVDF is relatively high. These results indicate that the chain sequence structure has a significant effect on the positive ToF-SIMS spectra of ETFE and PVDF, especially in the high-mass range. However, the chain sequence structure does not have much effect on the negative spectra of ETFE and PVDF. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This portion of the atmosphere is partially ionized and contains a plasma which {{is referred to as the}} ionosphere.

2500|$|Ultraviolet (UV), X-ray {{and shorter}} {{wavelengths}} of solar radiation are ionizing, since photons at these frequencies contain sufficient energy to dislodge an electron from a neutral gas atom or molecule upon absorption.

The reverse process to ionization is recombination, in which a free electron is [...] "captured" [...] by a <b>positive</b> <b>ion.</b> Recombination occurs spontaneously, and causes the emission of a photon carrying away the energy produced upon recombination. As gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process prevails, since the gas molecules and ions are closer together.
