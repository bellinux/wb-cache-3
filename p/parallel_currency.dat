40|$|In a {{surprisingly}} {{growing number of}} regions in Germany private "regional currencies" are issued as a cash substitute for the euro. Currently, these regional currencies are conceived almost exclusively as Schwundgeld (depreciative currency), which loses value on a predetermined timescale. This loss of value is intended to encourage the money owners to spend their money quickly in order to boost local demand. The paper shows that the issuance of unofficial <b>parallel</b> <b>currencies</b> is not a fundamentally new phenomenon neither in Germany nor in other European countries. The theoretical assumptions of the Schwundgeld concept (Silvio Gesell (1862 – 1930)) are highly flawed and suboptimal from a welfare-theoretical perspective. However, the current economic welfare losses resulting from the issuance of Schwundgeld are negligibly small.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} the {{conversion}} from national currency bank notes to hard-ECU notes is promoted by the provision of an implicit and free currency call option. This wealth effect {{is caused by the}} devaluation-proof definition of this currency. Nevertheless, additional transactions and information costs would keep the demand for hard-ECUs very limited. Because of such externalities the market does not lead to a Pareto-efficient arrangement for the European monetary order. At best the hard-ECU would out-compete currencies of EC countries with above-average inflation rates, while national currencies would remain in use in the other EC countries. In addition, the competition process is distorted by the subsidy character of the implicit option. The scheme is intended to enhance monetary stability in Europe, but the need for such an additional nominal anchor is not clear, nor is any reason why the Hard-ECU Bank should have an an extremely strong stability orientation. Moreover, a deliberate interest rate policy of the HEB, which would be required to discipline national central banks, conflicts with the main target of using the market as an exploratory device for identifying an optimum European monetary order.

50|$|In {{response}} to this situation, the government, which controlled all official foreign trade, continued to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of}} a shortage economy.

To {{the proponents of}} exchange restrictions, administrative-based allocation of a scarce resource is a viable economic option for countries that absorb external financial resources primarily {{in the form of}} official transfers. To the opponents of exchange restrictions, administrative-based methods of allocating reserves encourage <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> transactions. The incentives provided by the parallel premium have adverse resource allocation implications and welfare consequences. The model developed in this dissertation uses a general equilibrium framework to highlight the links between the goods market and the money market {{in a country where the}} foreign exchange market is bifurcated into an official and a <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> market. ^ Unlike in countries with market-based methods of allocating reserves—fixed or flexible, adjustment to excess demand pressures in nonunified systems occurs through changes which have real and monetary consequences.

40|$|Although today's main {{organisation}} {{principle of}} monetary spaces is the nation-state's one, everyone {{can see it}} is not totally the case because of the existence {{and the development of}} local and social currencies and other sorts of <b>parallel</b> <b>currencies.</b> European history gives very useful lessons on this matter. One can distinguish, indeed, three historical periods : firstly, an “old regime” with a great diversity of money, including forms of local currencies; secondly, the building of nation states and, consequently, what Benjamin Cohen (1998) calls a “westphalian model of geography of money”, centred on the principle of one nation, one money, excluding local currencies different from national currencies; thirdly, the contesting of such a regime of monetary sovereignty. European history gives, then, evidences that the contemporary dynamics of local currencies is not a new one, but that it is undoubtedly the most important of the third period. European history leads however to make significant differences between forms of monetary localisms. Those differences are analyzed within the following framework. First, we have to make a distinction between the nature of issuers : public authorities, groups of citizens, businesses and banks. Monetary localisms before the Westphalian era were mainly organized by public authorities (lords) and religious orders, whereas today's monetary localisms mainly come from citizens and businesses (except from emergency issues and secessions logics). Second, we have to make a distinction between the rationales for monetary localisms : sovereignty, seignoriage and financing needs, protecting spaces, revitalizing spaces, transforming the nature of exchanges and money. Monetary localisms before the Westphalian era were mainly organized in order to capture money and dynamize spaces, whereas one can find the four rationales in today's monetary localisms. The paper, after presenting the analytical framework, concentrates on three sorts of local currencies : local currencies as a result of necessities, local currencies issued by banks and local currencies aiming to change money. It concludes on the differences between local currencies in European history and contemporary local currencies. Local currencies;monetary history;Europe;Owen;Gesell;Banks of issue...|$|R
