5000|$|The General Formal Ontology (GFO) is an {{ontology}} integrating {{processes and}} objects. GFO includes elaborations of categories like objects, processes, time and space, properties, relations, roles, functions, facts, and situations. GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories, {{such as the}} existence of atomic time-intervals vs. dense time. Two of the specialties of GFO are its account of persistence and its time model. Regarding persistence, the distinction between endurants (objects) and perdurants (processes) is made explicit within GFO {{by the introduction of}} a special category, a <b>persistant.</b> A <b>persistant</b> is a special category with the intention that its instances [...] "remain identical" [...] over time. With respect to time, time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO, and time-points (called [...] "time boundaries") are derived. Moreover, time-points may coincide, which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes.|$|E

40|$|The French Revolution was the {{occasion}} for the reformulation of the definitions of basic concepts as liberté, égalité, fraternité, nation, patrie, etc. At {{the same time a}} lexical creativity, a large quantity of words appeared, some of them total news or with new significations, temporary or <b>persistants</b> (aristocruche, humanicide, enragés, loyaume, etc.). This paper examines aspects of lexical and semantic developments in Greek language focussing on the era of the French Revolution. This important period was characterized  by intensified contacts with Western Europe. In this process, Greek intellectuals expressed an open admiration of the new French model of the nation in their political works and attempted to form a new political language. Most of the modern notions were introduced from the French language, which in his turn had acquired a large amount of greek-latin loan words. The intercultural dimension provide the tools for analysing {{the ways in which the}} new terms and concepts were transfered to the greek vocabulary. These processes are examined as reflected in the Hellenic Nomarchy (Italy 1806), a crucial text of the period...|$|R
40|$|Park, {{have been}} {{reported}} to have higher concentrations of toxaphene than other lake trout populations of the Rocky Mountains. Our original hypothesis was that unusually high biomagnification via a long food chain was responsible for elevated levels of toxaphene and other persistent organochlorines in the lake trout. This hypothesis was refuted by the analyses of stable carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotope ratios in lake biota. Stable nitrogen isotope analyses dem-onstrated that the food chain length in Bow Lake was short. The sources of carbon (pelagic or benthic), as indicated by stable carbon isotope values, were highly correlated with organochlorine concentrations in the food web. Lake trout with more pelagic carbon signatures had higher organochlorine concentrations than littoral-feeding mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) and lake trout. The pelagic copepod Hesperodiaptomus arcticus had higher organochlorine concentrations (wet weight basis) than any other organism, including the fish. This was attributed to the high lipid con-tent of copepods and possibly their ingestion of suspended solids, including glacial silt or direct absorption from solu-tion in glacial inflows. Résumé: Les touladis du lac Bow, lac subalpin du parc national Banff situé près de la ligne de partage des eaux, sem-blent présenter des concentrations de toxaphène plus élevées que d’autres populations de touladis des montagnes Ro-cheuses. Nous sommes partis de l’hypothèse qu’une bioamplification anormalement forte le long d’une chaîne trophique très longue était responsable des teneurs élevées en toxaphène et en d’autres organochlorés <b>persistants</b> che...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. During September 1983 {{an unusually}} early {{freeze-up}} and persistent northwesterly winds that drove heavy multi-year ice into Proliv Longa {{and against the}} north coast of Chukotka resulted in a critical situation with regard to shipping in the Soviet eastern Arctic. Ports such as Zelenyy Mys and Mys Shmidta were prematurely closed by ice, leaving Pevek as the only functioning port {{in this part of}} the Arctic. Worse still, dozens of ships were beset in the ice at various points from the mouth of the Indigirka east to Bering Strait. One freighter, Nina Sagaydak, was crushed and sank near Kosa Dvukh Pilotov on 8 October; a sister ship, Kolya Myagotin, was badly holed and barely managed to limp out of the Arc-tic. Practically all available ice breakers, including the nuclear-powered icebreakers L nin, Leonid Brezhnev and Sibir’, were transferred from the western to the eastern Arctic to free the jammed ships. Ultimately all were rescued, but it was late November before the last ship sailed from Pevek. Many ships were forced to head west from Pevek to the Atlantic, rather than attempt to battle their way through the heavy ice in Proliv Longa in order to return to their Pacific home ports. Singled out for particular praise in Soviet post-mortems of the crisis were the nuclear-powered icebreakers and the new Noril’sk class (SA- 15) icebreaking freighters, several of which came straight from the Finnish shipyards to help rectify the situation in the eastern Arctic. Key words: Soviet eastern Arctic, Soviet Union, navigation, icebreaker &UM & En septembre 1983, un gel plus t 6 t que d’ordinaire et des vents <b>persistants</b> du nord-ouest qui pousdrent de la vieille glace misse dans la Proliv Longa et contre la c 8 te nord de Chukotka crerent une situation critique quant h la navigation dans l’est de l’Arctique soviettique.

40|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of patients}} with acute coronary syndromes is directly depends on risk, so it is necessary for the risk stratification to be carried out both at the admittance and during the treatment phase, as well as after the dismissal from hospital. There are many variables that influence the risk, being categorized as either high or low. It is important to emphasise that low risk doesn’t mean that there is no risk at all. The sort of therapic approach that would be applied depends on electrocardiogramic presentation of acute isochemical syndrome. If the patient with <b>persistant</b> elevation of ST segments is in question, then the first step is aimed at achieving reperfusion by the trombolitical therapy application or primary percutanae coronary intervention. Trombolisis is not applied in case of a patient who doesn’t have a <b>persistant</b> ST elevation, but expresses ST segments depression, change of T waves or has a normal electrocardiograme (acute coronary syndrome without <b>persistant</b> ST evaluation). If there is a high risk, the inhibitors of receptors Gp llb/lla and higher coronary angiography are applied. However, if there is a low risk, troponines are determined again. If troponines are positive, the procedure is the same as in patient with high risk; if troponines are negative two times, further procedure depens on the stress test results. A long-term treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome is necessary in order to prevent new cardic events to come into being. It presuposes life style change, modification of risk factors as well a medications for second prevention...|$|E
