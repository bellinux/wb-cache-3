40|$|The aim of {{the article}} {{is to examine the}} impact of {{progressive}} personal income tax rates and the effectiveness of this tax as an automatic economic stabilizer. The assessment of automatic stabilizers is based on the estimates of tax cyclical components. The study shows that the output elasticity of PIT is higher than one, which means that the analysed tax acts relatively efficiently as an automatic stabilizer. However, it was also observed that the tax progressivity is not the main reason of the effectiveness of a <b>progressive</b> <b>PIT</b> as an automatic stabilizer. The study shows that changes in <b>progressive</b> rates of <b>PIT,</b> contrary to widespread opinions, have little effect on the effectiveness of passive fiscal policy. Personal income tax acts as automatic stabilizer mostly due not to the progressive tax rates, but because of the sensitivity of employment to GDP fluctuations...|$|R

Bourne {{was a student}} of Dewey at Columbia, but he rejected Dewey's idea of using the war to spread democracy. (He {{was a member of}} the Boar's Head Society.) In his pointedly titled 1917 essay [...] "Twilight of Idols", he invoked the progressive pragmatism of Dewey's contemporary William James to argue that America was using democracy as an end to justify the war, but that democracy itself was never examined. Although initially following Dewey, he felt that Dewey had betrayed his democratic ideals by focusing only on the facade of a democratic government rather than on the ideas behind democracy that Dewey had once professed to respect.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the tax burden on labour income in Croatia, Austria, Greece, Hungary and Poland in 2013. The Taxing Wages {{methodology}} has been applied to hypothetical units across a range of gross wages in order to calculate net average tax wedge, net average tax rate, as well as other relevant indicators. When it comes to single workers without children, the smallest tax wedge for workers earning less than the average gross wage was found in Croatia, while Poland had the smallest tax wedge for above-average wages. Due to a <b>progressive</b> <b>PIT</b> system, the tax wedge for a single worker in Croatia reaches 50 % at 400 % of the average gross wage, equalling that of Austria, Greece and Hungary. Tax wedges for couples with two children show a similar trend...|$|R
40|$|Surface pitting {{occurs when}} InP {{electrodes}} are anodized in KOH electrolytes at {{concentrations in the}} range 2 - 5 mol dm- 3. The process has been investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the results correlated with cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electroanalytical measurements. AFM measurements show that pitting of the surface occurs and the density of pits is observed to increase with time under both potentiodynamic and potentiostatic conditions. This indicates a <b>progressive</b> <b>pit</b> nucleation process and implies {{that the development of}} porous domains beneath the surface is also progressive in nature. Evidence for this is seen in plan view TEM images in which individual domains are seen to be at different stages of development. Analysis of the cyclic voltammograms of InP electrodes in 5 mol dm- 3 KOH indicates that, above a critical potential for pit formation, the anodic current is predominantly time dependent and there is little differential dependence of the current on potential. Thus, pores continue to grow with time when the potential is high enough to maintain depletion layer breakdown conditions...|$|R
40|$|Using {{multi-level}} modeling, {{this study}} investigates {{the determinants of}} public opinion on personal income taxation (PIT) in Central and Eastern European countries. The analysis finds that socio-economic and demographic variables, such as household income, occupational social class, and age, are important in determining PIT preferences. However, beliefs about fairness and perceptions of corruption also play a significant role. Support for progressive taxation decreases with the acceptance of income differences {{as a reward for}} talent and effort. Also, distrust of the legal system and a conviction that tax authorities treat certain people more favorably than others increase support for progressive taxation, although this latter effect is constrained to the less affluent. These results indicate that <b>progressive</b> <b>PIT</b> might be understood by the public as a corrective measure vis-à-vis inequalities arising due to corruption. The study finds little evidence for the importance of country-level variables, such as income inequality or the institutional features of income tax systems. Nevertheless, there is a moderately strong association between overall economic development and average support for progressive taxation. The public in less developed post-socialist countries are more in favor of non-redistributive forms of taxation, such as the flat tax and lump-sum taxation. This tendency may reflect their increased willingness to accept neoliberal reforms under circumstances of growing pressure to improve the international competitiveness of the domestic economy...|$|R
40|$|Describe the {{modeling}} of progressive income tax in Lithuania, applying the progressive {{personal income tax}} models of Poland, Croatia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Ireland and Denmark. Relevance. In every country employees' income is taxed by Personal Income Tax (PIT) {{and the question of}} taxation is important for majority of people. Moreover, it is important to highlight that personal income taxation is changing according to economic situation of the country and this is happening quite often. PIT is not harmonized in EU countries and due to this reason every country applies different income taxation models. In the scientific researches there are emphasized that economically developed countries usually apply the <b>progressive</b> <b>PIT</b> models, when the higher tax rate is applied for the higher income level. However, economically developing countries generally use the proportional PIT model in which there is just one tax rate for all income levels. In order to ascertain the right model for the country, it is essential to understand their differences and peculiarities. Evaluating the situation in Lithuania, it is important to emphasize that The Republic of Lithuania Law on Income of Individuals was accepted in 2003 and since then has been adjusted 69 times. Frequent changes of the income tax treatment cause difficulties for both taxpayers and tax administrators. Moreover, the changes affect Lithuanian national revenue collection. In order to improve collection of tax revenues, it is essential to implement the reform of the tax system. Different opinions raise the debate and require researches which estimate the effect of the progressive personal income tax models on tax income from PIT...|$|R

Based on a practical assumption that image blocks to be inverse transformed are generally sparse, this paper presents a method to minimize both side effects simultaneously...|$|R

Moreover, this study tested 200 pictures in different categories and parameters. In consequence, the overall bit rates can be reduced significantly with good PSNR values and user satisfaction.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two {{schemes that}} combine JPEG and Segmented Image Coding (SIC) for progressive image transmission.

Introduction <b>Progressive</b> image transmission (<b>PIT)</b> involves the gradual improvement in the quality of an image as more information is transmitted. In recent years, PIT has been proposed as a means of providing the user as soon as possible with an interpretable image, in the specific situation where he/she is interactively interrogating an image database over a low capacity transmission channel, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This allows the user to decide whether to wait for a more detailed reconstruction, or to abort the transmission. Access to large image dat [...] ...|$|R

Through PIT, it is possible to expedite such activities as browsing through remote databases. He developed and tested a number of first and second generation morphological pyramidal techniques, which achieved compression ratios of around 100:1 for good quality, lossy, still image transmission. Professor Venetsanopoulos contributed to the area of vector quantization for lossy image compression and developed a number of hierarchical coding techniques for still images. Wavelet techniques for still image compression were also considered, as well as fractal-based techniques compressing and coding still images and video sequences. His latest contributions in telecommunications were in the area of mobility management, with the development of cost effective algorithms for mobile terminal location and determination and WLAN positioning systems. This area has attracted interest for its applications to emergency communications, location-sensitive browsing and resource allocation.|$|R

With Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as frontrunners, the 2008 Democratic primary campaign was a watershed moment in U. S. history. Offering the choice of an African American man or a white woman as the next Democratic candidate for president, the primary marked an unprecedented moment—but one that painfully echoed previous struggles for <b>progressive</b> change that <b>pitted</b> race and gender against each other. Who Should Be First? collects key feminist voices that challenge the instances of racism and sexism {{during the presidential campaign}} season, offer personal reflections on this historic moment, and trace the historic legacy of opposing issues of race and gender that informed debates and media representations of the 2008 Democratic primary. Over thirty leading feminists contribute to the book, including Patricia J. Williams, Gloria Steinem, Alice Walker, Carol Moseley Braun, Maureen Dowd, Katha Pollitt, Pearl Cleage, Robin Morgan, Erica Jong, Mark Anthony Neal, and M. Jacqui Alexander. Editors Beverly Guy-Sheftall and Johnnetta Betsch Cole deftly balance these charged conversations in the first collection on this key moment in contemporary U. S. history...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent times}} {{there has been}} a concerted effort from some researchers, reformers and {{practitioners}} in the alcohol and other drug field to convince policy-makers, politicians and others that heroin use is, above all, a health problem. This push has occurred in a discursive framework <b>pitting</b> <b>progressive</b> and compassionate harm minimisation strategies against more punitive programs of prohibition. Within this framework, harm minimisation strategies are frequently cast as a response to heroin use as a health problem, while prohibition and punishment are characterised as responses to drug dependence as criminal. We argue that this polarisation of crime/prohibition against health/harm minimisation is a political red herring. Using deconstructive tools from contemporary social-political theory, we show how competing understandings of heroin use may mask a different kind of political contest. Exploring the discursive intertwining of people, practices and substances, we challenge the appropriateness of figuring different proposals to govern heroin use as a contest between science and politics, or of health-centred versus crime-centred strategies. We ask after the consequences of figuring criminal and medical arenas as rival frameworks for governing heroin use, and point to the perils associated with the apportionment of blame and victimhood therein. The broader aim underpinning our work is to locate and unpick political resistance to progressive harm minimisation strategies. Heather Brook and Rebecca Stringer[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2 D-GE) {{images are}} one of the tools for protein {{research}}. The research method with images containing protein spots is called proteomics. Currently, there are many image databases on-line and biologists can use them through the internet. In order to transmit this type of data quickly, one of the,methods for image transfer is called the <b>Progressive</b> Image Transmission (<b>PIT)</b> method. Biologists are interested in spots, which might have important proteins residing inside the spots and it is important to transmit these important parts of the image data first. The Tsai et al. method provides a technique to transmit the more important parts of the images from the first several phases. However, the Tsai et al. method used only one (1) threshold to find these parts, which is not considered sufficient. This is due to the less important parts in different regions of the image data having different levels. If only one (1) threshold is used, there will be some loss of the more important parts of the image. For this reason, a losses compression progressive image transmission method was designed in this research that uses more than one (1) threshold to detect the more important parts Of an image. In the experimental results, the most important parts were detected better than the Tsai et al. method. And, this method allows the quick viewing of the location, size and color of the most important parts through the first several phases...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} coding scheme for <b>Progressive</b> Image Transmission (<b>PIT)</b> {{based on two}} components, that is the smooth and edge components, is presented. The image is first {{decimated}} by using the pyramid coding technique with a decimation factor of 4 : 1. A multistage predictive locally adaptive vector quantization (MSPVQ) progressively transmits the decimated image that represents the smooth component of the scene. The first stage of the proposed (VQ) gives a general grasp of the Lena image at a compression ratio as high as 80 : 1. An adaptive VQ (LAVQ) encodes the difference image, which contains the quantization and edges' error of the smooth component. By adding the encoded image components, an excellent reproduction is achieved at a low bit rate of only 0. 2 bit per pixel (bpp), i. e. compression ratio of 40 : 1, with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 36. 92 dB. It is also shown that, for Lena image and for the same PSNR of about 34 dB, the bit rate using the proposed algorithm is very low of only 0. 2 bpp. This bit rate is lower than about 0. 6 bpp using JPEG algorithm[10], and much lower than that using BTC-DCT [1] or SB-DCT [11] algorithms. Thus the proposed algorithm results in a saving of about 0. 4 in the bit rate for the same visual quality. © 1998 IEEE. IEE...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a focused}} ion beam (FIB) instrument, electron-transparent samples (termed foils) have been cut from the {{naturally}} weathered surfaces of perthitic alkali feldspars recovered from soils overlying the Shap granite, northwest England. Characterization of these foils by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has enabled determination of the crystallinity and chemical composition of near-surface regions of the feldspar and {{an assessment of the}} influence of intragranular microtextures on the microtopography of grain surfaces and development of etch pits. Damage accompanying implantation of the 30 kV Ga+ ions used for imaging and deposition of protective platinum prior to ion milling creates amorphous layers beneath outer grain surfaces, but can be overcome by coating grains with 	&#x 3 E; 85 nm of gold before FIB work. The sidewalls of the foil and feldspar surrounding original voids are also partially amorphized during later stages of ion milling. No evidence was found for the presence of amorphous or crystalline weathering products or amorphous "leached layers" immediately beneath outer grain surfaces. The absence of a leached layer indicates that chemical weathering of feldspar in the Shap soils is stoichiometric, or if non-stoichiometric, either the layer is too thin to resolve by the TEM techniques used (i. e., &#x 2264; &#x 223 C; 2. 5 nm) or an insufficient proportion of ions have been leached from near-surface regions so that feldspar crystallinity is maintained. No evidence was found for any difference in the mechanisms of weathering where a microbial filament rests on the feldspar surface. Sub-micrometer-sized steps on the grain surface have formed where subgrains and exsolution lamellae have influenced the propagation of fractures during physical weathering, whereas finer scale corrugations form due to compositional or strain-related differences in dissolution rates of albite platelets and enclosing tweed orthoclase. With <b>progressive</b> weathering, etch <b>pits</b> that initiated at the grain surface extend into grain interiors as etch tubes by exploiting preexisting networks of nanopores that formed during the igneous history of the grain. The combination of FIB and TEM techniques is an especially powerful way of exploring mechanisms of weathering within the "internal zone" beneath outer grain surfaces, but results must be interpreted with caution owing to the ease with which artifacts can be created by the high-energy ion and electron beams used in the preparation and characterization of the foils. </p...|$|R
