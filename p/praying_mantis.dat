5|$|Insects have {{appeared}} in mythology around the world from ancient times. Among the insect groups featuring in myths are the bee, butterfly, cicada, dragonfly, <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> and scarab beetle. Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to dragonflies, signifying the impossibility of immortality. Amongst the Arrernte Aborigines of Australia, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} San bushmen of the Kalahari, it is the <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultural}} trope {{imagines the}} female mantis as a femme fatale. The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others. It ends Isabella Rossellini's short {{film about the}} life of a <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} robot {{inspired by}} the forelegs of the <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.|$|E
5|$|Among the insects, in both Japan and Europe, as {{far back}} as ancient Greece and Rome, a {{butterfly}} was seen as the personification of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, while the <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are {{an order}} (Mantodea) of insects that {{contains}} over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest {{family is the}} Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies {{may or may not}} have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name <b>praying</b> <b>mantis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scarab beetles held {{religious}} and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to Odonata that signify the impossibility of immortality. Among the Aborigines of Australia of the Arrernte language groups, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} 'San' bush-men of the Kalahari, it is the <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> that holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
5|$|A style more melodic {{and more}} akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally {{represented}} during the NWOBHM. The music of Def Leppard, <b>Praying</b> <b>Mantis,</b> White Spirit, Demon, Shy, Gaskin, Dedringer and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock, included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After {{the peak of the}} movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.|$|E
5|$|Various wuxia {{novels and}} folk legends have endowed Zhou with {{different}} kinds of martial and supernatural skills. These range from mastery of the bow, double broadswords, and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong and even x-ray vision. Practitioners of Eagle Claw, Chuojiao and Xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with Yue Fei, the supposed progenitor of these styles. He is also linked to Northern <b>Praying</b> <b>Mantis</b> boxing via Lin Chong and Yan Qing. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing. However, the oldest historical record that mentions his name only says he taught archery to Yue Fei. Nothing is ever said about him knowing or teaching a specific style of Chinese martial arts.|$|E
5|$|The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists {{more than}} 500 {{recording}} bands {{established in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing {{by the end of}} the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as <b>Praying</b> <b>Mantis</b> in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.|$|E

25|$|Dotaku {{were used}} for about 400 years, between the second century B.C. and the second century C.E. (corresponding {{to the end of}} the Yayoi era), and were nearly only used as decorations for rituals. They were richly {{decorated}} with patterns representing nature and animals, among which the dragonfly, <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> and spider are featured. Historians believe that dōtaku were used to pray for good harvests, as the animals featured are natural enemies of insect pests that attack paddy fields.|$|E
25|$|Birds such as flickers, acorn woodpeckers, Mexican jays, and flycatchers {{are typical}} predators of M. flavitarsis. In {{addition}} to birds, ants will often try {{to invade the}} wasp nests. The wasps fight back by attempting to drive and throw the ants off the nest. They will also rub their abdomen on nest surfaces to deter ants from approaching. One final predator of M. flavitarsis is the <b>praying</b> <b>mantis,</b> which will eat perching males during mating season.|$|E
25|$|Although P. gibbosus {{feeds on}} insects, {{they are also}} prey for certain insects as well. Predatory insects for P. gibbosus include <b>praying</b> <b>mantis,</b> robber flies, and dragonflies. Sometimes, smaller P. gibbosus {{individuals}} will be preyed on by larger wasps. Some birds will even regularly consume wasps. A few examples of birds that prey on P. gibbosus include sparrows, wrens, and summer tanagers. In general, these birds normally exclusively hunt solitary wasps, making P. gibbosus an ideal target. Moreover, the birds avoid disturbing P. gibbosus near their nests.|$|E

He has also studied other arts including Baguazhang (Eight trigram palm), Taijiquan (Supreme ultimate fist), Xing Yi Quan (Shape intent fist), Zui Quan (Drunken fist), Ying Zhao Quan (Eagle claw fist) and Tanglangquan (<b>Praying</b> <b>mantis</b> fist). He did not learn Nanquan (Southern fist), because his training focused only in the Northern Shaolin Styles. He has also studied some of wushu's main weapons, such as Sanjiegun (Three Section Staff), Gùn, Dao (Broadsword), Jian (Straight Sword) and many more.|$|E
25|$|Mischocyttarus flavitarsis is {{a social}} paper wasp found in western North America. Their nests can be found both in forests close to rivers or in close {{proximity}} to human life under the eaves of roofs. Despite the fact that M. flavitarsis nests are frequently in close contact with humans, M. flavitarsis typically will not sting, but rather ram into the threatening individual. Their colony cycle typically begins before May and will last until October. The queen will then seek a hibernation site for the winter. Perched near female hibernation sites are males with whom the female will mate. The males have claimed their territory by rubbing sternal brushes along the border of the site, leaving a chemical that deters other individuals from approaching. M. flavitarsis feed on arthropods, nectar, and animal carcasses and are often prey to birds, ants, and <b>praying</b> <b>mantis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{no obvious}} amino acid {{sequence}} similarity from pathogen to host factors, structural studies have revealed that mimicry can still occur at the host level. In some cases, pathogenic mimics can possess a structural architecture that differs markedly {{from that of the}} functional homologues. Therefore, proteins of dissimilar sequence may have a common structure which elicits an autoimmune response. It has been hypothesized that these virulent proteins display their mimicry through molecular surfaces that mimic host protein surfaces (protein fold or three-dimensional conformation), which have been obtained by convergent evolution. It has also been theorized that these similar protein folds have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer, most likely from a eukaryotic host. This further supports the theory that microbial organisms have evolved a mechanism of concealment similar to that of higher organisms such as the African <b>praying</b> <b>mantis</b> or chameleon who camouflage themselves so that they can mimic their background as not to be recognized by others.|$|E
25|$|Malcolm Nance is {{a retired}} U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer in naval cryptology. He {{garnered}} expertise within the fields of intelligence and counterterrorism. He served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, from 1981–2001. Nance was an interpreter for Russian, and began working in the intelligence field through research {{into the history of}} the Soviet Union and its spying agency the KGB. He devoted years of research to analyzing Middle East terrorism and sovereign nations with ties to Russia. He graduated from New York's Excelsior College with a degree in Arabic. Nance took part in combat operations which occurred after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, was involved with the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, served on the USS Wainwright during Operation <b>Praying</b> <b>Mantis</b> and participated in the sinking of Iranian missile boat Joshan, served on the USS Tripoli during the Gulf War, and assisted during a Banja Luka, Bosnia air strike.|$|E
25|$|The mid-2000s {{would bring}} further {{confusing}} shake-ups and rotations. Tony O'Hora (ex-Onslaught, <b>Praying</b> <b>Mantis)</b> replaced Brown as lead vocalist in 2003. Ian Gibbons {{came back for}} a third stint as fill-in keyboardist in June 2005 for a gig in the Faroe Islands. O'Hora decided to split to take a teaching job in late 2005. Grant then jumped from keyboards to lead vocals and bass as Phil Lanzon returned on keyboards for a tour of Russia and Germany in October/November. New singer Mark Thompson Smith (ex-Praying Mantis) joined in November 2005 for some Swedish gigs, while Jo Burt (ex-Black Sabbath) was temporary bass player. Tony Mills (ex-Shy) was slated to be Sweet's new singer in early 2006 but failed to work out and left after six shows in Denmark. At this point, Ohora came back as fill in front man and then Grant did another turn himself as the singer/bassist (Steve Mann depped on keyboards) until the group finally landed a new permanent front man when Peter Lincoln (ex-Sailor) arrived in July 2006. The line-up then consisted of Scott, Bisland, Grant and Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Nothing more {{happened}} in the south, until Iraq liberated the Al-Faw Peninsula while also re-capturing all land lost in the central front. Iraq could attack Iranian oil platforms and oil tankers while their own oil was transported via Kuwait and other Arab countries. Iran got frustrated and started attacking Kuwait, and later any tanker from pro-Iraq Arab countries, which ended in the US starting Operation Earnest Will to protect the ships, Iran kept on attacking and, after a US ship was heavily damaged by an Iranian mine the US launched Operation <b>Praying</b> <b>Mantis.</b> In this operation they first destroyed 2 Iranian oil-platforms, followed by the largest naval battle since World War II. The Iranian navy lost a frigate, a gunboat and several speedboats during the battle. In the north Iran continued advancing and Saddam started gassing the Kurdish population. Following this Ayatollah Khomeini finally accepted peace. But by this time Saddam didn't want peace anymore and together with the MEK conducted a joint attack to capture the town of Mehran in the Iranian province of Ilam {{as well as providing}} air support for the MEK advance in the province of Kermanshah. Saddam came under heavy international pressure which prompted him to withdraw his troops back across the border from Mehran, leaving the MEK army in occupation of the town. However the Iranian armed forces were able to defeat the MEK army which was largely destroyed in Operation Mersad. Now Saddam also accepted peace and the 8-year war was finally over.|$|E

500|$|The name mantodea {{is formed}} from the Ancient Greek words [...] (mantis) meaning [...] "prophet", and [...] (eidos) meaning [...] "form" [...] or [...] "type". It was coined in 1838 by the German {{entomologist}} Hermann Burmeister. The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis. The name mantid properly refers only {{to members of}} the family Mantidae, which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common name, <b>praying</b> <b>mantis,</b> applied to any species in the order, but in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa, comes from the typical [...] "prayer-like" [...] posture with folded fore limbs. The vernacular plural [...] "mantises" [...] (used in this article) was confined largely to the USA, with [...] "mantids" [...] predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere in 1996.|$|E

The first bands of the newborn musical movement competed for space in venues with punk outfits, often causing clubs to specialise, presenting only punk or only rock and hard rock. Differences in ideology, attitude and looks also caused heated rivalries between the two audiences.
