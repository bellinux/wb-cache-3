50|$|A {{less than}} one inch thick plate has enough {{resistance}} to turn a 7.62 x 63 mm standard-issue M2 armor piercing bullet to dust. The test plate outperformed a solid metal plate of similar thickness, while weighing far less. Other potential applications include nuclear waste (shielding X-rays, gamma rays and neutron radiation) transfer and thermal insulation for space vehicle atmospheric re-entry, with twice the resistance to fire and heat as the <b>plain</b> <b>metals.</b>|$|R

50|$|Complaints {{from the}} pilots {{led to a}} search for a solution. Beatrice 'Tilly' Shilling, a young female {{engineer}} working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, came up with a disarmingly simple solution. She introduced a simple flow restrictor: a small metal disc much like a <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> washer. The restrictor orifice was made to accommodate just the fuel needed for maximum engine power, the power setting usually used during dogfights. It came in two versions, one for 12 psi manifold pressure and one for boosted engines with 15 psi manifold pressure.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} altered {{and is now}} a range of laboratories, lecture theatres, staff offices and ancillary service/storage/work areas arranged off the main east-west corridor of the original master plan. There are concrete stairs at each end. Some early fabric survives including the concrete stair with <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> balustrading to the east, some joinery and stop chamfered concrete beams and posts to the ground floor. The interior walls are painted or plastered brick, with plain plastered ceilings and concrete floors (some with vinyl and carpet floor coverings). Suspended ceilings conceal plaster ceilings.|$|E
5000|$|Concentration {{of force}} into a smaller area was {{initially}} attained by replacing the single metal (usually steel) {{shot with a}} composite shot using two metals, a heavy core (based on tungsten) inside a lighter metal outer shell. These designs were known either as armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR), high-velocity armor-piercing (HVAP) and [...] "hartkern" [...] (hard core) (resp. by the British, US and Germans). On impact, the core had a much more concentrated effect than <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> shot of the same weight and size. However, the air resistance and other effects {{were the same as}} for the shell of identical size.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} hunting costume was specified as [...] "a blue frock, with <b>plain</b> yellow <b>metalled</b> buttons, scarlet velvet cape, and double-breasted scarlet flannel waistcoat, {{the coat}} sleeve {{to be cut}} and turned up" [...] and was strictly enforced with fines of a guinea per infraction. This changed in 1770 to a red coat, green velvet cape and green waistcoat, and modern club members are distinguished by their green collars.|$|R
5000|$|Shielded housings. A {{conductive}} {{metal housing}} {{will act as}} an interference shield. In order to access the components, such a housing is typically made in sections (such as a box and lid); an RF gasket may be used at the joints {{to reduce the amount}} of interference that leaks through the joint. RF gaskets come in various types. A <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> gasket may be either braided wire or a flat strip slotted to create many springy [...] "fingers". Where a waterproof seal is required, a flexible elastomeric base may be impregnated with chopped metal fibers dispersed into the interior or long metal fibers covering the surface or both.|$|E
5000|$|The western {{elevation}} {{features a}} gable with twin two-over two windows inset {{in a wooden}} casing. [...] The gable/pediment is covered in slate. An almost-full, flat-roofed poured concrete rear porch is supported by four square metal posts with <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> capitals. [...] A one-over-one, double-hung window {{is set in the}} southern end of the elevation, just off the porch. Two doors open onto the back porch; the northern-most door has leaded glass, the other a single pane. [...] Another one-over-one, double-hung window at the northern end of the porch finishes the rear elevation. [...] There is a concrete cistern under the north end of the porch that was used to hold rainwater when the home was first built.|$|E
50|$|In 1892, a {{light brown}} cloth helmet cover, the M1892 Überzug, became {{standard}} issue for all Pickelhauben for manoeuvres and active service. The Überzug {{was intended to}} protect the helmet from dirt and reduce its combat visibility, as the brass and silver fittings on the Pickelhaube proved to be highly reflective. Regimental numbers were sewn or stenciled in red (green from August 1914) onto {{the front of the}} cover, other than in units of the Prussian Guards, which never carried regimental numbers or other adornments on the Überzug. With exposure to the sun, the Überzug faded into a tan shade. In October 1916 the colour was changed to be feldgrau (field grey), although by that date the <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> Stahlhelm was standard issue for most troops.|$|E
6000|$|Lieutenant Darwaysh (the linesman) who was {{too weak}} to ride, and Sub-Lieutenant Mohammed (the miner) who was too old to travel, had charge of the sick; both found the far niente equally sweet. On February 17th I again bade adieu to the gunboat Mukhbir, and marched with the largest party upon our camp at El-Muwaylah, distant about six miles (=one hour and forty-five minutes). The path from Sharm Yáhárr crosses the hard sands of the {{maritime}} <b>plain,</b> <b>metalled</b> with the natural macadam of the Desert. The stone is mostly dark silex, the [...] "hen's liver" [...] of the Brazil, and its surface is kept finely polished, and free from [...] "patina," [...] by the friction of the dust-laden winds. The line is deeply gashed by short, broad gullies: the Hajj-road, running further east, heads these ugly Nullahs. The third and largest channel is Wady Surr, the great valley of El-Muwaylah, which may be regarded as the southern frontier of [...] "Madyan" [...] (Proper): we shall trace it to its head in the Hismá.|$|R
50|$|The Tool and Gauge Shop and Metrology Laboratory {{built in}} the 1930s and 40s are {{severely}} geometric structures of the Functionalist style of architecture, with <b>plain</b> facebrick walls, <b>metal</b> framed and louvre windows set in walls with horizontal parapets devoid of decoration.|$|R
50|$|Expanded metal is {{frequently}} {{used to make}} fences, walkways, and grates, as the material is very durable and strong, unlike lighter and less expensive wire mesh. The many small openings in the material allow flow through of air, water, and light, while still providing a mechanical barrier to larger objects. Another advantage to using expanded metal as opposed to <b>plain</b> sheet <b>metal</b> is that the exposed edges of the expanded metal provide more traction, {{which has led to}} its use in catwalks or drainage covers.|$|R
5000|$|All {{police forces}} in England and Wales {{have their own}} [...] "helmet plates" [...] {{attached}} {{to the front of}} the helmet, most of which feature the county's coat of arms/crest or [...] "EiiR" [...] after Elizabeth II in the centre. Also, most helmet plates now feature parts with coloured enamel, such as the force name or crest. Adding enamel to helmet plates has only been done since around 1985, most forces before this had <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> ones with no or little colour. Some forces also used [...] "night plates", which were usually darkened apart from the centre, and [...] "day plates" [...] which were metal, in order to not give the officer away at night time. This practice had almost completely ceased by 1973.|$|E
50|$|After 1964, Katz {{increasingly}} portrayed {{groups of}} figures. He would continue painting these complex groups into the 1970s, portraying {{the social world}} of painters, poets, critics, and other colleagues that surrounded him. He began designing sets and costumes for choreographer Paul Taylor in the early 1960s, and he has painted many images of dancers throughout the years. One Flight Up (1968) consists of more than 30 portraits {{of some of the}} leading lights of New York's intelligentsia during the late 1960s, such as the poet John Ashbery, the art critic Irving Sandler and the curator Henry Geldzahler, who championed Andy Warhol. Each portrait is painted using oils on both sides of a sliver of aluminium that has then been cut into the shape of the subject's head and shoulders. The silhouettes are arranged predominantly in four long rows on a <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> table.|$|E
5000|$|The plan is {{organised}} {{about an}} L-shaped corridor off which studios, workshops, staff offices and storage/service areas open. Some internal spaces have been partitioned but the original internal spatial relations have been maintained though service ducts and lighting fixtures now intrude. Original fabric survives including the roof lights and pressed metal ceilings {{to the level}} two former woolclassing area now partitioned as F204 and F201; decorative pressed metal ceilings, concrete columns in a Tuscan order and dentilled plaster cornices with egg and dart mouldings to the ceilings and exposed beams in F101; decorative pressed metal ceilings with moulded [...] "acanthus" [...] pattern cornices to the corridors of level two; decorative pressed metal ceilings to the vestibule to the link across to J Block from level 2; decorative plaster cornice to {{the ceiling of the}} stairwell; doors and skirting boards to each floor; tiles to floor and walls of locker rooms on each level; and a polished concrete stair with <b>plain</b> <b>metal</b> balustrading.|$|E

5000|$|Nathan Ells {{addressed}} a situation regarding A.J. Minette {{in an interview}} stating, [...] "A.J. was tired of playing <b>metal,</b> <b>plain</b> and simple, {{and the rest of}} the band wants to continue the high-energy live shows and hard edged sound that we have fashioned and developed over the past two years." ...|$|R
50|$|Morestone {{cars in the}} 1950s {{were painted}} a variety of {{non-metallic}} colors, and often were two toned paint. Their wheels were most often <b>plain</b> silver <b>metal.</b> 1960s Budgie cars and trucks were reminiscent of Matchbox, though slightly smaller, with less detail, and simpler with plain paint and no windows (Ragan 2000, p. 27-28). It seems the detail increasingly required to satisfy Matchbox and Hot Wheels' toy-hungry children was something Budgie had problems keeping up with. The Morestone, Modern Product and ESSO series toys were a smaller scale and were the more common; some trucks and motorcycles were a bit larger scale, somewhat like Corgi Toys or Dinkys.|$|R
