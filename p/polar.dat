5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The <b>polar</b> bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge <b>polar</b> bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and <b>polar</b> bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of <b>polar</b> bears, while <b>polar</b> bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of <b>polar</b> bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{connection between}} <b>polars</b> and intermediate <b>polars</b> (IPs) {{is not yet}} well established. Soft X-ray IPs are good candidates for progenitors of <b>polars,</b> but their magnetic field strengths are poorly constrained. Only a handful of them {{are known to be}} circularly polarized and converting polarized fractions into magnetic field strengths is problematic, so it is still unclear whether they are of comparable magnetic field strength to <b>polars</b> or not. We have performed a polarimetric survey for a sample of Soft X-ray IPs. Results provide evidences that some IPs have comparable magnetic field strengths to some <b>polars</b> and can hence evolve {{from one to the other}} as their orbital period decreases and synchronism is achieved...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} confirm the {{anisotropic}} effect of resonance photons in hot accretion columns on white dwarfs in magnetic cataclysmic variables, proposed by Terada et al. (2001), systematic studies with ASCA of 7 <b>polars</b> and 12 intermediate <b>polars</b> are performed. The equivalent widths of He-like Fe Kα line of <b>polars</b> {{are found to be}} systematically modulated at their spin periods {{in such a way that}} it increases at the pole-on phase. This implies that the anisotropic mechanism is commonly operating among <b>polars.</b> On the other hand, those of intermediate <b>polars</b> are statistically consistent with being unmodulated with an upper limit of 1. 5 times modulation. This may be due to a different accretion manner like aurora curtain (Rosen et al. 1988) so that the plasma becomes optically thin along the horizontal axis also for the resonance lines, or because of larger optical depths for Compton scattering if the emission regions have the same coin-like shapes as <b>polars.</b> Key words: X-rays:general — accretion — plasmas — scattering — white dwarfs 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{received}} Type A and B funding {{under the}} NASA Astrophysics Data Program {{for the analysis}} and interpretation of hard x-ray data obtained by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and other NASA sponsored missions for Intermediate <b>Polars</b> (IPS) and <b>Polars.</b> For some targets, optical data was available. We reduced and analyzed the X-ray spectra and the X-ray and optical (obtained at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory) timing data using detailed shock models (which we constructed) to place constraints on {{the properties of the}} accreting white dwarfs, the high energy emission mechanisms of white dwarfs, and the large-scale accretion flows of <b>Polars</b> and IPS. IPS and <b>Polars</b> are white dwarf mass-transfer binaries, members of the larger class of cata,clysmic variables. They differ from the bulk of the cataclysmic variables in that they contain strongly magnetic white dwarfs; the white dwarfs in <b>Polars</b> have B, = 7 to 230 MG and those in IPS have B, less than 10 MG. The IPS and <b>Polars</b> are both examples of funneled accretion flows in strong magnetic field systems. The IPS are similar to x-ray pulsars in that accretion disks form in the systems which are disrupted by the strong stellar magnetic fields of the white dwarfs near the stellar surface from where the plasma is funneled {{to the surface of the}} white dwarf. The localized hot spots formed at the footpoints of the funnels coupled with the rotation of the white dwarf leads to coherent pulsed x-ray emission. The <b>Polars</b> offer an example of a different accretion topology; the magnetic field of the white dwarf controls the accretion flow from near the inner Lagrangian point of the system directly to the stellar surface. Accretion disks do not form. The strong magnetic coupling generally leads to synchronous orbital/rotational motion in the <b>Polars.</b> The physical system in this sense resembles the Io/Jupiter system. In both IPS and <b>Polars,</b> pulsed emission from the infrared to x-rays is produced as the funneled flows merge onto the white dwarfs through the formation of strong radiating shock waves. A comparative study of the IPS and <b>Polars</b> can elucidate the primary effects of the magnetic fields on the dynamics and thermodynamics in accreting white dwarf systems...|$|R
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} <b>polar</b> caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These <b>polar</b> caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected <b>polar</b> regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the <b>polar</b> terrain.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (<b>polar)</b> protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only <b>polar</b> compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} <b>polar</b> solutes. It is miscible with <b>polar</b> and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the <b>polar</b> bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to <b>polar</b> bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the <b>polar</b> bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E

The results of 3 D MHD simulations have shown that the accretion rate is a non-monotonic function of Ba: with growing Ba it raises in the intermediate <b>polars</b> and decreases in the <b>polars.</b> The maximal accretion rate occurs in the systems, transiting from the stage of intermediate <b>polars</b> to polars; it’s value reaches 60 % of the initially set mass transfer rate.

5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream.

Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms.
