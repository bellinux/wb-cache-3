Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long {{do we have to}} put up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E

During the meeting with the crew's relatives, he loudly blamed the oligarchs, who owned most of the country's non-government media, for the poor state of Russia's military. Putin told the family members, [...] "There are people in television today who... over the last 10 years destroyed the very army and fleet where <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> now... They stole money, they bought the media, and they're manipulating public opinion." [...] When relatives asked why the government had waited so long before accepting foreign assistance, Putin said the media had lied. He shouted to the assembled families, [...] "They're lying. They're lying. They're lying." [...] Putin threatened to punish the media owners and counter their influence through alternative [...] "honest and objective" [...] media. He scornfully derided their ownership of property abroad. [...] "They'd better sell their villas on the Mediterranean coast of France or Spain. Then {{they might have to}} explain why all this property is registered in false names under front law-firms. Perhaps we would ask them where they got the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|The year {{spent in}} Detroit was a {{difficult}} time for Kahlo. Although she had enjoyed visiting San Francisco and New York City, she disliked aspects of American society, which she regarded as colonialist, {{as well as most}} Americans, whom she found [...] "boring". She disliked having to socialize with capitalists such as Henry and Edsel Ford, and was angered that many of the hotels in Detroit refused to accept Jewish guests. In a letter to a friend, she wrote that [...] "although I am very interested in all the industrial and mechanical development of the United States", she felt [...] "a bit of a rage against all the rich guys here, since I have seen thousands of people in the most terrible misery without anything to eat and with no place to sleep, that is what has most impressed me here, it is terrifying to see the rich having parties day and night whiles thousands and thousands of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> of hunger." [...] Kahlo's time in Detroit was also complicated by a pregnancy. Her doctor agreed to perform an abortion, but the medication used was ineffective. Kahlo was deeply ambivalent about having a child and had already undergone an abortion earlier in the marriage. Following the failed abortion, she reluctantly agreed to continue with the pregnancy, but miscarried in July, which caused a serious hemorrhage that required her being hospitalized for two weeks. Less than three months later, her mother died from complications of surgery in Mexico.|$|E

'But,' adds the brave man in his journal, 'I will never, I hope, allow that because these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>dying</b> out, it is of no use or {{a waste of time}} carrying the Gospel to them.
