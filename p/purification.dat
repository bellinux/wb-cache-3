5|$|In {{countries}} where FGM is common, the practice's many variants {{are reflected in}} dozens of terms, often alluding to <b>purification.</b> In the Bambara language, spoken mostly in Mali, it is known as bolokoli ("washing your hands") and in the Igbo language in eastern Nigeria as isa aru or iwu aru ("having your bath"). A common Arabic term for <b>purification</b> has the root t-h-r, used {{for male and female}} circumcision (tahur and tahara). It is also known in Arabic as khafḍ or khifaḍ.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} {{data sets}} of protein complex <b>purifications</b> have provided unprecedented {{insights into the}} organization of cellular protein complexes. Several computational methods {{have been developed to}} detect co-complexed proteins in these data sets. Their common aim is the identification of biologically relevant protein complexes. However, much less is known about the network of direct physical protein contacts within the detected protein complexes. Therefore, our work investigates whether direct physical contacts can be computationally derived by combining raw data of large-scale protein complex <b>purifications.</b> We assess four established scoring schemes and introduce a new scoring approach that is specifically devised to infer direct physical protein contacts from protein complex <b>purifications.</b> The physical contacts identified by the five methods are comprehensively benchmarked against different reference sets that provide evidence for true physical contacts...|$|R

5|$|The {{emergence}} of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided {{closely with the}} rise of various Hindu proselytizing movements such as Shuddhi (<b>purification)</b> and Sanghatan (consolidation) which launched massive efforts {{in the early twentieth century}} to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{applications}} of 1,2-dithiolene complexes are limited. A few dithiolene complexes have been commercialized as dyes in laser applications. Metal dithiolenes {{have been discussed}} {{in the context of}} conductivity, magnetism, and nonlinear optics. It was proposed to use metal dithiolene complexes that bind unsaturated hydrocarbons at the sulfur centers for industrial olefin (alkene) <b>purifications.</b> However, the complexities within such systems became later apparent, and it was argued that more research would be needed before using metal dithiolene complexes in alkene <b>purifications</b> may become practical.|$|R
40|$|The use of ion-pairing {{reagents}} for reversed phase peptide separations {{has been}} investigated in numerous publications. Reversed phase oligonucleotide separations typically employ TEAA as an ion-pairing reagent. However, other ion-pair reagents may provide better separation results. We investigated several different ion-pairing reagents using a ten micron, mono-sized, reversed phase polymeric resin, Amberchrom HPR 10. DMT-off <b>purifications</b> of two synthetic 12 mer DNA oligonucleotides (AAA CCT GAT GTG and GGT GGT GGT GGT) were performed, and yields and purities from the different <b>purifications</b> were compared {{in order to determine}} the most favorable ion-pairing conditions...|$|R
40|$|This work {{provides}} a parametrization {{of the set}} of <b>purifications</b> of a 2 x 2 mixed state, and joint <b>purifications</b> (if any) of a given pair of mixed 2 x 2 states. The former is parametrized by SO(3, R), while the latter is parametrized by SO(2,R), except when the 2 x 2 state is pure. Using this parametrization some quantum information measures are obtained. In the process it is shown how to solve one variation of the classical Procustes problem. The appendix {{is devoted to the}} first step in extending this work to higher dimensions...|$|R
5|$|Actual <b>purification</b> of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not {{completed}} until the 21st century, when two <b>purification</b> stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E

30|$|Method: All needed {{reagents}} and solvents {{were used}} with no further <b>purifications</b> unless it’s necessary. Peptide used was purchased from GenScript and used without further <b>purifications.</b> Reaction progress was monitored using both radio-analytical thin-layer chromatography (Radio-TLC) and high pressure liquid chromatographic (Radio-HPLC). Radio-HPLC analyses {{were carried out}} on semi-preparative Phenomenex C- 18 (250 mm x 10 mm). Radiolabeled peptide was detected with the eluting of 0.065 % TFA in water and 0.05 % TFA in MeCN at 2 ml/min applying gradient elution mode. Radiochemical yields were calculated based on the Radio-HPLC collections. Sodium Citrate Buffer (PH= 7.5) wa the Radio-TLC mobile phase.|$|R

5|$|Follow-up work in {{response}} to criticism and challenges included the <b>purification</b> and crystallization, by Moses Kunitz in 1948, of a DNA depolymerase (deoxyribonuclease I), and precise work by Rollin Hotchkiss showing that virtually all the detected nitrogen in the purified DNA came from glycine, a breakdown product of the nucleotide base adenine, and that undetected protein contamination was at most 0.02% by Hotchkiss's estimation.|$|E
5|$|Further <b>purification</b> is {{effected}} by a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, {{resulting in a}} steady turn over.|$|E

5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{used for}} {{a large number of}} {{small-scale}} applications, such as leather processing, <b>purification</b> of common salt, household cleaning, and building construction.

Oil well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, an {{experiment}} showed that when natural 209Bi is bombarded with neutrons, 210Bi is created, which then decays to 210Po via beta-minus decay.
