25|$|Twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cables</b> {{are often}} {{shielded}} {{in an attempt}} to prevent electromagnetic interference.

50|$|Twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cabling</b> {{is a form}} of wiring {{in which}} pairs of wires (the forward and return {{conductors}} of a single circuit) are twisted together for the purposes of canceling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from other wire pairs and from external sources. This type of cable is used for home and corporate Ethernet networks. Twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cabling</b> is used in short patch cables and in the longer runs in structured cabling.|$|R
