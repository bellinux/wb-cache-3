The priority placed on vaccination by national authorities has {{turned it into}} a bargaining chip, with communities and interest groups resisting vaccination, not due to direct opposition, but to leverage other concessions from governmental authorities.

500|$|From 1966 to 1967, Smile was {{repeatedly}} delayed as the Beach Boys {{were subject to}} a considerable level of media hype amid a publicity campaign that proclaimed [...] "Brian Wilson is a genius".

50|$|There is {{a strong}} {{perception}} that Adjudicators are biased in favour of claimants, especially in the States using the 'East Coast' model of Security of Payment legislation.
