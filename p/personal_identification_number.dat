5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used {{the phone number}} of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within {{a few weeks of}} this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E

5|$|Passport Acquisition: Any time a Lebanese Identity Card holder applies for a passport, their <b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (PIN) is {{captured}} on the passport and their personal information cross-checked {{with the existing}} data in the National Identification System. A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{may not be able}} to acquire a passport if they do not possess a Lebanese Identity Card. This is because only people who qualify to hold Lebanese Passports will be issued with one since the individual’s nationality can be properly checked from the National Identification System.|$|E
5|$|Any Croatian citizen aged 18 or over {{may become}} a {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local elections. In order to become an official candidate, 10,000 signatures from Croatian citizens aged 18 or over must be collected and submitted to the State Electoral Commission. This must be done within 12 days following {{the publication of the}} decision to hold elections in Narodne Novine, the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia. The endorsements are made in a list comprising name, address and <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (PIN) of each of the citizens supporting a particular candidate. Each citizen may only endorse a single candidate. The election commission verifies the endorsement lists, publishes the candidate list in all daily newspapers in Croatia (and on Croatian Radiotelevision) and delivers it to the Croatian diplomatic missions for publication.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} is elected {{on the basis}} of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of the votes, a runoff election is held in 14 days. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office and requires election dates to be determined within 30 to 60days before the expiry of the term of the incumbent president. Any citizen of Croatia of 18 or over may be a candidate in a presidential election, provided that the candidate is endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required in form of a list containing name, address, <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> and voter signature.

To unlock or lock the car, you entered a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (PIN) on a keypad in the driver's side door, similar to that of Ford's Securicode system. Once inside, to start the car, no key was needed, nor was there a key slot. In the center console, there was a keypad on which the driver again entered the PIN to start the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{credit card}} issuer issues {{a credit card}} to a {{customer}} at the time or after an account has {{been approved by the}} credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a card not present transaction (CNP).|$|E
25|$|The BlackBerry PIN (<b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number)</b> is an eight-character {{hexadecimal}} {{identification number}} {{assigned to each}} BlackBerry device. PINs cannot be changed manually on the device (though BlackBerry technicians are able to reset or update a PIN server-side), and are locked to each specific BlackBerry. BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application. BlackBerry PINs are tracked by BlackBerry Enterprise Servers and the BlackBerry Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a BlackBerry device. Emails and any other messages, such as those from the BlackBerry Push Service, are typically directed to a BlackBerry device's PIN. The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center, and sent to a carrier, which will deliver the message the last mile to the device. In September 2012 RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users' BlackBerry ID starting in 2013 with {{the launch of the}} BlackBerry 10 platform.|$|E

25|$|In April 1994, Valley View Center added a frequent-shopper rewards {{program called}} the Smart Shoppers Club. Mall {{management}} said {{they planned to}} spend roughly $500,000 over {{the first two years}} of the program in a bid to increase mall traffic while collecting invaluable demographic data about mall shoppers. Within five months, 9,000 shoppers had joined the club and the mall announced a goal of 20,000 members by the end of 1994. Shoppers logged their visits by swiping their membership card and entering a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> at one of the mall's three touch-screen kiosks. Member benefits included special discount coupons, free gifts, and the chance to win prizes. Club members also received a periodic Shopping Smart newsletter, a Valley View Center shopping bag, plus a birthday card and gift. The Smart Shoppers Club was terminated in late 2000 when it was replaced by a cardless web-based system called Centerlinq. Customers were then able to redeem their old Smart Shoppers Club cards at the mall's customer service desk for a Valley View Center T-shirt.|$|E

A runoff election is held if no candidate secures {{a majority in the}} first round. The presidential elections are regulated by the constitution and dedicated legislation; however, the latter only defines technical details, appeals and similar issues. Any citizen of Croatia, 18 or older, may be a candidate in a presidential election if the candidate is endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required {{in the form of a}} list containing name, address, <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> and voter signature.

50|$|Since hand {{geometry}} is not {{thought to be}} as unique as fingerprints, palm veins or irises, fingerprinting, palm veins and iris recognition remain the preferred technology for high-security applications. Hand geometry is very reliable when combined with other forms of identification, such as <b>identification</b> cards or <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>numbers.</b> In large populations, {{hand geometry}} is not suitable for so-called one-to-many applications, in which a user is identified from his biometric without any other identification.|$|R
2500|$|Since 2006, RFID tags {{included}} in new United States passports will store {{the same information}} that is printed within the passport, and include a digital picture of the owner.

The department will also implement Basic Access Control (BAC), which functions as a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (PIN) in the form of characters printed on the passport data page. Before a passport's tag can be read, this PIN must be entered into an RFID reader. The BAC also enables the encryption of any communication between the chip and interrogator. As noted in the section below on security, there are many situations in which these protections have been shown to be insufficient, and passports have been cloned based on scans of them while they were being delivered in the mail.|$|E
