60|$|The International Working Men's Association {{had been}} founded in London in 1864, and its {{statutes}} and program were {{drawn up by}} Marx. Bakunin at first did not expect it to prove a success and refused to join it. But it spread with remarkable rapidity in many countries and soon became a great power for the propagation of Socialist ideas. Originally it {{was by no means}} wholly Socialist, but in successive Congresses Marx won it over more and more to his views. At its third Congress, in Brussels in September, 1868, it became definitely Socialist. Meanwhile Bakunin, regretting his earlier abstention, had decided to join it, and he brought with him a considerable following in French-Switzerland, France, Spain and Italy. At the fourth Congress, held at Basle in September, 1869, two currents were strongly marked. The Germans and English followed Marx in his belief in the State as it was to become after the abolition of private property; they followed him also in his desire to found Labor Parties in the various countries, and to utilize the machinery of democracy for the election of representatives of Labor to Parliaments. On the other hand, the Latin nations in the main followed Bakunin in opposing the State and disbelieving in the machinery of representative government. The conflict between these two groups grew more and more bitter, and each accused the other of various offenses. The statement that Bakunin was a spy was repeated, but was withdrawn after investigation. Marx wrote in a confidential communication to his German friends that Bakunin was an agent of the Pan-Slavist party and received from them 25,000 francs a year. Meanwhile, Bakunin became for a time interested in the attempt to stir up an agrarian revolt in Russia, and this led him to neglect the contest in the International at a crucial moment. During the Franco-Prussian war Bakunin passionately took the side of France, especially after the fall of Napoleon III. He endeavored to rouse the people to revolutionary resistance like that of 1793, and became involved in an abortive attempt at revolt in Lyons. The French Government accused him of being a <b>paid</b> <b>agent</b> of Prussia, and it was with difficulty that he escaped to Switzerland. The dispute with Marx and his followers had become exacerbated by the national dispute. Bakunin, like Kropotkin after him, regarded the new power of Germany as the greatest menace to liberty in the world. He hated the Germans with a bitter hatred, partly, no doubt, on account of Bismarck, but probably still more on account of Marx. To this day, Anarchism has remained confined almost exclusively to the Latin countries, and has been associated with, a hatred of Germany, growing out of the contests between Marx and Bakunin in the International.|$|E

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{test whether}} intentional and observable discriminatory pay of symmetric {{agents in the}} Winter (2004) game causes low <b>paid</b> <b>agents</b> to reduce effiort. We control for intentionality of wages by either allowing a principal to determine wages or by implementing a random process. Our main observations are that discrimination has no negative effiect on effiorts and principals do not shy away from using discriminatory pay if it is observable. Rather, with experience discrimination enhances efficiency as it facilitates coordination among agents. The only evidence for reciprocity is that subjects receiving a low payment from a principal (discriminatory or not) exert significantly less effort...|$|R
50|$|The Victorian {{government}} {{established the}} children's court in 1906 {{shortly after the}} creation of a similar court in New South Wales (see, the Children's Court of New South Wales). The Children’s Court Act 1906 provided that children's matters were to be dealt with separately from adult matters. The new law also established “probation officers” who were to provide information to the court on a child’s habits and conduct. This now formalised the previous voluntary basis of supervisions. However, probation officers continued to be volunteers until around 1916 when <b>paid</b> <b>agents</b> were employed to visit country homes.

40|$|My thesis {{discusses}} {{the effects on}} legal streaming agents of entry of free, but illegal, substitutes, in a two–sided video streaming market. Legal streaming agents rely on support from two very different, but inevitably linked, groups: studios and consumers, while their free counterparts rely on support only from consumers. As a result, the pricing decisions for legal streaming agents are far more complex than those of firms operating in regular single–sided markets and of firms operating in other two–sided markets. I have used one model, with two setups, {{in order to examine}} how the payment–scheme between a <b>paid</b> streaming <b>agent</b> and the Studios affect key metrics as user distribution and platform utility. In the first setup, with a lump–sum transfer, I find that the effectiveness of anti–piracy investments increase utility for both the paid and the free platforms, and shift consumers towards the legal alternative. In the second setup, with a per–user transfer, I find that the free agent will capture the whole market, and no efforts taken by either the Studios or the <b>paid</b> streaming <b>agent</b> will change the user distribution. From this, I find that studios and <b>paid</b> streaming <b>agents</b> are much better off with lump–sum transfer...|$|R
