40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the evaluation method of berth capacity for <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> in port. Specially, this study discussed the evaluation formula for <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> berth capacity. It described the traditional evaluation method and new evaluation method with a sample case using real data of the <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> berth. The results of the study revealed some problems for traditional evaluation method of <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> handling capacity. Traditional calculation method does not reflect real situation for the <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> berth capacity. Also, it does not reflect individual circumstances in terms of input parameter like berth occupancy rate, an annual working day and daily working hour. Finally, this study recommended the applicable and effective formula to reflect real situation on ports which can give direction for developing evaluation of formula for <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> port capacity...|$|R
30|$|The {{condition}} T_ 1 < l_min /v_ 1 signals self-impediment (see Fig.  2 b) {{that occurs}} if a self-loaded <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> unit still blocks the input {{area at the}} end of handling the following <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> unit. If the speed of conveyer 1 is too low or, put in another way, the operator at station 1 acts to fast, the preceding <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> unit has not had enough time to leave the input area. Assuming that the current <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> unit then will be placed immediately after the preceding one, there will be effectively no vacant space left between the two units.|$|R

30|$|On the one hand, {{impediment}} can {{be caused}} by the presence of a self-loaded <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> unit that has not yet left the input area in the moment when the next <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> unit is ready to be placed on the conveyer belt. This phenomenon is called self-impediment. On the other hand, at subsequent input stations of a multistage feeder system, impediment may and usually will be caused by traversing <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> from previous input stations. This article is largely focused on the latter type of impediment, mutual impediment (see Sect.  2).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology developed {{to evaluate the}} modal split of land transport of <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> in Brazil and possible reasons for the prevalence of road transport over rail, using a market share model. No studies were found using the market share model for planning cargo transport, {{in spite of its}} generic nature which makes it readily applicable to any market, service, utility or commodity. The methodology was applied in three transport corridors, two groups of <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> and enabled us to establish that Brazilian rail operations are still uncompetitive in terms of logistics costs when transporting <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> of high aggregate value. Moreover, transport supply is a determinant factor for the greater use of road transport in Brazil’s <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> transport matrix, and the demand for <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> transport in Brazil is elastic in relation to this factor. For low aggregate value <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> (AV 1), a 1 % reduction in the gap between road and railway supply leads to an increase in the railway market share of 4. 5 % through TC 1 (São Paulo - Porto Alegre - São Paulo), 4. 9 % through TC 2 (Santos - Brasilia - Santos), and 3. 3 % through TC 3 (São Paulo - Rio de Janeiro - São Paulo). For high aggregate value <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> (AV 2), this elasticity was more pronounced. A 1 % reduction in the gap between road and railway transport supply leads to an increase in the railway market share of 4. 2 % through TC 1, 11. 9 % through TC 2, and 9. 6 % through TC 3...|$|R
