The commonest reactions were seen to perfume mix 4 (21. 0 &#x 0025;), PABA 3 (15. 78 &#x 0025;), promethazine hydrochloride 3 (15. 78 &#x 0025;), chlorpromazine hydrochloride 3 (15. 78 &#x 0025;), balsam of peru 2 (10. 52 &#x 0025;), usnic acid, hexachlorophane, musk ambrette and 6 methyl coumarin showed 1 positive reaction each (5. 26 &#x 0025;) suggesting either phototoxicity or photo sensitization. Patch and <b>photo</b> <b>patch</b> test positive reaction suggesting allergic sensitisation was seen to balsam of peru 3 (23. 0 &#x 0025;) perfume mix 3 (23. 0 &#x 0025;) promethazine hydrochloride 2 (15. 3 &#x 0025;) and PABA, 6 methyl coumarin, tribromosalicylanilide, atranorin and wood mix showed positive reaction in one case each (7. 69 &#x 0025;).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multivariate output regression based method to synthesize face sketches from photos. The training photos and sketches {{are divided into}} small image patches. For each pairs of <b>photo</b> <b>patch</b> and its corresponding sketch patch in training data, a local regression model is built by multivariate output regression methods such as kernel ridge regression and relevance vector machine (RVM). Compared with commonly used single-output regression, multivariate output regression can enforce the synthesized sketch patches with structure constraints.

40|$|Facial sketch {{synthesis}} (FSS) {{is crucial}} in sketch-based face recognition. This paper proposes an automatic FSS algorithm with local strategy based on embedded hidden Markov model (E-HMM) and selective ensemble (SE). By using E-HMM to model the nonlinear relationship between a photo-sketch patch pair, a series of pseudo-sketch patches, generated based on several learned models for a given <b>photo</b> <b>patch,</b> are integrated with SE strategy to synthesize a finer face pseudo-sketch patch. Finally, the intact pseudo-sketch can be generated by combining all synthesized patches. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed FSS algorithm works well. Department of Computin...|$|E

40|$|Sketch-photo {{synthesis}} {{plays an}} important role in sketch-based face photo retrieval and photo-based face sketch retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose an automatic sketch-photo synthesis and retrieval algorithm based on sparse representation. The proposed sketch-photo synthesis method works at patch level and is composed of two steps: sparse neighbor selection (SNS) for an initial estimate of the pseudoimage (pseudosketch or pseudophoto) and sparse-representation-based enhancement (SRE) for further improving the quality of the synthesized image. SNS can find closely related neighbors adaptively and then generate an initial estimate for the pseudoimage. In SRE, a coupled sparse representation model is first constructed to learn the mapping between sketch <b>patches</b> and <b>photo</b> <b>patches,</b> and a patch-derivative-based sparse representation method is subsequently applied to enhance the quality of the synthesized photos and sketches. Finally, four retrieval modes, namely, sketch-based, photo-based, pseudosketch-based, and pseudophoto-based retrieval are proposed, and a retrieval algorithm is developed by using sparse representation. Extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed face sketch-photo synthesis and retrieval algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Exemplar-based face sketch {{synthesis}} methods usually {{meet the}} challenging problem that input photos are captured in different lighting conditions from training photos. The critical step causing the failure is {{the search of}} similar patch candidates for an input <b>photo</b> <b>patch.</b> Conventional illumination invariant patch distances are adopted rather than directly relying on pixel intensity difference, but they will fail when local contrast within a patch changes. In this paper, we propose a fast preprocessing method named Bidirectional Luminance Remapping (BLR), which interactively adjust the lighting of training and input photos. Our method can be directly integrated into state-of-the-art exemplar-based methods to improve their robustness with ignorable computational cost. Comment: IJCAI 2017. Project page: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} simple yet {{effective}} face sketch synthesis method. Similar to existing exemplar-based methods, a training dataset containing photo-sketch pairs is required, and a K-NN <b>photo</b> <b>patch</b> search is performed between a test photo and every training exemplar for sketch patch selection. Instead {{of using the}} Markov Random Field to optimize global sketch patch selection, this paper formulates face sketch synthesis as an image denoising problem which can be solved efficiently using the proposed method. Real-time performance can be obtained on a state-of-the-art GPU. Meanwhile quantitative evaluations on face sketch recognition and user study demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method. In addition, the proposed method can be directly extended to the tempo-ral domain for consistent video sketch synthesis, which is of great importance in digital entertainment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a statistical inference approach, Bayesian Tensor Inference, for style transformation between photo images and sketch images of human faces. Motivated by the rationale that image appearance {{is determined by}} two cooperative factors: image content and image style, we first model the interaction between these factors through learning a patch-based tensor model. Second, by introducing a common variation space, we capture the inherent connection between <b>photo</b> <b>patch</b> space and sketch patch space, thus building bidirectional mapping/inferring between the two spaces. Subsequently, we formulate a Bayesian approach accounting for the statistical inference from sketches to their corresponding photos {{in terms of the}} learned tensor model. Comparative experiments are conducted to contrast the proposed method with state-of-the-art algorithms for facial sketch synthesis in a novel face hallucination scenario: sketch-based facial photo hallucination. The encouraging results obtained convincingly validate the effectiveness of our method. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} an attempt to evaluate autocorrelation as an indicator of texture using five small patches representing varying distances on each of four lunar <b>photos.</b> Each <b>patch</b> was scanned at 50 micron increments on a 64 -level gray scale. Several problems were involved in using the ordinary autocorrelation value but a rougher autocorrelation measure, the percentage of neighboring pairs (at a given lag distance) which fell within one graylevel of one another, yielded very encouraging results. As the distance to the feature decreased, initial slope of the graph of percentage against lag increased, and the general level of the graph decreased. When a crestline was present, the graph tended to continue to decrease at higher lags as well, rather than leveling off after the initial steep slope...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present, how {{we use a}} quadrocopter {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle with a camera attached to it, to do low altitude photogrammetric land survey. We use the quadrocopter to take highly overlapping photos of the area of interest. A “structure from motion” algorithm is implemented to get parameters of camera orientations and to generate a sparse point cloud representation of objects in <b>photos.</b> Than a <b>patch</b> based multi view stereo algorithm is applied to generate a dense point cloud. Ground control points are used to georeference the data. Further processing is applied to generate digital orthophoto maps, digital surface models, digital terrain models and assess volumes of various types of material. Practical examples of land survey from a UAV are presented in the paper. We explain how we used our system to monitor the reconstruction of commercial building, then how our UAV {{was used to assess}} the volume of coal supply for Ljubljana heating plant. Further example shows the usefulness of low altitude photogrammetry for documentation of archaeological excavations. In the final example we present how we used our UAV to prepare an underlay map for natural gas pipeline’s route planning. In the final analysis we conclude that low altitude photogrammetry can help bridge the gap between laser scanning and classic tachymetric survey, since it offers advantages of both techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—As {{one of the}} {{important}} artistic styles of portrait, sketch portrait has wide applications for both digital entertainment and law enforcement. In this paper, an automatic face sketch generation approach is presented by learning from photo-sketch pair examples. Specifically, the relationship between a face photo and its corresponding face sketch is learned on image patch level. By applying this relationship to the input face <b>photo</b> <b>patch,</b> we can infer the output face sketch patch by exploiting some regression techniques such as kNN, the Lasso and so on. Via our local regression model, we can synthesize an appealing sketch portrait from a given face photo in a few minutes. Experiments conducted on CUHK database have shown that our results are more compelling than previous methods especially in two respects: (1) our synthesized sketches preserve more identity information of the original face photo; (2) our synthesized sketches presents more pencil sketch texture.

40|$|Face sketch {{synthesis}} with a {{photo is}} challenging due to that the psychological mechanism of sketch generation is difficult to be expressed precisely by rules. Current learning-based sketch synthesis methods concentrate on learning the rules by optimizing cost functions with low-level image features. In this paper, a new face sketch synthesis method is presented, which is inspired by recent advances in sparse signal representation and neuroscience that human brain probably perceives images using high-level features which are sparse. Sparse representations are desired in sketch synthesis due to that sparseness can adaptively selects the most relevant samples which give best representations of the input photo. We assume that the face <b>photo</b> <b>patch</b> and its corresponding sketch patch follow the same sparse representation. In the feature extraction, we select succinct high-level features by using the sparse coding technique, and in the sketch synthesis process each sketch patch is synthesized with respect to high-level features by solving an l 1 -norm optimization. Experiments have been given on CUHK database to show that our method can resemble the true sketch fairly well. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Automatic face sketch {{synthesis}} {{has important}} applications {{in law enforcement}} and digital entertainment. Although great {{progress has been made}} in recent years, previous methods only work under well controlled conditions and often fail when there are variations of lighting and pose. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm for synthesizing a face sketch from a face photo taken under a different lighting condition and in a different pose than the training set. It synthesizes local sketch patches using a multiscale Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The robustness to lighting and pose variations is achieved in three steps. Firstly, shape priors specific to facial components are introduced to reduce artifacts and distortions caused by variations of lighting and pose. Secondly, new patch descriptors and metrics which are more robust to lighting variations are used to find candidates of sketch patches given a <b>photo</b> <b>patch.</b> Lastly, a smoothing term measuring both intensity compatibility and gradient compatibility is used to match neighboring sketch patches on the MRF network more effectively. The proposed approach significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art method. Its effectiveness is shown through experiments on the CUHK face sketch database and celebrity photos collected from the web. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{a strong}} {{need to develop a}} photopatch test tray {{suitable}} for Indian patients of photodermatitis as European/Scandinavian photopatch test trays may not be wholly relevant for them. Aim: We carried out this study using photoallergens relevant in the Indian context to determine their relevance in patients of photodermatitis. Methods: Thirty patients (M:F, 23 : 7) between 19 and 76 years of age of photodermatitis and 10 controls were patch- and photopatch tested with 20 common photoallergens. In addition, the patients were also (<b>photo)</b> <b>patch</b> tested with articles of daily use as and when these were suspected to be the cause. Results: Forty-three positive reactions to one or more antigens were seen in 22 (74 %) patients. Fourteen positive photopatch tests to seven allergens were observed in 10 (33 %) patients, and nine (30 %) of them had a definite relevance. The most common contact allergen was fragrance mix (FM) (30 %), followed by p-phenylenediamine (20 %) and Parthenium hysterophorous (17 %). The definite relevance of the patch- and photopatch tests could be correlated in 47 % of these patients. Conclusions: FM is the most common contact and photocontact allergen among the various photopatch test antigens. Although differences in technique and evaluation make direct comparison between different centers difficult, still photopatch testing remains an integral part and gold standard for the work-up of the photosensitive patients...|$|E
