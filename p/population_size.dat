5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on <b>population</b> <b>size,</b> with {{fixation}} occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective <b>population</b> <b>size.</b> The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective <b>population</b> <b>size</b> may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|India has 641,000 {{inhabited}} {{villages and}} 72.2percent {{of the total}} population reside in these rural areas. Of them 145,000 villages have <b>population</b> <b>size</b> of 500999 persons; 130,000villages have <b>population</b> <b>size</b> of 10001999 and 128,000villages have <b>population</b> <b>size</b> of 200499. There are 3,961villages that have a population of 10,000persons or more. India's 27.8percent urban population lives in more than 5,100towns and over 380urban agglomerations. In the decade of 19912001, migration to major cities caused rapid increase in urban population. On the basis of net migrants by last residence during the past decade, Maharashtra had most immigration with 2.3million, followed by National Capital Territory of Delhi (1.7million), Gujarat (0.68million) and Haryana (0.67million). Uttar Pradesh (2.6million) and Bihar (1.7million) topped the list for interstate emigration. The five states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya pradesh account for almost half (47.90 percent) of the total Indian population.|$|E

Animals also often lose weight during winter. <b>Population</b> <b>size</b> varies dramatically from year to year in southern Texas.

5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for fixation to occur {{is proportional to}} the <b>population</b> <b>size,</b> such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective <b>population</b> <b>size,</b> which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective <b>population</b> <b>size</b> may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E

5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective <b>population</b> <b>size.</b> Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective <b>population</b> <b>size,</b> {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective <b>population</b> <b>size</b> experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective <b>population</b> <b>size.</b> This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E

40|$|Maintaining genetic {{variation}} and minimizing inbreeding are central goals of conservation genetics. It is therefore crucial {{to understand the}} important population parameters that affect inbreeding, particularly in reintroduction programs. Using data from 41 reintroduced Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex) populations we estimated inbreeding {{since the beginning of}} reintroductions using population-specific Fst, and inbreeding over the last few generations with contemporary effective <b>population</b> <b>sizes.</b> Total levels of inbreeding since reintroduction of ibex were, on average, close to that from one generation of half-sib mating. Contemporary effective <b>population</b> <b>sizes</b> did not reflect total inbreeding since reintroduction, but 16 % of variation in contemporary effective <b>population</b> <b>sizes</b> among <b>populations</b> was due to variation in current <b>population</b> <b>sizes.</b> Substantial variation in inbreeding levels among populations was explained by founder group sizes and the harmonic mean <b>population</b> <b>sizes</b> since founding.

5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising <b>population</b> <b>size</b> over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce <b>population</b> <b>size</b> by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce <b>population</b> <b>size</b> because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the WrightâFisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift ({{the variance}} effective <b>population</b> <b>size),</b> genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the <b>population</b> <b>size</b> required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current <b>population</b> <b>size.</b> This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
