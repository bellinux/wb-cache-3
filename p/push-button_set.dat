5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, small {{products}} called PLRs (programmable logic relays), {{and also by}} similar names, have become more common and accepted. These are much like PLCs, and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O (i.e. a few signals {{coming in from the}} real world and a few going out) are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Popular names include PICO Controller, NANO PLC, and other names implying very small controllers. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Size is usually about 4" [...] wide, 3" [...] high, and 3" [...] deep. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and <b>push-button</b> <b>set</b> for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two orders of magnitude less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.|$|E
5000|$|Potentiometers were {{formerly}} used {{to control}} picture brightness, contrast, and color response. A potentiometer was often used to adjust [...] "vertical hold", which affected the synchronization between the receiver's internal sweep circuit (sometimes a multivibrator) and the received picture signal, along with other things such as audio-video carrier offset, tuning frequency (for <b>push-button</b> <b>sets)</b> and so on.|$|R
50|$|The {{device was}} tested using the <b>push-button</b> {{technique}} <b>set</b> in vintage style. The first test was {{to see whether the}} triggering mechanism created the necessary neutrons which would start a fission chain-reaction in the actual device. However, when the button was pushed, most of the wires connecting the device to the oscillators were severed due to errors committed in the preparation of the cables. At first, it was thought that the device had malfunctioned but closer scrutiny of two of the oscillators confirmed that the neutrons had indeed come out and a chain-reaction had taken place.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the basic {{experimental}} results on the mechanical signal generator, which is applicable as the signal source in the <b>push-button</b> telephone <b>set</b> or the end apparatus of data transmission. 　As the signal source of the equipment shown in this paper, the tuning forks are used, and the reed vibrators can be also used. 　The largest problem in the equipment using the mechanical vibrator is {{the rise and fall}} time of signal. The equipment described here has the quick rise time by giving an initial displacement to the mechanical vibrator. 　When the signal generator is set into operation, the magnetic binding force to the vibrator disappears and then the vibrator begins to vibrate in the free damped vibration. The signal generated with the free damped vibration is picked up piezo-electrically or magnetically. 　Two kinds of the construction of the signal generator are described in this paper, one is the electromagnetic drive and piezo-electric pick up type, and the other is the electromagnetic drive and electromagnetic pich up one. 　This equipment has wide application and will be used widely...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{with which}} 123 I activity {{is measured by}} a dose calibrator depends on the composition and geometry of the source. The present study assessed the variability of current commercial dose calibrators in assaying liquid 123 I samples. Methods: A calibration procedure for 123 I measurement was performed on 177 dose calibrators (11 manufacturers) at 138 sites in North America and Europe. Using the standard 123 I <b>push-button</b> or dial <b>setting,</b> activity in a 5 -mL 123 I calibration source in a 10 -mL U. S. Pharmacopeia type 1 glass vial (actual activity previously determined using a National Institute of Standards and Technology–traceable standard metrology chamber) was measured. A portion of the source was then transferred to a plastic syringe (10 -, 5 -, and 3 -mL sizes at differ-ent sites), and the activity in the syringe was measured.
