A single in vitro assay for phototoxicity (photoirritation) is not likely to be predictive because of d ifferen t m echan ism s of phototoxicity and d iverse cellular targets for in jury. A num ber of m ethods have to be combined to pro-vide a better prediction of these phenomena. Measurem ent of m echan istically relevan t biomarkers also represents a prom ising area of in vitro testing for pho-totoxicity, and it is also brie ¯ y reviewed in this paper. Photodynam ic sensitizers, representing a large class of phototoxic agents, can now be identi ® ed by sensitive m easurem ent of photooxidative dam age to cellu lar RNA and DNA. Currently, US governm ent agencies have not identi ® ed a single in vitro assay for photo-toxicity wh ich would be acceptable for replacing an in vivo assay for regulatory purposes.

40|$|<b>Phototoxicology</b> {{deals with}} the in jurious effects of {{ultraviolet}} and visible rad ia-t ion. The principal phototoxic effect is the erythem a, edema, and pain (ª sunburnº) produced in unacclim atized sk in by exposure to solar radiation. S im ilarly, pho-tokeratitis (ª snow blindnessº) is a phototoxic phenomenon which was described as early as 410 BC by Xenophon. That it was u ltraviolet rad iation that was the proxim ate cause of these photo-toxic effects was d iscovered by Charcot (1858) in experim ents with electric arcs. Dubreuilh (1896) related outdoor solar exposure to incidence of sk in cancers; and in 1899, Raab noticed that ¯ uorescent chem icals could be activated by vis-ible light to produce k illing of m icroorgan ism s. By the m idd le of the twentieth century, phototoxic effects, prim arily on sk in, were d iscovered {{to be due to}} in trin-sic and to topically applied m aterials (e. g., porphyrins, coal tar). The phototoxic effects of m edicinal com pounds (e. g., ¯ uoroqu inolones), have recently become im-portan t. Photoactive agents and their phototoxic effects have long been used in the therapy of such skin d iseases as vitiligo and psoriasis, and m ore recently fo...|$|E
40|$|In {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT), photosensitisers accumulate somewhat preferentially in malignant tissues; photoactivation with appropriate wavelength of light release toxic molecular species {{which lead to}} tumour tissue death. In order to target ovarian cancer with increased specificity, a chlorin-based photosensitiser (chlorin e 6 monoethylendiamine monoamide) was conjugated to OC 125, a monoclonal antibody recognising an antigen expressed in 80 % of non-mucinous ovarian cancers. In previous work, this immunoconjugate (IC) was shown to be selectively phototoxic to cancer cells from ovarian cancer patients ex vivo and to localise preferentially in ovarian cancer tissue in vivo. In this study we report results from in vivo <b>phototoxicology</b> and photodynamic treatment studies using this IC in a murine model for ovarian cancer. A comparison of single vs multiple treatments was also made. For in vivo experimentation, Balb C nude mice were injected with 30 x 10 (6) NIH:OVCAR 3 cancer cells to create an ascitic tumour model. Animals were then given intraperitoneal injections of the immunoconjugate (0. 5 mg kg- 1). Twenty-four hours later the intraperitoneal surfaces were exposed to 656 nm light from an argon-ion pumped-dye laser (50 mW, 656 nm), using a cylindrical diffusing tip fibre. The overall treatment was given either once or multiply. No animals died from treatment complications. Twenty-four hours following one and three PDT treatments, the percentage of viable tumour cells in the ascites of the treated animals analysed ex vivo was 34 % and 5 % of control for one and three treatments respectively. With respect to survival, all control mice (n = 18) died between 30 and 50 days. However, for those treated three times (n = 10), 40 % were still alive after 50 days, and for those treated four times (n = 12) 58 % were alive after 50 days. Evaluation with log-rank test revealed a significant survival with intraperitoneal PDT compared with controls (P = 0. 0006). These preliminary results suggest that PDT with an OC 125 immunoconjugate may be an effective therapy {{for the management of}} advanced ovarian cancer. Clinical application of this therapy needs to be further optimised and may require multiple treatments, similar to fractionated radiation therapy and cyclic chemotherapy, in order to control malignant disease with acceptable toxicity to normal tissue...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the report}} from the “ECVAM–EFPIA {{workshop}} on 3 T 3 NRU Phototoxicity Test: Practical Experience and Implications for Phototoxicity Testing”, jointly organized by ECVAM and EFPIA and held on the 25 – 27 October 2010 in Somma Lombardo, Italy. The European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) was established in 1991 within the European Commission Joint Research, based on a Communication from the European Commission (1991). The main objective of ECVAM is to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods which are of importance to the biosciences and which reduce, refine and replace the use of laboratory animals. The European Federation of Pharmaceuticals Industries and Association (EFPIA) represent the pharmaceutical industry operating in Europe. Through its direct membership of 31 national associations and 40 leading pharmaceutical companies, EFPIA is {{the voice on the}} EU scene of 2200 companies committed to researching, developing and bringing to patients new medicines that improve health and the quality of life around the world. The workshop, co-chaired by Joachim Kreysa (ECVAM) and Phil Wilcox (GSK, EFPIA) involved thirty-five experts from academia, regulatory authorities and industry, invited to contribute with their experiences in the field of <b>phototoxicology.</b> The main objectives of the workshop were: – to present ‘in use’ experience of the pharmaceutical industry with the 3 T 3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test (3 T 3 NRU-PT), – to discuss why it differs from the results in the original validation exercise, – to discuss technical issues and consider ways to improve the usability of the 3 T 3 NRU-PT for (non-topical) pharmaceuticals, e. g., by modifying the threshold of chemical light absorption to trigger photo-toxicological testing, and by modifying technical aspects of the assay, or adjusting the criteria used to classify a positive response. During the workshop, the assay methodology was reviewed by comparing the OECD Test Guideline (TG 432) with the protocols used in testing laboratories, data from EFPIA and JPMA ‘surveys’ were presented and possible reasons for the outcomes were discussed. Experts from cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries reported on their experience with the 3 T 3 NRU-PT and evidence was presented for phototoxic clinical symptoms that could be linked to certain relevant molecules. Brainstorming sessions discussed if the 3 T 3 NRU-PT needed to be improved and whether alternatives to the 3 T 3 NRU-PT exist. Finally, the viewpoint from EU and US regulators was presented. In the final session, the conclusions of the meeting were summarized, with action points. It was concluded that the 3 T 3 NRU-PT identifies phototoxicological hazards with a 100 % sensitivity, and thus is accepted as the tier one test that correctly identifies the absence of phototoxic potential. Consequently, positive results in the 3 T 3 NRU-PT often do not translate into a clinical phototoxicity risk. Possible ways to improve the practical use of this assay include: (i) adaptation of changed UV/vis-absorption criteria as a means {{to reduce the number of}} materials tested, (ii) reduction of the highest concentration to be tested, and (iii) consideration of modifying the threshold criteria for the prediction of a positive call in the test...|$|E
