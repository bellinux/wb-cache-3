Included in the required <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{was known}} for his direct {{approach}} to game journalism and scathing criticism of the video game industry. During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile and stepped out of its sister publication's shadow, but Smith grew frustrated with the contemporary state of gaming news and what he considered manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> as news. In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co-host of the developer's podcast.|$|E
5|$|Takigawa {{was chosen}} to design the game's {{characters}} on recommendation of KID's PR staff, who got along well with Takigawa's friend and fellow character designer Chisato Naruse. In addition to designing the characters, Takigawa {{was in charge of}} creating the game's key visual, which was both used as <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> representing the game as a whole, and as reference material for in-game event graphics; Takigawa drew the game's heroines in an underwater environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} Marty McFly skateboarding {{in the film}} {{occurred}} during the infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture and numerous skateboarders, as well as companies in the industry, {{pay tribute to the}} film for its influence in this regard. Examples can be seen in <b>promotional</b> <b>material,</b> in interviews in which professional skateboarders cite the film as an initiation into the action sport, and in the public's recognition of the film's influence.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or <b>promotional</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 26 June {{the agents}} {{returned}} {{to supervise the}} destruction of the <b>promotional</b> <b>material,</b> including 251 copies of Reich's books. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a press release criticizing the book burning, although coverage of the release was poor, and Reich ended up asking them not to help because he was annoyed that they had failed to criticize {{the destruction of the}} accumulators. In England A.S. Neill and the poet Herbert Read signed a letter of protest, but it was never published. On 23 July the remaining accumulators in New York were destroyed by S. A. Collins and Sons, who had built them.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the guns}} seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol {{modified}} by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; {{because of the high}} power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> for the film.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{issues with the}} {{promotion}} of the film: <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> in the form of teaser posters created by Bob Peak, based on the Licence Revoked title and commissioned by Albert Broccoli, had been produced, but MGM decided against using them after American test screenings showed 'Licence Revoked' to be a common American phrase for the withdrawal of a driving licence. The delayed, corrected advertising by Steven Chorney, in the traditional style, limited the film's pre-release screenings. MGM also discarded a campaign created by advertising executive Don Smolen – who had worked in the publicity campaign for eight Bond films before – emphasising the rougher content of the movie.|$|E
5|$|A {{mobile app}} was {{released}} on 10 December 2013 on Google Play, and later on iOS; 1: Nenokkadine first look, posters, video promos and other <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> were released through the app. On 19 December 2013, users could download the film's soundtrack and purchase bulk pre-release tickets. Its digital-media marketing was handled by Sharath Chandra, Anurag and Rohita of First Show Digital. The digital campaign placed third at the 2014 Indian Digital Media Awards in Mumbai, surpassing that for Krrish 3. It accounted for 15 percent of total promotional activity, influencing the sale of 7,500 tickets on the film's release day. 1: Nenokkadine YouTube channel had 12 million views; on Facebook its page received 130 million views, reaching 40 million users and engaging 3.9 million people.|$|E

5|$|Although {{marketers}} typically avoid promoting adult-oriented {{films to}} reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including Coors, Amazon, and Verizon FiOS, which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through Fandango, and placed <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> in products shipped to customers; {{this was the first}} time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company. The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them to reporters to ask at the event. The National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released a series of Prometheus action figures in September 2012. A book, Prometheus: The Art of the Film, containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Many filmed scenes remain unused, {{even in the}} Extended Editions. <b>Promotional</b> <b>material</b> for The Fellowship of the Ring {{contained}} an attack by Orcs from Moria on Lothlórien after the Fellowship leaves Moria, replaced with a more suspenseful entrance for the Fellowship. Also cut were scenes from the book, including Frodo seeing more of Middle-earth at Parth Galen and an extended Council of Elrond, and new scenes with an attack upon Frodo and Sam at the river Anduin by an Uruk-hai. The major cut to The Two Towers featured Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at Lothlórien, with Arwen then leading the Elven reinforcements to Helm's Deep. This scene, and a flashback to Arwen and Aragorn's first meeting, was cut during a revision of the film's plot; the Elves' appearance was explained with a telepathic communication between Elrond and Galadriel.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at {{the opponent}} that travels in a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the opponent is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting All Stars, <b>promotional</b> <b>material</b> released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when it hits the opponent, similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E
