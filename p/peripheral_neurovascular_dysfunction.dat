40|$|Background: The {{neurovascular}} unit {{encompasses the}} functional interactions of cerebrovascular and brain parenchymal cells {{necessary for the}} metabolic homeostasis of neurons. Previous studies indicated marked but only transient (1 - 4 h) reactive oxygen species-dependent <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in newborn pigs after severe hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) stress contributing to the neuronal injury after birth asphyxia. Objectives: Our major purpose {{was to determine if}} <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> would also occur later, at 24 h after a milder H/I stress. We also tested if the putative hydroxyl radical scavenger hydrogen (H 2) exerted neurovascular protection. Methods: Anesthetized, ventilated piglets were assigned to three groups of 9 animals: time control, asphyxia/reventilation with air, and asphyxia/reventilation with air + 2. 1 % H 2 for 4 h. Asphyxia was induced by suspending ventilation for 8 min. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) of pial arterioles was determined using closed cranial window/intravital microscopy 24 h after asphyxia to the endothelium-dependent cerebrovascular stimulus hypercapnia, the neuronal function-dependent stimulus N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), norepinephrine, and sodium nitroprusside. The brains were subjected to histopathology. Results: Hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and core temperature did not differ significantly among the experimental groups. In the early reventilation period, the recovery of electroencephalographic activity was significantly better in H 2 -treated animals. Asphyxia/reventilation severely attenuated CR to hypercapnia and NMDA; however, reactivity to norepinephrine and sodium nitroprusside were unaltered. H 2 fully or partially preserved CR to hypercapnia or NMDA, respectively. Histopathology revealed modest neuroprotection afforded by H 2. Conclusions: Severe stimulus-selective delayed <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> develops and persists even after mild H/I stress. H 2 alleviates this delayed <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> that can contribute to its neuroprotective effect...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction plays a pathogenic role in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ), a peptide central to the pathogenesis of AD, has profound vascular effects mediated, for the most part, by reactive oxygen species produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase. The mechanisms linking Aβ to NADPH oxidase-dependent vascular oxidative stress have not been identified, however. We report that the scavenger receptor CD 36, a membrane glycoprotein that binds Aβ, {{is essential for the}} vascular oxidative stress and <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> induced by Aβ 1 – 40. Thus, topical application of Aβ 1 – 40 onto the somatosensory cortex attenuates the increase in cerebral blood flow elicited by neural activity or by endothelium-dependent vasodilators in WT mice but not in CD 36 -null mice (CD 360 / 0). The cerebrovascular effects of infusion of Aβ 1 – 40 into cerebral arteries are not observed in mice pretreated with CD 36 blocking antibodies or in CD 360 / 0 mice. Furthermore, CD 36 deficiency prevents the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> observed in transgenic mice overexpressing the Swedish mutation of the amyloid precursor protein Tg 2576 despite elevated levels of brain Aβ 1 – 40. CD 36 is also required for the vascular oxidative stress induced by exogenous Aβ 1 – 40 or observed in Tg 2576 mice. These observations establish CD 36 as a key link between Aβ 1 – 40 and the NADPH oxidase-dependent vascular oxidative stress underlying the <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and suggest that CD 36 is a potential therapeutical target to counteract the cerebrovascular dysfunction associated with Aβ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} the brain to locally augment glucose {{delivery}} and blood flow during neuronal activation, termed neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling, respectively, is compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since perfusion deficits may hasten clinical deterioration and have been correlated with negative treatment outcome, strategies to improve the cerebral circulation should form an integral element of AD therapeutic efforts. These efforts have yielded several experimental models, some of which constitute AD models proper, others which specifically recapture the AD cerebrovascular pathology, characterized by anatomical alterations in brain vessel structure, as well as molecular changes within vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells forming the blood–brain barrier. The following paper will present the elements of AD <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and review the in vitro and in vivo model systems that have served to deepen our understanding of it.

PAD is a contraindication to the use of anti-embolism stockings (AES). Half of those patients diagnosed with PAD report no symptoms, potentially underestimating its prevalence. Implementation of guidelines for thromboprophylaxis, including the safe prescribing of AES, is therefore imperative.

Neuro-vascular decline was sufficient to cause vascular leakage and correlated strongly with an increase in neuroinflammation including up-regulation of complement component C 1 QA in microglia/monocytes. Importantly, long-term aerobic exercise from midlife to old age pre-vented this age-related neurovascular decline, reduced C 1 QA+microglia/monocytes, and increased synaptic plasticity and overall behavioral capabilities of aged mice. Concomitant with age-related neurovascular decline and complement activation, astrocytic Apoe dramat-ically decreased in aged mice, a decrease that was prevented by exercise.

The headache was more severe (P< 0. 0002) and more strictly unilateral (P< 0. 0004) in patients who reported UAs than in those without.

40|$|Perinatal {{asphyxia}} can elicit mortality {{or severe}} disability in the survivors called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term infants. HIE yearly affects around one million babies worldwide. In {{contrast to the}} severe impact of HIE on the society and {{on the health care}} budget, the first effective neuroprotective therapy, mild whole-body hypothermia, has only recently been introduced into broader clinical practice. The resuscitation efforts in asphyxiated infants start invariably with adequate mechanical ventilation. The gas mixture used for artificial ventilation could be used to deliver possibly neuroprotective gases to reduce CNS damage, and to perhaps augment the efficacy of hypothermia. For instance, molecular hydrogen could be an ideal therapeutic agent, as it has recently been shown to exert selective antioxidant properties against hydroxyl and peroxynitrite radicals. There are several animal models to study HIE pathology. In our Szeged laboratory, a widely-used gyrencephalic large animal model of HIE, the newborn piglet has been utilized. Dysfunction of the so-called neurovascular unit – that is responsible for meeting the metabolic demands of neurons – may {{play an important role in}} the pathomechanism of HIE. Therefore, to assess the putative neuroprotective effects of molecular hydrogen, beside neuropathology we also determined CR to stimuli indicating neurovascular unit integrity both in the acute (1 - 4 h, n= 31) and the subacute (24 h, n= 27) phase of survival after asphyxia. We would like to highlight the novel observation from our results that after an initial recovery at the end of the acute period, a second delayed <b>neurovascular</b> unit <b>dysfunction</b> develops in the subacute phase. The molecular hydrogen gas per se did not affect CR or cortical perfusion, but preserved neurovascular unit function and diminished neuronal damage in the CNS after asphyxia. Our results are in accordance with the antioxidant mechanism of molecular hydrogen actions, since <b>neurovascular</b> unit <b>dysfunction</b> has been previously shown to be triggered by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species during reoxygenation. Our data suggest that molecular hydrogen administered in the early reoxygenation can alleviate not only the acute but also the delayed phase of <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> demanding further preclinical research. The importance of further research on molecular hydrogen is also substantiated by its other appealing features concerning its medical use: it is inexpensive, simple to produce and to administer, and has ideal pharmacokinetics. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> is an {{important}} component of Alzheimer's disease, leading to reduced clearance across the blood-brain barrier and accumulation of neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the brain. It has been shown that the ABC transport protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB 1) is involved in the export of Aβ from the brain into the blood. To determine whether Aβ influences the expression of key Aβ transporters, we studied the effects of 1 -day subcutaneous Aβ 1 - 40 and Aβ 1 - 42 administration via Alzet mini-osmotic pumps on P-gp, BCRP, LRP 1, and RAGE expression in the brain of 90 -day-old male FVB mice.

The expression of the four proteins was unchanged in mice treated with Aβ 1 - 40 or reverse-sequence peptides. These findings indicate that, in addition to the age-related decrease of P-gp expression, Aβ 1 - 42 itself downregulates the expression of P-gp and other Aβ-transporters, which could exacerbate the intracerebral accumulation of Aβ and thereby accelerate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and cerebral β-amyloid angiopathy...|$|R

CBF is regulated by neurovascular coupling (NVC), and disruption of NVC contributes to brain plasticity and repair problems. However, it is unknown how NVC is affected hyperacutely during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. We have developed a remote middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in the rat, which enables multi-modal assessment of NVC immediately prior to, during and immediately following reperfusion. Male Wistar rats were subjected to remote MCAO, where a long filament was advanced intraluminally through a guide cannula in the common carotid artery. Transcallosal stimulation evoked increases in blood flow, tissue oxygenation and neuronal activity, which were diminished by MCAO and partially restored during reperfusion.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> during BBB breakdown remain elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as key regulators of pathogenic responses, although their role in central nervous system (CNS) microvascular disorders is largely unknown. We have identified miR- 155 as a critical miRNA in neuroinflammation at the BBB. miR- 155 is expressed at the neurovascular unit of individuals with MS and of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In mice, loss of miR- 155 reduced CNS extravasation of systemic tracers, both in EAE and in an acute systemic inflammation model induced by lipopolysaccharide. In cultured human brain endothelium, miR- 155 was strongly and rapidly upregulated by inflammatory cytokines. miR- 155 up-regulation mimicked cytokine-induced alterations in junctional organization and permeability, whereas inhibition of endogenous miR- 155 partially prevented a cytokine-induced increase in permeability. Furthermore, miR- 155 modulated brain endothelial barrier function by targeting not only cell-cell complex molecules such as annexin- 2 and claudin- 1, but also focal adhesion components such as DOCK- 1 and syntenin- 1.

In mice, lack of Apoe leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, whereas APOE 4 increases BBB susceptibility to injury. How APOE genotype affects brain microcirculation remains elusive. Using different APOE transgenic mice, including mice with ablation and/or inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA), here we show that expression of APOE 4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not APOE 2 and APOE 3, leads to BBB breakdown by activating a proinflammatory CypA-nuclear factor-κB-matrix-metalloproteinase- 9 pathway in pericytes. This, in turn, leads to neuronal uptake of multiple blood-derived neurotoxic proteins, and microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions. We show that the vascular defects in Apoe-deficient and APOE 4 -expressing mice precede neuronal dysfunction and can initiate neurodegenerative changes. Astrocyte-secreted APOE 3, but not APOE 4, suppressed the CypA-nuclear factor-κB-matrix-metalloproteinase- 9 pathway in pericytes through a lipoprotein receptor.

Using a BBB model with human brain endothelial cells, we show PS inhibits time- and dose-dependently (half maximal effective concentration [EC 50] = 27 ± 3 nM) oxygen/glucose deprivation-induced BBB breakdown, as demonstrated by measurements of the transmonolayer electrical resistance, permeability of endothelial monolayers to dextran (40 kDa), and rearrangement of F-actin toward the cortical cytoskeletal ring.

We present a theoretical integration of human and animal data linking oxidative stress and neuroinflammation to neurovascular endotheliopathy and BBB breakdown in schizophrenia. These abnormalities {{may contribute to the}} cognitive and behavioral symptoms of schizophrenia via several mechanisms involving reduced cerebral perfusion and impaired homeostatic processes of cerebral microenvironment. Furthermore, BBB disruption can facilitate interactions between brain innate and peripheral adaptive immunity, thereby perpetuating harmful neuroimmune signals and toxic neuroinflammatory responses, which can also contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia. Taken together, these findings support the “mild encephalitis” hypothesis of schizophrenia. If neurovascular abnormalities prove to be etiologically relevant to the neurobiology of schizophrenia, then targeting these abnormalities may represent a promising therapeutic strategy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dysfunctional {{breathing}} (DB) {{may contribute}} to disproportionate dyspnea and other medically unexplained symptoms. The extent of dysfunctional breathing is often evaluated using the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ) or {{by the presence of}} abnormal breathing patterns. The NQ was originally devised to evaluate one form of dysfunctional breathing - hyperventilation syndrome. However, the symptoms identified by the NQ are not primarily due to hypocapnia and may be due to other causes including breathing pattern dysfunction. Objectives: The relationships between breathing pattern abnormalities and the various categories of NQ symptoms including respiratory or dyspnea symptoms have not been investigated. This study investigates these relationships. Method: 62 patients with medically unexplained complaints, that seemed to be associated with tension and breathing dysfunction, were referred, or self-referred, for breathing and relaxation therapy. Dysfunctional breathing symptoms and breathing patterns were assessed {{at the beginning and end}} of treatments using the NQ for assessment of DB symptoms, and the Manual Assessment of Respiratory Motion (MARM) to quantify the extent of thoracic dominant breathing. Subscales for the NQ were created in 4 categories, tension, central <b>neurovascular,</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>neurovascular</b> and dyspnea. Relationships between the NQ (sum scores and subscales) and the MARM were explored. Results: Mean NQ scores were elevated and mean MARM values for thoracic breathing were also elevated. There was a small correlation pre-treatment between MARM and NQ (r= 0. 26, p< 0. 05), but classification of subjects as normal/abnormal on both measurements agreed in 74...|$|R
40|$|<b>Neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{arising from}} endothelial cell damage {{is an early}} {{pathogenic}} event {{that contributes to the}} neurodegenerative process occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction are not fully elucidated, this study was aimed to explore the hypothesis that brain endothelial cell death is induced upon the sustained activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide, which deposits in the cerebral vessels in many AD patients and transgenic mice. Incubation of rat brain endothelial cells (RBE 4 cell line) with Aβ 1 – 40 increased the levels of several markers of ER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), in a time-dependent manner, and affected the Ca 2 + homeostasis due to the release of Ca 2 + from this intracellular store. Finally, Aβ 1 – 40 was shown to activate both mitochondria-dependent and -independent apoptotic cell death pathways. Enhanced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of the downstream caspase- 9 were observed in cells treated with Aβ 1 – 40 concomitantly with caspase- 12 activation. Furthermore, Aβ 1 – 40 activated the apoptosis effectors' caspase- 3 and promoted the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus demonstrating the involvement of caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms during Aβ-induced endothelial cell death. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ER stress plays a significant role in Aβ 1 – 40 -induced apoptotic cell death in brain endothelial cells suggesting that ER stress-targeted therapeutic strategies might be useful in AD to counteract vascular defects and ultimately neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{using the}} axon reflex-dependent hyperaemia (initial peak of skin local heating response) in fingers {{of patients with}} SSc or primary RP. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were initially enrolled to compare axon reflex-dependent thermal hyperaemia between the finger and forearm cutaneous circulations. Then, 10 patients with primary RP and 16 patients with SSc participated in a similar protocol focusing on the finger circulation only. Lidocaine/prilocaine cream was applied for 1 h to produce local blockade of cutaneous sensory nerves. After lidocaine/prilocaine pre-treatment, laser Doppler probes were heated from skin temperature to 42 degrees C for 30 min, and 44 degrees C for 5 min to achieve maximal skin blood flow. Data were expressed {{as a percentage of}} maximal cutaneous vascular conductance. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, we observed a significantly higher initial peak on the finger compared with the forearm, with both responses blunted following topical anaesthesia. In primary RP patients, we observed a decreased initial peak following lidocaine/prilocaine pre-treatment in the finger circulation [96. 7 % (33. 4) vs 75. 9 % (29. 5) with anaesthesia, P = 0. 02]. In contrast, pre-treatment did not alter the initial peak in patients with SSc. A minute-by-minute analysis showed no delay of the initial peak. CONCLUSIONS: We show an abnormal digital neurovascular response to local heating in SSc. Thermal hyperaemia could be monitored as a clinical test for neurovascular function in SSc. Further studies are required to test whether the abnormal digital neurovascular response correlates to the degree of peripheral vascular involvement...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{correlate}} retinal {{function with}} vascular response to flicker light in normotensive patients with diabetes without diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS. Twenty-eight normotensive patients with diabetes (11 with type 1, 17 with type 2) without DR and 28 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects underwent color vision and contrast sensitivity testing, pattern, full-field, and multifo-cal electroretinography, {{and evaluation of}} the vascular re-sponse to flicker light with the dynamic vessel analyzer. RESULTS. In the patients with diabetes, electroretinogram (ERG) pattern responses, b-wave in the scotopic bright flash ERG, a-wave and b-wave in the photopic single-flash ERG, and oscil-latory potential responses were significantly impaired com-pared with those in control subjects. Vascular response to flicker light was also impaired in patients with diabetes com-pared with controls. In the whole population, correlations were found between flicker light-induced arterial retinal vaso-dilation and the amplitude and implicit time of the N 95 wave of pattern ERG (r 0. 27, P 0. 047 and r 0. 35, P 0. 008, respectively), the b-wave implicit time of rod ERG (r 0. 36; P 0. 01) and the oscillatory potentials (r 0. 4; P 0. 003), suggesting that impairment of the vascular response to flicker light may reflect inner retinal neural impairment. How-ever, no correlation between these factors was found when only patients with diabetes were considered. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with diabetes, neural and <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> both precede the onset of clinically detectable DR. To which extent these abnormalities are {{related to each other}} remains to be determined. (ClinicalTrials. gov number...|$|R
40|$|Aging-related ED is {{predominantly}} attributed to <b>neurovascular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> mediated by NO suppression and increased oxidative stress in penis. The alterations of protein arginine methyltransferases 1 (PRMT 1) /dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) /asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) /NO synthase (NOS) pathway regulate NO {{production in the}} vascular endothelium. Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) {{is one of the}} most abundant and antioxidative ingredients isolated from green tea. In the present study, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed into four groups: one young rat group and three aged rat groups treated with daily gavage feedings of EGCG at doses of 0, 10 mg kg− 1 and 100 mg kg− 1 for 12 weeks, respectively. Erectile function was assessed by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerves with intracavernous pressure (ICP) measurement. After euthanasia, penile tissue was investigated using Western blot and ELISA to assess the PRMT 1 /DDAH/ADMA/NOS metabolism pathway. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected by colorimetry. We also evaluated smooth muscle contents. The ratio of maximal ICP and mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP) was markedly higher in EGCG-treated aged rats than in untreated aged rats. We found that DDAH 1 and DDAH 2 were expressed in cavernosal tissue, and they were downregulated in corpora of aged rats. The administration of EGCG upregulated the expression and activity of DDAH. In contrast, EGCG treatment downregulated the expression of PRMT 1 and ADMA content. Moreover, EGCG-treated rats showed an improvement in smooth muscle expression, the ratio of smooth muscle cell/collagen fibril, SOD activity, and MDA levels when compared with untreated aged rats...|$|R
