5|$|A {{study from}} June 15, 1945, by the Joint War Plans Committee, who {{provided}} <b>planning</b> <b>information</b> to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Olympic {{would result in}} between 130,000 and 220,000 U.S. casualties, of which U.S. dead {{would be in the}} range from 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army George Marshall, and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{of a computer}} vision system is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, <b>planning,</b> <b>information</b> databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make the B-2 more {{effective}} than previous bombers, many advanced and modern avionics systems were integrated into its design; these have been modified and improved following a switch to conventional warfare missions. One system is the low probability of intercept AN/APQ-181 multi-mode radar, a fully digital navigation system that is integrated with terrain-following radar and Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance, NAS-26 astro-inertial navigation system (first such system tested on the Northrop SM-62 Snark cruise missile) and a Defensive Management System (DMS) to inform the flight crew of possible threats. The onboard DMS is capable of automatically assessing the detection capabilities of identified threats and indicated targets. The DMS will be upgraded by 2021 to detect radar emissions from air defenses to allow changes to the auto-router's mission <b>planning</b> <b>information</b> while in-flight so it can receive new data quickly to plan a route that minimizes exposure to dangers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ We {{examine the}} impact of price, service quality and {{information}} search on people’s propensity to switch health insurers in the competitive Dutch health insurance market. Using panel data from annual household surveys and data on health insurers’ premiums and quality ratings over the period 2006 – 2012, we estimate a random effects logit model of people’s switching decisions. We find that switching propensities depend on health plan price and quality, and on people’s age, health, education and having supplementary or group insurance. Young people (18 – 35 years) are more sensitive to price, whereas older people are more sensitive to quality. Searching for health <b>plan</b> <b>information</b> has a much stronger impact on peoples’ sensitivity to price than to service quality. In addition, searching for health <b>plan</b> <b>information</b> has a stronger impact on the switching propensity of higher than lower educated people, suggesting that higher educated people make better use of available health <b>plan</b> <b>information.</b> Finally, having supplementary insurance significantly reduces older people’s switching propensity...|$|R
2500|$|After another {{significant}} censorship battle, and a vigorous publicity campaign by Universal, on May 13, 1917, Universal released The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, [...] "one {{of the most}} forceful films ever made in support of legalizing birth control", a follow-up to the previous year's top money-maker for Universal, Where Are My Children? Directed by Weber and Smalley based on their original script, it starred Smalley and Weber, in her last screen appearance, as a doctor's wife arrested and imprisoned for illegally disseminating family <b>planning</b> <b>information.</b> Influenced by the recent trial and imprisonment of pioneer birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, the film drew explicitly on her headline-generating activism.|$|E
2500|$|A {{quarter of}} a million {{casualties}} is roughly the level the Joint War Plans Committee estimated, in its paper (JWPC 369/1) prepared for Truman's 18 June meeting. A review of documents from the Truman Library shows Truman's initial draft response to the query describes Marshall only as saying [...] "one {{quarter of a}} million would be the minimum". The [...] "as much as a million" [...] phrase was added to the final draft by Truman's staff, so as not to appear to contradict an earlier statement given in a published article by Stimson (former Secretary of War). In a study done by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April 1945, the figures of 7.45 casualties per 1,000 man-days and 1.78 fatalities per 1,000 man-days were developed. This implied the two planned campaigns to conquer Japan would cost 1.6 million U.S. casualties, including 380,000 dead. [...] JWPC 369/1 (prepared June 15, 1945)), which provided <b>planning</b> <b>information</b> to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated an invasion of Japan would result in 40,000 U.S. dead and 150,000 wounded. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses resulting from a very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. Generals George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.|$|E

An online survey focused on their associations with the term ecogenomics, their <b>planned</b> <b>information</b> seeking behaviors if they were to acquire information about the new technology, and their first affective responses toward ecogenomics after having read some introductory information about it. Adolescents were found to associate ecogenomics most frequently with economy.

After having read the introductory information about ecogenomics most adolescents reported positive affective responses toward the new technology. © SAGE Publications...|$|R
