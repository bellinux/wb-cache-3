The work contains a theoretical and practical summarization of legal steps according the current legislation and a proposal of changes in the form of amendment of the public tendering act. Since dealing with this issue for many years, it was my attempt to incorporate my own practical experience and knowledge into the proposal of these changes. The thesis is divided into three thematic parts. In the first part there is an introduction of a summary of basic rules and procedures in public tendering since 1990 till present, i. e. the act no. 137 / 2006, on public tendering. The second part focuses on a practical example of the <b>public</b> <b>tendering</b> <b>procedure.</b> The third part contains the proposal of changes in rules and procedures leading to the promotion of equal treatment, transparency and non-discrimination in public tendering, as well as of their practical application...|$|E
40|$|Within the Italian legal framework, {{the award}} of social {{services}} is subject to very specific requirements due, in part, to the characteristics {{of social services}} themselves, and also to national and regional legislation which, by allowing derogations from the <b>public</b> <b>tendering</b> <b>procedure,</b> places non-profit entities at an advantage compared to other economic operators. ECJ case law has had a significant influence on the award procedure as, {{until a couple of}} years ago, it held that competition rules were not subject to derogations where legislation permits the direct award to third sector entities, according to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity. This approach by EU judges has recently changed as regards the relationship between the market and the system for the protection of social rights, based on increased cooperation between public entities and the so-called “private social services”. Moreover, for the first time, EU legislation took particular account of public contracts and concessions in the social services sector. Furthermore on the 6 th of June, the Parliament has approved the Third Sector Reform act. The act provides a delegation to the Government for a comprehensive revision of all laws regarding the non –profits sector. The present article attempts to outline the new relationship which is being forged between competition, social services and the third sector by reviewing public procurement legislation and the relevant case law and by comparing previous provisions with those of Directive 2014 / 24 /UE and its implementing Decree no 50 of 18 April 2016, considering furthermore the provisions of the specific delegation power to the Government for adopting the Third Sector Code...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the European Union (EU) has had a strong impact on the way public organisations {{introduce}} market philosophies in their policies. The EU directives on procurement, the battles against cartels, the globalisation and harmonisation of markets, all lead to extra attention to the procurement practice of public agencies. This paper focuses on the procurement practice {{of one of these}} public organisations, the municipalities in the Netherlands. Statistical data suggest that Dutch municipalities prefer limited <b>tendering</b> <b>procedures,</b> and seem to avoid <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper reports on research into the reasons for such preference. Analysis of municipalities' procurement and tendering practice uncovered an intricate mechanism for maintaining project control. Municipalities implicitly use the prospect of future assignments to restrain contractors' misbehaviours. By doing so municipalities reduce uncertainties and risks. Contractors' demeanour becomes more flexible, cooperative and quality orientated because of this mechanism. Through the use of this mechanism the municipality-contractor relationship has developed to a kind of co-makership relation. This phenomenon is categorically overlooked in the standard market paradigms. Bending the procurement and tendering practice towards more <b>public</b> <b>tendering</b> is expected to make project control more troublesome...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{improved}} insights into the contracting process for construction projects that the military contract out to civil contractors in the specific setting of civil–military interaction (CMI) in regions that are suffering from instability and armed conflict. The core questions are: what are the key criteria for contracting out CMI projects in out‐of‐area operations, and what contracting methods are appropriate? First, we discuss possible methods and key criteria for contracting out CMI projects. Following this, a case study based in the Uruzgan province of Afghanistan explores key criteria for contracting out CMI projects. Based on this case study, the following five CMI‐related criteria have been identified: generating information on the civilian environment; contributing to building local capacity; process transparency; force acceptance and local participation; and contracting as a tool for stability. These criteria dominate more regular criteria such as cost and time. Some methods frequently used in developed economies, for example the open <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> <b>procedure,</b> seem less appropriate when contracting out CMI projects within a military mission. In CMI projects, contracting most closely resembles the multiple negotiated <b>tender</b> <b>procedure.</b> Future projects can use the identified range of methods and key criteria in designing an improved contracting proces...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In 2011 the Ministry of Culture co-financed the {{purchase}} of library materials in 58 public libraries in Slovenia for the last time. The project {{was carried out in}} compliance with <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> <b>procedures.</b> In accordance with the contractual obligation, all the libraries had to provide final reports (to the Ministry of Culture) with detailed data on the range of purchases and the evaluation of their quality. Public libraries purchased library materials in value of 8, 538, 626 €. 3, 235, 136 € (37. 9 %) were funded by the state. They acquired 449, 890 units (219. 53 units per 1000 inhabitants) however, 157, 295 units (35 %) were provided out of state funds. For {{the purchase}} of library materials local communities allocated (on average) 2. 3 € per inhabitant in the range from 0 € (municipalities: Dobrna, Turnišče, Velika Polana, Beltinci, Gornji Petrovci, Križevci, Šalovci and Tišina) up to 6. 27 € per inhabitant (Bovec). Local communities financed library activity with an average of 19. 83 € per inhabitant in the range from 0 € (Velika Polana and Šalovci) to 34. 33 € (Cerknica). The article also presents all the data on individual public library purchases based on the following indicators: the total number of units (state funds) and the total number purchased units per 1, 000 inhabitants, the number of purchased units of book materials and the number of purchased units of non-book materials per inhabitant; the number of active members per 1, 000 inhabitants and the average price per unit. The data collected confirm that public libraries are building their collections in accordance with professional guidelines and purchasing criteria determined in an annual library plan.

The Ministry of Science supports students by subsidizing, but without defraying the expenses of the student centres activities. As non-profit organizations, everything that centres book as revenues, they should return into the activity again. In accordance with the Act on Institutions, (National Gazette No 76 / 1993, 29 / 1997, 47 / 1999, and 35 / 2008) student centres are managed by Governing body, and the principal is {{the manager of the}} student centre.

40|$|The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1 {{provides}} that organs of state {{must comply with}} five principles when procuring goods or services: procurement procedures must be fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective. In short, this means that organs of state should make use of competition when procuring goods or services. They should shop around and attract {{the maximum number of}} contractors who will participate in such competition. The aim should be the attainment of value for money, meaning, public money should be spent in an effective and efficient manner. Those who participate in competitions should also be treated fairly and without bias. In principle, no preferences should be afforded to different contractors; all contracting parties should have equal access to competition; some contractors should not be afforded more time for the preparation and submission of quotes or tenders than others; and the same information should be made available to all contracting parties. Government procurement procedures should further be transparent, meaning public or open. Thus, organs of state should not contract behind closed doors – government contracts should, as a rule, be advertised. Depending on the nature and value of a particular contract, the use of a <b>public</b> call for <b>tenders</b> is generally the best way to ensure compliance with the principles in the Constitution. By nature, a pubic call for tenders is open, it assists in the prevention of fraud and favouritism, and it ensures that the maximum number of contractors is approached to compete for a contract. Organs of state can also compare prices and quality and can contract with whoever offers the best deal. Most legislation therefore proceeds on the basis that procurement takes place by way of tendering. Generally, contracts above R 200 000 are subject to <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> <b>procedures.</b> In certain instances, however, a <b>public</b> call for <b>tenders</b> may be inappropriate regardless of the high value of the contract. For this reason, exceptions are provided for in legislation. Since tendering, however, is generally the best way to ensure compliance with all the principles in the Constitution, it is important for there to be sufficient guidance on the non-use of <b>tender</b> <b>procedures.</b> Proper guidance will, to a large extent, ensure uniformity and transparency in government procurement procedures which will, in turn, assist in the combating of corruption. In this article, attention is given to the legislation that provides for exceptions to the use of tendering at all three levels of government. Recommendations are then made as to how some of the legislative provisions should be interpreted in order to align them with the principles in the Constitution. In doing so, reference is made to a number of international instruments dealing with government procurement and specifically, the non-use of <b>tender</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{intends to}} be a {{critical}} reflection on the digitization of the acquisition procedures of goods and services, which European policies are aimed to facilitate in order to foster economic revival on both the national and the Community level. Many different reasons make us wonder if it isn't appropriate to introduce a digitized <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> in national and Community legislation. The Community’s economic and cultural policies have influenced national legislation by steering them towards {{the creation of an}} organic and unified set of rules for <b>public</b> <b>tender.</b> Specifically, economic goals such as the realization of a Single Market based on the principle of competition, can be considered essential with regard to acquisition of goods and services. As a matter of fact, the EU policies are intended to identify <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> as a strategic means for market revival and renewed competitiveness between enterprises, so to {{have a positive effect on}} the current economic crisis. Given the amount of financial resources connected to the Public Procurement Code, it is the economic crisis itself that calls for rationalization of public expenditure on acquisitions, which has been an ever more consolidated policy in the past few years, also by national government. This essay will focus on the growing importance of the Community, in particular on its economic policy and its influence over national regulations. The pursuit of the primary objective of European policies - the realization of a Single Market - is the decisive factor in the shift in function of contemporary <b>public</b> <b>tendering</b> from an exclusively national economic matter into a strategic means for the competitiveness of enterprises in the Single Market. This new function and its subsequent use in the public procurement in a broader framework are major factors in undermining the Italian traditional acquisition procedures which identifies the local authority as the fundamental body for the procurement procedures. The change from local to global perspective made it necessary to reflect on the convenience of an evolution in the acquisition dynamics developed in the late 2000 s. In fact, faced with the same economic problems and urged on by the EU, the Italian government has established a centralized digital purchasing system, the Consip model of 3 the electronic market, which has been able to provide an immediate response to the issue of expenditure rationalization by streamlining and simplifying procedures. Through the development of the information society, the European Union points at building a renewed relationship between institutions and citizens, based on the exchange of data in a new perspective of collaboration and simplification of procedures. The need to coordinate the technological tools with traditional institutions of administrative law implies the need to modernize the previous administrative structure both in terms of technological means and in terms of computer literacy for the operators. To this effect the Italian government has established appropriate institutions such as the AIPA, DigitPa and, most recently, the Agency for digital Italy. The mere creation of a digitized administration in which digital technologies are not only a support tool, but also a way to coordinate and redefine the administration itself, requires the analysis of its underlying principles and of some institutions of the administrative digitization procedure. Though the CONSIP system and the electronic market are generally considered to be acquisition procedures, they can't be traced back to the classical notion of administrative procedure. For this reason the analysis of the principles on which the digital administration is based has led us to reflect on their possible application to the <b>procedure</b> of <b>public</b> <b>tender.</b> Given the specific nature of the purchasing process it would be superfluous to create a new set of rules specifically for <b>public</b> <b>tendering,</b> as it can be covered by the current regulation of the digital administration. So even if at first glance there don't seem to exist specific guidelines for the digitization of the acquisition procedures, these can be deducted from the existing regulations of the industry and the Digital Administration Code (DAC). Furthermore, the development of a completely digitized procedure would allow us to better respond to economic needs in the current time of crisis. Technological tools not only save time and money, they can also open the market to more competitors, ultimately resulting in national and global economic revival. This revival will also result from a reduction of the type corruption that is typical of <b>public</b> <b>tender,</b> because the use of a digital procedure will render the expenditure of public money more transparent and easier to control...|$|R

40|$|The {{doctorate}} thesis {{assigned to}} me {{deals with the}} problem of the effects of cancelling the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> of a call for tenders on the contract stipulated in a judicial capacity {{in the course of the}} proceedings between the administration and the company, which turns out to have been unlawfully selected. As regards this question, the case law and legal theory have outlined solutions in terms of interpretation which are at two completely different ends of the spectrum (referring to the retractability, nullity and null and void agreement of the contract respectively) and which induces a set of questions regarding substantive and procedural law. The whole issue concerns the relations between the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> and contract and the majority of the debate in fact centres on the nature (procedural or contractual) of the deed of adjudication. In order to correctly set out this research I therefore decided to dedicate the first part of the work to the problem of the nature of the deed of adjudication. In carrying out a similar survey, I deemed it necessary to take the steps from the traditional guidance that asserts the concurrence, in the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure,</b> of two deeds (even though they are formally separated in the procedure) : an investigation (declaratory) deed (administrative), whereby the final deed of the selection procedure of the contractor is finalised, which consists of verifying the best offer; and a private contractual deed, which contains the agreement declaration of the public administration with regard to the contract to be stipulated. I focused in particular on the normative grounds of this theory (in particular, on the principle of equivalence of the record of the adjudication for the contract sanctioned by art. 16, paragraph 4, of the R. D. no. 2440 / 1923 and on the scope of this provision); and thereby making use of the specifications provided by the case law over time and the contributions made by legal theory. I subsequently analysed the concept of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> solely in terms of an administrative act, sustained by a minor part of the legal theory and case law, but which was endorsed by the Italian Supervisory Authority for Public Works with the decision dated 2 October 2002, no. 24, as it stands it is based on an unconvincing interpretation of the regulations regarding public works and those which provide for the non-conclusive nature of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure.</b> With regard to the problem in question, I was also able to observe how the new Public Contracts Law, approved with the Italian Legislative Decree 12 April 2006, no. 163, does not contribute towards clarifying the point. If in truth on the one hand, this appears to sanction the overcoming of the traditional planning, according to which the record of the adjudication is equivalent to the contract, expressly asserting, in art. 11, paragraph 7, that “the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> is not equivalent to the acceptance of the offer,” on the other hand, the new law reproduces – in art. 11, paragraph 9 – provision (art. 109, paragraph 3, of the D. P. R. no. 554 / 99), which seems instead allow an interpretation to the contrary and therefore to confirm the traditional planning, according to which the record of the adjudication takes the place of the contract. As regards the results achieved at the end of the survey on the nature of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure,</b> from this point of view I decided that the conclusions should be shared. This is where that case study orientation came from, which constitutes the specification of the traditional theory of the dual nature of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure.</b> This differentiates from the deed of adjudication in terms of content in relation to the type of procedure followed and, in particular, excludes the contractual value of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> (and therefore sustains the need to proceed to a separate, subsequent stipulation) if the proceedings of the private negotiation and the competitive tender have been followed. After having examined the essential character and nature of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure,</b> I focused on the specific topic of the doctorate thesis (the effects of cancelling the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> on the stipulated mid-term contract), moving from a (critical) analysis of the main guidelines of civil case law and legal theory recorded on the topic. From this point of view, I examined, first of all, the traditional and oldest guidelines of ordinary civil law, which asserts that the contract stipulated on the basis on an unlawful <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> can be cancelled in accordance with art. 1441 of the Italian Civil Code (hereafter c. c.). It is believed that this retractability can only and exclusively be asserted by the public administration, the only body that can legitimately carry out the relative act in conformity to the cited art. 1441 c. c [...] From this perspective, I dedicated particular attention to the different reconstructive hypotheses that were elaborated regarding the theory of retractability concerning the contract (retractability due to the public administration’s inability negotiate, former art. 1425, first paragraph of the c. c.; retractability due to errors the agreement, former art. 1427 and foll. of the c. c.; retractability due to the public administration’s error in contractual validation). I then went on to examine the theory, also strongly represented in legal theory and foll. and case law, which brings back the condition of the tender contract stipulated based on a <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> cancelled in a judicial capacity with hypothetical absolute nullity, in accordance with art. 1418 of the c. c., concentrating especially on the theory of structural nullity due to a lack of agreement former art. 1418, paragraph 2, and 1325, no. 1, of the c. c. and on the nullity theory due to the violation of binding regulations former art. 1418, first paragraph of the c. c [...] After having examined the different positions taken in the civil sphere, I devoted my attention to studying the “giuspubblicistica” position on the relationship between cancellation and contract, also through the (critical) analysis of the most significant case law rulings on the topic. I paid special attention to the theory of the automatic null and void agreement, which asserts the inefficiency of the contract following the cancellation of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> on the presupposition of the existence of a link of necessary consequentiality between the public representation procedural sequence and the (subsequent) stipulation of the contract and the relative inefficiency that has occurred, according to which the inefficiency of the contract would not be produced automatically, but following the judicial initiative of the omitted contractor and notwithstanding the rights acquired by bona fide third parties, in application of art. 23, paragraph 2, and 25, paragraph 2 of the c. c [...] At the end of the close examination I analysed the advantages and limitation of the various reconstructions proposed, with special attention paid to the criticisms directed at these theories. With particular regard to the traditional theory of the retractability of the contract, I pointed out that on the one hand – reserving the validation to request the cancellation of the contract to the only subcontracting organisation – it seems to adequately satisfy the needs of certainty of the judicial relations, on the other hand this concept does not appear to guarantee the third party in the same way, which has obtained the cancellation of the contract documents, nullifying in such a way the protection achieved by the latter in an administrative judicial capacity. I also ascertained how the theory of retractability appears to be inspired by an ‘artificial’ distinction between the administrative selection stage of the contractor and the strictly contractual period of the issue (which is clarified when stipulating the contract). Indeed, as I was able to notice in specifically examining the problem of the nature of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure,</b> it cannot be the case that the two stages cannot always be clearly separated, having considered that the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> in some cases could also be regarded as a declaration of contractual agreement by the public administration as regards the contract to be stipulated and the subject with which to conclude the contract. For this reason it seems difficult to sustain that the cancellation of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> cannot ever weigh upon the efficiency of the negotiation, and that is to say regardless of an explicit ruling of cancellation of the contract by the ordinary court, as the supporters of the theory of retractability believe. As regards the theory of nullity of the contract, I pointed out how this has been criticised above all as the actual result of an original fault in the contract (which characterises the scheme of radical invalidity) is attributed to an event that has taken place (the cancellation of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure),</b> with unacceptable consequences (on the level of certainty of the judicial relations), such as the exposure of the same contract to the verification of its office nullity, with any prescriptive limitations and by anyone concerned with them. Finally, as regards the recent reconstructions of administrative case law, substantially referring to the inefficiency of the contract, I was able to indicate how the same, although the interests in play have the merit of completely assessing, giving the right importance to protecting the rights of bona fide third parties, lead to results which are partly reassuring concerning the compatibility of this kind of reconstruction with the system coordinates. In conclusion, I was able to ascertain the deficiency of the various theories examined in explaining the problem of the effects of cancelling the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> on the contract. This inadequacy seems to come mainly from the lack of consideration – by these theories – of the problem of the (procedural and/or contractual) nature of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> itself and the relations between the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> and contract. I therefore attempted to identify a prospective solution suitable for resolving the problem of the relationship between the invalidity of the <b>public</b> <b>tenders</b> <b>procedure</b> and contract in light of the close examination of the various theories shown by the legal theory and case law (retractability; nullity; automatic null and void agreement; the relative inefficiency that has occurred), reaching a range of conclusions according to the legal, contractual or only procedural description, which we would like to attribute to the deed of adjudication. From this point of view I hypothesised that when the deed of adjudication also takes on contractual worth, the cancellation of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> causes the nullity of the stipulated mid-term contract, without the need for constitutive statements of its ceased effect, whereas in the cases in which the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure,</b> subject to cancellation, only holds procedural value, the contract must only be deemed as retractable. The combination of the surveys described so far lead to the drafting of three chapters of the doctorate thesis. The first of which is dedicated to the problem of the nature of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure.</b> The second chapter concentrates on the analysis of the positions of the civil case law and legal theory as to the types of the stipulated mid-term contract. The third chapter focuses on the analysis of the theories of administrative case law and the identification of a prospective solution to the problem...|$|R

In {{order to achieve}} my purpose, for my background information I utilize the Act no. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public Contracts {{with the emphasis on}} the so-called "Large" amendment to the act on Public Contracts (no. 55 / 2012 Coll), which was passed in order to make <b>public</b> <b>tenders</b> more transparent, reduce or even clear off corruption from the process of <b>public</b> <b>tenders</b> a lastly to increase the effectiveness of spending public money. Literature is also widely used as sources of information for my thesis. Throughout my diploma thesis, I evaluate the contemporary legal state of <b>public</b> <b>tenders,</b> as well as the view of society on the topic. My diploma thesis consists of nine chapters. The first chapter offers insight into <b>public</b> <b>tenders</b> in the light of European Union Law, from which the Act no. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public Contracts rises. Chapter two addresses the basic terminology and principals on which the Act stands upon. Having an understanding of these principles is necessary {{in order to make a}} deeper evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>tenders.</b> In order to have integrity of the subject, the third chapter outlines all the types of <b>public</b> <b>tenders</b> which are known in the Act no. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public [...] ...|$|R

The thesis is composed of four main chapters. Chapter One summarizes the development of <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> legislation in the Czech Republic, defines current legislation both in the Czech Republic and in the European Union. Chapter Two defines basic terms of the <b>public</b> <b>tenders</b> area which are typical and characteristic only for <b>public</b> <b>tenders</b> and which are not used in other fields of Czech law. The two remaining chapters are devoted to the qualifying requirements and evaluating criteria, their role and types. Through qualifying requirements contractors are divided into those who are qualified to perform <b>public</b> <b>tender</b> {{and those who are}} not. Regarding its importance, it is necessary to stick to the binding provision of the Public Procurement Act while setting the qualifying requirements. Chapter Four is devoted to the evaluating criteria. On the basis of the evaluating criteria the contractor whose bid best fulfils the idea of performance of the contracting authority is chosen from those who are [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, {{development}} {{plans for the}} Swedish municipality of Järfälla detected a severe disappointment concerning appropriate forms of housing for frail older citizens. In 2006, the municipality organized an architectural competition in order to renew housing for dependent and frail older persons. In 2007, a winner was selected from 33 submitted proposals. The proposal was made by Danish architects, who envisioned different types of housing that were organized around a central residential care home that became the centre for the town plan. The paper is a study on how architectonic visions were converted into a built environment {{under the influence of}} Swedish civil administration. Interviews with 10 key informants, involved in different stages of the process, along with official documentation allowed for reconstructing stages that influenced the course of the project. The research was focused on the perceived similarity between the winning proposal and the actual realization. The analysis of the research material identified three decisive stages in the realization of the winning proposal. Firstly, the commission, which the architects had won, created problems since it could be seen as merely a town plan or a plan in combination with a building commission. Secondly, <b>public</b> regulations on <b>tendering</b> <b>procedures</b> generated spatial problems for the key building of the town plan as well as for segments of the full plan. Thirdly, the financial market in a large city region affected the level of architectural quality. The study identified a continuum of exterior influence that could be termed as adaptiveness that organisational and political priorities imposed on the competition proposal. QC 20170109 </p...|$|R

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} Dissertation was {{to create}} a method {{enabling}} evaluation of a business plan of a firm doing business in the field of freight transport. The Dissertation is based on an actual investment project in which the transport company takes part in two <b>tender</b> <b>procedures.</b> The specific nature of the transport sector complicated the possibility to use classical methods for the evaluation of investment efficiency. Application of the net pre-sent value method to an already implemented investment project confirmed that this method cannot be used to assess the business plan of the transport company. For this reason, it was necessary to draw up a price creation method for both the <b>tender</b> <b>procedures</b> able to en-sure positive profitability of the project with regard to specifics in particular tenders. The subject matter of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedures</b> was the request for proposal concerning vehicle sets of various specifications.
