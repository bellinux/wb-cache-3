Koo eventually sold CTN in January 2000, having never turned a profit. In an attempt to increase the market share of China Network Systems (CNS), a cable company owned by KGI, Koo restructured CNS and sought investors to form a media conglomerate, becoming partners with Rupert Murdoch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Though he was credited with helping Koos Group gain a foothold in new industries, many of Koo's investments were also regarded as risky, and multiple ventures lost money. He resigned his position at China Life in December 2001. As a result, Koo became less involved with Koos Group business ventures, except for Hoshin Gigamedia Center Inc. which he had founded in October 1998. Under his leadership, GigaMedia reached an agreement with Microsoft and began working on a set-top box design suitable for broadband Internet via cable services. In November 1999, Microsoft bought a ten <b>percent</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> GigaMedia. <b>The</b> next year, GigaMedia began work with Yahoo Inc. on building a website which offered multimedia entertainment to GigaMedia customers.
