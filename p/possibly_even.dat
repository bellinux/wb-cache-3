5|$|The {{eggs were}} first named in 1994, {{when the two}} oospecies were {{classified}} in distinct oogenera as Cairanoolithus dughii and Dughioolithus roussetensis. They are now considered to belong in a single oogenus, <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> a single oospecies. Though it has been classified as a megaloolithid, Cairanoolithus is now placed in its own oofamily, Cairanoolithidae.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{seems to}} have {{involved}} {{the two of them}} overthrowing Tiberius, {{with the support of the}} Julians, and either assuming the Principate themselves, or serving as regent to the young Tiberius Gemellus or <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> Caligula. Those who stood in his way were tried for treason and swiftly dealt with.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{speculation}} that the assassination of Spanish prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo in 1897 was at least supported or influenced by Betances, and <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> planned by him (although there is no physical link that can be established that might link Betances to the event itself).|$|E
5|$|A new extant genus {{discovered}} in 2014, Dendrogramma, {{which appears to}} be a basal metazoan but of unknown taxonomic placement, has been noted to have similarities with the Ediacaran fauna. It has since been found to be a siphonophore, <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> sections of a more complex species, though this in turn has raised suspicions for a similar status for at least some ediacaran organisms.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E

5|$|As a result, Maslama {{launched}} {{another attack}} aimed at Tyana, with his nephew al-Abbas ibn al-Walid as co-commander. The chronology {{of the expedition}} is again unclear: the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor puts it in A.M. 6201 (708/709 AD, and <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> 709/710), but Arab sources date it to A.H. 88 and 89 (706/707 AD and 707/708 AD respectively). As a result, the siege has been variously dated to 707–708 AD and 708–709 AD.|$|E
5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches; many, if not most, {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> before, and is constructed {{of the same}} soft brick that makes up {{the exterior of the}} home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E

And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|Volcanoes {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be active if they have had eruptions during the Holocene. However, {{as demonstrated by the}} unexpected eruption of Chaiten volcano in Chile in May 2008, even long-inactive volcanoes can become active again. Such volcanoes can constitute a threat to regions with seemingly quiet volcanism. Ciomadul has had repose periods of over 10,000 years and <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> longer. Zircon crystallization data imply that the magma chambers of Ciomadul were active over time spans of over 300,000 years.|$|E

5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built just inside the {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, {{it was in a}} dilapidated state by 1577. A base court (an enclosed area) was added in front of the castle’s gatehouse after the main complex was built, but it unclear when. Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere, a type of broad shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more were raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and it is probable that political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> later.|$|E
5|$|A single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 248, is {{currently}} {{identified as a}} Ferugliotherium upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> a right mf1. LACM 149371, an enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to Ferugliotherium.

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} he was 6 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died, while his father and brother were {{continuously}} active in the Roman military, commanding armies in Germania and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish-Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as city prefect of Rome; or <b>possibly</b> <b>even</b> Marcus Cocceius Nerva, a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.|$|E

It has a narrow black terminal tailband, and a narrow black band; the male has a large white nape, the female pale grey. This form was initially described by H. L. White in 1922.
