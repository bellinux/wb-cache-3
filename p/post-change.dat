40|$|Objective: Few {{empirical}} {{studies have examined}} the feasibility of trauma-focused treatment among individuals with schizophrenia. This lack of research is important given the substantial overlap of trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD with psychotic spectrum disorders, and the potential for PTSD to complicate the course and prognosis of schizophrenia and other variants of severe mental illness. Method: As part of a larger study, 14 veterans with a psychotic spectrum disorder were enrolled to receive prolonged exposure (PE) for PTSD within a single arm open trial study design. Patient reactions and responses to PE were examined using feasibility indices such as attrition, survey reactions, and treatment expectancy; pre and <b>post-changes</b> in PTSD severity and diagnostic status; and thematic interviews conducted post-intervention. Results: Quantitative and qualitative data indicate that implementation of PE is feasible, subjectively well-tolerated, and may result in clinically significant reductions in PTSD symptoms in patients with psychotic spectrum disorders. Conclusion: Consistent with treatment outcome data in clinical populations with a broader range of severe mental illnesses, the current results support the use of PTSD exposure-based interventions, such as PE, for individuals with psychotic spectrum disorders...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of an 8 -week recess intervention on physical activity levels in children attending elementary school on an American Indian reservation during fall 2013. Physical activity was measured with direct observation in three zones on the playground. Lines were painted on existing pavement in zone 1. Zone 2 had permanent playground equipment and was unchanged. Zone 3 contained fields where bi-weekly facilitators led activities and provided equipment. Pre- to <b>post-changes</b> during recess in sedentary, moderate physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous, and vigorous physical activities were compared within zones. Females physical activity increased in Zone 1 (moderate: 100 % increase; moderate-to-vigorous: 83 %; vigorous: 74 %, p< 0. 01 for all) and Zone 3 (moderate: 54 % increase, p< 0. 01; moderate-to-vigorous: 48 %, p< 0. 01; vigorous: 40 %, p< 0. 05). Male sedentary activity decreased in Zone 2 (161 %, p< 0. 01). Physical activity changes in Zone 3 were not dependent upon the presence of a facilitator. Simple and low-cost strategies were effective at increasing recess physical activity in females.

They should be involved in the intervention program to be able to improve their quality of life. This study investigated the effect of a self-management program based on 5 A (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange) model on metabolic control indicators of diabetic patients. Material and method In this randomized, controlled trial, 70 diabetic insulin dependent patients who referred to Nader Kazemi clinic in Shiraz participated. They were randomly assigned to two groups of experiment and control. Then a self-management program based on 5 A model was performed for the experiment group during 3 -mounths and the indicators of metabolic control including hemoglobin A 1 c, cholesterol, triglyceride and also body mass index were measured pre- and post- intervention in both groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS ver 11. 5. Results Data analysis revealed a significant reduction in mean fasting blood sugar (69 units) and HbA 1 c (1. 16 units) in the experimental group. Pre- to <b>post-changes</b> in hemoglobin A 1 c, fasting blood sugar, and high density lipoprotein were significant between the two groups of study. However, there was no significant difference in cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, and body mass index between the two groups. Discussion Regarding the results, it can be concluded that a 3 -month self-management program based on 5 A model is effective in reducing the fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A 1 c. Application of self management program based on 5 A model in diabetic clinics is recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|Floral color {{changes and}} {{retention}} of old flowers are frequently combined phenomena restricted to the floral guide or single flowers in few-flowered inflorescences. They are thought to increase the attractiveness over long distances and to direct nearby pollinators toward the rewarding flowers. In Tibouchina pulchra, a massively flowering tree, the whole flower changes its color during anthesis. On the first day, the flowers are white and on the next 3 days, they change to pink. This creates a new large-scale color pattern in which the white pre-changed flowers contrast against the pink <b>post-changed</b> ones over the entire tree. We describe the spectral characteristics of floral colors of T. pulchra and test bumblebees' response to this color pattern when viewed at different angles (simulating long and short distances). The results indicated the role of different color components in bumblebee attraction and the possible scenario in which this flower color pattern has evolved. We tested bumblebees' preference for simulated trees with 75 % pink and 25 % white flowers resembling the color patterns of T. pulchra, and trees with green leaves and pink flowers (control) in long-distance approach. We also compared an artificial setting with three pink flowers and one white flower (T pulchra model) against four pink flowers with white floral guides (control) in short-distance approach. Bumblebees spontaneously preferred the simulated T. pulchra patterns in both approaches despite similar reward. Moreover, in short distances, pollinator visits to peripheral, non-rewarding flowers occurred only half as frequently in the simulated T pulchra {{when compared to the}} control. Thefore, this exceptional floral color change and the retention of old flowers in T. pulchra favors the attraction of pollinators over long distances in a deception process while it honestly directs them toward the rewarding flowers at short distances possibly exploring their innate color preferences...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore which of these four training concepts provides the greatest response on key components of endurance performance in well-trained endurance athletes. Methods: Forty eight runners, cyclists, triathletes, and cross-country skiers (peak oxygen uptake: (VO 2 peak) : 62. 6 ± 7. 1 mL·min- 1 ·kg- 1) were randomly assigned to one of four groups performing over 9 weeks. An incremental test, work economy and a VO 2 peak tests were performed. Training intensity was heart rate controlled. Results: POL demonstrated the greatest increase in VO 2 peak (+ 6. 8 ml·min·kg- 1 or 11. 7 %, P &lt; 0. 001), time to exhaustion during the ramp protocol (+ 17. 4 %, P &lt; 0. 001) and peak velocity/power (+ 5. 1 %, P &lt; 0. 01). Velocity/power at 4 mmol·L- 1 increased after POL (+ 8. 1 %, P &lt; 0. 01) and HIIT (+ 5. 6 %, P &lt; 0. 05). No differences in pre- to <b>post-changes</b> of work economy were found between the groups. Body mass was reduced by 3. 7 % (P &lt; 0. 001) following HIIT, with no changes in the other groups. With the exception of slight improvements in work economy in THR, both HVT and THR had no further effects on measured variables of endurance performance (P &gt; 0. 05). Conclusion: POL resulted in the greatest improvements in most key variables of endurance performance in well-trained endurance athletes. THR or HVT did not lead to further improvements in performance related variables. © 2014 Stöggl and Sperlich.

50|$|Prior {{research}} {{in the early part}} of the decade had shown that change blindness can be counteracted by a number of methods. Shifting attention with a visual cue can help lower the negative effects of change blindness. Stimulation of the superior colliculus improves performance and reaction time in the same way. However, recent research has also been done on countering tactile change blindness. A 2016 study by Riggs et al. shows that three successful methods for limiting tactile change blindness in distinguishing changes in vibration patterns are attention guidance, signal gradation and direct comparison. All three methods seek to bring attention to the area of change. Attention guidance works proactively by increasing the frequency of a cue. The second and third methods are reactive and based on error-feedback. Signal gradation further increases the intensity of the vibration after the change has been missed. Direct comparison pairs the pre-change and <b>post-change</b> vibration intensities without a gap in between after a change has been missed to support the use of relative judgment rather than absolute. While all significantly improve performance, the second and third countermeasures are most effective. Concentration and attention are also a major factors in avoiding change blindness.|$|E

In an initial analysis across all four videos, we used a general estimating equation procedure to test whether gaze duration in pre- and <b>post-change</b> regions of interest (ROIs) significantly predicted recognition of pre- and <b>post-change</b> properties (using video as a within-subject effect, assuming a binomial distribution, and an unstructured working correlation matrix structure). We ran two analyses, one with both pre- and <b>post-change</b> gaze duration predicting pre-change recognition, and one predicting <b>post-change</b> recognition.

So, if a given participant’s gaze fell within the pre-change ROI for 10 frames and within the <b>post-change</b> ROI for 15 frames, their 10 -frame minimum would reflect {{the fact that they had}} at least 333 [*]ms gaze within both regions to provide opportunity to encode the pre- and <b>post-change</b> properties. We also assessed the longest joint minimum continuous run length between pre- and <b>post-change</b> ROIs to assess the degree to which change blindness may have occurred in the face of relatively long continuous samples of visual information within both ROIs (that is, we calculated the longest temporally continuous run of frames that gaze fell in the pre-change ROI and in the <b>post-change</b> ROI and reported the lesser of these values).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of quickly {{detecting}} an abrupt change on a stochastic process under Bayesian framework is considered. Different from the classic Bayesian quickest change-point detection problem, this paper considers the case where there is uncertainty about the <b>post-change</b> distribution. Specifically, the observer only knows that the <b>post-change</b> distribution belongs to a parametric distribution family {{but he does not}} know the true value of the <b>post-change</b> parameter. In this scenario, we propose two multi-chart detection procedures, termed as M-SR procedure and modified M-SR procedure respectively, and show that these two procedures are asymptotically optimal when the <b>post-change</b> parameter belongs to a finite set and are asymptotically ϵ-optimal when the <b>post-change</b> parameter belongs to a compact set with finite measure. Both algorithms can be calculated efficiently as their detection statistics can be updated recursively. We then extend the study to consider the multi-source monitoring problem with unknown <b>post-change</b> parameters. When those monitored sources are mutually independent, we propose a window-based modified M-SR detection procedure and show that the proposed detection method is first-order asymptotically optimal when <b>post-change</b> parameters belong to finite sets. We show that both computation and space complexities of the proposed algorithm increase only linearly with respect to the number of sources. Comment: 30 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} quickest change {{detection}} is studied, {{where there is}} an additional constraint {{on the cost of}} observations used before the change point and where the <b>post-change</b> distribution is composite. Minimax formulations are proposed for this problem. It is assumed that the <b>post-change</b> family of distributions has a member which is least favorable in some sense. An algorithm is proposed in which on-off observation control is employed using the least favorable distribution, and a generalized likelihood ratio based approach is used for change detection. Under the additional condition that either the <b>post-change</b> family of distributions is finite, or both the pre- and <b>post-change</b> distributions belong to a one parameter exponential family, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal, uniformly for all possible <b>post-change</b> distributions.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the quickest change {{detection}} with mismatched <b>post-change</b> models. A change {{point is the}} time instant at which the distribution of a random process changes. The objective of quickest change detection is to minimize the detection delay of an unknown change point under certain performance constraints, such as average run length (ARL) to false alarm or probability of false alarm (PFA). Most existing change detection procedures assume perfect knowledge of the random process distributions {{before and after the}} change point. However, in many practical applications such as anomaly detection, the <b>post-change</b> distribution is often unknown and needs to be estimated with a limited number of samples. In this paper, we study the case that there is a mismatch between the true <b>post-change</b> distribution and the one used during detection. We analytically identify the impacts of mismatched <b>post-change</b> models on two classical detection procedures, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedure and the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure. The impacts of mismatched models are characterized in terms of various finite or asymptotic performance bounds on ARL, PFA, and average detection delay (ADD). It is shown that <b>post-change</b> model mismatch results in an increase in ADD, and the rate of performance degradation depends on the difference between two Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, one is between the priori- and <b>post-change</b> distributions, and the other one is between the true and mismatched <b>post-change</b> distributions.

30|$|To {{test for}} {{a link between}} gaze and change detection, we tested whether {{duration}} of gaze at pre- and <b>post-change</b> properties predicted change detection. To test this hypothesis we defined rectangular regions of interest bounding the pre-change and <b>post-change</b> properties and tabulated the number of frames (temporally contiguous or not) for which gaze fell within those regions. In video  2, the changing property was visible for the entire duration of the video, so we limited the assessed fixation durations to the 10 [*]s {{before and after the}} change. These gaze durations were entered as predictors into a generalized estimating equations analysis with video, pre-change gaze duration, and <b>post-change</b> gaze duration predicting change detection. Increases in <b>post-change</b> (X 2 (1)[*]=[*] 11.580, p[*]=[*] 0.001) but not pre-change (X 2 (1)[*]=[*] 1.246, p[*]=[*] 0.264) gaze duration significantly predicted increased change detection.|$|E
30|$|Experiment 1 {{demonstrated}} that change blindness was prevalent while viewing screen-captured instructional videos, {{and that these}} failures were associated with less accurate recognition of the changing objects. This was true both for recognition of pre- and <b>post-change</b> object properties. That said, recognition was reasonably accurate and well above a nominal chance level even where changes were missed. In addition, the experiment {{demonstrated that}} visual processing, as measured by gaze, was associated with change detection, but this relationship was strongest for <b>post-change</b> visual properties. It {{is important to note}} that this relationship is fundamentally ambiguous because of the reasonable likelihood that participants would lengthen their gaze to inspect the <b>post-change</b> property. More telling is the finding that attentive blank stares appeared to be frequent, as participants often missed changes despite looking at both the pre- and <b>post-change</b> ROIs. Finally, there were no links between awareness/representation and content learning.|$|E

30|$|Other {{patterns}} of {{results in the}} eye movement data may provide useful evidence about gaze patterns that may signal representation-creation and comparison. In particular, we observed that gaze duration to pre-change properties generally did not predict change detection while change-hitters and change-missers were sometimes differentiated by gaze duration in the <b>post-change</b> properties. This {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that variations in the amount of attention given to an object do not map directly on to variations in the prevalence of representations that are by default used prospectively to detect changes. The link between post-gaze and change detection was sometimes significant, but this could have occurred because change detection caused increased inspection of the <b>post-change</b> ROI, not because gaze in the ROI increased change detection. However, the pattern of differentiation of gaze between change-hitters and change-missers across the time course of the <b>post-change</b> ROI is potentially interesting because the gaze advantage for change-hitters is not specific to the onset of the <b>post-change</b> object, which one might expect if variation in the strength of a stimulus-driven onset induced change detection.|$|E
