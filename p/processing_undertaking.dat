40|$|This paper {{presents}} a work-in-progress exploring how learners can {{manage their own}} cognitive load {{through the use of}} computer-based tools. Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental <b>processing</b> <b>undertaken</b> in working memory by a learner. Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) has identified evidence-based design principles that inform the development of instructional materials to support the efficient use of working memory. Much of the CLT research has focused on how to present learners with optimally designed learning materials. There has been little research that has examined how learners can implement CLT design principles to manage their own cognitive load when exposed to non-compliant CLT instructional materials. This work builds on a current PhD study that investigated how university students can self-manage their cognitive load when exposed to print-based non-compliant CLT instructional materials. This study investigates how students can use computer-based tools to manipulate instructional materials and reduce cognitive load...|$|R

Often the hardness of these cutting materials is necessary to enable the machining of advanced materials which are difficult to cut. The objective of the project presented in the paper is to make efficient techniques for processing ultra-hard cutting materials available by developing and applying an economical and environmentally friendly laser technology. The focus of the project lies on examining the interrelation between the laser beam and the cutting material in order to establish the technological basics of the laser processing of ultra-hard cutting materials. In addition, the defined processing of the surfaces and the edges of the tools shall optimize the tool characteristics. Based on the data gathered in these investigations, tools made from ultra-hard cutting materials are processed for cutting experiments.

The 61, 000 line-km of data and the <b>processing</b> <b>undertaken</b> are described by Beamish and White (2014). The survey used a N–S line separation of 200  m and a radiometric data sampling of 1  Hz providing an along-line sampling of 71  m. The survey achieved a mean flying elevation of 92  m from a nominal elevation of 80  m.

Uranium (238 U) is estimated through the radon daughter 214 Bi in its decay chain, while thorium (232 Th) is estimated through 208 Tl in its decay chain. Potassium (40 K) is measured directly at 1.461  MeV. Conventionally secular equilibrium in the decay chains of uranium and thorium is assumed (Minty 1967) and the ground concentration results are reported as equivalent uranium (eU, ppm) and equivalent thorium (eTh, ppm).

40|$|International audienceResorting to {{restoration}} {{techniques for}} heritage documents becomes an increasingly urgent need. In fact, these valuable resources for human being {{are subject to}} several types of degradations limiting their use. A proposed {{solution to this problem}} is the application of restoration techniques on the digital copy of the originally degraded document. This would improve human readability and allow further application of image processing techniques. Hence identifying a typology of different types of image degradation is of primary concern for use in restoration techniques. Our main contributions in this paper are twofold. In the first instance, we propose a typology for different types of degradation of old document images. Our proposed typology is lead by the type of image <b>processing</b> <b>undertaken</b> in the course of virtual restoration. The second contribution is to develop a restoration method treating specific document degradation: "ink bleed-through". The proposed method is a non-supervised segmentation method. It is based on a recursive segmentation approach applied to the principal component analysis space. As an illustration, a scheme of "ink bleed-through" removal of the provided document images by the archive of "Chatillon-Chalaronne" is presented.

40|$|The {{reprocessing}} of the WSU 2002 seismic line {{indicates the}} presence of a Precambrian half-graben. Also observed through this reprocessing is the possible presence of Paleozoic structures. Although Paleozoic features have been interpreted, variations in glacial drift thickness evidenced by glacial drift maps also may have contributed to a lower quality of stacked section in comparison to other seismic lines. WSU 2002 was originally processed by Lauren Geophysical. The Lauren processing resulted in an image that was of much lower quality than corresponding seismic lines. The Lauren Geophysical processed section revealed many horizontal Paleozoic reflections, with no prominent reflectors beneath the Paleozoic. This prompted a study to be done to reprocess the data and determine if other reflections could be found. As a result of the <b>processing</b> <b>undertaken</b> in this study new reflectors have been found beneath the Paleozoic reflections. There are multiple interpretations of the sub-Paleozoic reflections which lead to a half-graben interpretation. Also new in this study is topography in the usually flat lying Paleozoic reflections. A low coherency in reflections is assumed {{to be the result of}} glacial drift thickness variations. At one point in the lower Paleozoic reflections is interpreted above a reactivated fault.

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} fuel property variations {{associated with the}} time of harvest and the duration of storage of Miscanthus x giganteus over a one year period. The crop has been harvested at three different times: early (September 2009), conventional (April 2010) and late (June 2010). Once harvested the crop was baled and stored. Biomass properties of samples taken from different storage zones were compared. The thermochemical properties have been investigated using a range of analytical equipment including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). In addition, bio-oil has been produced from the early, conventional and late harvest using a laboratory scale (300 gh) fast pyrolysis unit. The potential organic liquid yield (ondry basis, also excluding the reaction water generated) based on the laboratory fast pyrolysis <b>processing</b> <b>undertaken</b> in this study, was found to vary between 2. 82 and 3. 18 dry tha for the early and the late harvest respectively. The bio-oil organic yield was reduced by approximately 11 % (0. 36 tha) between the early and the late harvest. Char yield was also reduced by approximately 18 % (0. 61 tha). The highest gas yield (18. 03 %- 1. 60 tha) was observed for the conventional harvest. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the bio-oil shows that levoglucosan, methylbenzaldehyde and 1, 2 -benzenediol all increase {{as a consequence of}} delayed harvest. It was also observed that by delaying the harvest time the O:C atomic ratio is reduced and a more carbonaceous feedstock is produced...|$|R

40|$|A three {{jaw chuck}} set from a lathe machine tool failed whilst in use. At some prior {{point in time}} the {{case-hardened}} chuck jaw set had sustained damage to its gripping serrations, thus requiring refurbishment of the jaws. Shortly after re-entering service, the refurbished jaw number one (of three) failed traumatically. Sudden loss of grip allowed a large rapidly rotating work piece to be thrown free, hitting and inflicting seriously injury to the machine tool operator. Analysis of the broken jaw revealed sub-surface case-cracking, initiated {{as a result of}} metallurgical changes induced by thermal <b>processing</b> <b>undertaken</b> as part of the refurbishment cycle. Fatigue propagation of a case-crack had then ensued, driving the crack to final traumatic failure. Further analysis revealed stress raising features on a second jaw. This particular jaw had initiated a longitudinal crack that, at the time of observation, had not propagated to failure. Therefore, both thermal processing and design shortcomings were found to be at issue with this incident. When considering the safety critical nature of lathe chuck jaws, a question to consider is whether a more prudent route of action is required for the future. Rather than attempting refurbishment, it would be reasonable simply to scrap worn jaws. This is considered a sensible course of future action, rather than running the risk of being overtaken by a similar failure. Finally, the issue of ineffective or non-existent machine tool guarding was considered, with the outcomes effectively reducing injury compensation awarded to the machine tool operator. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{study is}} reported which attempts to validate two key theoretical consequences of consumer involvement: differences in brand buying behaviour {{and differences in}} the type of decision <b>processing</b> <b>undertaken.</b> A literature review is provided which traces the history of involvement and identifies a suitable contemporary framework. Work on brand loyalty and attitude modelling is also reviewed and suitable frameworks identified. A pilot stage is reported which shows how involvement measurement techniques can be adapted for use among frequently purchased products. Results from reliability testing and differences in the mean levels of involvement for six grocery product categories are reported. A main fieldwork phase is reported where a consumer panel was operated for four months (n= 191). Data on levels of involvement, decision making and purchasing behaviour were collected from the panel using surveys and diary sheets for three product categories: newspapers, breakfast cereals and paper kitchen towels. The relationship between sources of involvement and buying behaviour was analysed using LISREL. A model of involvement is identified which suggests that brand involvement is generated by the risks associated with making a poor brand choice and the levels of pleasure associated with the product field. For newspapers, the modelling identifies a significant (but small) relationship between involvement and devotion of purchasing to a limited number of brands. This relationship was not significant in the other two product fields. Further analysis identifies four classifications of buying behaviour (habitual, loyal, switchers, and variety seekers) which helps to explain why the linear relationship is so weak. A second analysis phase is reported which examines the utility of the Extended Fishbein Model {{for each of the three}} product categories. This analysis supports the notion that decision processing is more extensive where the level of product involvement is higher. The theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed. Strengths and limitations of the research design are reviewed...|$|R
