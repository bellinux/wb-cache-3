5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive <b>piercing</b> and spiritual <b>piercing,</b> modern {{primitives}} use <b>piercing</b> {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used <b>piercing</b> as a culturally binding ritual. But {{at the same time that}} <b>piercing</b> can be culturally binding, it may also be a means of rebellion, particularly for adolescents in Western cultures.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} nipple <b>piercing,</b> navel <b>piercing,</b> and genital <b>piercing</b> has been {{particularly}} misrepresented by printed works continuing to repeat myths that were originally promulgated by Malloy in the pamphlet Body & Genital <b>Piercing</b> in Brief. For example, according to Malloy's colleague Jim Ward, Malloy claimed navel <b>piercing</b> was popular among ancient Egyptian aristocrats and was depicted in Egyptian statuary, a claim that is widely repeated. Other sources say there are no records to support a historical practice for navel <b>piercing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>piercing</b> gun: The vast {{majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears pierced with a <b>piercing</b> gun. The safety of <b>piercing</b> guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for <b>piercing</b> body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that <b>piercing</b> guns not be used for any <b>piercing,</b> requiring members to agree not to use <b>piercing</b> guns in their practice.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of body <b>piercing</b> {{is subject to}} trends and fashions. Belly button and eyebrow piercings were popular during the 1990s when the <b>piercing</b> trend entered the mainstream.

5|$|A fifteen-year {{analysis}} {{published in}} 2011, Body <b>Piercing</b> and Identity Construction found that public <b>piercing</b> {{served as a}} mechanism of both accelerated camaraderie and political communication, while private piercings served to enhance sexuality and contest heteronormativity.|$|E
5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body <b>piercing</b> by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of <b>piercing</b> enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body <b>piercing</b> by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital <b>Piercing</b> in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the <b>piercing</b> that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of <b>piercing.</b>|$|E

5|$|Body <b>piercing,</b> {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word <b>piercing</b> can refer to the act or practice of body <b>piercing,</b> or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body <b>piercing</b> is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 20th century, <b>piercing</b> of any body part had become {{uncommon}} in the West. After World War II, it began increasing in popularity among the gay male subculture. Even ear <b>piercing</b> for a time was culturally unacceptable for women, but that relatively common form of <b>piercing</b> began growing in popularity from the 1960s. In the 1970s, <b>piercing</b> began to expand, as the punk movement embraced it, featuring nontraditional adornment such as safety pins; and Fakir Musafar began popularizing it as a form of Modern Primitivism, which incorporated <b>piercing</b> elements from other cultures, such as stretching.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body <b>piercing</b> {{practices}} {{emphasize the}} use of safe body <b>piercing</b> materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body <b>piercing</b> is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary <b>piercing</b> procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body <b>piercing</b> may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.|$|E

5|$|Ear <b>piercing</b> {{and nose}} <b>piercing</b> have been {{particularly}} widespread and are well represented in historical records and among grave goods. The oldest mummified remains ever discovered were sporting earrings, attesting {{to the existence of}} the practice more than 5,000 years ago. Nose <b>piercing</b> is documented as far back as 1500 BC. Piercings of these types have been documented globally, while lip and tongue piercings were historically found in African and American tribal cultures. Nipple and genital <b>piercing</b> have also been practiced by various cultures, with nipple <b>piercing</b> dating back at least to Ancient Rome while genital <b>piercing</b> is described in Ancient India c. 320 to 550 CE. The history of navel <b>piercing</b> is less clear. The practice of body <b>piercing</b> has waxed and waned in Western culture, but it has experienced an increase of popularity since World War II, with sites other than the ears gaining subcultural popularity in the 1970s and spreading to mainstream in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Physical trauma {{including}} tearing, friction or bumping of the <b>piercing</b> site, {{which may}} cause edema and delay healing. The risks can be minimized by wearing properly sized jewellery and not changing it unnecessarily, by not touching the <b>piercing</b> more than required for aftercare, and by being conscious of environmental factors (such as clothing) that may impact the <b>piercing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the <b>piercing</b> needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the <b>piercing</b> needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the <b>piercing.</b> More bleeding may follow, as the <b>piercing</b> is larger than the jewellery.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} <b>piercing</b> or not <b>piercing</b> are varied. Some people pierce for {{religious}} or spiritual reasons, while others pierce for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for sexual pleasure, {{to conform to}} their culture or to rebel against it. Some forms of <b>piercing</b> remain controversial, particularly when applied to youth. The display or placement of piercings have been restricted by schools, employers and religious groups. In spite of the controversy, some people have practiced extreme forms of body <b>piercing,</b> with Guinness bestowing World Records on individuals with hundreds and even thousands of permanent and temporary piercings.|$|E
5|$|According to 2006's Tattoos and Body <b>Piercing,</b> {{corporate}} dress codes {{can also}} strictly limit <b>piercing</b> displays. At that time, Starbucks limited piercings to two per ear and jewellery to small, matched earrings. Employees of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts were {{not permitted to}} display piercings at all.|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital <b>piercing</b> in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital <b>piercing</b> to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital <b>piercing</b> in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity <b>piercing</b> for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E

5|$|In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a nose ring. Nose <b>piercing</b> {{has been}} {{practiced by the}} Bedouin tribes of the Middle East and the Berber and Beja peoples of Africa, as well as Australian Aboriginals. Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum <b>piercing.</b> It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and {{feathers}} to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility. The name of the Nez Perce tribe {{was derived from the}} practice, though nose <b>piercing</b> was not common within the tribe. The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama. Nose <b>piercing</b> also remains popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh and is practiced in a number of Middle Eastern and Arab countries.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple <b>piercing.</b> Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by <b>piercing.</b> While rare, infection due to <b>piercing</b> of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue <b>piercing,</b> in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E
