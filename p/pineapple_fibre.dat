40|$|The {{cellulosome}} is a multimeric enzyme {{complex that}} {{has the ability to}} metabolise a wide variety of carbonaceous compounds. Cellulosomal composition may vary according to the microbe’s nutritional requirement and allows for the anaerobic degradation of complex substrates. The complex substrates of interest in this research study were sugarcane bagasse and <b>pineapple</b> <b>fibre</b> waste, as they represent two important lignocellulosic, South African agricultural crops. The effective degradation of complex plant biomass wastes may present a valuable source of renewable compounds for the production of a variety of biofuels, for example bioethanol, and a variety of biocomposites of industrial importance. The identification of renewable energy sources for the production of biofuels is becoming increasingly important, {{as a result of the}} rapid depletion of the fossil fuels that are traditionally used as energy sources. An effective means of completely degrading lignocellulose biomass still remains elusive due to the complex heterogeneity of the substrate structure, and the fact that the effective degradation of the substrate requires a consortium of enzymes. The cellulosome not only provides a variety of enzymes with varying specificities, but also promote a close proximity between the catalytic components (enzymes). The close proximity between the enzymes promotes the synergistic degradation of complex plant biomass for the production of valuable energy products. Previous synergy studies have focused predominantly on the synergistic associations between cellulases; however, the synergy between hemicellulases has occasionally been documented. This research project established the synergistic associations between two Clostridium cellulovorans hemicellulases that may be incorporated into the cellulosome and a cellulosomal endoglucanase that is conserved in all cellulosomes. This research study indicated that there was indeed a synergistic degradation of the complex plant biomass (sugarcane bagasse and <b>pineapple</b> <b>fibre).</b> The degrees of synergy and the ratio of the enzymes varied between the two complex substrates. The initial degradation of the bagasse required the presence of all the enzymes and proceeded at an enhanced rate under sulphidogenic conditions; however, there was a low production of fermentable sugars. The low quantity of fermentable sugars produced by the degradation of the bagasse may be related to the chemical composition of the substrate. The sugarcane contains a high percentage of lignin forming a protective layer around the holocellulose, thus the glycosidic bonds are shielded extensively from enzymatic attack. In comparison, the initial degradation of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>fibre</b> required the action of hemicellulases, and proceeded at an enhanced rate under sulphidogenic conditions. The initial degradation of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>fibre</b> produced a substantially larger quantity of fermentable sugars in comparison to the bagasse. The higher production of fermentable sugars from the degradation of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>fibre</b> may be explained by the fact that this substrate may have a lower percentage of lignin than the bagasse, thus allowing a larger percentage of the glycosidic bonds to be exposed to enzymatic attack. The data obtained also indicated that the glycosidic bonds from the hemicellulosic components of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>fibre</b> shielded the glycosidic bonds of the cellulose component. The identification of the chemical components of the different substrates may allow for the initial development of an ideal enzyme complex (designer cellulosome) with enzymes in an ideal ratio with optimal synergy that will effectively degrade the complex plant biomass substrate. ...|$|E

Regarding to all the microbiological analysis realized in chitosan â raw material â and in the inputs, the bacterian growth was ever < 10 UFC/g e < 10 UFC/bottle. The average obtained in mesophilic bacterium, mold and papaya and <b>pineapple</b> <b>fibres</b> yeast counting was, respectively, 2, 51, 1, 87 and 2, 41, 2, 29 UFC/g. The respective results to the before encapsulating product and encapsulated product were 1, 86, 1, 35, and 1, 92, 1, 15 UFC/g. The averages related to mesophilic bacterium counting in the encapsulator disk, funnel, platter and mixer were 1, 65, 1, 59, 1, 54 and 1, 72 UFC/cm 2. The respective results to mold and yeast were 1, 59, 1, 41, 1, 49 and 1, 11 UFC/cm 2. The mesophilic bacterium counting in the gloves of the handlers, at the beginning and at the end of the production process were, respectively, in average, 2, 18 and 2, 54 UFC/gloves. In all total coliformes analysis, the bacterian growth was ever < 10 UFC/g, < 10 UFC/bottle, < 10 UFC/cm 2 and < 10 UFC/gloves.

Although natural fibres exhibit admirable physical and mechanical properties, it varies with the plant source, species, geography, and so forth. <b>Pineapple</b> leave <b>fibre</b> (PALF) {{is one of the}} abundantly available wastes materials of Malaysia and has not been studied yet as it is required. A detailed study of chemical, physical, and mechanical properties will bring out logical and reasonable utilization of PALF for various applications.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Nowadays, <b>pineapple</b> leaf <b>fibre</b> (PALF) {{is getting}} more {{attention}} in research area since it’s showed the enhanced properties to be utilized in few industries. From the previous studies, it has been proved that, PALF is mechanically sound as a composites reinforcement agent and it’s showed the good contribution in pulp and papermaking production. Due to its enhanced properties, PALF now is commercialized as an alternative textile fiber. PALF is silky, fine and textile grade.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{natural fiber}} {{reinforced}} composites have received increasing attention {{in light of}} the growing environmental awareness. The use of natural fibers as reinforcement in polymeric composites for technical application has been a research subject of scientist. Among several natural fibers, <b>Pineapple</b> leaf <b>fibre</b> (PALF) is one that has good potential as reinforcement in polymer composite. PALF was extracted from raw pineapple leaf; it was then chemically treated and dried in hot air oven to hinder the water content. In the present work the composite specimens are prepared by using Bisphenol-A (BPA) as a matrix and the short PALF fiber with length < 15 mm and 30 % volume fraction as reinforcement. The composites were prepared by hand lay-up technique. The objective of the present work is to investigate the Tribological behavior of Short PALF reinforced Bisphenol-A composite. The composites reinforced with the fiber length of 2 mm, 4 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm & 14 mm was subjected wear test. The wear behavior of the composites was performed using pin on disc machine at varying loads of 5 N, 10 N & 15 N and at constant sliding distance, velocity and speed. The result shows that, the wear rate increases with increase in load for the composite specimen which has less interfacial bond strength. From this experimental study, it was observed that the fiber length greatly influences the wear propertie...|$|R
40|$|Clays are {{notoriously}} {{well known for}} giving rise to myriad problems and difficulties in construction due to excessive settlement and limited strength. Hence, {{there is a need}} to pretreat the soils prior to construction, such as improving the engineering properties via the stabilisation technique, before additional load can be applied on it. In soil stabilisation, cement is commonly used as a stabilizing agent, to simultaneously increase the strength and stiffness of the originally weak, soft material. However cement is relatively expensive and potentially harmful to the environment when admixed with soils. The need for alternative stabilizing agents which could reduce the use of cement is therefore apparent. In this study, natural fibres were retrieved from pineapple leaves, an agricultural waste product typical of Johor. Next pre-determined quantities of <b>pineapple</b> leaf <b>fibres</b> (PALF) were added to an artificial clay, kaolin, together with cement. The mixture was formed into specimens of 38 mm diameter and 76 mm high, cured in dry condition before being subjected to the s-wave velocity and unconfined strength measurements. A range of curing period was introduced to examine the effect of time on the performance of the stabilised specimens too. It was found that the fibres function as a form of reinforcement to the soil. Also, the test data revealed that PALF alone makes negligible contribution to the improved properties, where cement is necessary to act as a binder to strengthen the soil matrix. Nevertheless the potential of using PALF as an additive to cement in soft soil stabilisation is promising, though further work is necessary to better understand the stabilised material and its long term performance...|$|R
40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymer composites {{have many}} applications {{as a class}} of structural materials because of their ease of fabrication, relatively low cost and superior mechanical properties compared to polymer resins. <b>Pineapple</b> peel <b>fibres</b> (PAPF) have good potential as reinforcement in thermoplastic composite. It is {{the objective of the}} current research to develop a new formulation of PAPF biodegradable reinforced high density polyethylene as the material. Both HDPE and PAPF were compounded using extruder machine and then prepared for tensile test (ASTM D 638), flexural test (ASTM D 790) and impact test (ASTM D 256) by using injection moulding machine. The PAPF/HDPE composites were characterized using Melt Flow Index (MFI), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). MFI values of PAPF/HDPE composites decreased as the content of PAPF increased. SEM analysis clarified that the structure of 30 wt % PAPF/HDPE has fewer voids introduced by fibre pull out. FTIR results showed that O-H peak become broader with the increment of the fibre loading. As the PAPF loading in HDPE increased in term of wt%, the Youngâ€™s Modulus increased with fibre loading at the beginning and experienced optimum raise at 30 wt % of fibre loading. Conversely, it is found that the tensile strength declined as the fibre concentration in composite increased. It was also observed that the flexural modulus and strength of PAPF reinforced HDPE composite increased linearly with increment of fibre loadings. This trend was different for impact strength where it decreased as the fibre loading increased. The study concluded that the optimum fibre loading for the best performance of the composite is at 30 wt% fibre loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the possibility of using <b>pineapple</b> leaf <b>fibres</b> (PALFs) as an alternative source of cellulose polymer for membrane fabrication. The membranes were fabricated from dope solution containing cellulose/ N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) /polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) / N-propylgallate with a mass ratio of 8 / 88 / 3. 5 / 0. 5 by using immersion precipitation method. The permeation characteristics, structure and morphology of the membranes were investigated upon substituting the former cellulose source by the means of microfiltration rate (MFR), rejection rate (RR), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), respectively. It was found that membranes derived from PALEs exhibited higher RR of 86. 51 %, but slightly lower MER (i. e. 91. 79 mLh¯¹ m¯²mmHg¯¹) than the former membrane type under an applied pressure of 10 psi. Both of the membrane types (i. e. PALEs and hardwood) possess analogous chemical structures which have been confirmed by the existence of similar functional groups detection. Meanwhile, SEM analysis revealed that the source of cellulose had brought profound effect on the structural and morphology of resultant membranes. In general, matte and porous surfaces in a sponge-like configuration and uniform granular microporous structure were observed throughout the thickness of both membranes. The average pore size of membrane derived from PALEs exhibited to be smaller than the hardwood which in turn affected the MER and RR performances. Hence, based on the overall results, it can be concluded that PALEs as a non-wood plant can be utilized as one of the alternative sources for cellulose polymer in preparing the cellulosic microfiltration membranes...|$|R
40|$|Natural fibres play a {{significant}} role in mass industries such as automotive, construction and sports. Many researchers have found that the natural fibres are the best replacement for the synthetic fibres in terms of cost, safety, and degradability due to the shortage of landfill and ingestion of non biodegradable plastic by animals. This study mainly revolved around <b>pineapple</b> leaf <b>fibre</b> (PALF) which is available in abundance in tropical countries and for its excellent mechanical properties. The composite fabricated in this study is highly compostable as both fibre and matrix is from natural based material. The matrix used which is polylactic acid (PLA) is made from corn starch, which gives the upper hand as both materials are renewable resources are easier to degrade by bacteria or enzyme. The PALF is treated with different alkaline percentage to remove excessive moisture in the fibre for better interfacial bonding with PLA. Thereafter the PALF is washed with distilled water several times before placing in vacuum oven. The dried PALF were later mixed with PLA through extrusion using fibre in percentage of 30 by weight for better bonding and afterwards the products of the mixture were pelletized using pelletizer. The pellets were placed in the specimen sized mould for hot compression and subsequently were cold pressed. The specimens were tested for tensile and flexure strength and the result was remarkable where a fluctuating graph can be seen for both tensile and flexure strength where 5 % alkaline treatment showed the highest tensile and flexure strength among the alkaline solution. It can be concluded that the alkaline concentration affects the strength of the composite and the 5 % NaOH solution is the best percentage of alkaline treatment for PALF...|$|R

The synergized effect of this natural fibre and thermoplastic polymer in composite include low cost, low density, acceptable specific properties, ease of separation, enhanced energy recovery, biodegradability, reduce wear on processing machinery and reduced health hazard. In this research, short <b>pineapple</b> leaf <b>fibre</b> (PALF) reinforced polypropylene (PP) composite was studied. The main objective was to achieve the optimum PALF loading in PP matrix towards better mechanical properties. PALF was prepared from raw pineapple leaf. It was then chemically treated to hinder the water content. Both PP and PALF were compounded using two-roll mill machine prior to compression via hot press machine to form a sheet. After forming the composite sheet, samples were prepared for tensile test (ASTM D 638), flexural test (ASTM D 790) and impact test (ASTM D 256). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the miscibility between the fibre and the matrix. It was found that the Youngâ€™s modulus increased slowly and curved down after 30 wt% of PALF. Meanwhile, the composite tensile strength as well as the elongation at break reduced. However, flexural modulus and strength increased linearly with increment of fibre loadings. This trend was similar for impact strength where it exhibited a slight reduction at the initial stage but increased later on as the fibre loading increased. The study has demonstrated that the optimum fibre loading for peak performance was at 30 wt% of PALF. This was clarified further by SEM where fibres and matrix have shown better miscibility at 30 wt% of PALF...|$|R
