2500|$|Rivastigmine (sold {{under the}} trade name Exelon) is a <b>parasympathomimetic</b> or {{cholinergic}} {{agent for the}} treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type and dementia due to Parkinson's disease. The drug can be administered orally or via a transdermal patch; the latter form reduces the prevalence of side effects, which typically include nausea and vomiting.|$|E
2500|$|Nicotine is {{a potent}} <b>parasympathomimetic</b> {{stimulant}} and an alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants. Nicotine acts as an agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10) where it acts as a receptor antagonist. Nicotine {{is found in the}} leaves of Nicotiana rustica, in amounts of 2–14%; [...] in the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum; in Duboisia hopwoodii; and in Asclepias syriaca.|$|E
2500|$|Saliva {{substitutes}} {{can improve}} xerostomia, but {{tend not to}} improve the other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction. Parasympathomimitic drugs (saliva stimulants) such as pilocarpine may improve xerostomia symptoms and other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction, but the evidence for treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia is limited. Both stimulants and substitutes relieve symptoms to some extent. [...] Salivary stimulants are probably only useful in people with some remaining detectable salivary function. A systematic review of the treatment of dry mouth found no strong {{evidence to suggest that}} a specific topical therapy is effective. The review reported limited evidence that oxygenated glycerol triester spray was more effective than electrolyte sprays. Sugar free chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no strong evidence that it improves symptoms. There is a suggestion that intraoral devices and integrated mouthcare systems may be effective in reducing symptoms, but {{there was a lack of}} strong evidence. A systematic review of the management of radiotherapy induced xerostomia with <b>parasympathomimetic</b> drugs found that there was limited evidence to support the use of pilocarpine in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. It was suggested that, barring any contraindications, a trial of the drug be offered in the above group (at a dose of five mg three times per day to minimize side effects). Improvements can take up to twelve weeks. However, pilocarpine is not always successful in improving xerostomia symptoms. The review also concluded that there was little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetics in this group.|$|E

50|$|L-Alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine (alpha-GPC, choline alfoscerate) is {{a natural}} choline {{compound}} found in the brain. It is also a <b>parasympathomimetic</b> acetylcholine precursor which may have potential {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of the endocannabinoid is enhanced in normal, but not in endothelium-denuded rat aorta on reacting with carbachol, an <b>parasympathomimetic</b> drug. It potently reduces blood pressure in rats and may represent an endothelium-derived hypotension factor.|$|E
50|$|Use of carbachol, {{as well as}} {{all other}} muscarinic {{receptor}} agonists, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, coronary insufficiency, gastroduodenal ulcers, and incontinence. The <b>parasympathomimetic</b> action of this drug will exacerbate the symptoms of these disorders.|$|E

5000|$|A {{substance}} (or ligand) is cholinergic if it {{is capable}} of producing, altering, or releasing acetylcholine ("indirect-acting") or mimicking its behaviour at {{one or more of the}} body's acetylcholine receptor types ("direct-acting").

50|$|Pilocarpus is a genus {{of about}} 13 {{species of plants}} {{belonging}} to the family Rutaceae, native to the neotropics of South America. Various species are important pharmacologically {{as a source of}} the <b>parasympathomimetic</b> alkaloid Pilocarpine. Many of the species have the common name jaborandi.|$|E
50|$|Bethanechol is a <b>parasympathomimetic</b> choline {{carbamate}} that selectively stimulates muscarinic receptors {{without any}} effect on nicotinic receptors. Unlike acetylcholine, bethanechol is not hydrolyzed by cholinesterase and will therefore have a long duration of action. Bethanechol is sold under the brand names Duvoid (Roberts), Myotonachol (Glenwood), Urecholine (Merck Frosst) and Urocarb (Hamilton).|$|E
50|$|Tacrine is a {{centrally}} acting anticholinesterase {{and indirect}} cholinergic agonist (<b>parasympathomimetic).</b> It {{was the first}} centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor approved {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease, and was marketed under the trade name Cognex. Tacrine was first synthesised by Adrien Albert at the University of Sydney. It also acts as a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|Diisopropyl fluorophosphate is a <b>parasympathomimetic</b> drug {{irreversible}} anti-cholinesterase and {{has been}} used in ophthalmology as a miotic agent in treatment of chronic glaucoma, as a miotic in veterinary medicine, and as an experimental agent in neuroscience because of its acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties and ability to induce delayed peripheral neuropathy. It is known as fluostigmine and Dyflos in such uses.|$|E
5000|$|Rivastigmine (sold {{under the}} trade name Exelon) is a <b>parasympathomimetic</b> or {{cholinergic}} {{agent for the}} treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type and dementia due to Parkinson's disease.

50|$|A <b>parasympathomimetic</b> drug, {{sometimes}} called a cholinomimetic drug, is {{a substance that}} stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS). These chemicals are also called cholinergic drugs because acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter used by the PSNS. Chemicals in this family can act either directly by stimulating the nicotinic or muscarinic receptors (thus mimicking acetylcholine), or indirectly by inhibiting cholinesterase, promoting acetylcholine release, or other mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parasympathomimetic</b> drugs act on {{parasympathetic}} muscarinic receptors {{to induce}} an increased saliva flow. The M3 receptor {{has been identified}} as the principal target to increase salivary flow rates. Pilocarpine is an example; the maximum dose of this drug is 30 mg/day. Contraindications include many lung conditions, such as asthma, cardiac problems, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease; side effects include flushing, increased urination, increase perspiration, and GI disturbances.|$|E
