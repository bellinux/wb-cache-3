40|$|In an uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter study, 711 outpatients {{with either}} {{cervical}} pain (n = 200) or low-back pain (n = 511) received 450 mg/d of <b>proglumetacin,</b> a pro-drug of indomethacin. After 7 days of treatment, a highly {{significant reduction in}} pain and an improvement in function were observed in both groups of patients (P < 0. 001). The incidence of side effects (10. 5 %), mainly gastrointestinal (8. 7 %), was low, especially compared with that associated with indomethacin. Approximately half (47 %) of the patients who developed side effects were able to continue <b>proglumetacin</b> treatment; only 2 % of all patients in the study had to discontinue the treatment. Thus <b>proglumetacin</b> {{appears to be a}} good alternative to indomethacin as a drug of choice for treating patients with cervical and low-back pain...|$|E
40|$|In a randomized, parallel-group study, 44 {{young adults}} with acute ankle sprains {{were treated with}} <b>proglumetacin</b> or diclofenac. The {{patients}} were examined daily for pain, swelling, and impaired mobility during the 7 -day treatment period. The needed duration of physical therapy {{and the length of}} the break from sports activities were determined after the patients completely recovered. The clinical results showed that proglumetacin's efficacy was significantly greater and faster than that of diclofenac, especially on pain and swelling. Fewer gastric complaints were reported with <b>proglumetacin</b> than with diclofenac. Â© 1993 Excerpta Medica, Inc. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In an uncontrolled, open trial, 182 outpatients {{suffering}} from either overuse syndromes (n = 68) or minor traumas (n = 114) resulting from soccer practice received <b>proglumetacin,</b> a prodrug of indomethacin, for 10 days, at {{a dose of}} 600 mg/d from day 1 to day 5 and 450 mg/d from day 6 to day 10. After 2 days and at 5 and 10 days, a highly significant reduction in symptoms (pain, edema, redness, and local heat) and improvement of function were observed (P < 0. 001). The incidence of side effects (11. 5 %) - mainly gastrointestinal (9. 3 %) - was low, especially compared with that usually described for indomethacin. More than 50 % of the patients who developed side effects were able to continue taking <b>proglumetacin</b> without any specific treatment for the adverse reactions. Seven patients (ie, 3. 8 % of all patients in the study) had to discontinue the treatment. For the treatment of sport injuries (both overuse syndromes and minor traumas) due to soccer practice, <b>proglumetacin</b> {{appears to be a}} safe, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compound that is associated with a reduction in pain, edema, redness, and local heat, and improvement in function in treated patients.

40|$|AbstractLipoxin A (LXA) {{is a novel}} eicosanoid, {{generated}} by the interactions of lipoxygenases, which {{has a variety of}} biological actions. When added to human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, LXA stimulated thromboxane formation which was monitored as TxB 2 by radioimmunoassay. The compound augmented the formation of TxA 2 stimulated by the ionophore of divalent cations (A 23187). Formation of thromboxane was inhibited by two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i. e. indomethacin and <b>proglumetacin).</b> Results of the present study indicate that LXA can provoke the release and transformation of endogenous arachidonic acid to thromboxane. Moreover, they suggest a relationship between lipoxin A and the formation of cyclooxygenase pathway products...|$|E
