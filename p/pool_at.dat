The spent fuel <b>pools</b> <b>at</b> Indian Point are not stored under a {{containment}} dome like the reactor, but rather they are contained within an indoor 40-foot-deep pool and submerged under 27 feet of water. Water {{is a natural}} and effective barrier to radiation. The spent fuel <b>pools</b> <b>at</b> Indian Point are set in bedrock and are constructed of concrete walls that are four to six feet wide, with a quarter-inch thick stainless steel inner liner. The pools each have multiple redundant backup cooling systems.|$|R
5|$|Despite tensions, {{the march}} was a resounding success. More {{than a quarter}} of a million people of diverse ethnicities {{attended}} the event, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting <b>pool.</b> <b>At</b> the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.|$|E

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the <b>pool.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq {{in order to better}} man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough {{at a time when he}} had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming <b>pool</b> <b>at</b> Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E

5|$|Feeling lonely, Natasha {{goes out}} {{clubbing}} and meets Ivan DeMarco (Ben Knight), an older man. Michael discovers {{the relationship and}} bans Natasha from seeing Ivan. However, Natasha continues {{to see him in}} secret and when Ivan asks her for some naked pictures, she sends him some. Natasha learns Ivan has been showing the pictures to his friends and that they are on the internet. She initially lies to Michael about who took the photos, but Michael learns the truth from Ivan. Natasha becomes desperate to win her father's favour back and she sprays the street with derogatory graffiti about herself. However, Michael discovers she was responsible for the graffiti and he disowns her. After she is taunted about her appearance, Natasha decides to get rhinoplasty and uses Michael's credit card to pay the deposit. Natasha then sells some of her father's records to raise the money and Michael decides to send her to a boarding school. He changes his mind after Natasha nearly drowns in the <b>pool</b> <b>at</b> Number 30 and their relationship begins to improve.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} {{public works projects}} in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and <b>pool</b> <b>at</b> Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt went on {{to chair}} a conference of welfare {{providers}} to military personnel {{in order to show}} that the Army understood the issues affecting its soldiers and to organise a series of smaller conferences, hosted by himself and Sir Freddie Viggers—then Adjutant-General to the Forces—to discuss welfare issues with commanding officers across the UK. In 2007, Dannatt and his wife, Pippa, visited Headley Court, an MoD rehabilitation centre for wounded personnel, where the commanding officer informed the Dannatts of his desire for a swimming pool, but accepted that it was unlikely to receive government funding. Some time later, the Dannatts were introduced to Bryn and Emma Parry by Sarah-Jane Shirreff—the wife of Sir Richard Shirreff—and the Dannatts assisted the Parrys with the formation of Help for Heroes, set up with the specific aim of funding the swimming <b>pool</b> <b>at</b> Headley Court. Dannatt initially worried that the charity's ₤2 million goal might be unattainable, but it eventually raised enough money to build both the pool and a gymnasium, which were opened in 2010. He and Pippa later assisted both Help For Heroes and SSAFA Forces Help in efforts to build houses to accommodate the families of wounded servicemen at Headley Court and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham, inspired by the difficulties faced by the family of George Cross recipient Peter Norton.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the pool, steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} <b>pool</b> <b>at</b> right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining wall at {{the end of the}} terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of the Broad Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|The Exeter Township snow emergency, {{which was}} {{declared}} on the 14th, was extended through 4 PM on the 15th. Several {{schools across the}} county were closed on the 14th, with some also closed on the 15th. Across the Lehigh Valley: In Lehigh County, The city of Allentown declared a snow emergency early on the 14th, which was then lifted at 8 PM on the 14th. The weight of snow and ice, on the 14th, brought down the dome over the swimming <b>pool</b> <b>at</b> the West End Racquet and Fitness Club in South Whitehall Township. The dome itself was destroyed. Also, the Brookside Country Club in Wescosville also reported dome damage {{as a result of}} the snow and ice. In Northampton County, an 83-year-old woman was found dead on the rear porch of her home from hypothermia. Also in Bethlehem, a pedestrian was hospitalized after a private snowplow operator backed over him while clearing the Sheetz gas station parking lot at 3201 Schoenersville Road on the 14th. County Emergency Dispatch officials reported about a dozen or so minor vehicle accidents due to the slippery conditions. The snow and ice was too much on the 15th for a dome covering a soccer field at the Iron Lakes Sports Club on Shankweiler Road in North Whitehall that it collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{into the}} wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop {{down onto the}} sands at low tide, the path follows {{the line of the}} sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for {{explosives}} manufacture for many years, the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to {{the west side of the}} tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew <b>Pool</b> <b>at</b> Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.|$|E
