40|$|A {{common problem}} faced by fire safety {{engineers}} {{in the field}} of evacuation analysis is the optimal <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>exits</b> within arbitrarily complex structures. This problem is usually addressed through time consuming and expensive trial-error analysis. While a solution is usually found to this problem, it is seldom optimal or even near optimal, resulting in a compromise in building performance and safety. For instance, there is no clear guidance regarding: where to place an exit in order to produce minimum evacuation times? Is it better to have two exits of X m width or one exit of 2 X m width? If two exits are required, what is the optimal relative positioning of these exits? The analysis required to address these questions grows in difficulty as the available options and hence complexity of the scenario increases. While attempting to address this issue while dealing with only two exits may be manageable, what if there were 10 exits, each of varying dimensions? How would engineers know they had found the optimal or near optimal solution? In the other hand, numerical optimisation techniques have been applied in a range of different fields such as structural analysis and {{have been shown to be}} a powerful approach for designers, saving time and costs in the pursuit of optimal solutions. Therefore, this work intends to demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to evacuation analysis to determine optimal configurational layout. Particularly, we present a methodology that combines the use of numerical optimisation techniques (and associated concepts such as: Design of Experiments and Response Surface Models) with an evacuation simulation tool.

In the other hand, numerical optimisation techniques have been applied to a range of different fields such as structural analysis. These techniques have shown to be a powerful tool for designers, saving their time and consequently reducing costs during the process. For this reason, the emphasis, throughout this study, is to develop a methodology that enables the optimisation of fire safety analysis of structural designs. In other words, the current research was primarily intended to demonstrate and develop this combination of fire engineering tools and techniques such as the Design of Experiments (DoE) and numerical optimisation techniques. For this purpose, a Computational Fire Engineering (CFE) tool combined with Numerical Optimisation Techniques and associated statistical methods (i. e., Design of Experiments (DoE) and Response Surface Models (RSM)) are used. The study is focused on evacuation modelling; nevertheless the methodology proposed here could equally be applied to CFD-based fire simulation tools. While the approach that has been developed is intended to be generally applicable, the techniques have been explored and demonstrated using the buildingEXODUS computational package. This fire engineering simulation tool is used worldwide, to improve the fire safety in building designs. This study therefore intended, besides to develop a numerical methodology to allow the efficient optimisation of fire safety aspects of structural designs, to understand how the core variables impact the evacuation efficiency. For instance, a common problem faced by fire safety engineers, in the field of evacuation analysis, is the optimal <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>exits</b> within an arbitrarily complex structure. This problem is usually addressed through time consuming and expensive trial and error. While a solution is usually found, to this problem, it is seldom the optimal solution, resulting in a compromise in building performance and safety. The methodology explored in this thesis, as applied to CFE, was initially based around a relatively small set of physical variables. This approach evolved and was subsequently expanded to include more complex behavioural, procedural and environmental parameters. The methodology has also been further developed and applied to evacuation simulation. This integrated approach is intended to help fire safety engineers and designers to develop optimal designs (i. e., safe designs) in an optimised manner. In reality, this was the motivation of this study: to introduce numerical optimisation techniques and associated concepts, well known within the operational research field, as an approach for a more efficient and systematic procedure when developing and/or improving fire safety designs. Post comparisons between the outputs obtained, using these different DoE techniques, have been also performed in order to analyze which technique is most suitable for the optimisation of structural designs. This thesis describes a number of analyses (of a variety of structural designs) that have been used to evaluate the application of optimisation techniques into the CFE context. This included the use of the buildingEXODUS simulation tool, as mentioned previously, followed by the application of a variety of optimisation techniques (both gradient and non-gradient based numerical optimisation techniques) as well as different types of DoE (such as Latin Hypercube, Central Composite Design (CCD) and also a Random approach) in order to improve the designs according to a number of different variables. These variables have initially included physical modifications to the geometry. The proposed methodological approach developed in this thesis is demonstrated on a variety of practical problems. These problems are represented by 4 case studies which vary from complexity {{to the nature of the}} variables. These case studies involved both types of problems, namely: unconstrained and constrained. The results obtained have shown to be satisfactory, i. e., global minima and local minima closest to the global minima region were found. For all the cases, a gradient-based algorithm (i. e., the Fletcher-Reeves numerical optimisation technique) and non gradient-based algorithm (i. e., the Particle Swarm Optimisation numerical optimisation technique) were used to find the optimal solution. And as mentioned before, different DoE techniques were also applied. Important issues within building fire safety design were found and discussed in this thesis. For example, it was shown that the positioning of the exits can have a stronger impact on the design evacuation time rather than the exits' widths for some scenarios. Furthermore, the level of life safety for buildings should also consider the exits' locations within enclosures. The analysis revealed that this methodology seems to be a very powerful tool for evacuation modelling analysis. This systematic methodology to efficiently optimise evacuation safety aspects of structural designs should be also extended to more complex designs, such as larger enclosures and open spaces. This methodology is also intended to be applied to problems found in the field of fire simulation, such as: the sizing and positioning of smoke extraction vents and the modelling of cable fires...|$|E

40|$|I {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} floating viscous fluid films introduced into a channel of finite length, motivated by the flow of glacial ice shelves. The dynamics are characterized by a mixture of viscous extensional stresses, transverse shear stresses and a driving buoyancy force. A theory based on a width-integrated model is developed and investigated using analytical, asymptotic and numerical methods. With fluid introduced at a constant rate, the flow is found to approach a steady state with two possible asymptotic forms depending {{on the length of}} the channel. For channel lengths less than half the width, the flow is similar to a purely extensional one-dimensional flow, characterized by concave surface profiles and being insensitive to the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the channel <b>exit</b> (or calving front). Greater lengths result in a more complex asymptotic structure in which the flow adjusts over a short distance towards a prevailing flow of universal dimensionless form. In complete contrast to the extensional regime, the prevailing flow is controlled by the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the channel <b>exit.</b> Data from a new laboratory experiment involving particle velocimetry of a floating fluid film compares well with the predicted along-channel velocity. Motivated by glaciological application, the analysis is generalized to power-law rheologies and the results used to classify the flow regimes of a selection of ice shelves. The prediction for the frontal speed is in good agreement with geophysical data, indicating that the universal profile predicted by the theory is common in nature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{cellular}} {{and molecular}} study of dorsal neural tube ablation reported here demonstrates {{a critical role}} for midline closure in hindbrain repatterning. This was revealed by {{detailed analysis of the}} transcriptional response of two genes,Pax- 3 andslug,during repair of the neural tube following ablation. The reexpression ofPax- 3 appears to rely on a single surface ectoderm/neuroepithelial contact, while this is insufficient for reexpression ofslug. In fact,slugup-regulation only occurred upon midline closure and, strikingly, corresponded to down-regulation ofPax- 3. We examined whether a candidate dorsalizing molecule,Bmp- 4,was responsible for this reciprocal regulation ofPax- 3 andslugat midline closure. However,Bmp- 4 was not reexpressed following ablation, indicating not only that it is not responsible for the observed repatterning but that it lies in regulatory pathways distinct fromPax- 3 andslug. We additionally examined the expression ofPax- 6,which, together with assessment of the pattern of cranial ganglia, roof plate morphology, and <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> branchiomotor <b>exit</b> points, demonstrates that neural crest regeneration is accompanied by reestablishment of a normal dorsoventral pattern within the neural tube.

First, this framework provides an online test in order to establish the compound microscope arrangement as a combination of a objective lens and an ocular lens (simple eyepiece). Several simulations make use of simple parameters controlling the behavior of the compound microscope. Image focal lengths of the objective and the ocular lenses and the optical tube length may be modified in order to control the objective lateral magnification, <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exit</b> pupil and the field of view.

Multimedia simulations reproduce a direct observation and online tests check the geometrical characteristics of the compound microscope. Additionally, by using the intermediate image we apply the reticule basis. Some examples are employed to measure an object lateral size. Finally, the tutorial system allows determining the normal magnification of the compound microscope having a doublet as an eyepiece.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{research}} of variable magnification optical systems of sophistic class - so-called double conjugation systems. When the magnification changes, they provide two pairs of fixed conjugate planes, namely object and image, as well as entrance and exit pupils. Similar systems are used in microscopy and complex schemes, where {{it is necessary to}} conform the pupils of contiguous removable optical components. Synthesis of double conjugation systems in Gauss region is not an easy task. To ensure complete immobility <b>of</b> the <b>exit</b> pupil in the system there should be three movable components or components with variable optical power. Analysis of the literature shows that the design of double conjugation optical system in the paraxial region has been neglected, all methods are not completely universal and suitable for automation. Based on the foregoing, the research and development of a universal method for automated synthesis of double conjugation systems in Gauss region formulated as an objective of the present work seem to be a challenge. To achieve this goal a universal algorithm is used. It is {{based on the fact that}} the output coordinates of paraxial rays are multilinear functions of optical surfaces and of axial thicknesses between surfaces. It allows us to create and solve a system of multilinear equations in semi-automatic mode to achieve the chosen values of paraxial characteristics. As a basic scheme for the synthesis a five-component system has been chosen with extreme fixed components and three mobile "internal" ones. The system was considered in two extreme states of moving parts. Initial values of axial thicknesses were taken from Hopkins' patent. Optical force five components were considered unknown. For calculation the system of five equations was created, which allowed us to obtain a certain back focal length, to provide the specified focal length and a fixed <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exit</b> pupil at a fixed entrance pupil. The scheme of the algorithm is as follows. The initial thicknesses for two extreme states of the system are set, and their sum must be the same. Based on the given conditions a system of multilinear equations is generated in automatic mode. Using the numerical method all possible solutions are found. In case of failure, the air thicknesses are changed to a predetermined value, and the algorithm repeats. After finding the solutions a kinematics of three moving parts is calculated. To do this a new system of multilinear equations is automatically generated with the axial thicknesses to be as unknowns. The conditions are the following: constant back focal length and <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exit</b> pupil, immutable sum of axial thicknesses, providing a define focal length. Next, the resulting system focal length changes at a predetermined step, and the search for solutions of the system is carried out by methods of nonlinear programming. The solution results are the axial thicknesses corresponding to the specified focal length and determining the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the moving components. The proposed algorithm is universal and, a part from the other methods, in principle can be applied to design both the systems of double conjugation with mobile components and the systems based on liquid lenses. All methods revealed while analyzing the literature have been designed only for one of abovementioned cases. The algorithm was tested using the Hopkins system of calculation as an example. As a result, two versions of double conjugation system with twentyfold magnification were calculated, optical forces and principles of motion components were determined. The developed algorithm allows us to facilitate a paraxial design of double conjugation systems with a high degree of automation. A designer, actually, has only to enter the required dimension and magnification. The main drawback of the proposed algorithm is the ambiguity in choice of the initial axial distances. The activities to eliminate it are underway. </p...|$|R

Our results show that deterioration in the financial <b>position</b> <b>of</b> firms has increased the hazard <b>of</b> export <b>exit</b> during the 2007 - 09 crisis but has no significant effect on the early 1990 s crisis. We also explore the extent to which firms in financially vulnerable industries face greater sensitivity <b>of</b> export <b>exit</b> to financial conditions. We conclude that firms in sectors with great reliance on external finance experience higher hazards <b>of</b> <b>exiting</b> the export market during the 2007 - 09 crisis...|$|R

For this purpose, CMS uses the GEANT 4 package [1], which {{takes into account the}} geometry and material of the detector and simulates the physics processes that occur as particles cross each sensitive volume: multiple scattering, energy loss, the bending of the track due to the magnetic field, and the production of secondary particles. GEANT 4 version 6. 2 was used in the present study. The output are “GEANT SimHits”, which carry information about the passage of a track through the sensitive detector volumes. In the muon system, the sensitive region is defined as an active gas volume comprising one CSC chamber, one DT cell or a RPC single gap module (double gap modules are approximated with a single active active volume, called a roll). The SimHit contains the particle type and energy, the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>exit</b> in the gas volume, as well as the energy loss in the gas. Subsystem-specific “Digitizer ” packages turn these SimHits into digita...|$|R
40|$|Experiment E 683 at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) in Batavia, Illinois, uses a modular, high-energy {{sampling}} calorimeter as {{the basis}} of the detector system. This detector provides information on the energy and <b>position</b> <b>of</b> particles that <b>exit</b> a collision <b>of</b> a photon or pion with a target proton. While exiting particles are thought to form what are described as "jets", and several E 683 projects involve working with these jets, it has not yet been demonstrated that jets indeed have been detected. The solution proposed here involves demonstrating that E 683 data has a statistically significant "jettiness" even in a data sample which has not been biased. Towards this, a data sample was selected based on criteria unrelated to the presumption of jets. Planarity and the Et Flow were chosen as measures of how oblong(jetlike) an event is. The sample was then examined for planarity and Et flow in a number of kinematic ranges and the results demonstrate that over a certain kinematic range, events in our sample are increasingly planar, as we hypothesized.
