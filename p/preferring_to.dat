50|$|Assuming {{no option}} is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> itself i.e. the {{relation}} is irreflexive, a preference relation with a loop is not transitive. For if it is, each {{option in the}} loop is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> each option, including itself. This can be illustrated for this example of a loop among A, B, and C. Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> B and B is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C, also A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C. But then, since C is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> A, also A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> A.|$|R
