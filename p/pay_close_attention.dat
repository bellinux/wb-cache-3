5|$|The ancient {{remedies}} of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and {{habeas corpus}} were originally only {{available to the}} British Crown and thus termed prerogative writs, that is, writs that could be issued at the prerogative of the sovereign.

5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> {{to the needs of}} her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E

25|$|Identity {{development}} is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are liklely to cycle {{through a number of}} identities to find one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also {{plays an important role in}} their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.|$|E

The President congratulated the pilgrims for {{successfully}} completing the journey and praised the Chinese Muslim Association as an important asset of Taiwan, saying that the association has successfully promoted the frequent contacts and exchanges between Taiwan and the Muslim worlds, and serves as the communication window for Taiwan to those nations. He said that Islam is the current fastest growing religion in the world and has a major role and contribution to mankind and civilization. The core value of Islam is {{that there is only one}} God, people should do good deeds and people should love their fellow men and citizens. He personally believes that Taiwanese Muslims must emphasize the principle of Islam that stresses peace and love in order to enable others to understand the true nature of Islam. He further added that in recent years, Taiwan has made significant progress in expanding affairs with the Muslim world, creating a win-win situation for all parties involved and also triggering more interest in Islam among Taiwanese people. Although there are only around 60,000 Taiwanese Muslims, this community has made Taiwan becomes more diverse and richer in culture. He assured to the local Muslims that the Muslim people in Taiwan will always enjoy religious freedom and that the government will <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> to any raising needs to the group. He also hoped that Taiwanese Muslims will participate in Islamic-related international affairs and play even more role in helping Taiwan solidifies itself with the Islamic nations.|$|E

[...] Measuring time can also be problematic because [...] "the slowest and most inefficient workers [...] the greatest workload." [...] Time use in assessing childcare is criticized as [...] "easily obscur gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in {{the same amount of time}} being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Men's standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns." [...] A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: [...] "It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies." [...] In general, measurement of time causes [...] "some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [...] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged."

500|$|The {{conformation}} of the Clydesdale {{has changed}} greatly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 1930s, {{it was a}} compact horse smaller than the Shire, Percheron, and Belgian.

Today, the Clydesdale stands [...] high and weighs [...] Some mature males are larger, standing taller than 18 hands and weighing up to [...] The breed has a straight or slightly [...] facial profile, broad forehead and wide muzzle.

Clydesdales have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema, a disease with clinical signs that include progressive swelling, hyperkeratosis, and fibrosis of distal limbs that is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans. Another health concern is a skin condition on the lower leg where feathering is heavy. Colloquially called [...] "Clyde's itch", it's thought to be caused by a type of mange.

John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal.

500|$|That December, {{at their}} annual meeting at Lord's Cricket Ground, the captains of the {{first-class}} counties discussed {{the problem of}} throwing. MacLaren asked those present at the meeting to give their opinion of Mold's bowling. According to MacLaren, they [...] "replied to a man that they considered that Mold was not always fair". Reports in the press stated that they voted {{by a majority of}} eleven to one that Mold's action was unfair, and that along with other bowlers whose actions were suspected, he should not bowl in the coming season. The captains further recommended that bowlers with illegal actions should be banned, suspended or warned depending on the severity of their transgression. The meeting proved controversial, and disputes arose over how many captains had supported the decision. MacLaren claimed that he was the only captain to support Mold. Despite the verdict of the meeting, Lancashire's committee remained of the opinion that Mold bowled legally; the Lancashire president A. N. Hornby and several of Mold's team-mates also publicly backed the bowler. Opinions among other players and in the press varied as to the fairness of Mold's bowling, but sympathy was expressed for the damage to Mold's career and reputation, while Pelham Warner suggested that it was unfair to ban Mold completely. Some critics believed that the captains should not have passed judgement at all. The MCC, responsible for the laws of cricket and the organisation of the English game, were asked to adjudicate by several county committees. Reluctant to let the decision stand, the MCC overruled the captains, preferring to leave the matter to individual umpires. However, the umpires were instructed to <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> to suspect bowlers during the coming season.|$|E
