40|$|Forest {{composition}} is a faithful {{indicator of the}} stressors and disturbances that influence forest ecosystems, {{and it should be}} accounted for in Sustainable Forest Management policies. Indeed, the classification of forest ecosystems in forest types is considered as a key tool to improve the assessment and monitoring of forest biological diversity, and for the definition of management guidelines. Accordingly, the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe has recognized the need of developing a pan-European forest classification in forest types, and has identified indicators of Sustainable Forest Management that should be applied by forest types. The classification of vegetation has always been among the main aims of the <b>plant</b> <b>sociology.</b> The quantitative and qualitative analysis of plant species composition, performed through the plant sociological approach, condenses compositional and structural information within a hierarchical system, and expresses all historical, sociological and habitat factors that influence the actual and potential vegetation. In a modern perspective the integration of <b>plant</b> <b>sociology</b> and ecological analysis represents a key to a hierarchical land classification and to the understanding of vegetation dynamics; furthermore the long history of <b>plant</b> <b>sociology</b> determined the availability of large datasets of vegetation data throughout Europe.

40|$|Das Verhältnis von Standort und Vegetation Wie sollte man das Verhältnis von Standort und Vegetation beschreiben? Viele Autoren bezeichnen den Standort als die „Gesamtheit der an einem bestimmten Ort auf die Vegetation wirkenden Einflüsse“ (u. a. GLAVAC 1996).

The paper {{discusses}} {{different ways}} to describe the relationship between site-conditions and vegetation. The methods ‘Causation‘ and ‘Hempel-Oppenheim-Scheme‘ {{do not seem to}} be sufficient, since the actual plant-cover in an area is not only determined by natural laws but is also result of a historical process and of coincidence. Moreover, plants play an active role in site-vegetation relationships. Central European <b>plant</b> <b>sociology</b> distinguishes vegetation units. Deviations found in the field can be classified as atypical and are not necessarily contradictory to the classification unit. Therefore, the validity of a classification at least partly depends on the conventions between vegetation scientists.

40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{diagnostic}} species is an important concept in <b>plant</b> <b>sociology.</b> However, since over a century ago, when the term “association” was introduced, the identification of diagnostic species {{has been among the}} most controversial topics in phytosociological practice. With the aim of promoting methodological standardization in <b>plant</b> <b>sociology,</b> this paper addresses: 1) the need to distinguish between the concepts and methods involved in the definition of syntaxa (analysing relevés, characterization, diagnosis, naming and typification), and 2) the need to support and improve existing syntaxonomical classification schemes using statistical measures of fidelity to identify diagnostic species. The phytosociological literature describes numerous different approaches to the designation of diagnostic species. Here, we examine two such approaches to determine diagnostic species using as an example the class Atriplici julaceae-Frankenietea palmeri {{within the context of a}} data set of 5092 relevés taken of coastal plant communities distributed along the Pacific rim of North America.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Pubescent oak (Quercus pubescensWilld.) and {{holm oak}} (Quercus ilex L.) are climatozonal {{species in the}} area of Zadar, where the {{communities}} formed by these two species have an ecological- protective role. The aim of this research is {{to address the problem of}} the disturbed stability of these stands and the possibility of their post-fire regeneration. Materials and Methods: Research was undertaken in burned and unburned areas of the Zadar Forest Office. This included pubescent oak coppices, scrub, thickets, maquis and garrigue. The relevés were made according to the <b>plant</b> <b>sociology</b> method (Braun-Blanquet 1964, Dierschke 1994). Pedological research involved taking composite samples of the humus-accumulative horizon. Chemical soil analyses were performed according to the standard methods. Results: The number of pubescent oak individuals was about 2. 5 times higher in burned areas compared to unburned ones. This was in contrast to holm oak, which showed poorer occurrence in burned areas in relation to unburned ones. The average number of all trees and shrubs in degraded forms of pubescent oak was 11. 567 per hectare, whereas in degraded forms of holm oak forest this number was more than twice as high and amounted to 2. 550 individuals per hectare. Conclusions: Forest fires are an important cause of soil degradation.

40|$|Although {{the forest}} systems in Italy have been {{subjected}} to the influence of human activities ever since thousands of years, some remote areas maintained a high degree of naturalness, representing an important legacy both in terms of resources and biological diversity. In recent decades, the increasing costs of silvicultural practices has led to the concentration of timber exploitation in the most easily accessible zones and, consequently, to the abandonment of several stands. As a result, the interest in woodlands driven by predominantly natural dynamics has been growing considerably. These general observations provided the starting point for the project Old-growth forests in Italian National Parks, which is promoted by the Nature Protection Directorate in collaboration with the Biodiversity, <b>Plant</b> <b>Sociology</b> and Landscape Ecology Interuniversity Research Centre of the Sapienza University of Rome. The first phase of this project was conducted between 2006 and 2009. It was aimed at gathering information on Italian forests with old-growth features, selecting those that satisfy the old-growth forest definition drawn up {{for the purposes of this}} project. The selected forests have been mapped, classified according to an old-growth scale and included in a geodatabase that stores structural and vegetation data. Although Italy does not boast forests that have never been touched or have not been disturbed for several centuries, numerous forests with old-growth features were identified and studied. The considerable variety of vegetation types that characterize these forests makes this sample an important starting point for a nationwide Old-growth Forests Network, which may become the object of important monitoring initiatives, taking into account also persistent woodlands.

In the lateglacial time the continental element in the vegetation (Artemisia) is very pronounced, {{probably due to the}} particular soil conditions in South Limburg. The zonation of FIRBAS (1949) has been applied to the South Limburg diagrams. Zone I: Tundra, a temporary amelioration of the climate (Bölling time) can be observed. Zone II: Closed pine forests present (Alleröd time). Zone III: In {{the lower part of the}} zone Pinus dominant, afterwards Belula. Zone IV: Decrease of the percentages of the herbs; Pinus dominant in the vegetation; first appearance of Corylus. Zone V: Pinus and Corylus dominant; in the lower part of the zone Ulmus and Quercus present, in the upper part also Alnus and Tilia. The development of the vegetation in the following periods of the Holocene has been interpreted with the aid of dates from the field of <b>plant</b> <b>sociology.</b> Along a valley the vegetation of the bogs itself (usually Alnion glutinosae or Alnion incanae), the vegetation on the colluvial soils (Ulmion) and the vegetation along the slopes and on the plateaus (Carpinion) were distinguished. The changes in the vegetation of these vegetation units have been followed (Fig. 3, 4 and 5). The course of the curves in the pollen diagrams has been explained by taking into account the natural succession, human influence, soil conditions, and size of the investigated bogs. Zone VI and zone VII: In the Alno-Ulmion Tilia cordata dominant. In zone VII first appearance of Fagus outside the valleys. Zone VIII: Strong influence of man in the valleys by which Tilia and Alnus decrease and Quercus and Corylus increase. Outside the valleys less influence of man resulting in a proceeding increase of Fagus. Zone IX: Regeneration of the forests in the valleys (exc. Tilia and Ulmus) : Alnus increases, Corylus decreases. Outside the valleys Fagus dominant. Between the Fagus belt and the Alno-Ulmion belt probably a Querceto-Carpinetum present. Zone X: Large-scale clearance of the forests.

40|$|In {{the realm}} of the {{doctoral}} program in technologies for sustainability and land restoration, this thesis deepens sustainable and ecological solutions for Mediterranean environment after the German tradition and the Swiss school of green roofs for biodiversity. Specific aims were to: (1) assess the effectiveness of the existing green roofs norms in supporting biodiversity; (2) review methodologies and approaches for the implementation of biodiverse green roofs but also their application for ecological design; (3) identify habitat templates in the Mediterranean ecoregion replicable on green roofs; and (4) investigate the long term vegetation development of unmanaged green roofs in order to give ecological design guidance. As regards the green roof norms assessment, the German guidelines were chosen for its traditional referential role, the Swiss norm for its peculiar biodiversity approach, the Italian one for affecting a territory with remarkably heterogeneous environmental conditions, stretching from Alpine to Mediterranean ecosystems. Even if the three regulations at comparison addressed to some extent biodiversity related matters, none of them focused on the peculiarities of different ecoregions in term of plant species selection and assemblage, growing medium composition (materials and granular size) and system build-ups (multi-layers and single-layer construction). It was concluded that at the current knowledge, an official and effective regulation for green roof design in Mediterranean ecoregion is still missing. Biodiverse green roofs, being characterised by different and contiguous microhabitats (habitat mosaics or patches) can host several species with different morphological and functional traits (Brenneisen, 2003). As regards their implementation methods and approaches, the habitat template consists in choosing suitable plant species among the one living in nature under similar conditions e. g. shallow and nutrient poor substrate and drought, while the phytosociological approach applied to green roofs considers habitat analogues not only as species pools, but also as models to group plants in specific associations. It was concluded that nature conservation approaches on green roofs offer new perspectives for urban sustainability and for ecological design. However, in order to give the “naturalistic” approach a chance to develop extensively, it is necessary to act into the education and technical spheres: sensitizing the public opinion starting from the new generations (eco-litteracy) and training professionals able to conjugate scientific knowledge (analytic phase) and design (creative phase). An Eco-designer should operate considering the local climatic conditions, the potential vegetation and the interactions with neighbouring biocenosis: he/she has to be also an ecologist in order to combine the ways of nature to the ways of man. As regards replicable habitat on green roofs in Mediterranean areas, the proposed methodology approach was based on a practical <b>plant</b> <b>sociology</b> understanding of EU Directive 92 / 43 : a recognition of Natura 2000 habitat that could be imitated on roofs in terms of characteristic species and substrates. The results lead to three groups: those linked to sandy substrates (psammophilous vegetation), to gravely-pebbly substrates (glareicolous vegetation) and to xeromorfic soils (garrigues and dry grasslands). Desirable plants establishment methods on green roofs should be based on diaspore hay- transfer and threshing from selected donor meadows, as it happens for grasslands restoration. Finally, as regards the long term vegetation development over a thirty year period, results demonstrated that the main driver of the observed functional changes on undisturbed simple-intensive green roofs in temperate climate, was a shift towards relatively more thermo-xeric conditions. In terms of plant life strategies, the competitive species sown on the roof gradually gave way to stress-tolerant and ruderal species, along with a progressive increase in species with short-distance seed dispersal strategies. It is concluded that: (a) to create resilient green roofs, spontaneous colonisation should be accepted and considered as a design factor; and (b) regional plant communities could {{serve as a model for}} seed recruitment and design...|$|E
