5000|$|Fringe {{originated}} {{as a way}} {{of preventing}} a cut piece of fabric from unraveling when a hemming was not used. Several strands <b>of</b> <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> would be removed, and the remaining warp threads would be twisted or braided together to prevent unraveling. In modern fabrics, fringe is more commonly made separately and sewn on. Modern [...] "add-on" [...] fringe may consist of wool, silk, linen, or narrow strips of leather. The use of fringe is ancient, and early fringes were generally made of unspun wool (rather than spun or twisted threads).|$|R

50|$|Cutting was {{one part}} of the process. The yarn was sized and the cloth was woven—there would be a high number <b>of</b> <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> to warp. The ridges were {{manually}} cut, and the cloth sent to be finished. It was scoured to remove the size, and brushed to raise the nap. This was then singed over a gas flame, then bleached and or dyed. It was brushed again. It was now stentered to pull it out to the standard width. The cloth was woven at 31 or 32 inches and during processing has shrunk to 27 inches. Stentering would stabilise the width to 28 inches. The back of the cloth would now be filled to give it stiffness. This could be with a glue based mixture that could be formed from boiled bones. Each manufacturer had their own techniques. The cloth was now ready to be taken to the warehouse to be sold.|$|R
50|$|When weaving on a loom, {{the beads}} {{are locked in}} between the warp <b>threads</b> by the <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> The most common bead weaving {{technique}} requires two passes <b>of</b> the <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b> First, an entire row of beads is strung on the <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b> Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads. The needle is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular {{near the beginning of}} the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.|$|R
5000|$|Selvages of fabrics {{formed on}} weaving {{machines}} with shuttles, such as hand looms, are {{formed by the}} weft turning {{at the end of}} each pick (pass <b>of</b> the <b>weft</b> <b>thread)</b> or every second pick. To prevent fraying, various selvage motions (or [...] "styles") are used to bind the warp into the body of the cloth. Selvages are created to protect the fabric during weaving and subsequent processing (i.e. burnishing, dyeing and washing) but ideally should not detract from the finished cloth via ripples, contractions or waviness.|$|R

5000|$|Charmeuse (...) is a {{lightweight}} fabric woven with a satin weave, {{in which the}} warp threads cross over four or more <b>of</b> the backing (<b>weft)</b> <b>threads.</b> These float threads give {{the front of the}} fabric a smooth finish—lustrous and reflective—whereas the back has a dull finish.

40|$|In 2006 {{myself and}} the painter R. A. Webb {{redesigned}} the Hythe to Southampton Pier and Ferry ten-journey ticket, to bring small messages from other passengers to the punch hole spaces; short phrases and poems that capture glimpses, thoughts or feelings from a commuter community taking an everyday journey to work. The Hythe Pier train shuttles commuters {{back and forth between}} land and water. It contains the passengers’ journey with the narrow 363 meter stretch of planks and metal ballasts which lead them to board the ferry at the far end. In the position of this long walkway and pier train track {{at each end of the}} journey, a parallel can be found with a selvedge – the process which forms a firm configuration <b>of</b> warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> at the extreme lateral edges of the cloth, in order to contain the fabric and stop it fraying. So too, the edge of the ticket is intensified by the punch holes spaces, and by passengers’ quotes which carry meaning through the inter-related composition and correspondence of each phrase.

25|$|Yarns {{from these}} fibers are woven into {{a variety of}} {{different}} weaves, the most notable of which include broadcloth, with double the number <b>of</b> warp to <b>weft</b> <b>threads,</b> giving a smooth, formal shirting; twill, where the tucks <b>of</b> the <b>weft</b> do not line up, giving a diagonal pattern, a weave used for most country checked (e.g. Tattersall) shirtings; poplin, with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and Oxford weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including end-on-end patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including voile and batiste, which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{of making a}} soumak involves wrapping wefts over {{a certain number of}} warps (usually 4) before drawing them back under the last two warps. The process is repeated from selvedge to selvedge. The wefts are discontinuous; the weaver selects coloured threads in turn, and wraps each within the area which is to have that particular colour. Unlike kilim, the back is left ragged, with all the loose ends <b>of</b> the differently-coloured <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> visible, sometimes several inches long, providing extra thickness and warmth. Also unlike kilim, there are no slits where colours meet, as there is a supplementary or structural weft which supports the coloured pattern weft. Some late Soumaks made by the Kurds are however [...] "weftless", lacking the structural weft support, and the stitches naturally overlap.|$|R
50|$|An extra set of threads are {{woven into}} the weft between two regular <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> to create an {{ornamental}} pattern {{in addition to the}} ground weave.

40|$|A {{small but}} {{fascinating}} Chancay gauze fragment {{in the collection}} of the Michael C. Carlos Museum stands out as an exemplary object that embodies the symbolic associations and aesthetic principles of the Peruvian coastline during the Late Intermediate Period (Fig. 1). Its weave structure, production process, iconography, and polychromy unite in reinforcing the protective and regenerative purposes of the original headdress. Consisting of variably spun threads knotted together, its unique discontinuous warp relates to its function in funerary and ceremonial contexts. Significantly, its weaver pushed beyond technical limitations to bring together the laborious techniques of gauze weaving and discontinuous warping in a single textile. The result of this ingenious yet unpublished technical combination was a “jumping” serpentine figure on an indigo background. The allusion to serpent movement, enabled by the use of a discontinuous warp made whole through the tying of tiny knots, recalls both the corporeal process of the cloth’s creation as well as the physical exertion of snakes. Moreover, the cloth’s overall polychrome patterning evokes the vivid dorsal patterning of snakes that have just shed their skin and emerged headfirst into the environment as regenerated beings. Although no other published gauze headdresses have been recognized as having discontinuous warps, and very few are polychromatic, the Carlos Museum gauze nevertheless shares many features with other Chancay gauzes. Commonalities include the organic abstract patterning created by complex gauze weaves, serpentine iconography, elasticity due to slightly over-spun threads, and the wearing of gauzes on the head in transformative ritual contexts. Moreover, the forceful repetitive motions exerted by the weaver during production may also be considered as contributing to the reception of the textile, as process and product are interconnected in Andean worldview. These combined attributes support the interpretation that many other gauze headcloths were meant to evoke the powerful properties of serpents. Gauze weaving requires a special technique, in which the weaver forces some warp threads to cross over or under other warp threads. These gauze crosses are held in place by the insertion <b>of</b> <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> This method <b>of</b> warp-crossing, contrasts with standard back-strap weaving, where the warp threads do not interact with each other but remain in a fixed position. Different types of gauze weave are classified by the various interactions of the warp threads. The simplest structure is that of plain gauze weave, in which the same warp threads pass over or under each other. More complex gauze weaves are created when variation is introduced into the interworking of warps and interlacing <b>of</b> <b>wefts.</b> In Textiles <b>of</b> Ancient Peru and Their Techniques, Raoul d’Harcourt illustrates how several complex openwork gauzes may be created through the omission of the crossing of certain warp threads. These types of gauzes are effective in conveying a sense of movement through their undulating serpentine patterns. The organic shapes created in gauze openwork, often simply labeled “ovular” or “gourd-shaped,” appear to mimic the scale patterning on snakes, a subject to which I will later return...|$|R
