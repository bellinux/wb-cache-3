40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the physical changes of wax apple fruits, symptoms of chilling injury and induced ethylene synthetic rate after exposing to low temperature. Result indicated chilling injury occurred when wax apple were stored below 10 ℃. Visible symptoms of chilling injury included surface pitting, color-fading, water soaking of <b>pulp,</b> <b>mold</b> infection and decay of fruit. The respiration and ethylene production rates of wax apple fruit stored below 5 ℃ were very low but rose and fell abruptly again after transferring to an environment of 25 ℃. Ethylene production reached a peak and maintained the highest value for 8 hrs at 25 ℃. The large amount of ethylene produced under the chilling condition was a result of stress which led to the biosynthesis of ACC synthase and EFE after fruits were transferred to room temperature (25 ℃). 本試驗調查蓮霧果實採收後低溫逆境所引起寒害，造成果實外觀的變化及誘發乙烯生合成。結果顯示，蓮霧果實貯藏在低於 10 ℃以下的溫度即會發生寒害，其寒害徵狀首先在果實表面形成許多凹陷小病斑、果皮顏色變淡、果肉呈水浸狀、嚴重者果實發霉腐爛。於 5 ℃下貯藏，其呼吸率及乙烯釋放率都非常低，但隨果實移至室溫(25 ℃) 時間的延長，二者皆上升，之後再下降。於回溫 8 小時，乙烯釋放率達到高峰；而呼吸率則無明顯呼吸高峰產生。寒害果實在回溫後所產生的大量乙烯屬於逆境。乙烯大量產生是因低溫誘發果實在回溫後ACC synthase及EFE，而促進ACC合成，進而使乙烯大量生成...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{the decline}} of the world's forest resources, non-wood fiber sources are {{becoming}} increasingly important as raw materials in fiber-based industries, One source of such non-wood fiber is S. alterniflora (Common Cordgrass) and related species, which are large-sized grasses, about 1 - 1. 5 m tall, with leaves 20 - 60 cm in length). These grasses have invaded many coastal areas in China and can result in huge economic losses. Studies have shown that the fiber composition of S. alterniflora is: cellulose 35. 9 %, hemicellulose 34. 2 %, lignin 15. 9 %, ash 2. 98 %. The length of S. alterniflora fibers, which are shorter and narrower than bamboo fibers, makes it difficult to utilize S. alterniflora in chemical pulps. However, thermomechanical pulping of S. alterniflora stems can be used to prepare pulps which can then be suitably mixed with chemical pulps and used to manufacture a variety of <b>molded</b> <b>pulp</b> products The raw material for the <b>pulp</b> <b>molding</b> products is used S. alterniflora pulp mixing with other chemical pulp like bamboo pulp, off-cuts from the paper making factory, printing factory, corrugated factory and other paper product factories. The <b>pulp</b> <b>molding</b> products can be collected and reused again, which could control the rapid spread invasive species of S. alterniflora effectively.

40|$|Packaging is {{designed}} to protect products from shock and vibration during transport. In recent years, paper cushioning materials, such as corrugated board and <b>pulp</b> <b>molded</b> packaging, are being increasingly used because they are environmentally friendly and easy to recycle. However, because no efficient packaging-design method yet exists for paper cushioning material, packaging engineers must rely on previous experience and the so-called trial-and-error method to design packaging. One reason for this situation is that, for most cases, the paper cushioning material used for protective packaging has a complicated structure and deforms after being subjected to repetitive shock and vibration. To address this shortcoming, we propose a damping design method for corrugated-board packaging that includes shock-absorbing and vibration damping elements. To verify that the resultant packaging functions as intended, we test three types of packaging in the following way: First, we use an existing design method to create cushioned packages and examine them via free-fall drop tests. Next, to test the robustness of packaging against vibration (i. e., for packaging destined for various modes of transport), we study the three packaging types by subjecting them to (i) vibration-only tests and (ii) drop-plus-vibration tests. For vibration-only tests, the packaging with highest static stress gives the best result, its “vibration fatigue” accounts for approximately 52 % of the worst result given by packaging with the lowest static stress. In the drop-plus-vibration tests, the best packaging is that with the lowest static stress; its “vibration fatigue” is approximately 31 % of the worst packaging, which has an intermediate value of static stress. This approach allows us to determine the packaging with the best shock-absorbing and vibration damping characteristics...|$|R
