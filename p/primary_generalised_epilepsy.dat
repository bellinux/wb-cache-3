40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} levetiracetam in cases of refractory <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Methods: Three patients with refractory <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> were treated with levetiracetam monotherapy; one with absence seizures, myoclonic jerks and generalised tonic–clonic (GTC) seizures one with myoclonic jerks and GTC seizures, and one with only GTC seizures. All three patients had generalised spike wave on the EEG and had failed at least three antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) before trying levetiracetam. Results: All three patients tolerated levetiracetam well and became seizure free for at least 6 months. Therapeutic doses of levetiracetam ranged from 1250 to 3000 mg/day. Conclusion: Levetiracetam, a new AED with a novel mechanism(s) of action, should be considered for patients with refractory <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{prospective}} {{observational study}} explored the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam (LEV) in a prospective series of 200 patients with refractory epilepsy attending a single epilepsy service. Patients were started on adjunctive LEV {{using one of}} two titration schedules (slow and fast) and patients were studied for at least 6 months after commencing LEV. Fifty-three patients had severe learning disabilities. 14. 3 % became seizure free, 57. 7 % showed > 50 % reduction, 15. 4 % showed seizure increase. Patients with learning disability showed less positive but still very worthwhile results. A highly significant improvement in clinical outcomes overall is shown (P< 0. 0001). 56. 6 % showed no adverse effects, 27. 4 % showed minor adverse effects, 16 % were withdrawn. The most common adverse effect causing drug withdrawal was seizure exacerbation (12 %) which was much commoner in <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (P= 0. 00035).

25|$|These studies {{suggested}} that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies {{have investigated the}} effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant {{in the treatment of}} human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These {{and a variety of other}} results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against <b>generalised</b> absence <b>epilepsy</b> and other <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> syndromes, including <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> tonic–clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Electrophysiological {{data suggest}} that an {{abnormal}} oscillatory pattern of discharge in cortical and thalamic neurons may be the major mechanism underlying <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> No neurochemical or anatomical substrate for this theory has hitherto been demonstrated in humans and the pathophysiology of <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> remains unknown. By means of PET and the benzodiazepine (BZ) ligand [11 C]flumazenil it has been previously shown that the BZ receptor density is reduced in the epileptic foci of patients with partial epilepsy. In the present study the method was further developed and used in a comparative analysis of cortical, cerebellar, and subcortical BZ receptor binding in patients with primary generalised tonic and clonic seizures (n = 8), and healthy controls (n = 8). Patients with generalised seizures had an increased BZ receptor density in the cerebellar nuclei (p = 0. 006) and decreased density in the thalamus (p = 0. 003). No significant changes were seen in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex or in the basal ganglia. The observed alterations suggest that the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) -BZ system may be affected in the cerebello-thalamocortical loop of patients with generalised epilepsy and indicate possible targets for selective pharmacological treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} {{patients}} with myoclonus is described whose jerks are preceded by a bilaterally synchronous, frontocentrally predominant, negative cerebral potential in the EEG.

40|$|The {{effects of}} large doses of -phenylalanine and of {{aspartame}} on seizure susceptibility and severity have been assessed in baboons Papio papio from Senegal which show photosensitive epileptic responses similar to <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in man. -Phenylalanine, 50, 150 or 450 mg/kg, or aspartame, 300 or 1000 mg/kg, were administered orally.

40|$|Photosensitivity is {{the most}} common mode of seizure precipitation. It is age-related, more {{frequent}} in females, and most often found in <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies.</b> Little is known about its relation to individual epileptic syndromes. This study on 1062 epileptic patients who had 4007 split screen video EEG investigations revealed that the relation to <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> is even more close than generally believed. Versive seizures with visual hallucinations was the only focal seizure type related to photosensitivity. Of the syndromes of <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> only childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with grand mal on awakening were related to photosensitivity. The closest correlation was with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. This is confirmed by a relation to the poly-spike wave pattern, and by an increase of myoclonic seizures by intermittent light stimuli. No relation was found with early childhood syndromes of <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> or <b>generalised</b> tonic-clonic seizures in the evening, or, most remarkably, with juvenile absence <b>epilepsy.</b> In <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> with onset around puberty, photosensitivity could thus act as a pathoplastic factor.

40|$|Antiepileptic drug (AED) {{treatment}} {{is the first}} line strategy for seizure control {{in the majority of}} individuals with epilepsy but remains challenging, not least because of interindividual variability in efficacy, tolerability and dosing. The studies presented in this thesis set out to explore that variability from a genomic perspective in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy from across the UK. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding drug metabolising enzymes (DMEs) may be associated with the dose of carbamazepine (CBZ) required for seizure control. A cohort of 159 individuals who were seizure-free for 12 months on a stable dose of CBZ monotherapy was genotyped for 51 SNPs across six DMEs. Haplotype analysis identified 8 haplotype blocks across the genes. No single SNPs or haplotype blocks were associated with CBZ dose. Thus, it is unlikely that genetic variability in DMEs accounts for the individual differences in CBZ dose requirement. A splice site SNP (rs 3812718) in the SCN 1 A gene was previously shown to influence maximum doses of AEDs. This SNP was genotyped in 817 patients and tested for association with maximum and maintenance doses of several AEDs. An association was identified between rs 3812718 and maximum AED dose, with an interaction analysis suggestive of a drug specific effect. These findings suggest that this SCN 1 A variant contributes to variability in the limit of tolerability to AEDs. Response to AED {{treatment is}} multifactorial and likely to be influenced by multiple genes. Five SNPs previously reported to predict treatment outcome in epilepsy were genotyped in 772 patients and the resulting data, together with data from an Australian cohort, incorporated into a predictive algorithm. The algorithm failed to predict treatment outcome in general but was partially successful in identifying responders to CBZ and valproate. These five SNPs may be relevant to the prognosis of epilepsy, particularly when treated with specific AEDs. <b>Primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (PGEs) are highly heritable and believed to be polygenic in origin. Predictive algorithms were employed to explore genetic influences on seizure (absence vs. myoclonus) and epilepsy (PGE vs. focal) type using 1, 840 SNP genotypes available from 436 patients with PGE. Although the algorithms failed to distinguish PGE patients on the basis of genetic variants, they showed improved association over univariate methods of analysis. Such an approach may be suitable for future investigations using large genomic datasets. A recent genome-wide association study identified multiple genetic variants that approached genome-wide significance for association with 12 month remission from seizures. Five of these SNPs were genotyped in an independent cohort of 424 patients and tested for association with remission and time to remission. No significant associations were found, questioning the validity of the original observation or the method of replication. Further work is required to understand this outcome. In conclusion, the genetic bases of epilepsy, AED response and AED dose requirement are multigenic and thus far undetectable using traditional association studies in modestly-sized patient cohorts. Further advances in genomic, bioinformatics and statistical methodologies are required before the genetic contribution to heterogeneity in epilepsy-related phenotypes can be translated into improved clinical care...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{aim of this}} audit was to {{ascertain}} outcomes for people who had taken or who were still taking three “new generation” broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), namely lamotrigine, levetiracetam and topiramate. Thirteen percent of people became seizure free and approximately, one-third had a reduction of greater than 50 % in their seizures. Two-thirds of people were still taking their audit AED. In addition, approximately one-third of people with a learning disability derived substantial benefit, although the rate of seizure freedom was lower. All three AEDs were most successful at treating <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and least successful with symptomatic generalised epilepsy. With some reservations the data suggests that levetiracetam and topiramate are the most efficacious AEDs, but topiramate is the least well tolerated. These results mean consideration of a “general prescribing policy” is important when using and choosing these AEDs. We conclude that lamotrigine, levetiracetam and topiramate are useful additions to the armamentarium of AEDs...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{study the}} {{circumstances}} of death in sudden death in epilepsy.  METHODS—Self referred bereaved relatives of patients with epilepsy who had died suddenly were interviewed with information obtained substantiated through other sources—namely, coroners' officers' reports, postmortem reports, previous medical records, and EEG reports.  RESULTS—Of 34 cases, 26 were classified as sudden unexpected deaths in epilepsy (SUDEP). Twenty four of 26 cases of SUDEP were unwitnessed. Evidence indicative or suggestive of a seizure was found in most. In 11 of 26 {{the position of the}} head was such that breathing could have been compromised. Cases included both localisation related and idiopathic <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Only three were in remission at the time of death. Most relatives expressed the view that they would have preferred to have known that epilepsy could be fatal.  CONCLUSIONS—Although the deaths in question were largely unwitnessed, the available evidence suggested that most cases of SUDEP represented ictal or postictal seizure deaths, occurring in people with a history of generalised tonic clonic seizures, and in both primary generalised and localisation related epilepsy. These interviews highlight the needs of bereaved relatives and their sense of isolation {{in the face of an}} entirely unexpected and apparently unexplained loss. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients {{can sustain}} {{injuries}} during seizures and the pattern {{and type of}} injury (eg, tongue biting) can be a useful silent witness in the diagnosis of seizures. In addition, the seizure type potentially influences the type of injury. Methods: Patients with dental injury were identified from the Gloucestershire Epilepsy Database (n =  1673). These patients’ notes were reviewed and the following data collected: demographic data; seizure types and age of onset; injury; EEG; and MRI. Results: 14 people had dental injuries: 10 incisors (seven had > 1 incisor) and five other teeth. Eight had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), two other <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and four focal onset epilepsy. Compared {{with the rest of}} the database population (JME; n =  81) there was a highly significant association of dental injury with JME (p< 0. 0001). Conclusions: Incisor injury is rare but appears to be associated with JME in patients with epilepsy, presumably reflecting the pattern of seizure onset. This pattern of injury should prompt consideration of this diagnosis. It is hoped that recognition of this can both facilitate earlier diagnosis and help educate patients to protect their teeth...|$|E
30|$|More recently, Shen et al. [23] {{introduced}} a method {{based on a}} cascade of wavelet-approximate entropy for feature extraction in the epileptic EEG signal classification. They tested three existing methods for classification: support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), to determine which has the best performance in such as cascaded EEG analysis system. Acharjee and Shahnaj [24] used twelve Cohen class kernel functions to transform EEG data {{in order to facilitate}} the time frequency analysis.

In another work, Siuly and Li [26] developed a new algorithm for feature extraction considering the variability of the observations within a time window called optimum allocation approach. Then, the extracted features were assessed by various multiclass least square support vector machine (MLS-SVM), classifying epileptic EEG signals; Aslan et al.

40|$|The neuroanatomical and {{pathophysiological}} {{basis of}} primary generalised absences is uncertain. Administration of endogenous opioids {{has been shown}} to result in absence-like seizures in animal models. Positron emission tomography scans were performed in eight patients with <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and eight control subjects. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured interictally with C 15 O 2, after which a 90 minute dynamic study with the opioid-receptor ligand 11 C-diprenorphine was performed. Serial absences were precipitated by hyperventilation for 10 minutes, starting 30 - 40 minutes after injection of diprenorphine. Absences, with generalised spike-wave discharges on the EEG, occurred for between 10 % and 51 % of the provocation period. No individual (normal or patient) had any interictal focal abnormalities of cerebral blood flow. After provocation of serial absence seizures, there was increased diprenorphine elimination from the association cortex, but not from the thalamus, basal ganglia, or cerebellum, compared with control subjects and patients scanned without provocation of absences. It was possible to simulate the observed increased diprenorphine elimination following seizures in cerebral cortex using a two tissue compartment model, with an estimated 15 - 41 % decrease in the specific tracer uptake rate constant (k 3). These results suggest that endogenous opioids are released in the association cortex at the time of serial absences, lead to increased receptor occupancy, and may have {{an important role in the}} pathophysiology of generalised absences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Increased {{prevalence}} of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) {{and changes in}} serum immunoglobulin concentrations {{have been reported in}} patients with epilepsy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the presence of aCL, ANA, anti-B 2 glycoprotein I -antibodies (anti-B 2 -GPI), antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), immunoglobulin A, G and M serum concentrations and the presence of IgA and IgG class antigliadin antibodies (AGAbA and AGAbG), transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAbA) and antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) in a cohort of 1386 adult patients treated for epilepsy in the Oulu University Central Hospital during the years 1996 – 7 and in a reference population obtained from the Population Register Centre and matched for age, gender and municipality of residence. The effects of co-morbidity, medications, age, gender and different epilepsy attributes on the occurrence of the immunological parameters studied as well as the possible interrelations of these parameters were studied. There was no difference in the presence of aCL or ANA between the patients and the reference subjects. In patients, aCL were associated with long duration of epilepsy and poor seizure control. Low IgA serum concentrations were more common in patients with epilepsy, particularly those using phenytoin. Unspecific AMA were more common among the epilepsy patients. The {{prevalence of}} coeliac disease (CD) -related antibodies was similar in patients with epilepsy and in the reference population. AGAbA were associated with <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> No significant interrelations between the immunological markers were found.

40|$|Gamma {{oscillations}} (30 - 100 Hz gamma electroencephalographic (EEG) activity) {{correlate with}} high frequency synchronous rhythmic bursting in assemblies of cerebral neurons participating in aspects of consciousness. Previous studies in a kainic acid animal model of epilepsy revealed increased intensity of gamma rhythms in background EEG preceding epileptiform discharges, leading the authors {{to test for}} intensified gamma EEG in humans with epilepsy. 64 channel cortical EEG were recorded from 10 people with <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> 11 with partial epilepsy, and 20 controls during a quiescent mental state. Using standard methods of EEG analysis the strength of EEG rhythms (fast Fourier transformation) was quantified and the strengths of rhythms in the patient groups compared with with controls by unpaired t test at 1 Hz intervals from 1 Hz to 100 Hz. In patients with generalised epilepsy, there was a threefold to sevenfold increase in power of gamma EEG between 30 Hz and 100 Hz (p< 0. 01). Analysis of three unmedicated patients with primary generalised epilepsies revealed an additional 10 -fold narrow band increase of power around 35 Hz- 40 Hz (p< 0. 0001). There were no corresponding changes in patients with partial epilepsy. Increased gamma EEG is probably a marker of the underlying ion channel or neurotransmitter receptor dysfunction in primary generalised epilepsies and {{may also be a}} pathophysiological prerequisite for the development of seizures.

In this series, 30 % with idiopathic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Overall, 70 % of patients with idiopathic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> were photosensitive to intermittent photic stimulation and the mechanism of seizure provocation was probably similar to that of television induced seizures, although sensitivity to specific patterns was sometimes important. Two children had self induced video game seizures. Non-photic factors such as excitement, fatigue, sleep deprivation, cognitive processing, and diurnal variation in susceptibility seemed to be important seizure precipitants, particularly in non-photo-sensitive patients. Twenty nine per cent of patients had partial (mainly occipital) video game associated seizures. Occipital spikes were common in the EEG of these patients. Photosensitivity to intermittent photic stimulation may have been important in two patients but in the others, who all played arcade video games, other mechanisms need to be considered.

MethodsWe evaluated 35 patients (21 female, mean age 24. 7 years) with different types of <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE), myoclonic absences (MA), benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (BMEI) and 4 patients had unspecified epileptic syndromes). Patients received LEV as de novo monotherapy or add-on therapy. Seizure frequency changes and adverse events were observed. Follow-up was conducted {{for a period of}} 12 months after treatment. ResultsPatients received LEV 2000 – 3000 mg/day as de novo (n= 8) and as add-on therapy. In total, 29 (82 %) of the 35 patients achieved ≥ 50 % seizure frequency reduction, 15 (42 %) patients achieved seizure freedom while a further 14 (40 %) patients achieved ≥ 50 – 99 % seizure frequency reduction. Six (17 %) patients discontinued LEV due to inefficacy or seizure worsening. Not even a single patient discontinued due to adverse effects.

The clinical, psychometric, imaging, and electroencephalographic features of 13 adult patients with subependymal heterotopia and epilepsy have been reviewed. Age at seizure onset ranged from 18 months to 20 years (median 13 years). There were significantly more female (12) than male (1) patients (p < 0. 01). Diagnosis of subependymal heterotopia was made by MRI in 11 patients and CT in two. The heterotopic grey matter was nodular in 11 patients and diffuse in two; bilateral in eight and unilateral in five. There were significantly more patients with predominant right than left cerebral hemisphere involvement (p < 0. 01). The most commonly involved site was the occipital horn of the lateral ventricles (10 of 13 patients). Eleven patients presented with partial epilepsy, 10 of whom also had secondarily generalised seizures. The clinical description of the seizures often suggested either an occipital (four patients) or temporal (five patients) onset. Two patients presented with absence attacks without clear focal features. Patients demonstrated normal early milestones (12 of 13 patients), including normal motor development (all patients) and average or above average intelligence (10 of 13 patients). An EEG examination showed normal background activity in all but two patients, one of whom had large intracranial haematomas. Epileptiform activity was usually widespread (10 of 13 patients) and in three patients, there was generalised 3 -Hz spike and wave activity that had previously led to an erroneous diagnosis of concomitant <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Onset of epilepsy in the second decade of life, normal developmental milestones and intelligence, and the finding of an overwhelming female preponderance differentiates subependymal heterotopia from other cortical dysgeneses.

Phenytoin administration caused further decrease of cortisol and its metabolite 17 -OHCS levels and a compensation of pro-gesterone serum concentration. Investigations of the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis have been mainly con-cerned in aspects to the influence of anticonvulsants on adrenal cortex function. '- ` After long-term treatment patients have shown a decrease of serum and urinary levels of glicocorticosteroid hormones as well as a diminished adrenal cortex response to meta-pirone and dexamethasone. l 3 5 - 7 9 - 11 The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the disease itself may have an influence on adrenal cortex function apart from the effect of therapy, with one frequently used antiepileptic drug, phenytoin. Adre-nocortical hormones were determined before and during a 2 year period of anticonvulsant therapy. Material and method Forty five male patients, aged 20 - 49 years (mean age 32 4 + 8 6) admitted for the first time to the Centre for Epilepsy at Zabrze and never before treated for epilepsy, were studied. Mean age of onset was 27 4 + 11 - 3 years. In 26 patients the period between the first and the next seizure, after which the anticonvulsant therapy was introduced ranged from a few months to 1 year. In 14 other males the period was longer (about 2 - 4 years), and five cases had initial seizures in child-hood with long-term remission without treatment. In 24 patients the illness could be classified as <b>primary</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> In the remaining 21 cases with know...|$|E

We present techniques for analysing the electroencephalogram {{of patients with}} idiopathic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> having spike and wave discharges. The techniques may have clinical applications and can help to further {{our understanding of the}} physiological mechanisms involved in spike and wave discharges and absence seizures. We introduce a new model based on the hypothesis that spike and wave discharges initiate through a transition in a multistable system. The emphasis of the model is in understanding how network structure could relate to the pathology of epilepsy, which is explored with application to human electroencephalogram data. We present evidence to support the hypothesis that changes in network connectivity are a factor in the pathology of epilepsy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Background The epilepsies are a {{clinically}} heterogeneous {{group of}} neurological disorders. Despite strong evidence for heritability, genome-wide association studies {{have had little}} success in identification of risk loci associated with epilepsy, probably because of relatively small sample sizes and insufficient power. We aimed to identify risk loci through meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for all epilepsy and the two largest clinical subtypes (genetic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and focal epilepsy). Methods We combined genome-wide association data from 12 cohorts of individuals with epilepsy and controls from population-based datasets. Controls were ethnically matched with cases. We phenotyped individuals with epilepsy into categories of genetic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> focal epilepsy, or unclassified epilepsy. After standardised filtering for quality control and imputation to account for different genotyping platforms across sites, investigators at each site conducted a linear mixed-model association analysis for each dataset. Combining summary statistics, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of all epilepsy, focal <b>epilepsy,</b> and genetic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> We set the genome-wide significance threshold at p< 1 · 66  ×  10 − 8. Findings We included 8696 cases and 26   157 controls in our analysis. Meta-analysis of the all-epilepsy cohort identified loci at 2 q 24. 3 (p= 8 · 71  ×  10 − 10), implicating SCN 1 A, and at 4 p 15. 1 (p= 5 · 44  ×  10 − 9), harbouring PCDH 7, which encodes a protocadherin molecule not previously implicated in epilepsy. For the cohort of genetic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> we noted a single signal at 2 p 16. 1 (p= 9 · 99  ×  10 − 9), implicating VRK 2 or FANCL. No single nucleotide polymorphism achieved genome-wide significance for focal epilepsy. Interpretation This meta-analysis describes a new locus not previously implicated in epilepsy and provides further evidence about the genetic architecture of these disorders, with the ultimate aim of assisting in disease classification and prognosis. The data suggest that specific loci can act pleiotropically raising risk for epilepsy broadly, or can have effects limited to a specific epilepsy subtype. Future genetic analyses might benefit from both lumping (ie, grouping of epilepsy types together) or splitting (ie, analysis of specific clinical subtypes) ...|$|R
