5|$|On 3 April 1970, a B-52D {{assigned}} to the 28th Bomb Wing caught fire and crashed while landing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; sliding {{to a halt and}} burning atop a 25,000 gallon fuel storage tank. Efforts by fire department personnel saved the 9 man crew and <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> catastrophic explosion of the fuel tank.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{prompted the}} issuance of hurricane and tropical storm warnings for the Azores and the closure of schools and businesses. Alex ultimately brought gusty winds and heavy rain to the archipelago, causing generally minor damage.

5|$|A {{series of}} voiceovers called STRIKE Files outline {{the origins of}} STRIKE. One such file has the Security Czar {{detailing}} the organization's mandate to US President Bill Clinton after his inauguration in January 1993. In the tape, Clinton is unaware that STRIKE <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> civil war in Mexico in 1982 which could have turned the country into a secret Warsaw Pact member-state.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E

50|$|This {{may or may}} {{not involve}} self-defense in that, using a {{reasonable}} degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve <b>preventing</b> <b>an</b> assault, but it could be <b>preventing</b> <b>a</b> crime not involving the use of personal violence.|$|R
5|$|Angola {{agreed to}} trade oil to Slovakia {{in return for}} arms, buying six Sukhoi Su-17 attack {{aircraft}} on 3 April 2000. The Spanish government in the Canary Islands <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, and acknowledged the captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E
5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.|$|E
5|$|In June 1915, Sir George Makgill, Secretary of the Anti-German Union, {{applied for}} {{permission}} from the High Court to issue quo warranto writs against Speyer and Sir Ernest Cassel, a German-born Privy Counsellor, requiring them to prove their right to hold that position. Makgill's claim was that the Act of Settlement 1701 <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor. In December 1915, Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application {{on the grounds that}} the relevant sections of the Act of Settlement had been repealed by later legislation.|$|E
50|$|Section 5(2)(b) {{provides}} that no person may <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> employee (or a prospective employee) from exercising any right {{in terms of}} the LRA, or <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> employee from participating in any LRA proceedings. For example, where <b>an</b> employer <b>prevents</b> <b>an</b> employee from standing for election as a trade-union representative, or where he threatens a union representative with dismissal because the representative is representing a union member at a disciplinary hearing, the employer would be acting unlawfully.|$|R
50|$|In November 2003 the Queensland {{parliament}} {{passed the}} Justice and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2003. Section 41 of that Act inserted new sections 49A and 49B into the Civil Liability Act 2003. These sections <b>prevent</b> <b>a</b> court from awarding damages for a financial loss suffered in rearing a healthy child. This effectively <b>prevents</b> <b>a</b> decision awarding the same damages that were awarded in Cattanach v Melchior being awarded again in Queensland - however, the amendment does not <b>prevent</b> <b>a</b> successful Wrongful Birth claim.|$|R

5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the last}} skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce defense at Thayngen. Although the small force of {{defenders}} was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack was held up {{long enough for the}} Swiss to send troops from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their foot soldiers made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> larger battle.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield teams {{created the}} first goals with solid crossbars. Heading, throw-ins, corner kicks and {{awarding}} free kicks for fouls were also conceived in Sheffield games. One of the most enduring rules of the Sheffield game <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> goal from being scored directly from a free kick or throw in/kick in. This was present in every version of the Sheffield Rules and was later adopted within the FA rules. It was later refined by the International Football Association Board into the modern-day indirect free kick.|$|E
25|$|For major fouls (including {{throwing}} <b>a</b> {{stick to}} <b>prevent</b> <b>a</b> score, tripping, holding, cross-checking, boarding) players would sit off for five minutes, with {{no substitute for}} three minutes.

5|$|The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Toronto went five games, but is {{remarkable}} as each game required overtime to be decided. In the third game, with the series tied at one game a piece, Kennedy both saved {{the game for}} the Leafs and won it. First, he <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> goal by clearing a puck that was heading into the Toronto net, then, just fifty seconds later {{at the other end}} of the rink, he intercepted a clear-out pass from Montreal's Calum MacKay and scored to win the game. The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy loads and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point above the river means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E
5|$|Wales did not field an {{international}} team until the IRFB, {{supported by the}} RFU, recommended that the WFU be readmitted into the organisation in February 1898. The WFU agreed that they would in future abide by all IRFB by-laws, and that Gould {{not be allowed to}} play in any future internationals. Gould accepted the ruling but returned to rugby as a referee and Welsh international selector. The compromise <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> long term split in the sport, and by 1901 the IRFB added laws to the game banning professionalism to clarify their authority on the issue.|$|E

5|$|Within ten years, {{another case}} arose, which dealt with fishing rights at Celilo Falls, a {{traditional}} Indian fishing location. Two brothers, Lineas and Audubon Winans, owned property {{on both sides}} of the Columbia River and obtained licenses from the state of Washington to operate four fish wheels. The wheels <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> significant number of salmon from passing the location. Additionally, the Winans prohibited anyone, whether an Indian with treaty rights or otherwise, from crossing their land to get to the falls.|$|E
5|$|According to Naman Ramachandran, {{the author}} of , most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic {{activities}} went unpublicised {{because he did not}} want them to be so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.|$|E
5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica {{fell to the}} Persian army, which {{captured}} and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter {{the course of the}} war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis <b>prevented</b> <b>a</b> quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E
