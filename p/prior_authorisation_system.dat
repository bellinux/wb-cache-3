40|$|From the Introduction. That the {{requirement}} of a <b>prior</b> <b>authorisation,</b> as a precondition for the exercise of any economic activity, may restrict the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services is a truism. If an authorisation is required in the Member State where establishment is to take place or the service is to be offered (host Member State), then operators who lack such authorisation are in no right to proceed to the projected activity. Therefore, {{as soon as it}} is being accepted that the EU internal market rules are not only about discriminatory measures, but also cover mere restrictions, {{it comes as no surprise}} that national <b>authorisation</b> <b>systems</b> come to be scrutinized under the Internal Market rules...|$|R

40|$|An <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> determines who is {{authorised}} {{to do what}} i. e. it assigns privileges {{to users}} and provides a decision on whether someone is allowed to perform a requested action on a resource. A traditional <b>authorisation</b> decision <b>system,</b> which is simply called <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> or system {{in the rest of}} the thesis, provides the decision based on a policy which is usually written by the system administrator. Such a traditional <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> is not sufficient to protect privacy of personal data, since users (the data subjects) are usually given a take it or leave it choice to accept the controlling organisation’s policy. Privacy is the ability of the owners or subjects of personal data to control the flow of data about themselves, according to their own preferences. This thesis describes the design of an <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> that will provide privacy for personal data by including sticky authorisation policies from the issuers and data subjects, to supplement the authorisation policy of the controlling organisation. As personal data moves from controlling system to controlling system, the sticky policies travel with the data. A number of data protection laws and regulations have been formulated to protect the privacy of individuals. The rights and prohibitions provided by the law need to be enforced by the <b>authorisation</b> <b>system.</b> Hence, the designed <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> also includes the authorisation rules from the legislation. This thesis describes the conversion of rules from the EU Data Protection Directive into machine executable rules. Due to the nature of the legislative rules, not all of them could be converted into deterministic machine executable rules, as in several cases human intervention or human judgement is required. This is catered for by allowing the machine rules to be configurable. Since the system includes independent policies from various authorities (law, issuer, data subject and controller) conflicts may arise among the decisions provided by them. Consequently, this thesis describes a dynamic, automated conflict resolution mechanism. Different conflict resolution algorithms are chosen based on the request contexts. As the EU Data Protection Directive allows processing of personal data based on contracts, we designed and implemented a component, Contract Validation Service (ConVS) that can validate an XML based digital contract to allow processing of personal data based on a contract. The <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> has been implemented as a web service and the performance of the system is measured, by first deploying it in a single computer and then in a cloud server. Finally the validity of the design and implementation are tested against a number of use cases based on scenarios involving accessing medical data in a health service provider’s system and accessing personal data such as CVs and degree certificates in an employment service provider’s system. The machine computed authorisation decisions are compared to the theoretical decisions to ensure that the system returns the correct decisions...|$|R

30|$|The {{distributed}} {{nature of}} OpenStack, {{and its ability}} to support multiple heterogeneous services, means that OpenStack components are arranged in a different way. For example, there are two Policy Decision Points (PDP), which require two sets of policies in the same system. This has implications on how OpenStack computes access decisions, and because of that self-adaptive solutions for dealing with authorisation, such as Self-Adaptive Authorisation Framework (SAAF) [2], cannot be directly used on OpenStack Keystone. Moreover, SAAF uses PERMIS [7] as <b>authorisation</b> <b>system,</b> which is different from OpenStack Keystone, and one of the differences is latter’s reliance on a token-based mechanism. The differences between these two <b>authorisation</b> <b>systems,</b> and the fact that in a system based feedback control loop the target system (in this case the <b>authorisation</b> <b>system)</b> influences the design of the controller [4], implies that a novel architectural solution is required for supporting for self-adaptive authorisation in OpenStack, which will be the topic of the next section.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, public {{awareness}} of unsafe and ineffective high-risk devices entering the market has been raised. Consequently, evidence requirements for the market authorisation process of medical devices {{may not be enough}} to ensure high-quality and safe provision of care. This research report first explores the <b>authorisation</b> <b>systems</b> for high-risk medical devices in four selected regions (USA, Canada, Australia and Europe). Secondly, it analyses the clinical evidence accessible at the time of both market approval and assessment (HTA) for the reimbursement of seven selected high-risk medical devices. Methods: A literature search in PubMed, complimented by a worldwide web-search, was conducted for <b>authorisation</b> <b>systems</b> and their evidence requirements in the four selected regions, with a focus on seven exemplary high-risk devices. Results: All seven medical devices have been approved in the European Union through an appointed Notified Body, only four by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), one each by the US-American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Canadian Therapeutics Products Directorate (TPD) respectively. In comparison to the other three regulatory systems, the number of approved devices in Europe is high, especially when taking into additional consideration that four further devices were also assessed by the FDA, but were either rejected or not approved for general use. In almost all of the seven analysed examples, the pre-market approval in Europe was granted 2 - 5 years before <b>authorisation</b> in other <b>systems.</b> The evidence used for CE-marking is not known due to its highly decentralised <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> and the lack of transparency. Since authorisation in Europe is granted earlier, the clinical evidence is naturally less mature. In contrast, none of the seven medical devices has so far been recommended for reimbursement. The pre-reimbursement assessments most often state that current evidence is not enough to ensure patient benefit and safety. Some devices are recommended for "research only". Discussion and conclusion: The results support the call for a change in the European <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> towards a transparent and evidence-based regulation process. Conditional coverage or coverage under evidence development is applied as an instrument to close the gap between immature data and reimbursement requirements...|$|R
