50|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> {{the common law}} of contract provides that a contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations arising under it on any person or agent except the parties to it.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas v. Winchester, 6 N.Y. 397 (1852), which {{established}} the [...] "imminent danger to human life" [...] doctrine, {{was at the}} head of the cases in assaulting the protective wall of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the tort field. Subsequent examples include: MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., Goldberg v. Kollsman Instrument Corp., and finally, Judge Jones's landmark holding in Codling v. Paglia, in which the Court demolished what was left of the <b>privity</b> barrier <b>in</b> tort cases by adopting the doctrine of strict products liability.|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the Nebraska Supreme Court missed an {{opportunity}} to reconsider the entrenched common law rule <b>in</b> Nebraska requiring <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> legal malpractice actions. Part II briefly explores the role of <b>privity</b> nationally and <b>in</b> Nebraska, while Part III discusses the facts of Swanson v. Ptak. Part IV explores the implied relationship doctrine, concluding that the harshness of the privity requirement for clients who reasonably relied on what they assumed to be an attorney-client relationship outweighs any benefits it may have to the legal profession...|$|R
50|$|The {{assignment}} {{does not}} necessarily {{have to be in}} writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish <b>privity</b> (<b>in</b> other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party obligor and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, it {{has been}} held that {{third-party}} beneficiaries may uphold a promise made for its benefit in a contract of insurance {{to which it is}} not a party (Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v. McNiece Bros Pty Ltd (1988) 165 CLR 107)Austlii. It {{is important to note that}} the decision in Trident had no clear ratio, and did not create a general exemption to the doctrine of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> Australia.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the common law's {{law of contract}} dictates that persons may not reap the benefits nor suffer the burdens of a contract {{to which they were}} not a party. Under the doctrine, if a consumer bought goods from a retailer who had originally bought them from the manufacturer, then, if the goods proved faulty, the consumer should sue the retailer. The consumer could not sue the manufacturer in contract law because no contract existed between them. The retailer could then counterclaim against the manufacturer. In most cases, however, consumers may rely on the manufacturer's guarantee that will have been assigned to them.|$|R
5000|$|Laskin C.J., {{writing for}} a {{unanimous}} court, held that provincial legislatures had no jurisdiction {{to impose a}} <b>privity</b> clause <b>in</b> order to shield its tribunals from judicial review due to s. 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867: ...|$|R
5000|$|In the US {{federal law}} of res judicata, privity {{is said to}} {{preclude}} a party to a legal action from raising an issue that either was raised or could have been raised in previous legal action. Under federal law, [...] "concepts summarized by the term privity are looked to {{as a means of}} determining whether the interests of the party against whom claim preclusion is asserted were represented in prior litigation." [...] Therefore, <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> federal common law is [...] "a convenient means of expressing conclusions that are supported by independent analysis." [...] Because privity is actually a term to summarize a conclusion that one party was precluded, it [...] "may exist for the purpose of determining one legal question but not another depending on the circumstances and legal doctrines at issue." ...|$|R

40|$|The Special Committee on Education and the Law first {{interested}} itself <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> procedures when a subcommittee {{looked into}} recent cases that challenged {{the confidentiality of}} votes <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> decisions. That inquiry led to a broader examination of the processes that are or should be used when universities decide whether to confer tenure, or (less frequently) move to terminate a tenured appointment.

40|$|In the {{products}} liability area the pendulum has now swung {{back to the}} imposition of strict liability. This transition, beginning with {{the elimination of the}} <b>privity</b> requirement <b>in</b> negligence actions, continuing with the imposition of strict liability under a warranty theory, and culminating {{in the development of a}} tort theory of recovery in strict liability, has been well-documented...|$|R
40|$|Mutual wills {{are one of}} a {{range of}} {{solutions}} providing for a form of family property in common law jurisprudence. The doctrine of mutual wills also operates in support of contracts for the benefit of third parties. With the settling of the doctrine of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> 1861, some regard the survival of mutual wills as anomalous. A close analysis of the foundation case for the doctrine, Dufour v Pereira, provides insights into the relationship between probate and equity, and common law and equity, in the late 18 th century. It was a common law solution laced with arguments of the civil law. While the decision was ultimately resolved as a matter of English law, its civil law ‘shadow’ left questions hanging. In the unravelling of those issues within the common law, the developments in equitable doctrine ultimately caught up with the ‘anomaly’. 22 page(s...|$|R
50|$|This issue {{appeared}} repeatedly until MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. (1916), a case {{analogous to}} Winterbottom v Wright involving a car's defective wheel. Judge Cardozo, {{writing for the}} New York Court of Appeals, decided that no privity is required when the manufacturer knows the product is probably dangerous if defective, third parties (e.g. consumers) will be harmed because of said defect, {{and there was no}} further testing after initial sale. Foreseeable injuries occurred from foreseeable uses. Cardozo's innovation was to decide that the basis for the claim was that it was a tort not a breach of contract. In this way he finessed the problems caused by the doctrine of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> a modern industrial society. Although his opinion was only law in New York State, the solution he advanced was widely accepted elsewhere and formed the basis of the doctrine of product liability.|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityCommunity colleges are experiencing many challenges that stem from political and fiscal uncertainties and these challenges are often exacerbated by high turnover in executive leadership positions (Floyd et al., 2010), which has implications for longterm strategic planning. The magnitude of {{the problems associated with}} high turnover rates for community college presidents prompted the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to award a grant to the American Association of Community College (AACC) in 2003 for the specific purpose of documenting the requisite values, skills, and competencies for community college leaders (American Association of Community Colleges, 2005). The purposes of this study was therefore to add to the body of knowledge on community college presidents, investigate the factors leading to longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for exemplary California community college presidents, and determine how the competency domains reported by the AACC relate to longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for community college presidents. This mixed-methods study was designed to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the leadership skills that facilitate longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for exemplary community college presidents? (2) What leadership-support structures enhance longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for exemplary community college presidents? (3) What relationships do exemplary community college presidents create and maintain? (4) What factors and experiences are of significance in preparing exemplary community college presidents? And, (5) How are the AACC's competency domains related to longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for exemplary community college presidents? Taking a comprehensive look at factors that enhance longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for community college presidents required that qualitative and quantitative data be collected from multiple sources. Consequently, qualitative data were collected from 48 California community college presidents using a study specific survey instrument. In addition, qualitative data were collected from 48 California community college presidents using the survey instrument and interviews were conducted with four additional community college presidents, one retired community college president, one community college chancellor, two community college vice presidents, two board of trustee members, and two faculty leaders. The findings from this research revealed that longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for community college presidents is enhanced by the president’s ability to communicate with individuals and constituent groups, and the president's ability to speak before large audiences. Second, the president's ability to demonstrate a balance between expert knowledge and charisma as well as manage personnel, personnel conflicts, and change initiatives was linked to length <b>in</b> <b>tenure.</b> Third, presidents who have a natural tendency towards being patient with individuals and governance processes that are able to garner support from the board of trustees, professional networks, peer networks, mentors, and constituent leaders tend to have longer tenures as presidents. A fourth theme regarding experiences that enhance longevity suggests that aspiring presidents should spend time in diverse and increasingly challenging leadership roles in the community college system. Fifth, the data revealed that the collection of competencies specified by the AACC is more important with respect to longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> than the compilation of other skills and competencies identified in an extensive review of the literature. The final finding suggests that there are differences with respect to gender when considering the skills, competencies, and factors that enhance longevity <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> for exemplary community college presidents...|$|R

40|$|Americans are {{convinced}} that employment stability has declined in recent decades, but previous research on this question has led to mixed conclusions. A key challenge is that trends {{for men and women}} are in opposite directions and appear to cancel each other out. We clarify this situation by examining trends <b>in</b> employer <b>tenure</b> by sex, marital status, and parental status. We find that married mothers are behind the increase <b>in</b> women’s job <b>tenure,</b> but men and never-married women have seen declines <b>in</b> <b>tenure.</b> Furthermore, we show that the timing of tenure trends for women parallels periods of increased labor force attachment. Finally, we find that shifts in industry and occupation composition can account for the decline <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> among men and never-married women before 1996 but not afterward. We situate these diverging trends in two broad shifts in expectations, norms, and behaviors in the labor market: the end-of-work discourse and the revolution in women’s identification with paid work. Our findings support the view that job tenure is declining for all groups, but women’s greater labor force attachment, especially their more continuous employment around childbirth, countered and masked this trend...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{declines in}} {{the average length of}} time that U. S. workers spend with a given {{employer}} represent an important change {{in the nature of the}} employment relationship, yet it is one whose causes are poorly understood. I explore those causes using Current Population Survey data on the tenure of men aged 30 – 65, from the years 1979 – 2008. I argue that long-term employment relationships primarily occur when workers pressure employers to close off employment from market competition, reducing the attractiveness of external mobility relative to internal opportunities and increasing employment security. I then explore how two changes in organizations’ environments—a decline in union strength and increased turbulence from changes in technology and globalization—might have affected workers’ ability to secure such closed employment relationships over the last 30 years. My results support the argument that declines <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> reflect the reduced power of workers to secure closed employment relationships. Recent declines <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> have been concentrated in large organizations, and many of those declines are explained by controlling for the changing levels of industry unionization. I find little evidence that foreign competition or technological change affected mobility. The results are robust to measures of changing industry growth rates and within-industry reorganization. Supplementary analyses suggest that layoffs are associated with different industry pressures than tenure and that voluntary mobility may have played an important role <b>in</b> declines <b>in</b> <b>tenure...</b>|$|R
