40|$|Voltammetry {{provides}} quick {{information about}} {{the evolution of the}} iron electrodes subjected to different chemical treatments. Temporarily the dichromate protects it in acid medium whereas the protective action of the diprotonated <b>phenformine</b> is more persistent and efective, as it is observed through Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). Cr (VI) passivates iron in potassium chloride medium and <b>phenformine</b> complexes Fe (II) forming a surface film that protects it from corrosion. The chromate forms the surface film in basic medium. This film makes it impossible to detect by voltammetry the peaks of the Fe (II) + 2 e â†” Fe (O) system. The <b>phenformine,</b> in basic form, forms insoluble white complexes that settles on the electrode surface protecting it from electrochemical oxidation...|$|E
