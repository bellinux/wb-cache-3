50|$|<b>PEGylation</b> is {{the process}} of {{attaching}} the strands of the polymer PEG to molecules, most typically peptides, proteins, and antibody fragments, that can improve the safety and efficiency of many therapeutics. It produces alterations in the physiochemical properties including changes in conformation, electrostatic binding, hydrophobicity etc. These physical and chemical changes increase systemic retention of the therapeutic agent.

5000|$|Researchers are {{exploring}} enzyme substitution therapy using PAL to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in humans in which mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, EC 1.14.16.1) gene inactivate the enzyme.

[...] Treatment in mouse models using recombinant PAL {{has been shown to}} lower plasma Phe level, converting L-Phe to harmless metabolites that can be excreted. In order to reduce the immunogenicity of PAL, the enzyme is modified by <b>PEGylation.</b> This process disguises the introduced PAL from the host’s immune system and can lead to a longer and more effective reduction in blood Phe levels than non-modified PAL.|$|E

5000|$|Chemically, naloxegol is a {{pegylated}} (polyethylene glycol-modified) {{derivative of}} α-naloxol.

50|$|The {{polymers}} {{used for}} islet microencapsulation are alginate, chitosan, polyethylene glycol (PEG), agarose, sodium cellulose sulfate and water-insoluble polyacrylates with alginate and PEG being commonly used polymers. With successful {{in vitro studies}} being performed using this technique, significant work in clinical trials using microencapsulated human islets is being carried out. In 2003, the use of alginate/PLO microcapsules containing islet cells for pilot phase-1 clinical trials was permitted {{to be carried out}} at the University of Perugia by the Italian Ministry of Health. In another study, the potential of clinical application of <b>PEGylation</b> and low doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A were evaluated. The trial which began in 2005 by Novocell, now forms the phase I/II of clinical trials involving implantation of islet allografts into the subcutaneous site. However, there have been controversial studies involving human clinical trials where Living Cell technologies Ltd demonstrated the survival of functional xenogeneic cells transplanted without immunosuppressive medication for 9.5 years. However, the trial received harsh criticism from the International Xenotransplantation Association as being risky and premature.However, even though clinical trials are under way, several major issues such as biocompatibility and immunoprotection need to be overcome.|$|E

40|$|<b>PEGylation</b> {{has turned}} {{proteins}} into important new biopharmaceuticals. The fundamental {{problems with the}} existing approaches to <b>PEGylation</b> are inefficient conjugation {{and the formation of}} heterogeneous mixtures. This is because poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is usually conjugated to nucleophilic amine residues. Our <b>PEGylation</b> protocol solves these problems by exploiting the chemical reactivity of both of the sulfur atoms in the disulfide bond of many biologically relevant proteins. An accessible disulfide bond is mildly reduced to liberate the two cysteine sulfur atoms without disturbing the protein's tertiary structure. Site-specific <b>PEGylation</b> is achieved with a bis-thiol alkylating PEG reagent that sequentially undergoes conjugation to form a three-carbon bridge. The two sulfur atoms are re-linked with PEG selectively conjugated to the bridge. <b>PEGylation</b> of a protein can be completed in 24 h and purification of the PEG-protein conjugate in another 3 h. We have successfully applied this approach to <b>PEGylation</b> of cytokines, enzymes, antibody fragments and peptides, without destroying their tertiary structure or abolishing their biological activity...|$|E
40|$|Conjugation of {{truncated}} recombinant staphylokinase (trSak) with {{polyethylene glycol}} (PEG) {{is an effective}} way to overcome its short plasma half-life and enhance its therapeutic potential. However, conventional amine directed <b>PEGylation</b> chemistry inevitably led to modification at its functionally important N terminus, which resulted in a significantly reduced bioactivity of trSak. In this study, a novel solid phase <b>PEGylation</b> process was developed to shield the N-terminal region of the protein from <b>PEGylation.</b> The process was achieved by oriented adsorption of an N-terminally His-tagged trSak (His-trSak) onto an immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). His-trSak was efficiently separated and retained on IMAC media before reaction with succinimidyl carbonate mPEG (SC-mPEG, 5, 10 or 20 kDa). The IMAC derived mono-PEGylated His-trSak showed structural and stability properties similar to the liquid phase derived conjugate. However, isoelectric focusing electrophoresis analysis revealed that mono-PEGylated His-trSaks via solid phase <b>PEGylation</b> were more homogeneous than those from liquid phase <b>PEGylation.</b> Moreover, tryptic peptide mapping analysis suggested that a complete N-terminal blockage of IMAC bound His-trSak from <b>PEGylation</b> with 10 kDa- and 20 kDa-SC-mPEG. In contrast, only partial protection of the N-terminal region was obtained for 5 kDa-SC-mPEG. Bioactivities of 10 kDa- and 20 kDa-PEG-His-trSak conjugates without N-terminal <b>PEGylation</b> were significantly higher than those of randomly PEGylated products. This further demonstrated the advantage of our new on-column <b>PEGylation</b> strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, protein <b>PEGylation</b> {{has become an}} {{established}} and highly refined technology by moving forward from initial simple random coupling approaches based on conjugation {{at the level of}} lysine ε-amino group. Nevertheless, amino <b>PEGylation</b> is still yielding important conjugates, currently in clinical practice, where the degree of homogeneity was improved by optimizing the reaction conditions and implementing the purification processes. However, the current research is mainly focused on methods of site-selective <b>PEGylation</b> that allow the obtainment of a single isomer, thus highly increasing the degree of homogeneity and the preservation of bioactivity. Protein N-terminus and free cysteines were the first sites exploited for selective <b>PEGylation</b> but currently further positions can be addressed thanks to approaches like bridging <b>PEGylation</b> (disulphide bridges), enzymatic <b>PEGylation</b> (glutamines and C-terminus) and glycoPEGylation (sites of O- and N-glycosylation or the glycans of a glycoprotein). Furthermore, by combining the tools of genetic engineering with specific <b>PEGylation</b> approaches, the polymer can be basically coupled at any position on the protein surface, owing to the substitution of a properly chosen amino acid in the sequence with a natural or unnatural amino acid bearing an orthogonal reactive group. On the other hand, <b>PEGylation</b> has not achieved the same success in the delivery of small drugs, despite the large interest and several studies in this field. Targeted conjugates and PEGs for combination therapy might represent the promising answers for the so far unmet needs of PEG as carrier of small drugs.
