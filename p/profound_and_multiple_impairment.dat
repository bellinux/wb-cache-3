40|$|This thesis {{address the}} {{question}} of agency that children with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> learning disabilities (PMLD) have in educational contexts. Teachers and educators do not usually regard children with PMLD in terms of their agency, because of their <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>impairments.</b> Discourses on children and adults with PMLD are linear, systematic, defining and closed to contingency. The discourses normally applied with regard to children with PMLD attending school are mapped out {{in the beginning of the}} thesis. The thesis provides an account of my becoming-teacher and my becoming-researcher It is my journey with students whom I worked with directly as their teacher in a segregated specialised school for children with PMLD, and also as a participant observer in two mainstream primary classrooms. The works of Jacques Derrida, Felix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze were crucial in reading the lives of these children together with mine. Nine stories with comments are the central focus of this thesis, where through the writing of these stories my own becoming-teacher is mapped out. The thesis shows how students with PMLD are able to provide teachers with spaces of possibilities in the linear and closed discourses mentioned above. Students themselves are able to introduce in the life of teachers, their classroom and at times even at school level, the ‘non-sense’ that help teachers ‘think again’ the discourses that they are working with. They are able to help teachers open up discourses, and see that they are ‘assemblages’, characterised by contingency, contradictions and aporias. Students with PMLD provide possibilities (potentials) for engagement in these assemblages. The identity of a teacher is shaken when she experiences her identity as an assemblage, but even more so when such an identity is seen as a process of becoming by engaging with the possibilities. Here the end is not important and is unknown; what is important is the process. What is argued is that the teacher’s identity is seen as becoming-teacher through becoming-PMLD. This thesis concludes that there needs to be a desire to engage with students with PMLD to continue the process of becoming-teacher...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{increasing}} interest in service user involvement in research, such involvement rarely extends to people with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> learning disabilities. New developments in visual methodologies offer the potential for people with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> learning disabilities {{to be included in}} research. At the same time, however, tighter regulation of the UK Research Governance Framework and the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 have increased the complexity of ethical approval processes. In reaching decisions about whether or not to grant approval, ethics committees are obliged to consider the potential harm to research participants and also the potential benefits. This article documents the benefits of involvement for ‘Martha’, who participated in a research project using photographic methods at the hostel where she lived.

40|$|With all the {{developments}} {{in information technology}} (IT) for people with disabilities, few interventions have been designed for people with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities as there is little incentive for companies to design and manufacture technology purely {{for a group of}} consumers without much buying power. A possible solution is therefore to identify mainstream technology that, with adaptation, could serve the purposes required by those with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities. Because of its ability to engage the attention of young children with autism, the role of a humanoid robot was investigated. After viewing a demonstration, teachers of pupils with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities described actions they wished the robot to make in order to help nominated pupils to achieve learning objectives. They proposed a much wider range of suggestions for using the robot than it could currently provide. Adaptations they required fell into two groups: either increasing the methods through which the robot could be controlled or increasing the range of behaviours that the robot emitted. These were met {{in a variety of ways}} but most would require a degree of programming expertise above that possessed by most schoolteachers...|$|R
40|$|Consideration toward {{children}} with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities started lately copmared with that {{other types of}} disabilities in Japan {{as well as that}} in other countries. Children with those disabilities were excluded from the governmental educational system. The social movement to guarantee the educational right of those disabled children strongly tried to protect their life, living and health. As a result, in 1979 all Japanese children were legally included in the Scool Education Act, guaranteering compulsory education to {{children with}} those disabilities. Since 1979, there has been educational approach to those children in hospitals, institutions and so on, although educational conditions are poor. Special School teachers devoted to such educational approach have been facing to new conditions including the handicapping conditions of students. New approach is needed to the teachers for the educational approach to students with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities, for example, approach to special health needs. This study examines the conditions of the educational approach for children with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities in the hospital in Kyoto prefecture until mid- 1980 s. There are many difficult problems and issues in the field of the educational approach to those students as follows, 1) New concepts and strategies for the education have been needed to fit the new educational approach. 2) New aproach has needed to overcome the poor educational conditions. 3) Although the teachers have been needed to suitable action from interpersonal interaction point of view, teachers action becomes complex motion for such educational approach and care. It is obvious that the teachers have been fsaced to their task and stree in relation to educational approach to students with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities in the early 1980 's...|$|R

40|$|Facilitating the {{expression}} of preferences and choices of non-verbal adults who have <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities is important yet challenging. The present research project aimed to examine whether consistent opportunities for expressing song-choices within music therapy resulted in an improvement in communication abilities of five females with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities. A multiple case study design was used. Each participant attended weekly thirty-minute sessions comprising three song-preference assessment sessions followed by ten song-choice intervention sessions. Affective responses to songs in the song-preference assessment were analyzed to identify each participant’s preferred songs. Four song-choice opportunities consisting {{of a pair of}} preferred and less-preferred songs were offered during the intervention sessions, and intentional choice-making behaviors were facilitated. The descriptive video-analysis of the sessions shows that the participants were able to indicate consistent preferences for songs, make intentional choices of songs, and improve communication skills throughout the ten intervention sessions. Two participants developed clear choice-making skills, such as selecting a preferred song-card from two options and alternating eye-gaze between a song-card and the researcher. The other three participants demonstrated idiosyncratic but clear intentional behaviors using body movements, facial expressions, and vocalizations to indicate choices of preferred songs. Inter-rater reliability was calculated. These results suggest that some adults with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities are capable of improving non-verbal communication skills when appropriate interventions and strategies are provided and also highlight the potential of music therapy to promote communication development of these individuals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Persons with <b>profound</b> {{intellectual}} <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities form {{a vulnerable}} group within the Norwegian {{health and social}} care system, whose needs can be poorly understood due to their cognitive and communicative challenges. Aim: This article aims {{to contribute to a}} richer understanding of persons with profound disabilities as narrative agents, and to highlight how the narrative competence of healthcare staff can be instrumental to a person-centred approach. Method: The methodology used was a practice development project in residential housing for persons with <b>profound</b> intellectual <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities. Dialogue seminars and reflection seminars with staff were conducted, and a group interview was carried out. Results: Episodes of emotional, embodied and silent narratives were identified. These episodes illustrated the staff’s narrative competence in bodily enacted caring encounters. Conclusion: This small-scale practice development project can contribute to changes and new ways forward towards person-centred care for adults with <b>profound</b> intellectual <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities living in residential housing.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} investigate postures and manipulations of an infant with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> learning difficulties. The female subject, who is five years and five months old, is an infant with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> learning difficulties, suffering from hypotonus, atrophy {{of the brain and}} severe mental retardation. We made a hypothesis that postures and manipulations is mutually related and we also observed what behaviors appear in subject while the teaching materials were presented. Changing or unchanging her posture, she turned on the switch of the teaching material and ringed the chime by/with some parts of her body. While she changes her posture, there were behaviors that the switch was turned on by her mouth, chin and shoulder in sitting position on the chair. While she keeps her posture sitting up, we could see her behaviors; For example, (i) she reached the mirror in the supine position, (ii) she kicked the switch by her leg sitting on chair, (iii) she reached the switch putting her elbow on the desk, that is, she reached the switch after she carried her hand to her mouth. In her position of sitting on the chair in front of the desk, she reached and slided the wooden knob along the board. At this moment, she controlled her posture moving her body forward and backward. Judging from the facts we mentioned above, our conclusion is that in an infant with <b>profound</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> learning difficulties the posture restricts the manipulation, otherwise the manipultion is performed in terms of changing the posture...|$|R
