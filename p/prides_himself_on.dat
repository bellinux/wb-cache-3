25|$|Schumer <b>prides</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> visiting {{every one}} of New York's 62 {{counties}} each year and has successfully done so {{in each of the}} 16 years he has served in the United States Senate, the only New York senator to have done so. He has a reputation for focusing on local issues that are important to average New Yorkers not normally associated with United States senators, ranging from tourism, to local taxes, to job creation. When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant. When it was revealed that Canon Inc. was considering relocating from its corporate headquarters in Long Island because of a dispute over road infrastructure funding, Schumer stepped in to advocate New York state redirect federal stimulus dollars to make the road improvements and keep the company and its jobs on Long Island.|$|E
500|$|Youth {{development}} and scouring for talent abroad {{is central to}} Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as {{he was looking at}} statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger <b>prides</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe {{one of the best things}} about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way. That's basically what a manager is about. When I can do that, I am very happy".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Official Star Trek Voyager Magazine in 1998, director Cliff Bole spoke highly of guest star Tom Wright, saying he was a [...] "good actor [...] <b>prides</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> being Shakespearian", but {{felt that he was}} in over his head working on Star Trek, particularly underestimating the rigors of working under the requisite makeup. [...] Bole detailed a four-hour, [...] process to apply the glue, mask, and prostheses before the actor even began delivering his lines for what was an all-day shoot; all of these [...] "subtract from [...] performance" [...] of actors unaccustomed to them. [...] Bole tempered himself explaining that he had seen [...] "really competent actors" [...] suffer from the same trials and simple exhaustion that he saw in Wright's performance. [...] For his part, Wright compared the trials of the [...] "heavy makeup" [...] and contact lenses required to play Tuvix with his previous roles on Creepshow 2 and Tales from the Crypt. [...] Tuvix's makeup was designed and supervised by Michael Westmore.|$|E
2500|$|In an [...] "Op-Ed" [...] {{published}} on December 4 in The Jerusalem Post, David A. Harris, {{executive director of}} the American Jewish Committee (AJC), says that he finds it [...] "startling that a former president who <b>prides</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> his ongoing contribution to world peace would write a crude polemic that compromises any pretense to objectivity and fairness": [...] "Carter leaves out what any reasonable observer, even those that share his basic views of the conflict, would consider obvious facts, but does include stunning distortions".; Harris [...] "cite just two of the numerous examples" [...] of what he calls [...] "such mendacity." [...] The first of these, Harris says, is that [...] "Carter discounts well-established claims that Israel accepted and Arafat rejected a generous offer to create a Palestinian state." [...] The second [...] "manifest distortion," [...] according to Harris, is that [...] "Carter states that Israel plans to build a security fence 'along the Jordan River, which is now planned as the eastern leg of the encirclement of the Palestinians'"; whereas well-informed observers know that [...] "Israel has modified the projected route of the security fence on numerous occasions (the current route roughly tracks the parameters that Clinton advanced to the parties in negotiations) and that there is no plan to hem the Palestinians in on the eastern border." [...] In omitting [...] "these well-known developments," [...] Harris argues, Carter is [...] "leaving readers to think that a route that was once contemplated in proposed maps but never adopted or acted upon represents current reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis); regular Seasons 1–3, {{guest star}} Season 5: A {{creative}} copywriter and Princeton University alumnus, the bearded, pipe-smoking Paul <b>prides</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> his politically liberal views. Some {{time before the}} series began he {{had a relationship with}} Joan Holloway which ended badly, largely because Paul talked about it too much. Paul tried, unsuccessfully, to date Peggy soon after she was hired by Sterling Cooper. Through most of the second season, Paul dated Sheila White, an African-American woman from South Orange, New Jersey. They break up while in Oxford, Mississippi, where they had gone as Freedom Riders to oppose segregation in the South. It is a source of pride for Kinsey to live in the low-income, southern section of Montclair, New Jersey; Joan, however, mocks him as a shallow poseur. He is highly competitive, an attribute revealed to have soured a few friendships while he was in college, and which causes friction with Peggy, who quickly proves to be a superior copywriter to him. [...] He is furious upon discovering that Don chose Peggy for the new agency over him. Paul did not appear after the third season finale until he reappeared in the tenth episode of Season 5, revealing himself to Harry as a disciple of Krishna Consciousness. Paul asks Harry to look at a Star Trek script he wrote, which Harry thinks is awful. Harry later realizes that Paul's girlfriend is manipulating him because of his recruiting skills within the Krishna movement, and encourages Paul to follow his dreams. He gives Paul $500 and tells him to get to Los Angeles as soon as possible.|$|E

6000|$|But when it {{is clearly}} {{understood}} that Browning's love of the fantastic in style was a perfectly serious artistic love, when we understand that he enjoyed working in that style, as a Chinese potter might enjoy making dragons, or a mediæval mason making devils, there yet remains something definite which must be laid to his account as a fault. He certainly had a capacity for becoming perfectly childish in his indulgence in ingenuities {{that have nothing to}} do with poetry at all, such as puns, and rhymes, and grammatical structures that only just fit into each other like a Chinese puzzle. Probably it was only one of the marks of his singular vitality, curiosity, and interest in details. He was certainly one of those somewhat rare men who are fierily ambitious both in large things and in small. He <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> having written The Ring and the Book, and he also <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> knowing good wine when he tasted it. He <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> re-establishing optimism on a new foundation, and it is to be presumed, though it is somewhat difficult to imagine, that he <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> such rhymes as the following in Pacchiarotto:-- ...|$|R

But he has sterner words. Pharisees, the separatists, the religious men, who think themselves holier than any one else; and Sadducees, materialist men of the world, who sneer at the unseen, the unknown, the heroic, come to him.
