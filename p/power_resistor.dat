50|$|Of note, {{for about}} a century, some variable-speed {{electric}} motors have had decent efficiency, but they were somewhat more complex than constant-speed motors, and sometimes required bulky external electrical apparatus, such as a bank of variable <b>power</b> <b>resistors</b> or rotating converters such as the Ward Leonard drive.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, as effects pedals proliferated, their {{sounds were}} {{combined}} with tube amp distortion at lower, more controlled volumes by using power attenuators, such as Tom Scholz's Power Soak, {{as well as}} re-amplified dummy loads, such as Eddie Van Halen's use of dummy-load <b>power</b> <b>resistor,</b> post-power-tube effects, and a final solid-state amp driving the guitar speakers.|$|E
50|$|Compared to a {{squirrel-cage}} rotor, {{the rotor}} of the {{slip ring motor}} has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, and the current lower, than for a squirrel-cage rotor. During the start-up a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the slip ring. Each pole is wired in series with a variable <b>power</b> <b>resistor.</b> When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over squirrel-cage motors is higher starting torque.|$|E
50|$|Some SMPSs have an {{absolute}} limit on their minimum current output. They are {{only able to}} output above a certain power level and cannot function below that point. In a no-load condition {{the frequency of the}} power slicing circuit increases to great speed, causing the isolated transformer to act as a Tesla coil, causing damage due to the resulting very high voltage power spikes. Switched-mode supplies with protection circuits may briefly turn on but then shut down when no load has been detected. A very small low-power dummy load such as a ceramic <b>power</b> <b>resistor</b> or 10-watt light bulb can be attached to the supply to allow it to run with no primary load attached.|$|E

5000|$|Radio {{manufacturers}} {{attempted to}} deviate from traditional heater voltages of 2.5, 5 and 6.3 volts to try and use a 5 tube heater scheme to get as close to 110-120 VAC line voltage. For the 1935 model year, designers {{were able to get}} a 5-tube heater string to total up to 78 volts. This meant that a dropping resistor or line ballast tube was needed to drop the remaining 35-42 volts. If a ballast tube was used, the radio would be marketed as a [...] "6-tube" [...] radio even though one was just a voltage dropping ballast. Other manufacturers used a [...] "line cord resistor", a special AC cord made with resistance wire which replaced a <b>power</b> <b>resistor</b> in the radio chassis. These line cords tend to get warm to the touch after the radio was in use for a while.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum tube {{equipment}} used {{a number of}} tubes, each with a heater requiring {{a certain amount of}} electrical power. In AC/DC equipment, the heaters of all the tubes are connected in series. All the tubes are rated at the same current (typically 100, 150, 300, or 450 mA) but at different voltages, according to their heating power requirements. If necessary, resistance (which can be a ballast tube (barretter), a <b>power</b> <b>resistor</b> or a resistive mains lead are added so that, when the mains voltage is applied across the chain, the specified heating current flows. Some types of ballast resistors were built into an envelope like a tube that was easily replaceable. With mains voltages of around 220 V, the power dissipated by the additional resistance and the voltage drop across it could be quite high, and it was common to use a resistive power cable (mains cord) of defined resistance, running warm, rather than putting a hot resistor inside the case. If a resistive power cable was used, an inexperienced repairer might replace it with a standard cable, or use the wrong length, damaging the equipment and risking a fire.|$|E

40|$|A new {{promising}} {{material for}} power resistors {{which are used}} in power supplies, power conversion circuits or as heating elements are electrically conductive glass-carbon composites. Their resistivity can be adjusted by the carbon type and the carbon content. Manufacturing such resistor components by powder injecting moulding gives the advantage of shape complexity without machining of sintered parts.

The high-impedance bright channel was used on the amplifier, and the tone knobs were all set to 12 o'clock. Different responses were measured by varying the [...] "Volume bright" [...] knob, which in practice controls the gain for the bright channel. On the software plugins also, the bright channel was selected (called [...] "Brilliant" [...] on the ReValver AC 30), all tone controls were set to 12 o'clock, and different recordings were made while varying the channel gain. It should be noted that since the real AC 30 was operated without a loudspeaker, the loudspeaker emulation was switched off for both virtual plugins.|$|E
