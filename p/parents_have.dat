40|$|Abstract Several {{articles}} and {{studies have been}} done on extreme <b>parenting.</b> Many authors <b>have</b> found that, to some degree, extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> a negative effect on children. More and more children are coming from homes that <b>have</b> included extreme <b>parenting</b> styles. These children have grown up to be struggling adults when it comes to academics, peer-to-peer relationships, and employee to employer relationship. Extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> the potential to destroy the independence, problem-solving, and relationships of the next generation. One area that has been researched most is extreme parents and youth sports. Studies have shown that youth sports have taken on an entirely new meaning than those of the past. This paper will examine the different styles of extreme parenting, how extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> changed the coach/player/parent relationship, how extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> changed not only youth sports but other areas such as employment, college professor/student relationsh...|$|R

5|$|Scholar M.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a social {{learning}} analysis, it was hypothesized that a history of parental divorce would predispose partners to difficulties in managing conflict. Ninety-three engaged couples were videotaped while they discussed two areas of conflict. Each partner then completed a video-mediated recall procedure, an assessment of cognition during the interactions, which was then coded and analyzed. As predicted, couples in which the woman 2 ̆ 7 s <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> divorced showed more negative communication and cognitions during conflict discussions than did couples in which neither partner 2 ̆ 7 s <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> divorced. Contrary to predictions, couples in which the man 2 ̆ 7 s <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> divorced did not differ from couples in which neither partner 2 ̆ 7 s <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> divorced. The current research shows that, at least for women, a history of parental divorce is associated with more negative couple communication before marriage...|$|R

5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} family members usually become the children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives. Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that {{extended family}} members mistreat orphans whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> died from HIV/AIDS. For example, {{family members who}} are unable to support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Holloway was {{scheduled}} to fly home from Aruba on May 30, 2005, but she failed to appear for her flight. She was last seen by her classmates outside of Carlos'n Charlie's, a restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad. She {{was in a car}} with local residents Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish. When the three men were questioned, they said that they dropped off Holloway at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her. Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence, the three suspects were released each time without being charged with a crime. Holloway's <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> criticized Aruban police for the lack of progress in the investigation and interrogation of the three men who were last seen with their daughter. The family also called for a boycott of Aruba, which gained Alabama Governor Bob Riley's support but failed to gain widespread backing.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and naked, and start to develop down on their heads on day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day nine or ten. For {{the first three days}} after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. <b>Parents</b> <b>have</b> been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
