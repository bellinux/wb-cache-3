5|$|Local <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> take pups for {{the exotic}} pet trade or as pets for themselves, but the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates {{the story of}} an Arawak Indian who took two pups from their parents. While {{revealing}} of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was a profound blow to the breeding pair, which went on to lose their territory to competitors.|$|E
5|$|<b>People</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{suspected}} vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
5|$|Wolves kill dogs on occasion, {{with some}} wolf populations relying on dogs as an {{important}} food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by <b>people,</b> <b>sometimes</b> ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered {{a major problem in}} Scandinavia and Wisconsin. The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harriers, with older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as Swedish elkhounds are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.|$|E

25|$|In Uruguay and Brazil, the {{traditional}} gourd is usually big with a corresponding large hole. In Argentina (especially {{in the capital}} Buenos Aires), the gourd is small and has a small hole and <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> add sugar for flavor.|$|E
50|$|Boortsog {{is often}} eaten as a dessert, with sugar, butter, or honey. They may {{be thought of}} as cookies or biscuits, and since they are fried, they are {{sometimes}} compared to doughnuts. Mongolians and Turkic <b>peoples</b> <b>sometimes</b> dip boortsog in tea. In Central Asia, baursaki are often eaten alongside chorba.|$|R
6000|$|... "Them's common feelin's among mourners, Ruey. These 'ere {{forty years}} that I've been round nussin', and layin'-out, and tendin' funerals, I've watched <b>people's</b> exercises. <b>People's</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{supported}} wonderfully {{just at the}} time, and maybe at the funeral; but {{the three or four}} weeks after, most everybody, if they's to say what they feel, is unreconciled." ...|$|R

25|$|The Kam <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> use Chinese {{characters}} {{to represent the}} sounds of Kam words. A Latin alphabet was developed in 1958, {{but it is not}} much in use {{due to a lack of}} printed material and trained teachers.|$|E
25|$|Gait change. Some {{aspects of}} gait {{normally}} change with old age. Gait velocity slows after age 70. Double stance time (i.e., time {{with both feet}} on the ground) also increases with age. Because of gait change, old <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> appear to be walking on ice.|$|E
25|$|The <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> called Forgotten Australians are the {{survivors}} of government policies that resulted in at least 500,000 children growing up in 'out-of-home' care in Australia in the 20th Century. Forgotten Australians are also known as 'Care Leavers'. Other terms for people who spent time in out-of-home care include 'homies', 'state wards' or 'wardies'.|$|E

50|$|Those táltos who espouse a Turanist {{ideology}} (id est {{the theory}} of the Hungarian kinship with the Turkic <b>peoples)</b> <b>sometimes</b> choose to affiliate with Tengrism, that is the Turkic ethnic religion. This is the case of Zoltán Sólyomfi, a renowned táltos in Hungary. These táltos are generally characterised by their used of the Turkic name of the Deity, Tengri, instead of the Hungarian indigenous one, which is Isten.|$|R
50|$|Street <b>people</b> are <b>sometimes</b> called gamines, a {{term that}} is also used for Colombian street {{children}} of either sex.|$|R
25|$|The Basque Country's flag, the Ikurriña, is also {{loosely based}} on the Union Jack, {{reflecting}} the significant commercial ties between Bilbao and Britain {{at the time the}} Ikurriña was designed in 1894. The Miskito <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the Mosquito Coast.|$|E
25|$|Glory {{holes are}} {{especially}} associated with gay male culture, and anal or oral sex, {{but may also}} be used by bisexual or heterosexual men, or by men who do not identify as gay, bisexual, or heterosexual. The partition maintains anonymity. Some gay websites offer directories of glory holes, and <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> install private glory holes within their residences.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{object to}} using the prefix mal- to derive highly {{frequent}} antonyms, especially when they are as long as malproksima (far). There are a few alternative roots in poetry, such as turpa for malbela (ugly) and pigra for mallaborema (lazy) – some of which originated in Ido – that {{find their way into}} prose. However, they are rarely used in conversation.|$|E
50|$|<b>People</b> are <b>sometimes</b> {{depicted}} in the artwork, such as Australian explorers, drovers, bushranger, swagmen, Australian Aborigines, diggers and the like.|$|R
50|$|Mixed-race <b>peoples</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{emerged as}} leaders, for {{instance}} in the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast, many leaders of the early 19th century tribes were men of mixed race, who could bridge cultures. While they often had European or American schooling, they identified primarily as Cherokee or Creek, for instance, and usually spoke both their own languages and English. The older chiefs thought such young men could provide a unique path to the future.|$|R
50|$|Very {{large numbers}} of <b>people</b> were <b>sometimes</b> transported on the small riverboats. For one {{baseball}} game at Bandon, Dispatch came down from Coquille with about 400 people aboard, and Telegraph arrived with 150. At one point, Telegraph ran eight different Saturdays along the river to carry <b>people</b> to dances, <b>sometimes</b> at Prosper, sometimes at Parkersburg, Lampa and Riverton.|$|R
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{relocate}} {{from one}} country to another, either permanently or on a limited-time basis. This presents challenges to businesses, governments, and individuals seeking to ensure future benefits or having to deal with taxation authorities in multiple countries. To that end, the Social Security Administration has signed treaties, often referred to as Totalization Agreements, with other social insurance programs in various foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|Long {{half-life}} benzodiazepines like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are {{preferred to}} minimize rebound effects {{and are available}} in low potency dose forms. Some people may not fully stabilize between dose reductions, even when the rate of reduction is slowed. Such <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> simply need to persist as they may not feel better until they have been fully withdrawn from them {{for a period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Older local <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{claim that}} the name of Worthing is derived from a natural annual phenomenon. Seaweed beds off nearby Bognor Regis are ripped up by summer storms and {{prevailing}} Atlantic currents deposit it on the beach. A rich source of nitrates, it makes good fertiliser. The decaying weed was sought by farmers from the surrounding area. Thus the town would have become known as Wort (weed) -inge (people).|$|E

5000|$|By the 17th {{century the}} Acala had two {{principal}} towns; Cagbalam had 300 multiple-family houses and Culhuacan had over 140. The towns {{were divided into}} four sections, each governed by their own ruler. The combined population of these two towns has been estimated at 7,000. The Acala were allies of the Lakandon Ch'ol, their immediate neighbours to the west, and the two <b>peoples</b> <b>sometimes</b> cooperated militarily. [...] The Acala {{are known to have}} cultivated cacao and achiote.|$|R
25|$|A portable, dome tent, {{called a}} Matjieshut (Afrikaans for 'mat house') or Haru Oms (meaning 'rush house' in Nama) is {{a feature of}} Khoikhoi culture. These {{dwellings}} are used in their seasonal camps in the Richtersveld. It consists of a frame traditionally covered with rush mats. In the 21st century, the <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{use a variety of}} manufactured materials. In recognition of its significance, the Richtersveld has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), {{is usually}} {{one of the}} largest contingents, {{featuring}} several hundred people. These are typically the (straight) parents or family members of LGBT <b>people,</b> <b>sometimes</b> marching together with their LGBT relatives. Many carry signs indicating where their PFLAG chapter comes from. It's common to see signs from all over Northern California. This contingent is notable for the swell in cheers (and some tears) that follow it along the route.|$|E
25|$|When wisdom teeth {{communicate}} with the mouth, the most common symptom is localized pain, swelling and bleeding of the tissue overlying the tooth. This tissue is called the operculum and the disorder called pericoronitis which means inflammation around the crown of the tooth. Low grade chronic periodontitis commonly occurs on either the wisdom tooth or the second molar, causing less obvious symptoms such as bad breath and bleeding from the gums. The teeth can also remain asymptomatic (pain free), even with disease. As the teeth near the mouth during normal development, <b>people</b> <b>sometimes</b> report mild pressure of other symptoms similar to teething.|$|E
50|$|A related {{condition}} called sexually induced sneezing also exists, where <b>people</b> sneeze, <b>sometimes</b> uncontrollably, when engaging in or {{even thinking about}} sexual activity.|$|R
50|$|An ethnographic {{film is a}} non-fiction film, often {{similar to}} a {{documentary}} film, historically dealing with non-Western <b>people,</b> and <b>sometimes</b> associated with anthropology.|$|R
