25|$|By late 1975, {{after years}} of intense {{construction}} the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.|$|E
25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>button.</b> Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{component}} of the test is [...] "extinction". Again, participants learn to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> for picture A but not picture B. However this time, instead of the rules reversing, the rule changes altogether. Now the participant will be punished for pressing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> in response to either picture. The correct response is not to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> at all, but people with OFC dysfunction {{find it difficult to}} resist <b>the</b> temptation to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> despite being punished for it.|$|R
40|$|Helen Frowe (2006 / 2010) {{contends that}} there is a {{substantial}} moral difference between killing and letting die, arguing that in Michael Tooley's infamous machine case it is morally wrong to flip a coin to determine who lives or dies. Here I argue that Frowe fails to show that killing and letting die are morally inequivalent. However, I believe that she has succeeded in showing that it is wrong to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> in Tooley's case, where pressing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> will change who lives and dies. I argue that because killing and letting die are morally equivalent {{we have no reason to}} <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> in <b>the</b> machine case. <b>Pressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> in this case is morally wrong because there is no reason to do it; to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is to treat matters of life and death irreverently...|$|R

2500|$|In a study, a {{child was}} taken to the {{experimental}} room and told {{that they were going to}} play a game in which they had a chance to win a lot of M's. [...] Every time they made the light of the reward indicator by pressing a red button, they would earn an M's. However, they had to wait a while (6 seconds) before they could press it to get another point.

2500|$|In 1943, Barnes {{launched}} a secret project {{to create an}} enormous electronic computer, which {{came to be called}} ENIAC. He supervised its development by the researchers at the University of Pennsylvania.

While {{it was too late to}} perform ballistic calculations for World War II, John von Neumann put it to work performing the complex calculations required by the hydrogen bomb. In April 1946, Barnes was chosen as the chairman of a committee appointed to oversee experimental firing of 25 captured German V-2 rockets. For his services during the war he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the larger}} {{group of the}} grey flair, those who would not <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> smaller cults formed with unique beliefs to others that also held the grey flair. Of these, the most {{prominent}} was the “Knights of The Button”. Members of this cult attempted to prevent <b>the</b> <b>button</b> from ever reaching zero by pressing it before the clock could fully descend. The 'Knights' {{went so far as}} to create an algorithm associated with a large pool of thousands of “dummy” accounts to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> automatically before it could reach zero. However, of these accounts, one was not verified to have been created prior to April 1st, 2015 and therefore was unable to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> permitting it to finally reach zero.|$|R
