5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females {{in many of the}} larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E

When lines cross in a kind of superposition of X-shapes, that's negative relationship. When lines cross randomly or are parallel, that show there is no particular relationship.|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} a copied manuscript, textual critics scrutinize the way the transcripts have passed through history to their extant forms. The higher {{the volume of the}} earliest texts (and their <b>parallels</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other),</b> the greater the textual reliability and the less chance that the transcript's content has been changed over the years. Multiple copies may also be grouped into text types (see New Testament text types), with some types judged closer to the hypothetical original than others. Differences often extend beyond minor variations and may involve, for instance, interpolation of material central to issues of historicity and doctrine, such as the ending of Mark 16.|$|R

5|$|In the skull, {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the front part of the skull) and diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The back end of the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part of the skull, join) are straight and <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the toothrows, and the midline of the skull in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements of the skull and teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E

5|$|Off Enewetak, grey reef sharks exhibit {{different}} social behaviors on {{different parts of}} the reef. Sharks tend to be solitary on shallower reefs and pinnacles. Near reef drop-offs, loose aggregations of five to 20 sharks form in the morning and grow in number throughout the day before dispersing at night. In level areas, sharks form polarized schools (all swimming in the same direction) of around 30 individuals near the sea bottom, arranging themselves <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> or slowly swimming in circles. Most individuals within polarized schools are females, and the formation of these schools has been theorized to relate to mating or pupping.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them {{right on top of}} each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E
5|$|The maxillary toothrows are <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than}} the {{connecting}} crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a cingulum (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike {{in most of the}} closest relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at the front and back and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the front and back. Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the one and}} a {{half months}} after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, {{underwent}} tests in preparations for the first flight. Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two semi-trailers were parked <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> outside Building 82; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but Have Blue retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12–13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, Have Blues chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design's characteristic faceting. The aircraft was disassembled and loaded onto a C-5– on 16November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed Bob Hope Airport) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight. After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E

40|$|POS, {{integrated}} by GPS / INS (Inertial Navigation Systems), {{has allowed}} rapid and accurate determination of position and attitude of remote sensing equipment for MMS (Mobile Mapping Systems). However, {{not only does}} INS have system error, but also it is very expensive. Therefore, in this paper error distributions of vanishing points are studied and tested in order to substitute INS for MMS in some special land-based scene, such as ground façade where usually only two vanishing points can be detected. Thus, the traditional calibration approach based on three orthogonal vanishing points is being challenged. In this article, firstly, the line clusters, which <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>others</b> in object space and correspond to the vanishing points, are detected based on RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) and parallelism geometric constraint. Secondly, condition adjustment with parameters is utilized to estimate nonlinear error equations of two vanishing points (V X, V Y). How to set initial weights for the adjustment solution of single image vanishing points is presented. Solving vanishing points and estimating their error distributions base on iteration method with variable weights, co-factor matrix and error ellipse theory. Thirdly, under the condition of known error ellipses of two vanishing points (V X, V Y) and {{on the basis of}} the triangle geometric relationship of three vanishing points, the error distribution of the third vanishing point (V Z) is calculated and evaluated by random statistical simulation with ignoring camera distortion. Moreover, Monte Carlo methods utilized for random statistical estimation are presented.
