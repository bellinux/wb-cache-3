Methods Exploratory phase conducted by the research team followed by an operational period coordinated by municipal health service. A blood sample was taken for serological and parasitological tests of Trypanosoma cruzi from pregnant women who were searching antenatal care or visited at home by field investigators. Infants born to T. cruzi-infected women were examined for infection at birth and again at 1 and 7 months of age. Results 64. 5 % of the pregnant women were infected. Congenital infection was diagnosed at birth in 4. 0 % (12 / 299) of the children born to seroreactive mothers. Twelve additional cases of infection (4 %) were diagnosed in children between 1 and 7 months of age.

Annual Parasite Incidence (API) was increased from 37. 54 % in 1997 up to  51. 10 % in 1999.   Anopheles balabacencis and maculalus have been confirmed as malaria vectors in this area. Malaria case findings by active and <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> <b>detections</b> and malaria treatment were conducted routinely and bionomics study of malaria vectors was conducted in Gunungrego hamlet, Hargorejo village (Kokap I) and Sebatang hamlet, Hargotirto village (Kokap II) in 2000. Results show that malarial cases in Kokap subdistrict were found throughout the year and there was indication that the increasing malaria cases started in the transition period of wet to dry season, i. e. in April and are highest in May - July and October­ December. Anopheles balabacensis was a predominant indoor species in all areas and predominant outdoor in Sebatang, while maculatus is a predominant outdoor species in Hargorejo. Both species were found throughout the night starting at sunset. Their density were highest between 21. 00 - 24. 00. The distribution of malarial vectors and other  Anopheline high mosquitoes were found mostly (89, 44 %  - 97, 90 %) in cattle shelters and its surrounding areas. Malaria control in Hargotirto Village, Kokap II was conducted by indoor residual spraying using Bendiocarb 80 WP at a target dosage of 0, 20 g active ingredient in 2 cycles in 2000.

40|$|Background: A common {{challenge}} {{to the study of}} several infectious diseases consists in combining limited cross-sectional survey data, collected with a more sensitive detection method, with a more extensive (but biased) syndromic sentinel surveillance data, collected with a less sensitive method. Our article describes a novel modeling framework that overcomes this challenge, resulting in enhanced understanding of malaria in the Western Brazilian Amazon. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cohort of 486 individuals was monitored using four cross-sectional surveys, where all participants were sampled regardless of symptoms (aggressive-active <b>case</b> <b>detection),</b> resulting in 1, 383 microscopy and 1, 400 polymerase chain reaction tests. Data on the same individuals were also obtained from the local surveillance facility (i. e., <b>passive</b> and active <b>case</b> <b>detection),</b> totaling 1, 694 microscopy tests. Our model accommodates these multiple pathogen and <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> methods. This model is shown to outperform logistic regression in terms of interpretability of its parameters, ability to recover the true parameter values, and predictive performance. We reveal that the main infection determinant was the extent of forest, particularly during the rainy season and in close proximity to water bodies, and participation on forest activities. We find that time residing in Acrelandia (as a proxy for past malaria exposure) decreases infection risk but surprisingly increases the likelihood of reporting symptoms once infected, possibly because non-naïve settlers are only susceptible to more virulent Plasmodium strains.

40|$|Abstract Background Approximately 40 % of the world's {{population}} {{is at risk}} for malaria. In highly endemic tropical areas, malaria is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality during infancy. There is a complex interrelationship between malaria, malnutrition and intestinal helminths, and this may impair cognitive development in children. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between malaria and school performance in children living in an endemic area where Plasmodium vivax is the species responsible for most of the cases. Methods The study was conducted in the Municipality of Careiro, Amazonas, Brazil, with five to 14 year-old children, studying the first eight grades of public school, during the year 2008. After an initial active <b>case</b> <b>detection,</b> during nine months of follow-up, <b>passive</b> malaria <b>cases</b> <b>detection</b> was instituted, through a thick blood smear performed in every child with fever. School performance was evaluated by the final notes in Mathematics and Portuguese Language. Performance was considered poor when either of the final notes in these disciplines was below the 50 th percentile for the respective class and grade. Results The total number of students followed-up in the cohort was 198. Malarial attacks were reported in 70 (35. 4 %) of these students, with no cases of severe disease. Plasmodium vivax was detected in 69. 2 % of the attacks, Plasmodium falciparum in 25. 5 % and both species in 5. 3 %. In the multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, mother's education, time living in the study area and school absenteeism, presenting with at least one episode of malaria independently predicted a poor performance at school [OR = 1. 91 (1. 04 - 3. 54); p = 0. 039]. Conclusion Non-severe malaria compromises the school performance of children even during a nine-month follow-up, potentially contributing to the maintenance of underdevelopment in countries endemic for malaria. This is the first evidence of such impact in Latin America, where P. vivax is responsible for the majority of the cases. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> remains low in many countries, {{compromising the}} {{efficacy}} of TB control efforts. Current global TB control policy emphasizes case finding through sputum smear microscopy for patients who self-report to primary health centers. Our objective {{was to assess the}} feasibility and yield of a simple active case finding strategy in a high incidence population in northern Lima, Peru. METHODS: We implemented this pilot strategy in one health center's catchment area. Health workers visited household contacts of new TB case subjects to identify symptomatic individuals and collect sputum for screening. Neighboring households were screened in the same manner. Secondary analyses measured risk of TB by (1) sputum smear status of the index case subject, (2) compliance with testing, and (3) risk factors for disease detected through active contact tracing in contrast to self-report. RESULTS: The TB prevalence detected through combined active and <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding among 1, 094 household contacts was 0. 91 % (914 per 100, 000), much higher than with <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding alone (0. 18 %; 183 per 100, 000; p= 0. 02). Among 2, 258 neighbors, the combined strategy detected a TB prevalence of 0. 22 % (221 per 100, 000) in contrast to 0. 08 % (80 per 100, 000) detected through <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding alone (p= 0. 25).

Indoor residual spraying coverage per cluster was more than 80 % for both years in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group. Incidence of clinical malaria was 0 · 047 per child-month at risk in the LLIN group and 0 · 044 per child-month at risk in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group in 2010, and 0 · 032 per child-month at risk in the LLIN group and 0 · 034 per child-month at risk in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group in 2011. The incident rate ratio was 1 · 08 (95 % CI 0 · 80 – 1 · 46) controlling for confounders and cluster by mixed-effect negative binomial regression on all malaria attacks for both years. No significant difference was recorded in the density of vector mosquitoes caught in light traps in houses over the two transmission seasons; the mean number of A gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes per trap per night was 6 · 7 (4 · 0 – 10 · 1) in the LLIN group and 4 · 5 (2 · 4 – 7 · 4) in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group (p= 0 · 281 in the random-effects linear regression model).

Both laboratory parameters of organ dysfunction and inflammatory cytokines were reduced during anti-parasite therapy in those patients with severe disease. Conclusion Different clinical presentations of vivax malaria infection present strong association with activation of pro-inflammatory responses and cytokine imbalance. These findings are of utmost importance to improve current knowledge about physiopathological concepts of this serious widespread disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sustaining {{elimination}} of malaria {{in areas with}} high receptivity and vulnerability will require effective strategies to prevent reestablishment of local transmission, {{yet there is a}} dearth of evidence about this phase. Mauritius offers a uniquely informative history, with {{elimination of}} local transmission in 1969, re-emergence in 1975, and second elimination in 1998. Towards this end, Mauritius’s elimination and prevention of reintroduction (POR) programs were analyzed via a comprehensive review of literature and government documents, supplemented by program observation and interviews with policy makers and program personnel. The impact of the country’s most costly intervention, a passenger screening program, was assessed quantitatively using simulation modeling. On average, Mauritius spent $ 4. 43 per capita per year (pcpy) during its second elimination campaign from 1982 to 1988. The country currently spends $ 2. 06 pcpy on its POR program that includes robust surveillance, routine vector control, and prompt and effective treatment and response. Thirty-five percent of POR costs are for a passenger screening program. Modeling suggests that the estimated 14 % of imported malaria infections identified by this program reduces the annual risk of indigenous transmission by approximately 2 %. Of cases missed by the initial passenger screening program, 49 % were estimated to be identified by <b>passive</b> or reactive <b>case</b> <b>detection,</b> leaving an estimated 3. 1 unidentified imported infections per 100, 000 inhabitants per year.

40|$|Background Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tbg) causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), {{one of the}} {{neglected}} tropical diseases {{targeted for}} elimination. Integration of diagnosis and case management into the general health system, sustainable monitoring of eliminated foci and development of safe and efficacious drugs, remain important challenges. Methods The DiTECT-HAT project tackles these challenges. For <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> <b>detection,</b> we will determine the diagnostic performance and cost of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) performed on clinical suspects in peripheral health centres, whether or not combined with serological and/or molecular tests on filter paper done at regional reference centres. Cost-effective diagnostic algorithms with high positive predictive values might allow test-and-treat scenarios {{without the need for}} complicated parasitological confirmations. Secondly, health workers performing house to house visits in foci with very low HAT prevalence can easily collect blood on filter paper and send it to regional HAT reference centres for analysis. The feasibility and cost of diagnostic algorithms with RDTs, serological and molecular high-throughput tests for post-elimination monitoring will be determined. An appropriate threshold will be established to trigger active case finding to avoid re-emergence of HAT, without unnecessarily raising the alarm. Finally, the accuracy of neopterin and RNA detection as early test-of-cure will be determined in therapeutic trials. Earlier treatment outcome assessment will speed up the development of new drugs for HAT, and improve management of relapses in routine care. Results An update of ongoing and planned activities is given. The <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> sub-project is being set up in DR Congo, Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea. The inclusions for the early test-of-cure sub-project are ongoing in DR Congo. Conclusions The proposed research will provide evidence to support policies for improved HAT diagnosis and patient management within a context of disease elimination, and will contribute to successful and sustainable HAT elimination.

40|$|Abstract Background Since 2005, Cambodia’s {{national}} tuberculosis programme {{has been}} conducting active case finding (ACF) with mobile radiography units, targeting household contacts of TB patients in poor and vulnerable communities in addition to routine <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding (PCF). This paper examines {{the differences in the}} demographic characteristics, smear grades, and treatment outcomes of pulmonary TB cases detected through both active and <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding to determine if ACF could contribute to early case finding, considering associated project costs for ACF. Methods Demographic characteristics, smear grades, and treatment outcomes were compared between actively (n[*]=[*] 405) and passively (n[*]=[*] 602) detected patients by reviewing the existing programme records (including TB registers) of 2009 and 2010.

40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>detection</b> by <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding (PCF) {{strategy}} {{alone is}} inadequate for detecting all tuberculosis (TB) cases in high burden settings especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Alternative <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> {{strategies such as}} community Active Case Finding (ACF) and Household Contact Investigations (HCI) are effective but empirical evidence of their cost-effectiveness is sparse. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether adding ACF or HCI compared with standard PCF alone represent cost-effective alternative TB <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> strategies in urban Africa. A static decision modeling framework was used to examine the costs and effectiveness of three TB <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> strategies: PCF alone, PCF+ACF, and PCF+HCI. Probability and cost estimates were obtained from National TB program data, primary studies conducted in Uganda, published literature and expert opinions. The analysis was performed from the societal and provider perspectives over a 1. 5 year time-frame. The main effectiveness measure was the number of true TB cases detected and the outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) expressed as cost in 2013 US$ per additional true TB case detected. Compared to PCF alone, the PCF+HCI strategy was cost-effective at US$ 443. 62 per additional TB case detected. However, PCF+ACF was not cost-effective at US$ 1492. 95 per additional TB case detected. Sensitivity analyses showed that PCF+ACF would be cost-effective if the prevalence of chronic cough in the population screened by ACF increased 10 -fold from 4 % to 40 % and if the program costs for ACF were reduced by 50 %. Under our baseline assumptions, the addition of HCI to an existing PCF program presented a more cost-effective strategy than the addition of ACF in the context of an African city. Therefore, implementation of household contact investigations as a part of the recommended TB control strategy should be prioritized...|$|R
40|$|Summary {{objective}} To {{compare the}} yield of active tuberculosis (TB) <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> {{among risk groups}} during home visits with passive detection among patients at health services. methods In April 2004, in a first phase, we introduced, active screening for coughing among all family members of patients that were visited at home by their family doctor or nurse for other reasons. Subsequently, from October 2004 onwards, active screening was restricted to family members belonging to groups at risk of TB. results The overall detection rate of TB increased from 6. 7 ⁄ 100 000 during passive detection at health services before the intervention to 26. 2 ⁄ 100 000 inhabitants when passive detection was com-plemented by active case finding. Active screening among risk groups yielded 35 TB cases per 1000 persons screened compared to 20 TB cases per 1000 persons passively screened at health services. Active case finding was particularly efficient in those coughing for 3 weeks or more (107 ⁄ 1000 screened). conclusion This study demonstrates that active case finding in groups at risk during home visits increases the <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> rate in the population and permits the identification of cases {{that may not be}} detected through <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding at health facility level...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comThe World Health Organization recommends <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> by regular health services as a minimum strategy for schistosomiasis morbidity control. To evaluate preparedness of the health systems in Ghana and Mali, we presented four clinical scenarios, two with blood in urine (main early symptom of Schistosoma haematobium) and two with (bloody) diarrhoea (main early symptom of S. mansoni), to health workers. We requested the health personnel for an initial diagnosis and case management strategy without providing information about our primary interest in schistosomiasis. The information {{was used to determine}} the chance that a person reporting with symptoms that might have been caused by schistosomiasis would receive praziquantel. All selected health workers participated. Their initial diagnosis was frequently S. haematobium for both scenarios with blood in urine. For the two scenarios with (bloody) diarrhoea, only few mentioned S. mansoni. At health centre level, case management in Mali mainly consisted of direct prescription of medication, whereas in Ghana health workers often referred to a hospital or requested a diagnostic test. The ultimate probability of prescribing praziquantel was relatively high for the scenarios with blood in urine, 60 % in Ghana and 75 % in Mali, but very low for both scenarios with (bloody) diarrhoea (< 20 %). Of those health care facilities that would prescribe praziquantel, 60 % (Ghana) and 80 % (Mali) had it in stock. In conclusion, the clinical scenario study showed that patients reporting with blood in urine will be treated with praziquantel at approximately half of the health care facilities, whereas of those presenting with (bloody) diarrhoea only few would receive treatment with praziquantel. Considering these facts, it is questionable if <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> is a sufficient basis for effective schistosomiasis morbidity control, especially for S. mansoni infection...|$|E

40|$|The {{surveillance}} of malaria is generally undertaken {{on the assumption}} that samples passively collected at health facilities are comparable to or representative of the broader Plasmodium reservoir circulating in the community. Further characterization and comparability of the hidden asymptomatic parasite reservoir are needed to inform on the potential impact of sampling bias. This study explores the impact of sampling strategy on molecular surveillance by comparing the genetic make-up of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax isolates collected by <b>passive</b> versus active <b>case</b> <b>detection.</b> Sympatric isolates of P. falciparum and P. vivax were collected from a large community survey and ongoing clinical surveillance studies undertaken in the hypomesoendemic setting of Mimika District (Papua, Indonesia). Plasmodium falciparum isolates were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci and P. vivax at eight loci. Measures of diversity and differentiation were used to compare different patient and parasitological sample groups. The results demonstrated that passively detected cases (symptomatic) had comparable population diversity to those circulating in the community (asymptomatic) in both species. In addition, asymptomatic patent infections were as diverse as subpatent infections. However, a significant difference in multiplicity of infection (MOI) and percentage of polyclonal infections was observed between actively and passively detected P. vivax cases (mean MOI: 1. 7 ± 0. 7 versus 1. 4 ± 1. 4, respectively; P = 0. 001). The study findings infer that, in hypomesoendemic settings, passive sampling is appropriate for molecular parasite surveillance strategies using the predominant clone in any given infection; however, the findings suggest caution when analyzing complexity of infection. Further evaluation is required in other endemic settings...|$|R
40|$|SETTING: Thyolo district, rural Malawi. OBJECTIVES: To compare <b>passive</b> {{with active}} <b>case</b> finding among {{household}} contacts of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients for 1) TB <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> and 2) {{the proportion of}} child contacts aged under 6 years who are placed on isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: <b>Passive</b> and active <b>case</b> finding was conducted among household contacts, and the uptake of INH preventive therapy in children was assessed. RESULTS: There were 189 index TB cases and 985 household contacts. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among index cases was 69 %. Prevalence of TB by <b>passive</b> <b>case</b> finding among 524 household contacts was 0. 19 % (191 / 100000), which was significantly lower than with active finding among 461 contacts (1. 74 %, 1735 / 100000, P = 0. 01). Of 126 children in the passive cohort, 22 (17 %) received INH, while in the active cohort 25 (22 %) of 113 children received the drug. Transport costs associated with chest X-ray (CXR) screening were the major reason for low INH uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Where the majority of TB patients are HIV-positive, active case finding among household contacts yields nine times more TB cases and {{is an opportunity for}} reducing TB morbidity and mortality.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Naturally {{acquired}} immunity to clinical malaria {{is thought to}} be mainly antibody-mediated, but reports on antigen targets are contradictory. Recognition of multiple antigens may be crucial for protection. In this study, the magnitude of antibody responses and their temporal stability was assessed for a panel of malaria antigens in relation to protection against clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria. METHODS: Malian children aged two to 14 years were enrolled in a longitudinal study and followed up by <b>passive</b> and active <b>case</b> <b>detection</b> for seven months. Plasma was collected at enrolment and at the beginning, in the middle and {{after the end of the}} transmission season. Antibody titres to the P. falciparum-antigens apical membrane protein (AMA) - 1, merozoite surface protein (MSP) - 1 (1) (9), MSP- 3, glutamine-rich protein (GLURP-R 0) and circumsporozoite antigen (CSP) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 99 children with plasma available at all time points. Parasite carriage was determined by microscopy and nested PCR. RESULTS: Antibody titres to all antigens, except MSP- 1 (1) (9), and the number of antigens recognized increased with age. After malaria exposure, antibody titres increased in children that had low titres at baseline, but decreased in those with high baseline responses. No significant differences were found between antibody titers for individual antigens between children remaining symptomatic or asymptomatic after exposure, after adjustment for age. Instead, children remaining asymptomatic following parasite exposure had a broader repertoire of antigen recognition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides immune-epidemiological evidence from a limited cohort of Malian children that strong recognition of multiple antigens, rather than antibody titres for individual antigens, is associated with protection from clinical malaria...|$|R
