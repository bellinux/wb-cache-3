40|$|The {{risk from}} {{potentially}} toxic elements in playground soils {{is of concern}} to children’s health {{as a result of}} the potential for intentional or unintentional consumption. Current approaches, based on total potentially toxic element concentration, may overestimate the risk. This has resulted in the development and use of in vitro gastrointestinal extraction protocols. The concentration of arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) in soils collected from 12 schools in north-east England has been compared with Soil Guideline Values from seven countries as well as reported literature concentrations for playgrounds and recreational parks. It was found that the mean As concentration of 14. 1 ± 5. 4 mg/kg does not exceed the England residential Soil Guideline Value in any location, while the mean Pb concentration of 298 ± 380 mg/kg is high but not excessive. Both concentrations have been assessed using the maximum <b>potential</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> from soil that a child could ingest. Based on this protocol Pb does not exceed the tolerable daily intake in any playground location, while As is generally 10 times lower than the oral index dose in the majority of playgrounds. The oral bioaccessibility of As and Pb was investigated. It was concluded that the highest concentrations were determined in the gastric phase with maximum bioaccessibilities of 54 and 46 % for As and Pb, respectively. Here we have demonstrated that minimal risk arises from the investigated playgrounds provided that good personal hygiene is adhered to...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{impact of}} soil chemical properties and different wheat genotypes in Croatia on micronutrient and toxic elements content in wheat integral flour. Methods Research was conducted and soil {{samples were collected}} from two different production areas in the Republic of Croatia: Ovčara and Dalj. Besides soil samples, grain samples of four different Croatian wheat genotypes were also collected and analyzed. In total, 40 samples of soil and 40 samples of wheat grain were analysed for total (aqua regia) and plant available (EDTA extraction) heavy metal content of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd. Results Determined soil pHKCl ranged from 5. 63 to 6. 25 at Ovčara and from 6. 95 to 7. 37 at Dalj sampling sites. The highest total concentration of heavy metals in soil were determined for Fe, followed by Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb and the lowest total concentration wasrecorded for Cd. The highest EDTA concentrations in soil were determined for Mn, than followed by Fe, Cu, Pb, and the lowest EDTA concentration was recorded for Cd. The highest concentration in integral wheat flour was found for Fe, than lower for Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb and the lowest concentration was found for Cd. If consumers in Croatia used daily 203 g of bread made of integral flour, they would take 2. 31 to 8. 44 µg Cd daily, depending on soil and wheat genotype. Conclusion The analysed soil and winter wheat genotypes have significant impact on <b>potential</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of toxic and essentialheavy metals by integral flour or bread...|$|E

Particular concern has surrounded the exposure to Pb indicated {{by the presence of}} highly elevated concentrations of Pb in blood and hair samples. This study utilizes a physiologically-based in-vitro extraction method to assess the bioaccessibility of PHEs in surface soils and metallurgical waste in Mitrovica and assesses the <b>potential</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of soil-bound PHEs. Maximum As (210 mg kg− 1), Cd (38 mg kg− 1), Cu (410 mg kg− 1), Pb (18790 mg kg− 1) and Zn (8500 mg kg− 1) concentrations in surface soils (0 – 10 cm) are elevated above guideline values. Samples with high PHE concentrations (e. g. As > 1000 mg kg− 1; Pb > 1500 mg kg− 1) exhibit a wide range of bioaccessibilities (5. 40 – 92. 20 % in the gastric (G) phase and 10. 00 – 55. 80 % in the gastric–intestinal (G–I) phase). Samples associated with lower bioaccessibilities typically contain a number of XRD-identifiable primary and secondary mineral phases, particularly As- and Pb-bearing arsenian pyrite, beudantite, galena and cerrusite. Quantification of the potential human exposure risk associated with the ingestion of soil-associated PHEs indicates that on average, 0. 01 μg Cd kg− 1 BW d− 1, 0. 16 μg Cu kg− 1 BW d−- 1, 0. 12 μg As kg− 1 BW d− 1, 7. 81 μg Pb kg− 1 BW d− 1, and 2. 68 μg Zn kg− 1 BW d− 1 could be bioaccessible following ingestion of PHE-rich soils in the Mitrovica region, with Pb, {{and to a lesser extent}} As, indicating the likely possibility of local populations exceeding the recommended tolerable daily intake. Lead present within surface soils of the area could indeed have contributed to the human Pb burden due to the high bioaccessibility of Pb present within these soils (13. 40 – 92. 20 % in the gastric phase).

Grasses generally predominate in such pastures, with varying proportions of legumes. Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) (simple sugars, starch, and fructan) can induce laminitis experimentally, and NSC can accumulate to > 400 g/kg of dry matter (DM) in pasture grasses. In this article we discuss the environmental factors affecting NSC accumulation in pastures and estimate the <b>potential</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> of pasture NSC by grazing horses.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} the nutrients in shallots, after harvest, various protocols, including incubation, drying or lyophiliza-tion of the shallot are developed in this study. Using aqueous extracts of ground shallot powders, this study examines the antioxidative properties of shallots on the formation of hydroxyl radical species (•OH) generated via a Fenton-type reaction. A ribose degradation assay shows that all aqueous extracts of shallot prepared in this study exhibit enhanced levels of •OH, suggesting that processed shallot, like strong reductants such as ascorbate, has a strong reducing power, which converts Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + in a Fenton’s reaction and increases the levels of •OH. A DNA integrity assay shows that fragmentation of super-coiled plasmid DNA, pGEM- 7 Zf(-), by •OH is diminished {{in the presence of}} all shallot aqueous extracts, albeit to various extents. Finally, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments show that lyophilized shallot completely scavenges •OH, as evidenced by the disappearance of the EPR-active reaction product generated be-tween spin trap, 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), and •OH.

40|$|When a rodent licks a sweet-tasting solution, taste {{circuits}} in {{the central}} nervous system that facilitate stimulus identification, motivate intake, and prepare the body for digestion are activated. Here, we asked whether taste also determines <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of sugar solutions in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. We tested several dilute concentrations of glucose (167, 250, and 333 mM) and fructose (167, 250, and 333 mM). In addition, we tested saccharin (38 mM), alone and in binary mixture with each of the sugar concentrations, to manipulate sweet taste intensity while holding caloric value constant. In experiment 1, we measured taste responsiveness to the sweetener solutions in two ways: chorda tympani nerve responses and short-term lick tests. For both measures, the mice exhibited the following relative magnitude of responsiveness: binary mixtures > saccharin > individual sugars. In experiment 2, we asked whether the taste measures reliably predicted <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of the sweetener solutions. No such relationship was observed. The glucose solutions elicited weak taste responses but high <b>daily</b> <b>intakes,</b> whereas the fructose solutions elicited weak taste responses and low <b>daily</b> <b>intakes.</b> On the other hand, the saccharin + glucose solutions elicited strong taste responses and high <b>daily</b> <b>intakes,</b> while the saccharin + fructose solutions elicited strong taste responses but low <b>daily</b> <b>intakes.</b> Overall, we found that 1) <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of the sweetener solutions varied independently of the magnitude of the taste responses and 2) the solutions containing glucose stimulated substantially higher <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> than did the solutions containing isomolar concentrations of fructose.

The creatinine correction approach, {{as well as the}} urine volume approach in a simple one compartment model were used to calculate the daily urinary MEP excretion rates and DEP intake rates in individual survey participants. Using multiple regression models, we have estimated least square geometric means (LSGMs) of body-weight-adjusted MEP concentration, <b>daily</b> excretion and <b>intake</b> rates among different age groups and sex. We observed that body weight affects the trends in the MEP concentrations significantly among children (aged 6 – 11 years), adolescents (aged 12 – 19 years) and adults (aged 20 – 49 years). The body-weight-adjusted MEP concentrations in children were significantly higher than those in adults. On the other hand the DEP <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> in children were significantly lower than those in adults. We did not observe any differences in the DEP <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> rates between males and females. Although the urinary MEP concentrations are correlated well with DEP <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> estimates in the overall population, one should be cautious when directly using the urinary concentrations to compare the intake trends in the sub-populations (e. g. children vs. adults) as these trends are governed by additional physiological factors.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 80 % of the mortality in persons with type 2 diabetes, with the age-adjusted relative risk of death due to CVD being 2 to 4 times {{higher than in the}} general population. There is considerable evidence that a diet enriched with n- 3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3), protects against anti-inflammatory process, atherosclerotic heart disease, myocardial infarction and sudden death. The aim of the study is to estimate and compare the mean <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of EPA and DHA polyunsaturated fatty acids in type 2 diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects. The mean <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> of EPA and DHA were also compared with several dietary recommendations to prevent cardiovascular diseases. The study was performed in 150 Portuguese type 2 diabetic patients and 143 nondiabetic subjects. The study population was divided into three groups: group I- 75 diabetics with angiopathy; group II- 75 diabetics without angiopathy and group III- 143 nondiabetic subjects. The statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe test. Nutrients intake were estimated from a food-frequency questionnaire previously validated for Portuguese adults with cardiovascular disease by the Epidemiology Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oporto. Group III had a lower mean EPA <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> (96 mg/day) compared to the mean values obtained for groups I (115 mg/day) and II (114 mg/day). For DHA, groups I and II had the same mean <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> (260 mg/day), which was higher than the mean value estimated for group III (216 mg/day). Statistical differences were achieved for EPA and DHA <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> between diabetic patients and nondiabetic patients. According to the recommendations of the French Food Safety Agency, American Dietetic Association and the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids, to prevent cardiovascular diseases, the sum of EPA+DHA <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> should provide 500 mg/day. All groups in the study had a mean <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> significantly different than the recommended value, but the prevalence of subjects with <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> lower than the recommended values was for each group, respectively: group I - 75 %, group II - 79 % and group III - 93 %. As recommended by the French Food Safety Agency, the mean <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> of DHA for all study groups were higher than 120 mg/day. The <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of EPA and DHA is similar between diabetics with and without angiopathy, but higher in diabetics compared to nondiabetic subjects. These results suggest that diabetic patients are more concern with the diet than nondiabetic subjects. The prevalence of EPA and DHA <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> below the recommended values is very high in the study population. This fact is associated with a higher risk to develop cardiovascular disease and with a lower ability to protect against inflammatory process in diabetes.
