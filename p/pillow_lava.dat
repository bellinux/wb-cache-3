5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form <b>pillow</b> <b>lava,</b> through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. <b>Pillow</b> <b>lava</b> is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E
5|$|Alexander S. Lloyd, {{a student}} of Dickinson College, focused on the cooling rates of pillow lavas. Lloyd studied in detail the {{variation}} in crystal sizes from the edge pristine <b>pillow</b> <b>lava,</b> which could have derived from nearby Pillow Ridge which last erupted during the Pleistocene period.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. <b>Pillow</b> <b>lava</b> is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
50|$|The Siletz River Volcanics, {{located in}} the Oregon Coast Range, United States, are a {{sequence}} of basaltic <b>pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> that make up part of Siletzia. The basaltic <b>pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> originally came from submarine volcanoes that existed during the Eocene.|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of <b>pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> in the oldest preserved volcanic sequences on the planet, the Isua and Barberton greenstone belts, confirms the {{presence of}} large bodies {{of water on the}} Earth's surface early in the Archean. <b>Pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> are used generally to confirm subaqueous volcanism in metamorphic belts.|$|R
5|$|This {{life cycle}} {{consists}} of several stages. The first stage is the submarine preshield stage, currently represented solely by Lōʻihi Seamount. During this stage, the volcano builds height through increasingly frequent eruptions. The sea's pressure prevents explosive eruptions. The cold water quickly solidifies the lava, producing the <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> that {{is typical of}} underwater volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism at La Reforma began {{during the}} Pliocene, with ash flows and subaqueous pumice flows. Later {{activity}} became subaerial and generated <b>pillow</b> <b>lava.</b> Of the local volcanoes, La Reforma {{was the first}} to emerge from the sea. Four to five million years ago, basaltic dykes formed. Volcanic activity at La Reforma occurred between 1.6 and 1.4 million years ago, and at least four ignimbrites have been found there.|$|E
5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is <b>pillow</b> <b>lava,</b> named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.|$|E

5|$|After the side-scan sonar aboard Geosounder was {{switched}} {{out for the}} ROV (again {{delayed by}} technical issues and more bad weather), the survey ship returned to Sydneys wreck site on 3 April, and performed a detailed study {{of the ship and}} her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on Kormoran and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of <b>pillow</b> <b>lava),</b> before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, with the objective of using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underwater}} flow is <b>pillow</b> <b>lava,</b> a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape. Less common are glassy, marginal sheet flows, indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks {{are common in}} shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption rates start to die down, and water erosion grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the seamount in alkalic flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some exemplary seamounts are Loihi Seamount, Bowie Seamount, Davidson Seamount, and Axial Seamount.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> are lavas {{that contain}} {{characteristic}} pillow-shaped structures that {{are attributed to}} the extrusion of the lava under water, or subaqueous extrusion. <b>Pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> in volcanic rock are characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses, commonly up to one metre in diameter. They form {{the upper part of}} 'Layer 2' of normal oceanic crust.|$|R
50|$|Nature of effusive activity: short, locally <b>pillowed,</b> <b>lava</b> flows; lavas may be rare.|$|R
5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E

25|$|The Cassiar Mountains and Tanzilla Plateau in {{northern}} British Columbia {{are dominated by}} tuyas of the broad Tuya Volcanic Field. These flat-topped, steep-sided subglacial volcanoes were formed when magma intruded into and melted a vertical pipe in the overlying Cordilleran Ice Sheet. At least six volcanoes formed beneath glacial ice close to Tuya Lake, including Ash Mountain, South Tuya, Tuya Butte, Mathews Tuya. Ash Mountain {{at the head of}} Parallel Creek consists of <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> and hyaloclastite, South Tuya consists of loose volcanic debris with basaltic dikes intruding into the volcano and Tuya Butte and Mathews Tuya consist of <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> and hyaloclastite on its lower flanks with subaerially erupted lava flows at their flat-topped summits.|$|E

50|$|Two {{formations}} {{associated with}} submarine eruptions are seamounts and <b>pillow</b> <b>lavas.</b> <b>Pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> are created due to rapid cooling of lava which forms a skin. As more magma is forced into this the skin expands creating a lobe. When this fractures then lava seeps {{through the gap}} exposing hot lava to the water and again a skin forms over this: this process is then repeated.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{formation}} of the Facho-Pico Alto Volcanic Complex was a phase of intense volcanism, resulting from submarine eruptions as early as 5 million years ago, resulting in the {{formation of}} Pico do Facho and extensive <b>pillow</b> <b>lavas.</b> Remnants of these <b>pillow</b> <b>lavas</b> can be identified 180 m above sea level, helping to increase the size of the island to roughly its current dimensions.|$|R

25|$|The ideal {{lava flow}} {{will have a}} {{brecciated}} top, either as <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> development, autobreccia and rubble typical of aā and viscous flows, or a vesicular or frothy carapace such as scoria or pumice.

25|$|Komatiites often show <b>pillow</b> <b>lava</b> structure, autobrecciated upper margins {{consistent}} with underwater eruption forming a rigid upper skin to the lava flows. Proximal volcanic facies are thinner and interleaved with sulfidic sediments, black shales, cherts and tholeiitic basalts. Komatiites were produced from a relatively wet mantle. Evidence {{of this is}} from their association with felsics, occurrences of komatiitic tuffs, Niobium anomalies and by S- and H2O-borne rich mineralizations.|$|E

25|$|Lying {{just on the}} {{northern}} flank of Hoodoo Mountain is a small tuya known as Little Bear Mountain. This related Pleistocene age subglacial volcano consists of alkaline basalt and erupted mainly pyroclastic breccia with minor amounts of massive lava, <b>pillow</b> <b>lava,</b> volcanic sandstone and hyaloclastite. Cross-cutting veinlets of obsidian indicate these volcanics were formed by partial melting in the mantle beneath Little Bear Mountain. Mantle xenoliths found at Little Bear Mountain may have originated from mid-crustal depths.|$|E
25|$|Underwater fissural eruptions {{originated}} from the <b>pillow</b> <b>lava,</b> which {{are produced by}} the rapid cooling of the magma when it comes in contact with water, obtaining their peculiar shape. This pillow-lava accumulated, constructing {{the base of the}} island underneath the sea.

The volcanic eruptions became more violent and had a more explosive character, and resulted in the forming of peculiar geological fragments.|$|E
