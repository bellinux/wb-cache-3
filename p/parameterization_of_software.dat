40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{has taken place}} in recent times in the area of <b>parameterization</b> <b>of</b> <b>software</b> defined radio (SDR) architecture. Parameterization decreases the size of the software to be downloaded and also limits the hardware reconfiguration time. The present paper is based on the design and development of a programmable baseband modulator that perform the QPSK modulation schemes and as well as its other three commonly used variants to satisfy the requirement of several established 2 G and 3 G wireless communication standards. The proposed design {{has been shown to be}} capable of operating at a maximum data rate of 77 Mbps on Xilinx Virtex 2 -Pro University field programmable gate array (FPGA) board. The pulse shaping root raised cosine (RRC) filter has been implemented using distributed arithmetic (DA) technique in the present work in order to reduce the computational complexity, and to achieve appropriate power reduction and enhanced throughput. The designed multiplier-less programmable 32 -tap FIR-based RRC filter has been found to withstand a peak inter-symbol interference (ISI) distortion of - 41 dB...|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} {{of an effective}} and efficient IAEA safeguards approach at large scale reprocessing facilities with large throughput and continuous flow of nuclear material requires the introduction of enhanced safeguards measures to provide added assurance about the absence of diversion of nuclear material and confirmation that the facility is operated as declared. One of the enhanced safeguards measures, a Solution Monitoring and Measurement System (SMMS), comprising data collection instruments, data transmission equipment and an advanced Solution Monitoring Software (SMS), is being implemented at a large scale reprocessing plant in Japan. SMS is designed {{as a tool to}} enable automatic calculations of volumes, densities and flow-rates in selected process vessels, including most of the vessels of the main nuclear material stream. This software also includes automatic features to support the inspectorate in verifying inventories and inventory changes. The software also enables one to analyze the flows of nuclear material within the process and of specified “cycles” of operation, and, in order to provide assurance that the facility is being operated as declared to compare these with those expected (reference signatures). The configuration and parameterization work (especially the analytical and comparative work) for the implementation and configuration of the SMS has been carried out jointly between the IAEA, Euriware-France (the software developer) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) -Ispra. This paper describes the main features of the SMS, including the principles underlying the automatic analysis functionalities. It then focuses on the collaborative work performed by the JRC-Ispra, Euriware and the IAEA for the <b>parameterization</b> <b>of</b> the <b>software</b> (vessels and cycles of operation), including the current status and the future challenges.

This paper studies the construction <b>of</b> piecewise linear <b>parameterizations</b> <b>of</b> triangulations and <b>of</b> discrete <b>parameterizations</b> <b>of</b> sets of unorganized points. Such parameterizations are useful tools for the approximation of triangulations by smoother surfaces {{as well as}} for the construction of triangulations from unorganized points. Parameterization can also be used as the starting point for multiresolution analysis of triangulations, through remeshing by triangulations with subdivision connectivity. ...|$|R
