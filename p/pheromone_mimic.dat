50|$|<b>Pheromone</b> <b>mimic</b> lures are commercially {{available}} from ISCA Technologies. This pheromone lure is formulated to constantly emit the optimal level of <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimic</b> to attract males to monitoring glue traps, allowing growers to monitor {{for the presence}} and density of the pest population in the field. By using pheromone traps, growers know where, how much, and when to trigger control measures.|$|E
5000|$|The mimic {{pheromone}} used {{in monitoring}} lures {{also provided a}} viable nontoxic alternative of locust bean moth control. When the mimic pheromone is formulated into SPLAT, {{it can be used}} to control moth populations through [...] "mating disruption" [...] in date gardens and pomegranate and almond orchards. Extensive field trials with the mimic pheromone formulation SPLAT EC and its organic counterpart, SPLAT EC-Organic, have proven that effective season-long control of populations in date gardens is achieved after a single application of the <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimic</b> formulation. SPLAT EC or SPLAT EC-Organic are deployed as preventive measures to protect an area from locust bean moth infestation. The products do not [...] "kill" [...] the moths, they control populations by disrupting their mating with the volatiles of the <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimic</b> emitted by SPLAT EC and SPLAT EC-O. Hence, the timing of the product application is important to optimally target the mating season.|$|E
50|$|Orchids of {{the genus}} Ophrys use sexual {{deception}} to attract pollinators to their flowers. In sexual deception, an orchid attracts male pollinators by producing the sex pheromone of virgin female pollinators {{in addition to providing}} visual and tactile cues (Schiestl 2005; Schluter et al. 2009; Stokl et al. 2009). These signals stimulate mating behavior in the male pollinators, which then attempt copulation, called “pseudocopulation”, with the orchid labellum (Schluter et al. 2009). During pseudocopulation, pollen from the flower’s column becomes attached to some part of the pollinator, usually the head or abdomen, and the pollinator inadvertently carries and transfers this pollen to other flowers when they are once again enticed into pseudocopulation. While the morphological cues such as the shape and texture of the labellum play a role especially at close range in inducing the pollinator mating behavior, the orchid’s <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimic,</b> or allomone, has been shown to play the most important role in enticing pollinators to the flower (Schiestl 2005; Schluter et al. 2009).|$|E
50|$|The bird {{dropping}} spider stays motionless on its web {{during the}} day, only hunting for prey at night. It hangs {{down from a}} single silk thread and releases a <b>pheromone</b> which <b>mimics</b> the sex smells released by female moths. When a moth comes near, the spider will capture it with its powerful front legs. They {{can be found in}} Australia, mainly along the eastern and southern coasts.|$|R
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a <b>pheromone</b> that <b>mimics</b> the sex {{attractant}} of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers of}} C. robinsonii exude a scent that <b>mimics</b> <b>pheromones</b> {{of the female}} thynnid wasp, which attracts male wasps that {{pollinate}} the flowers. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to absorb nutrients.|$|R
50|$|Female Phengaris {{lay eggs}} on {{specific}} {{plants such as}} thyme. After about three weeks, larvae hatch to feed on the seeds and flowers of the plant. The caterpillar will stay {{in the vicinity of}} its food plant until its 4th instar, when it will drop to the ground. From there the caterpillar will adopt various strategies to be found by Myrmica ants. Several caterpillar species of Phengaris, such as P. rebeli and P. alcon, will secrete pheromones that are specific to their respective hosts. The purpose of such behaviour is to mimic the pheromones of ant larvae that will become workers in the future. By successfully mimicking ant larvae, the caterpillars are taken back to the host nest and fed by the ants. Originally it was thought that the large blue butterfly behaved differently in that some believed it either secreted a poor <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimic,</b> or did not secrete one at all. Today it has been determined that it still secretes semiochemicals as a form of chemical mimicry to gain acceptance into the host ant nest. Large blue caterpillars will sometimes follow ant trails or move away from the food plant during peak-foraging time to expose themselves specifically to Myrmica and not other ants. This results in workers generally ignoring the caterpillar once in the nest because it does not attract attention. The methods in which large blue caterpillars interact with the host ants are not yet known.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigated spawning {{biology of}} female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus. Females mate following the terminal molt and undertake a spawning migration seaward, producing multiple clutches of larvae. To examine lifetime reproductive potential of female crabs, individual crabs were confined {{in the field}} from terminal molt to death. Crabs produced up to 7 clutches over 1 - 2 spawning seasons and survived up to 394 d after the terminal molt. Time to first clutch and time between clutches were positively correlated with carapace width and best described by degree-days. Size at maturity was negatively correlated with water temperature {{on the day of}} the terminal molt. Most measurements of clutch quality and larval fitness were similar for all clutches. The percentage of embryos developing normally decreased 40 % from clutch 1 to clutch 4 and clutch volume decreased 50 % from clutch 1 to clutch 5. Thus, most of a crab's reproductive output is from the first few clutches. Using swimming and abdominal pumping assays, the roles of pheromones in larval release and migratory behavior were investigated. Following delivery of egg extract, bradykinin (a <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimic),</b> and trypsin (an enzyme that generates peptide pheromones), ovigerous crabs responded with increased abdominal pumping, indicating that peptide pheromones stimulate larval release in blue crabs. Ovigerous crabs responded with increased swimming following delivery of egg extract, but not following delivery of a peptide <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimic</b> or an enzyme that produces peptide pheromones. These results suggest that some substance generated from the egg mass stimulates vertical swimming, but that peptides alone do not stimulate swimming. A blend of molecules, possibly including sugars, may be the cue that stimulates swimming behavior. Endogenous rhythms in vertical swimming, a mechanism underlying migration in tidal estuaries, were examined in the laboratory under constant conditions in juvenile females, recently-molted females, and females with mature ovaries from Beaufort, NC. Rhythms were variable in each stage, though circatidal rhythms consistent with ebb tide transport were observed in juvenile females and recently-molted females. Crabs with mature ovaries typically swam around the time of high tide. Rhythms were also examined for ovigerous females collected from estuaries with three different tidal regimes: semi-diurnal, diurnal, and non-tidal. Crabs from the tidal estuaries had circatidal or circalunidian swimming rhythms with period lengths corresponding to the tidal period of their home estuary. Swimming occurred primarily on ebb tide. Crabs from the non-tidal estuary had a circadian rhythm of vertical swimming around the time of sunset. Such a rhythm has no obvious migratory significance and migration likely takes place though another mechanism. Swimming behavior was also examined in the field in one non-tidal site and three tidal sites. Crabs were tethered in the field and swimming was monitored using archival pressure tags. Crabs tethered in the non-tidal site did not swim, possibly due to the lack of necessary environmental cues. Crabs at the tidal sites swam primarily on ebb tides. Swimming was greatest at the deepest site, which also had the strongest currents. This site is known to be a migratory area for spawning blue crabs. Decreased swimming behavior was observed at the two shallower sites, including one site that is known to be habitat for all stages of blue crabs. These results indicate that swimming behavior is variable among different areas in a single estuary. In areas where swimming is reduced, crabs may continue migrating seaward by walking or may spend additional time in that area to forage. Within each site, peak swimming generally occurred during the time of the most rapid decrease in water level, suggesting that hydrostatic pressure may serve as a cue for swimming. Mark-recapture studies were conducted in three rivers (North River, South River, Adams Creek) in eastern North Carolina, and recently-molted female crabs were tagged to ensure a relatively constant time since molting. Most crabs traveled relatively short distances and were recaptured before producing a clutch of eggs. Individuals that moved substantial distances typically moved down-estuary. The Adams Creek canal, connecting Adams Creek with the Newport River estuary, functioned as a migratory corridor, as crabs from both Adams Creek and South River migrated down the canal, presumably using ebb tide transport. Many of the crabs that migrated down the canal into the Newport River were recaptured while ovigerous. Results of this study support the hypothesis that rapid long-distance migratory movements do not begin until production of the first clutch of eggs, though some down-estuary movement takes place by prior to production of the first clutch of eggs. Female blue crabs mate following the terminal molt and begin moving seaward soon thereafter by walking and swimming. Once the appropriate salinity (> 22 ppt) is reached, the first clutch of eggs is produced and migration rate rapidly increases. Blue crab spawning biology should be similar throughout the range of the species. After taking latitudinal temperature variation and other local variables into account, results presented here should be applicable not only to blue crabs in North Carolina, but in other areas as well.

5000|$|A {{striking}} {{example of}} phoresy is that planidia of beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe will form a group and produce a <b>pheromone</b> that <b>mimics</b> the sex attractant of its host bee species; when the male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen, and from there they transfer in turn to a female bee, and finally to the bee nest, where they attack the bee larvae as their hosts.http://esa.confex.com/esa/2007/techprogram/paper_32157.htm ...|$|R
40|$|Physical fights are {{the usual}} means of {{establishing}} dominance hierarchies in animal societies. This form of dominance behaviour is most strongly expressed in honeybee queens {{who engage in}} fights to the death to establish themselves in the colony. Workers can also compete for reproductive dominance resulting {{in the establishment of}} stable hierarchies. They do not engage each other physically, but use <b>pheromones</b> that <b>mimic</b> those produced by queens. The dynamics of pheromone production in paired workers suggests that they engage in a pheromonal contest. Because queen pheromones suppress ovary activation, the contest results in the sterility of the loser...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Western {{flower thrips}} Frankliniella occidentalis {{produces}} conspicuous anal droplets that {{function as a}} direct defense against various predators. These droplets also function in pheromonal communication in that they contain a mixture of decyl acetate and dodecyl acetate, which acts as an alarm. Exposure of thrips to synthetic pheromone is known to promote takeoff or refuge seeking, but {{the effect of the}} natural pheromone has not yet been studied. Here, we not only studied the response to natural pheromone, but also tested the new hypothesis that the alarm pheromone primes a defensive response in thrips. This test was carried out by measuring the reaction time to a simulated predator attack after exposure to synthetic or natural alarm pheromone (against a control with no pheromone at all). The reaction was quantified in terms of the time it takes a thrips larva to produce a droplet after attack. We found that thrips larvae produce droplets of alarm pheromone faster when cues associated with danger are present. There {{were no significant differences in}} reaction times of responses to synthetic pheromone, natural pheromone, or odors from a patch with a predator attacking a thrips larva. This implies that the synthetic <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimics</b> the natural <b>pheromone,</b> and that other cues emanating from the predator play a minor role. We conclude that the alarm pheromone increases the vigilance of the thrips, and this may promote its survival...|$|R
50|$|In 1990, 400 A. mellifera c. colonies {{were moved}} into the {{vicinity}} of A. mellifera s. species.

Dietemann et al. was able to prove that A. mellifera c. worker parasites were able to produce mandibular <b>pheromones</b> that <b>mimic</b> that of A. mellifera s. queens while in their presence. The resulting breakdown of the division of labor leads to desertion or death of the parasitized colony.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigated larval {{release and}} larval {{behavior of the}} Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus and the spotted spiny lobster P. guttatus. These species were examined under laboratory conditions to determine the phase relationship between larval release and natural environmental cycles. P. argus displayed a nocturnal tidal rhythm, while P. guttatus displayed a circadian rhythm in larval release. P. argus releases larvae near the time of nocturnal high slack water, while P. guttatus released larvae near the time of sunrise. The role of 'pumping pheromones' in controlling larval release behaviors was tested by measuring the pumping response of ovigerous P. argus to (1) hatch water, (2) homogenized-embryo water, (3) embryo-conditioned water, and (4) water containing homogenized-egg cases. Lobsters with late-stage embryos displayed increased pleopod pumping with increased concentration of hatch water. Water individually conditioned with homogenized late-stage embryos, intact late-stage embryos, and homogenized egg-cases induced pumping activity in females with late-stage embryos, indicating {{the presence of a}} chemical cue. I quantified pumping responses upon exposure to synthetic peptides to determine if they <b>mimicked</b> <b>pheromones</b> that induce larval release behaviors. Pumping behavior was evoked by oligopeptides with a basic amino acid at the carboxy-terminus, preceded by several neutral amino acids. Carboxyl-terminal arginine peptides serve as <b>pheromone</b> <b>mimics.</b> I investigated whether these peptides originate from the action of trypsin-like enzymes by conducting a bioassay measuring pumping activity of ovigerous P. argus subjected to increasing concentrations of trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, and a combination of the two. Pumping activity increased with increasing concentrations of trypsin and trypsin inhibitor, while behaviors ceased when ovigerous females were subjected to a complex of the two. Pheromones are generated by trypsin-like enzymes assisting in the degradation of the egg membranes at the time of hatching. Vertical swimming behaviors of stage-I phyllosoma larvae of P. argus and P. guttatus were observed under laboratory conditions. P. argus larvae displayed a pattern of twilight vertical migration, while P. guttatus larvae displayed nocturnal diel vertical migration (DVM). Rhythms persisted for 5 - 6 cycles under constant conditions, indicating that an endogenous rhythm in activity plays a proximate role in DVM for both species. Dissertatio...|$|R
5000|$|As {{pollination}} {{is vital}} for the plants in the Brazilian rain forests, some plant species have developed pheromone mimicry to attract the drones of S. postica. Virgin S. postica queens have a mixture of 2-alkanols in the pheromones that attract the drones for mating. Many Orchidacae species common in Brazilian rain forests, such as Mormolyca ringens, have a similar mixture of alkanes/alkenes that will attract those same drones to the flower.

50|$|Like apples, pears are self-incompatible {{and need}} to attract insects {{in order to be}} pollinated and produce fruit. One notable {{difference}} from apples is that pear blossoms are much less attractive to bees due to their pale coloring and light odor. Bees may abandon the pear blossoms to visit dandelions or a nearby apple orchard. The majority of pollinators of pear trees are honey bees, although pears are also visited by blow flies and hoverflies. A way to combat the low attraction of honey bees to pear blossoms is to use bee attractants to entice the bees to pollinate the flowers. Bee attractants may include <b>pheromones</b> that <b>mimic</b> the brood <b>pheromone</b> or the juvenile pheromone, or other attractants. There are also other methods for attracting honey bees to pear blossoms. One is saturation pollination, that is to stock so many bees that all area blossoms are worked regardless of the attractiveness to the bees. Another method is to delay the movement of the beehives into the orchards until there is about 30 percent bloom. The bees are moved into the orchard during the night and will usually visit the pear blossoms for a few hours until they discover the richer nectar sources. The recommended number of hives per acre is one.|$|R
