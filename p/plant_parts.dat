5|$|The German {{psychologist}} Adolf Zeising (1810–1876) {{claimed that}} the golden ratio was expressed in the arrangement of <b>plant</b> <b>parts,</b> in the skeletons of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, {{as well as in}} the geometry of crystals.|$|E
5|$|Despite its slow {{metabolism}} rate, the Sunda slow loris has a high-energy diet. Its slow lifestyle {{may be due}} to {{the energy}} costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets. The largest amount of time is spent eating phloem sap (34.9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> (31.7%), and fruits (22.5%). It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects. Gum is taken by licking wounds on trees. They are also known to feed on molluscs, including the giant land snail Achatina fulica, and birds' eggs.|$|E
5|$|The book covers many topics {{including}} {{the effects of}} scale on the shape of animals and plants, large ones necessarily being relatively thick in shape; the effects of surface tension in shaping soap films and similar structures such as cells; the logarithmic spiral as seen in mollusc shells and ruminant horns; the arrangement of leaves and other <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> (phyllotaxis); and Thompson's own method of transformations, showing the changes in shape of animal skulls and other structures on a Cartesian grid.|$|E

5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more probably an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard <b>plant</b> <b>parts,</b> such as seeds. The wear patterns on Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E
5|$|The marsh rice rat, O.couesi, and O.gorgasi {{are known}} to be omnivores, eating both plant and animal material. They eat both seeds and green <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> and consume a variety of animals, {{including}} insects, crustaceans, and many others. The barn owl (Tyto alba) is a major predator on the marsh rice rat and remains of O.antillarum, O.couesi, and O.gorgasi have been found in owl pellet deposits. Several other animals {{are known to}} prey on Oryzomys. A variety of parasites are known from O.couesi and the marsh rice rat and two parasitic nematodes have been found in O.gorgasi.|$|E

50|$|Dwarfing is {{the failure}} of a plant or a <b>plant</b> <b>part</b> to attain its full size.|$|R
5|$|The {{second factor}} {{is the value of}} protection: would the plant be less able to survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E
5|$|Cape sparrows {{primarily}} eat seeds, {{and also}} eat soft <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks {{to move around}} in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, a bush, a cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, {{and it is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{of only a few}} species has been studied in any detail, mainly those which are pests of commercially grown mushrooms.

25|$|Pathogens {{can lead}} to high {{reductions}} in crop yield. Cumin can be attacked by aphids (Myzus persicae) at the flowering stage. They suck the sap of the plant from tender parts and flowers. The plant becomes yellow, the seed formation is reduced (yield reduction), {{and the quality of}} the harvested product decreases. Heavily infested <b>plant</b> <b>parts</b> should be removed. Other important pests are the mites (Petrobia latens) which frequently attack the crop. Since the mites mostly feed on young leaves, the infestation is more severe on young inflorescences.|$|E

This assembly plant produced Rambler Americans, AMC Rebels, and later, Hornets, Concords, Gremlins, Spirits, and Eagles.
