40|$|The {{analysis}} {{is based on}} one year of transactional data from a major beverage company and interviews with asset based and non-asset based truckload carriers. Throughout our research we investigate the use of asset based carriers and brokers as unique sources of capacity on low volume and medium haul lanes. We examine price escalation issues {{in the context of}} load tender rejections and daily shipment volumes on a given lane. Our study revealed that as the shipment volume goes up on a lane, prices could escalate as much as 30 - 40 % over rates originally contracted with primary carriers. In the case of rejections though, as prices go up, the probability of not covering a load comes down. Additionally, we propose a lane aggregation methodology, which decreases variability and simplifies freight procurement for long and short haul shipments. Finally, through a carrier proximity study we demonstrate that distance from carrier domicile to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>location</b> has an impact on pricing for short haul shipments. Based on our findings, we identified building network robustness and creating available carrier capacity as critical factors to sustainable pricing, while still being able to maintain a high service level. by Lukasz Kafarski and David Allen Caruso, Jr. Thesis (M.

30|$|The {{shift towards}} online {{shopping}} in consumer behaviour {{has an impact}} on personal travel as well as freight transport. According to Suel and Polak [10], despite the recent rapid growth of digital retailing and online shopping, the impact on travel behaviour remains poorly understood. The authors provide a literature review of how online activity can be incorporated into operational transport demand models. Online shopping may replace individual trips to stores by home deliveries by retailers or third party carriers. Alternatively, ordered goods might be delivered to designated <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>locations</b> for collection hence will generate individual trips to these collection points. Suel and Polak [10] conclude that efforts are necessary to continue to develop modelling frameworks that successfully can combine urban logistics and individual travel demand models. Such capability will also serve to answer some of the emerging and pressing questions from the business side. For example, understanding preferences for delivery slots and how their availability influences physical trip decisions is important to manage peaks in demand both for efficient logistics operations and reducing trucks on urban roads. Demand side effects of online shopping leading to a shift in personal travel has already been studied by multiple authors. We refer to Crocco et al. [11] for a literature review and analysis of aspects mostly affecting consumer choices of purchasing goods by web or in-store. However, supply side effects concerning the possible delivery time slots offered by retailers or logistics service providers is only limited.|$|R

Using probabilistic knowledge about future freights, the LSP’s {{objective is to}} minimize costs over a multi-period horizon. We propose a look-ahead planning method using Approximate Dynamic Programming. Experiments show that our approach reduces costs up to 25. 5 % compared to a single-period optimization approach.

40|$|A novel {{concept for}} suppressing {{the problem of}} {{multipath}} ghosts in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Through-Wall Imaging (TWI) is presented. Ghosts (i. e., false targets) mainly arise {{from the use of}} the Born or single-scattering approximations that lead to linearized imaging algorithms; however, these approximations neglect the effect of multiple scattering (or multipath) between the electromagnetic wavefield and the object under investigation. In contrast to existing methods of suppressing multipath ghosts, the proposed method models {{for the first time the}} reflectivity of the probed objects as a probability function up to a normalized factor and introduces the concept of random subaperture by randomly <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> measurement <b>locations</b> from the entire aperture. Thus, the final radar image is a joint probability distribution that corresponds to radar images derived from multiple random subapertures. Finally, numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology in GPR and TWI imaging...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the behaviour and attitudes of dog walkers to <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> and disposing of dog foul, with a specific focus on bagged dog waste. Two research methods were utilised. The first explores locational and social factors influencing dog walkers’ behaviour in <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> and disposing of dog faeces. Dog waste audits were conducted on popular dog walking paths in Lancashire. Secondly, the results were used to deliver an online national dog walking survey. Results of the audits suggested that availability of bins, path morphology, visibility, and path location are key factors in determining the occurrence of dog faeces. In the survey a key factor influencing behaviour was the belief that clearing up after dogs is the “right thing to do” and this was associated with an awareness of health risks. Typologies of dog walker are also proposed heuristically, ranging from those dog walkers that are ‘proud to pick up’ who will <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> in any <b>location,</b> through those who make contextual judgements about where and when it could be permissible to leave dog waste, to the ‘disengaged’ who will not <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> {{even if they are}} aware of the health and environmental consequences.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design of}} a two-level transportation network. This type of network is typically established in national European less-than-truckload businesses. Cargo shipment from source to sink customers can be divided into three segments. Goods are <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> at customer <b>locations</b> and shipped to a source depot. After that there is a long-haul transport to a sink depot. Finally cargo is distributed from the sink depot to its final destination. In order to formalize this problem, two models, one linear and one quadratic, are proposed and analyzed. The goal of optimizing this NP-hard problem is to minimize total costs by determining the number, position and capacity of depots. In addition, customers have to be allocated to depots. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an approach which utilizes a relaxation of the long-haul transports. The resulting problem is the well-known facility location problem. Using this approach, real-world problems can be solved very quickly in high quality, for both an uncapacitated and a capacitated version of the model...|$|R
50|$|An {{infrared}} touchscreen uses {{an array}} of X-Y infrared LED and photodetector pairs {{around the edges of}} the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the exact <b>location</b> of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any input including a finger, gloved finger, stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and point of sale systems which can not rely on a conductor (such as a bare finger) to activate the touchscreen. Unlike capacitive touchscreens, infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system. Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt/dust that can interfere with the IR beams, and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers his/her finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected.|$|R
40|$|Planners {{and social}} psychologists have {{suggested}} that the recognizability of the urban environment is linked to people’s socio-economic well-being. We build a web game that puts the recognizability of London’s streets to the test. It follows as closely as possible one experiment done by Stanley Milgram in 1972. The game <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> random <b>locations</b> from Google Street View and tests users {{to see if they can}} judge the location in terms of closest subway station, borough, or region. Each participant dedicates only few minutes to the task (as opposed to 90 minutes in Milgram’s). We collect data from 2, 255 participants (one order of magnitude a larger sample) and build a recognizability map of London based on their responses. We find that some boroughs have little cognitive representation; that recognizability of an area is explained partly by its exposure to Flickr and Foursquare users and mostly by its exposure to subway passengers; and that areas with low recognizability do not fare any worse on the economic indicators of income, education, and employment, but they do significantly suffer from social problems of housing deprivation, poor living conditions, and crime. These results could not have been produced without analyzing life off- and online: that is, without considering the interactions between urban places in the physical world and their virtual presence on platforms such as Flickr and Foursquare. This line of work is at the crossroad of two emerging themes in computing research- a crossroad where “web science ” meets the “smart city ” agenda...|$|R

50|$|Laneco {{was founded}} by Raymond A. Bartolacci Sr. in 1946. The first store opened as Paramount Foods in Easton, Pennsylvania, and {{completed}} its first day of business {{with a total of}} less than $20 in sales. The stores were acquired by Supervalu in October 1992, and were closed by them in 2001. The stores were scaled down {{for the last several years}} until they were closed. The stores operated with a union and several thousand employees were laid off at the closure of the stores. Laneco had around 16 stores at the time of closure. Many stores were purchased by and converted to Giant such as the Lehighton, PA <b>location,</b> while Redner's <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a few <b>locations,</b> and a few still remain vacant today.

The theater manager fired her on the spot for [...] "insubordination" [...] and humiliated her by stripping the epaulets from her uniform in the theater lobby. Twenty-six years later, at her request, Burnett's star was placed at the corner of Hollywood and Wilcox—in front of the theater.|$|R
