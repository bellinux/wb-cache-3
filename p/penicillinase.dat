40|$|Pullulanase is a starch-debranching enzyme {{produced}} by the gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this organism, the enzyme is first exported to the outer membrane and is subsequently released into the growth medium. Evidence reported here indicates that pullulanase is a lipoprotein. It is apparently synthesized as a precursor with a 19 -residue-long signal sequence and modified by the covalent attachment of palmitate to the cysteine residue which becomes the amino terminus after cleavage of the signal sequence. In this respect, pullulanase is similar to some <b>penicillinases</b> {{produced by}} gram-positive bacteria which are initially exported to the cell surface and subsequently released into the medium. However, pullulanase and the <b>penicillinases</b> differ in one important aspect, namely, that the extracellular pullulanase still carries the covalently attached fatty acyls, whereas extracellular <b>penicillinases</b> lack the modified amino-terminal cysteine together with {{a limited number of}} other residues from the amino terminus...|$|R
2500|$|Flucloxacillin is {{insensitive}} to beta-lactamase (also known as <b>penicillinase)</b> enzymes secreted by many penicillin-resistant bacteria. The {{presence of the}} isoxazolyl group on the side chain of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase [...] resistance, since they are relatively intolerant of side chain steric hindrance. Thus, {{it is able to}} bind to penicillin-binding proteins and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but is not bound by or inactivated by β-lactamases.|$|E
2500|$|Beta-lactamases (β-lactamases, {{also known}} as <b>penicillinase)</b> are enzymes (...) {{produced}} by bacteria, that provide multi-resistance to β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, Cephalosporins, [...] cephamycins, and carbapenems (ertapenem), although carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the antibiotics' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a β-lactam. Through hydrolysis, the lactamase enzyme breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.|$|E
50|$|Meticillin is {{actually}} a penicillinase-resistant B-lactam antibiotic. <b>Penicillinase</b> is a bacterial enzyme produced by bacteria resistant to other B-lactam antibiotics which hydrolyses the antibiotic, rendering it nonfunctional. Meticillin is not bound and hydrolysed by <b>penicillinase,</b> meaning it can kill the bacteria, even if this enzyme is present.|$|E
40|$|A novel carbapenem, SF 2103 A, is {{a strong}} {{inhibitor}} of various types of beta-lactamase. Equimolar concentrations of SF 2103 A completely inactivated the cephalosporinases of Proteus vulgaris and Citrobacter freundii and type Ib and type II <b>penicillinases</b> mediated by R plasmids in a progressive manner. The inactivation of the two <b>penicillinases</b> and P. vulgaris cephalosporinase was apparently irreversible; however, when the inactivated enzymes were separated from excess SF 2103 A by gel filtration, they showed very slow reactivation. The hydrolysis of SF 2103 A by these three beta-lactamases was below the limit of detection. It is concluded that SF 2103 A acts as a tight-binding competitive inhibitor for the <b>penicillinases</b> and P. vulgaris cephalosporinase. In contrast, the inactivation of C. freundii cephalosporinase by SF 2103 A was evidently reversible. The rate constant of reactivation of the enzyme was compatible with the turnover rate of the enzyme in the steady state of SF 2103 A hydrolysis. Thus, SF 2103 A simply acts as a poor substrate for C. freundii cephalosporinase...|$|R

50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{antibiotic resistance}} is common. Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like antibiotics themselves, are ancient. The genes that confer resistance {{are known as}} the environmental resistome. These genes may be transferred from non-disease-causing bacteria to those that do cause disease, leading to clinically significant antibiotic resistance. In 1952 it was shown that penicillin-resistant bacteria existed before penicillin treatment; and also preexistent bacterial resistance to streptomycin. In 1962, the presence of <b>penicillinase</b> was detected in dormant endospores of Bacillus licheniformis, revived from dried soil on the roots of plants, preserved since 1689 in the British Museum. Six strains of Clostridium, found {{in the bowels of}} William Braine and John Hartnell (members of the Franklin Expedition) showed resistance to cefoxitin and clindamycin. <b>Penicillinase</b> may have emerged as a defense mechanism for bacteria in their habitats, such as the case of penicillinase-rich Staphylococcus aureus, living with penicillin-producing Trichophyton; however, this may be circumstantial. Search for a <b>penicillinase</b> ancestor has focused on the class of proteins that must be a priori capable of specific combination with penicillin. The resistance to cefoxitin and clindamycin in turn was attributed to Braine's and Hartnell's contact with microorganisms that naturally produce them or random mutation in the chromosomes of Clostridium strains. There is evidence that heavy metals and other pollutants may select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, generating a constant source of them in small numbers.|$|E

40|$|Background: Early β-lactamase inhibitors were {{combined}} with established penicillins, but different combinations {{may be more}} appropriate to counter current β-lactamase threats, with development facilitated by the US Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act. Cefepime/tazobactam is especially attractive, combining an AmpC-stable cephalosporin with a clinically established inhibitor, active against ESBLs and suitable for high-dose administration. Methods: Organisms (n = 563) were clinical isolates submitted to the UK national reference laboratory. MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution with tazobactam at 4 mg/L and, for a subset, at 8 mg/L. Results: Cefepime/tazobactam 8 + 4 mg/L achieved coverage of 96 %– 100 % of Enterobacteriaceae with <b>penicillinases,</b> AmpC, ESBL, K 1 or OXA- 48 β-lactamases. Even at 1 + 4 mg/L, the combination inhibited > 94 % of isolates with <b>penicillinases,</b> AmpC enzymes or ESBLs. Most Enterobacteriaceae with KPC and NDM carbapenemase were resistant at current cefepime breakpoints but 80 % of those with VIM types were susceptible at 8 + 4 mg/L. Tazobactam did little to potentiate cefepime against non-fermenter groups, though gains were seen against AmpC-producing Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Increasing the tazobactam concentration to 8 mg/L gave further small increases in activity against Enterobacteriaceae groups. Conclusions: High-dose cefepime/tazobactam, justifying an 8 + 4 or 8 + 8 mg/L breakpoint, can achieve a carbapenem-like spectrum, with some additional coverage of OXA- 48 (and maybe VIM) Enterobacteriaceae. Clinical evaluation is warranted...|$|R

The gene encoding this enzyme from S. maltophilia 1275 IID has been cloned on a 3. 3 -kb fragment into pK 18 {{under the control of}} a Ptac promoter to generate recombinant plasmid pUB 5840; when expressed in Escherichia coli, this gene confers resistance to cephalosporins and penicillins. Sequence analysis has revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 909 bp with a GC content of 71. 6 %, comparable to that of the L 1 metallo-beta-lactamase gene (68. 4 %) from the same bacterium. The ORF encodes an unmodified protein of 303 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31. 5 kDa, accommodating a putative leader peptide of 27 amino acids. Comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of other beta-lactamases showed it to be most closely related (54 % identity) to the BLA-A beta-lactamase from Yersinia enterocolitica. Sequence identity is most obvious near the STXK active-site motif and the SDN loop motif common to all serine active-site <b>penicillinases.</b> Sequences outside the conserved regions display low homology with comparable regions of other class A <b>penicillinases.</b> Kinetics of the enzyme from the cloned gene demonstrated an increase in activity with cefotaxime but markedly less activity with imipenem than previously reported.
