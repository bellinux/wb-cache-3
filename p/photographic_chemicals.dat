5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his <b>photographic</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E

Uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool.

2500|$|His {{father was}} an amateur {{photographer}} who sold <b>photographic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Dr. Wentzel was also {{a friend of the}} photochemical pioneer Hinricus Lüppo-Cramer, and preserved much of Lüppo-Cramer's work after his death. Volkmar Wentzel later said his father would sometimes punish his sons by making them take a [...] "time-out" [...] in his photographic darkroom, but that Volkmar soon learned to love the space. [...] "This was a terrifying, almost traumatic experience, until by accident, with the flick of the darkroom's amber-red inspection light switch, the magic world of photography, my lifetime love, was revealed," [...] he later said. When Wentzel was nine years old, he and his father built a wooden pinhole camera and his first photographs were of statues in the Grosser Garten near their home.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was only}} after his contact with Swiss {{photographer}} Pierre Rossier (1829 [...] ca. 1890) that Ueno decided {{to pursue a career}} as a photographer. Rossier had been commissioned by the firm Negretti and Zambra to photograph in Asia and he worked in Japan from 1859 to 1860. He was only in Nagasaki for a short time, but while there he taught wet-collodion process photography to Ueno, Horie Kuwajirō (18311866), Maeda Genzō (18311906) and others. Soon after, Ueno's friend Horie bought a wet-plate camera. The purchase, which included <b>photographic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> was funded by the daimyō of Tsu Domain, Tōdō Takayuki, and the price was 150 ryō. Apparently the photographic equipment was of such interest to Ueno that he chose to become a subject of the Tsu Domain in order to have access to it at the domainal residence in Edo. and in 1861 Horie photographed Ueno at work in the domain's laboratory in Edo (now Tokyo). In 1862 Ueno and Horie co-wrote a textbook titled Shamitsu kyoku hikkei that comprised translated extracts from ten Dutch science manuals and which included an appendix titled Satsueijutsu [...] that described techniques of collodion process photography as well as Nicéphore Niépce's asphalt printing method.|$|E
50|$|System unsharpness (previously called {{photographic}} unsharpnesss) is {{the result}} of the detector system employed. Every detector type has a limiting factor which determines its maximum spatial resolution. In film systems it is the size of the grains of <b>photographic</b> <b>chemical.</b> In computed radiography systems it the size of the laser used to read the phosphor plate in the cassette reader. In digital radiography systems it is the size of the individual thin film transistors. Since each type has a maximum capability, there is no way to minimise this system other than using a better and probably more expensive machine.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{deterioration}} found in <b>photographic</b> materials. <b>Chemical</b> deterioration occurs when the chemicals in the photograph or negative undergo reactions (either through contact with outside catalysts, or because the chemicals are inherently unstable) that damage the material. Physical or structural deterioration occurs when chemical reactions are not involved, and include abrasion and tearing.|$|R

60|$|At {{first sight}} {{it might seem}} as though there were hardly enough of such pungent and fiery things in {{existence}} to make it worth while {{for us to be}} provided with a special mechanism for guarding against them. That is true enough, no doubt, as regards our modern civilised life; though, even now, it is perhaps just as well that our children should have an internal monitor (other than conscience) to dissuade them immediately from indiscriminate indulgence in <b>photographic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> the contents of stray medicine bottles, and the best dried West India chilies. But in an earlier period of progress, and especially in tropical countries (where the Darwinians have now decided the human race made its first début upon this or any other stage), things were very different indeed. Pungent and poisonous plants and fruits abounded on every side. We have all of us in our youth been taken in by some too cruelly waggish companion, who insisted upon making us eat the bright, glossy leaves of the common English arum, which without look pretty and juicy enough, but within are full of the concentrated essence of pungency and profanity. Well, there are hundreds of such plants, even in cold climates, to tempt the eyes and poison the veins of unsuspecting cattle or childish humanity. There is buttercup, so horribly acrid that cows carefully avoid it in their closest cropped pastures; and yet your cow is not usually a too dainty animal. There is aconite, the deadly poison with which Dr. Lamson removed his troublesome relatives. There is baneberry, whose very name sufficiently describes its dangerous nature. There are horse-radish, and stinging rocket, and biting wall-pepper, and still smarter water-pepper, and worm-wood, and nightshade, and spurge, and hemlock, and half a dozen other equally unpleasant weeds. All of these have acquired their pungent and poisonous properties, just as nettles have acquired their sting, and thistles their thorns, in order to prevent animals from browsing upon them and destroying them. And the animals in turn have acquired a very delicate sense of pungency on purpose to warn them beforehand of the existence of such dangerous and undesirable qualities in the plants which they might otherwise be tempted incautiously to swallow.|$|E

50|$|A {{cold chain}} or cool chain is a {{temperature-controlled}} supply chain. An unbroken cold chain is an uninterrupted series of refrigerated production, {{storage and distribution}} activities, along with associated equipment and logistics, which maintain a desired low-temperature range.

Such products, during transport and when in transient storage, are sometimes called cool cargo. Unlike other goods or merchandise, cold chain goods are perishable and always en route towards end use or destination, even when held temporarily in cold stores and hence {{commonly referred to as}} cargo during its entire logistics cycle.|$|R

The present study is aimed to provide information on the application of PCM.
