In the present study, we examined students’ learning activities while studying <b>process</b> <b>diagrams,</b> related to their resulting comprehension of these diagrams. Each student completed three learning tasks. Verbal data and eye-tracking data were collected as indications of students’ learning activities. For the verbal data, we applied a fine-grained coding scheme to optimally describe students’ learning activities. For the eye-tracking data, we used fixation time and transitions between areas {{of interest in the}} <b>process</b> <b>diagrams</b> as indices of learning activities. Various learning activities while studying <b>process</b> <b>diagrams</b> were found that distinguished between more and less successful students. Results showed that between-student variance in comprehension score was highly predicted by meaning making of the process arrows (80 %) and fixation time in the main area (65 %). Students employed successful learning activities consistently across learning tasks. Furthermore, compared to unsuccessful students, successful students used a more coherent approach of interrelated learning activities for comprehending <b>process</b> <b>diagrams...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The goal of XPDL is {{to store}} and {{exchange}} the <b>process</b> <b>diagram,</b> allowing one tool to model a <b>process</b> <b>diagram,</b> another {{to read the}} diagram and edit, yet another to [...] "run" [...] the process model on an XPDL-compliant BPM engine, and so on.

Thus it has ‘XY' or vector coordinates, including lines and points that define process flows.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} in the environmental design disciplines. It seeks to advance knowledge {{on the use of}} diagramming media in design processes. The emphasis of this thesis is the study of diagramming as a medium that supports design process communication and dialogue, and is tested for value in developing and communicating <b>process</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The findings are used {{in the creation of a}} computer system intended to expand a professional’s ability to convey the logic of designs through diagrams. The dissertation first presents its areas of interest within a context of knowledge mapping. A review of the literature is used to identify the critical issues in this work. This results in the development of three thesis hypotheses; 1) the association of knowledge attributes – characteristics of design decision-making knowledge – with <b>process</b> <b>diagrams</b> provides a useful means of organization to the diagrams, 2) a computational implementation can provide a robust environment in which to represent complex design <b>process</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and 3) a computational implementation can support “hyper”-diagrams capable of functioning as an interface to design information. A case study design studio is used to expose the potential of knowledge attributes in developing and using <b>process</b> <b>diagrams.</b> A prototype computer implementation called KM is then developed as an instrument to test the computability and broader potential of design <b>process</b> <b>diagrams</b> in hypermedia.
