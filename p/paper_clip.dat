25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a <b>paper</b> <b>clip,</b> ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>Clips</b> is a 2004 {{documentary}} film written and produced by Joe Fab, {{and directed by}} Elliot Berlin and Joe Fab, about the <b>Paper</b> <b>Clips</b> Project, in which a middle school class tries to collect 6 million <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> to represent the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Paper</b> <b>Clips</b> Project, by {{middle school}} {{students}} from the small southeastern Tennessee town of Whitwell, created a monument for the Holocaust victims of Nazi Germany. It started in 1998 as a simple 8th-grade project to study other cultures, and then evolved into one gaining worldwide attention. At last count, over 30 million <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> had been received. <b>Paper</b> <b>Clips,</b> an award-winning documentary film about the project, was released in 2004 by Miramax Films.|$|R
25|$|After a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at {{the front}} of the drive is {{manually}} lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle clamping hub, and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some 5¼-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer 5¼-inch drives and all 3½-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button. On Apple Macintosh computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Stone and Singer {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} show's first special, the [...] "triumphant" [...] Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, which included an O Henry-inspired storyline in which Bert and Ernie gave up their prized possessions—Ernie his rubber ducky and Bert his <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> collection—to purchase each other Christmas gifts. [...] Bert and Ernie were played by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, who in real life were, like the puppets they played, colleagues and friends. [...] To Davis, this demonstrated the puppeteers' remarkable ability to play [...] "puppetry's Odd Couple". [...] In Singer's opinion, the special—which Stone also wrote and directed—demonstrated Stone's [...] "soul", and Sonia Manzano called it {{a good example of}} what Sesame Street was all about. [...] The special won Emmys for Stone and Singer in 1979, beating, among others, an independently-produced Sesame Street special for CBS.|$|E
500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in a {{very complicated}} manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated {{that a couple of}} sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators {{had to come up with}} new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit cigarette out in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to start calling MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E

As of the summer of 2004, the school had collected about 24 million <b>paper</b> <b>clips.</b> As of 2005, more were still coming in.

5000|$|Suppose {{we have an}} AI {{whose only}} {{goal is to make}} as many <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer <b>paper</b> <b>clips.</b> Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into <b>paper</b> <b>clips.</b> The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which {{there were a lot of}} <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> but no humans. [...] Bostrom has {{emphasised}} that he does not believe the paperclip maximiser scenario will actually occur.

Twenty years later, when Johnson ran for U.S. Congress, Mike Kelleher, his Democratic rival, had the story documented on a website dedicated to the photograph and Johnson's reactions, saying [...] "It would be funny, if it weren't so serious..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wire is {{versatile}} in its nature. Thus a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> is {{a useful}} accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force. Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need. This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an [...] "emergency eject" [...] should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh). Various smartphones {{require the use of}} a long thin object such as a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> to reset the device. The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> as the key to the bezel. A <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> bent into a [...] "U" [...] can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header). One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS232 interface (or indeed many interfaces). A <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk-drive as a flexible head-stop. A <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse. The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.|$|E

50|$|Whitwell {{has become}} renowned for the <b>Paper</b> <b>Clips</b> Project, a Holocaust {{memorial}} and educational project, that {{was carried out}} by children of the local middle school starting in 1998. A subsequent documentary was made about the children's achievement. This project started because students at the local middle school wanted to visually grasp how much six million was. The students started collecting <b>paper</b> <b>clips,</b> one for every Jewish individual that died in the Holocaust during World War II. This project soon attracted media attention and international support. Many Jewish notables sent <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> representing lost members of their families. The children collected well over the number of <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> they wanted (11 million, representing all noncombatant prisoners---Jew and Gentile---killed by the Nazis). The total collected number of <b>paper</b> <b>clips</b> now stands between ten and fifty million. This number is approximately equal to the total number of war deaths between 1939-1945. The rail car that appears in the movie is original rolling stock, actually used to transport Jews to the concentration camps. This rail car is located at the Whitwell Middle School. The Middle School routinely hosts Holocaust survivors as well as other guest speakers {{on the subject of the}} Holocaust.|$|R

5000|$|The post-war years saw a {{widespread}} {{consolidation of the}} <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> as a national symbol. Authors of books and articles {{on the history of}} Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial. They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was {{not the same as the}} fully developed Gem-type clip. In 1989 a giant <b>paper</b> <b>clip,</b> almost 7 m high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler. The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent. A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness. The background shows a facsimile of the German [...] "Patentschrift". However, the figure in the foreground is not the <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> depicted on that document, but the much better known [...] "Gem". In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the <b>paper</b> <b>clip.</b>|$|E

A money laundering offence under UK legislation need not involve money, since the money laundering legislation covers assets of any description. Technically therefore an individual who steals even a <b>paper</b> <b>clip</b> in the UK commits a money laundering offence (possession of the stolen <b>paper</b> <b>clip)</b> in addition to the predicate offence (of theft of the <b>paper</b> <b>clip).</b>|$|E
