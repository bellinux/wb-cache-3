40|$|We {{systematically}} {{study the}} relationship between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase diagrams {{of a system of}} short-ranged attractive colloids. Using Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations we find a window of enhanced crystallization that is limited at high interaction strength by a slowing down of the dynamics and at low interaction strength by the high nucleation barrier. We find that the crystallization is enhanced by the metastable gas-liquid binodal by means of a two-stage crystallization process. First, the formation of a dense liquid is observed and second the crystal nucleates within the dense fluid. In addition, we find at low colloid <b>packing</b> <b>fractions</b> a fluid of clusters, and at higher colloid <b>packing</b> <b>fractions</b> a percolating network due to an arrested gas-liquid phase separation that we identify with gelation. We find that this arrest is due to crystallization at low interaction energy and it is caused by a slowing down of the dynamics at high interaction strength. Likewise, we observe that the clusters which are formed at low colloid <b>packing</b> <b>fractions</b> are crystalline at low interaction energy, but glassy at high interaction energy. The clusters coalesce upon encounter. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the Asakura-Oosawa model of hard sphere colloids and ideal polymers {{in contact with}} a porous matrix modeled by immobilized configurations of hard spheres. For this ternary mixture a fundamental measure density functional theory is employed, where the matrix particles are quenched and the colloids and polymers are annealed, i. e. allowed to equilibrate. We study capillary condensation of the mixture in a tiny sample of matrix as well as demixing and the fluid-fluid interface inside a bulk matrix. Density profiles normal to the interface and surface tensions are calculated and compared to the case without matrix. Two kinds of matrices are considered: (i) colloid-sized matrix particles at low <b>packing</b> <b>fractions</b> and (ii) large matrix particles at high <b>packing</b> <b>fractions.</b> These two cases show fundamentally different behavior and should both be experimentally realizable. Furthermore, we argue that capillary condensation of a colloidal suspension could be experimentally accessible. We find that in case (ii), even at high <b>packing</b> <b>fractions,</b> {{the main effect of}} the matrix is to exclude volume and, to high accuracy, the results can be mapped onto those of the same system without matrix via a simple rescaling.

50|$|Aristotle {{claimed that}} tetrahedra could fill space completely. In 2006, Conway and Torquato {{showed that a}} <b>packing</b> <b>fraction</b> about 72% can be {{obtained}} by constructing a non-Bravais lattice packing of tetrahedra (with multiple particles with generally different orientations per repeating unit), and thus they showed that the best tetrahedron packing cannot be a lattice packing (with one particle per repeating unit such that each particle has a common orientation). These packing constructions almost doubled the optimal Bravais-lattice-packing fraction 36.73% obtained by Hoylman. In 2007 and 2010, Chaikin and coworkers experimentally showed that tetrahedron-like dice can randomly pack in a finite container up to a <b>packing</b> <b>fraction</b> between 75% and 76%.

40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{measurements of}} dynamical heterogeneities in a dense system of microgel spheres, sheared {{at different rates}} and at different <b>packing</b> <b>fractions</b> in a microfluidic channel, and visualized with high speed digital video microscopy. A four-point dynamic susceptibility is deduced from video correlations, and is found to exhibit a peak that grows in height and shifts to longer times as the jamming transition is approached from two different directions. In particular, the time for particle-size root-mean square relative displacements is found to scale as τ^* ∼ (γ̇Δϕ^ 4) ^- 1 where γ̇ is the strain rate and Δϕ=|ϕ-ϕ_c| is {{the distance from the}} random close <b>packing</b> volume <b>fraction.</b> The typical number of particles in a dynamical heterogeneity is deduced from the susceptibility peak height and found to scale as n^* ∼ (γ̇Δϕ^ 4) ^- 0. 3.

Thus, our results considerably extend a previous observation of n^* ∼γ̇^- 0. 3 for granular heap flow at fixed packing below ϕ_c.

On the one hand, at high temperatures and high <b>packing</b> <b>fractions,</b> close to an ordered-solid/disordered-solid coexistence line, we find that the fluid-to-crystal pathway does not follow the minimum free energy route. On the other hand, a quench to a state point far from the ordered-crystal/disordered-crystal coexistence border is followed by a fluid-to-solid transition through the minimum free energy pathway. At low temperatures and <b>packing</b> <b>fractions</b> we observe that the system undergoes a gas-liquid spinodal decomposition that, at some point, arrests giving rise to a gel-like structure.
