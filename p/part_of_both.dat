5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> town and gown.|$|E

Forster had a good match in Southampton's scoreless draw with Liverpool at Anfield on 7 May 2017; saving James Milner's 65th minute penalty kick, and then pushing Marko Grujic's header over the crossbar in injury time.|$|E

5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Verrières Ridge was {{a series}} of engagements fought as part of the Battle of Normandy, in western France, during the Second World War. The main combatants were two Canadian {{infantry}} divisions—with additional support from the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—against elements of three German SS Panzer divisions. The battle was part of the British and Canadian attempts to break out of Caen, and took place from 19–25 July 1944, being <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Operation Atlantic (18–21 July) and Operation Spring (25–27 July).|$|E

Laurence Rickard was recruited solely as a writer, but found himself <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the senior writing staff and starring cast after creating the character of Bob Hale, whose extended, convoluted monologues proved impossible to hand over to anyone else.|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} high sales, selling 400,000 copies {{in its first}} week of release and 700,000 {{by the end of}} 1999. Reviews were less {{positive}} than for prior games in the series. Critics gave considerable acclaim to its vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics and soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, but were critical of the lack of a clear main storyline, stating that it left the game feeling disjointed. The game was re-released as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the PlayStation's and Square Enix's best-sellers lines. It was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan and North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{which today}} makes up Lycoming County was purchased from the Iroquois in two treaties signed at Fort Stanwix in New York: the first treaty was in 1768, {{and the second}} treaty was in 1784. The county was formed on April 13, 1795 from part of Northumberland County. The county originally contained seven townships when formed: Lower Bald Eagle, Loyalsock, Lycoming, Muncy, Nippenose, Pine Creek, and Washington. Today Pine Creek is part of Clinton County and Lower Bald Eagle is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Centre and Clinton counties, but the rest are still in Lycoming County, although many other municipalities have been formed from these since.|$|E

5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were {{exceptions to this}} (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), {{it was not until}} after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point (designated as Blakeney National Nature Reserve) is a National Nature Reserve {{situated}} near to {{the villages}} of Blakeney, Morston and Cley next the Sea on the north coast of Norfolk, England.

It has been managed by the National Trust since 1912, and lies within the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Ramsar listings. The reserve is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and a World Biosphere Reserve. The Point has been studied {{for more than a}} century, following pioneering ecological studies by botanist Francis Wall Oliver and a bird ringing programme initiated by ornithologist Emma Turner.|$|E
5|$|Given {{started his}} career at Celtic, however he never made a first-team {{appearance}} and he was released and signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994.
