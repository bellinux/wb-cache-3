5|$|At {{the time}} of the counterattack, Manstein could count on the Fourth <b>Panzer</b> Army, {{composed}} of XLVIII <b>Panzer</b> Corps, the SS <b>Panzer</b> Corps and the First <b>Panzer</b> Army, with the XL and LVII <b>Panzer</b> Corps. The XLVIII <b>Panzer</b> Corps was composed of the 6th, 11th and 17th <b>Panzer</b> Divisions, while the SS <b>Panzer</b> Corps was organized with the 1st SS, 2nd SS and 3rd SS <b>Panzer</b> Division. In early February, the combined strength of the SS <b>Panzer</b> Corps was an estimated 20,000 soldiers. The Fourth <b>Panzer</b> Army and the First <b>Panzer</b> Army were situated south of the Red Army's bulge into German lines, with the First <b>Panzer</b> Army to the east of the Fourth <b>Panzer</b> Army. The SS <b>Panzer</b> Corps was deployed along the northern edge of the bulge, on the northern front of Army Group South.|$|E
5|$|The German forces {{consisted}} of the 1st, 2nd and 10th <b>Panzer</b> Divisions. The 1st <b>Panzer</b> Division {{under the command of}} General-Major (Major General) Friedrich Kirchner, had on strength 52 <b>Panzer</b> IIs, 98 <b>Panzer</b> III, 58 <b>Panzer</b> IV, 40 <b>Panzer</b> 35(t) and eight SdKfz 265 Panzerbefehlswagens. The 2nd <b>Panzer</b> Division, under the command of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Rudolf Veiel, had to hand 45 <b>Panzer</b> I, 115 <b>Panzer</b> II, 59 <b>Panzer</b> III and 32 <b>Panzer</b> IVs. It also had 16 SdKfz 265. The 10th <b>Panzer</b> Division, under the command of Generalleutnant Ferdinand Schaal, had 44 <b>Panzer</b> I, 113 <b>Panzer</b> II, 58 <b>Panzer</b> III, 32 <b>Panzer</b> IV and 18 SdKfz 265. In total Guderian could muster 60,000 men, 22,000 vehicles, 771 tanks and 141 artillery pieces. He could also call upon 1,470 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, its armored corps was {{composed}} of 1,445 <b>Panzer</b> Is, 1,223 <b>Panzer</b> IIs, 98 <b>Panzer</b> IIIs and 211 <b>Panzer</b> IVs; the more modern vehicles amounted to less than 10% of Germany's armored strength. The 1st <b>Panzer</b> Division had a roughly equal balance of types, with 17 <b>Panzer</b> Is, 18 <b>Panzer</b> IIs, 28 <b>Panzer</b> IIIs, and 14 <b>Panzer</b> IVs per battalion. The remaining <b>panzer</b> divisions were heavy with obsolete models, equipped as they were with 34 <b>Panzer</b> Is, 33 <b>Panzer</b> IIs, 5 <b>Panzer</b> IIIs, and 6 <b>Panzer</b> IVs per battalion. Although the Polish Army possessed less than 200 tanks capable of penetrating the German light tanks, Polish anti-tank guns proved more of a threat, reinforcing German faith {{in the value of}} the close-support <b>Panzer</b> IV.|$|E
50|$|Codename: <b>Panzers</b> is a World War II {{video game}} created by Hungarian game {{developer}} StormRegion. It launched in 2004 to generally favorable reviews.

In 1949 the armored regiment was reorganized into two battalions of 60 T-26s, with two command <b>Panzer</b> Is, six combat versions of the <b>Panzer</b> I and two CV-33, which were used for reconnaissance, each.

5|$|Facing Army Detachment Kempf, {{consisting}} of III <b>Panzer</b> Corps and Corps Raus (commanded by Erhard Raus), were the 7th Guards Army, dug {{in on the}} high ground on the eastern bank of the Northern Donets. The two German corps were tasked with crossing the river, breaking through the 7th Guards Army and covering the right flank of the 4th <b>Panzer</b> Army.

5|$|Having taken Chambois, {{two of the}} Polish battlegroups drove {{north-east}} {{and established}} themselves on part of Hill 262 (Mont Ormel ridge), spending the night of 19 August digging in. The following morning, Model ordered elements of the 2nd SS <b>Panzer</b> Division and 9th SS <b>Panzer</b> Division to attack from outside the pocket towards the Polish positions. Around midday, several units of the 10th SS <b>Panzer</b> Division, 12th SS <b>Panzer</b> Division and 116th <b>Panzer</b> Division managed {{to break through the}} Polish lines and open a corridor, while the 9th SS <b>Panzer</b> Division prevented the Canadians from intervening. By mid-afternoon, about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{earmarked}} three field armies for the offensive: the 7th and the Fifth and Sixth <b>Panzer.</b> These {{accumulated over}} 240,000 soldiers, spread over seven <b>panzer</b> divisions, two <b>panzer</b> brigades and thirteen infantry divisions. The {{bulk of the}} offensive's armored strength was in the Sixth <b>Panzer</b> Army, which was tasked with the capture of the Belgian port of Antwerp. To its south was the Fifth <b>Panzer</b> Army, outfitted to protect the Sixth's flank while it crossed the Meuse river. The southernmost flank was covered by the Seventh Army, composed of three infantry corps and ordered to protect the Fifth Army's southern flank and tie down American reserves in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Hoepner's <b>Panzer</b> Corps and Prioux' Cavalry clashed head-on near Hannut, Belgium, on 12 May. Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Germans did not outnumber the French. Frequently, figures of 623 German and 415 French tanks are given. The German 3rd and 4th <b>Panzer</b> Divisions {{numbered}} 280 and 343 respectively. The 2e DLM and 3e DLM numbered 176 Somuas and 239 Hotchkiss H35s. Added to this force were the {{considerable number of}} Renault AMR-ZT-63s in the Cavalry Corps. The R35 was equal or superior to the <b>Panzer</b> I and <b>Panzer</b> IIs in armament terms. This applies all the more to the 90 Panhard 178 armoured cars of the French Army. Its 25mm main gun could penetrate the armour of the <b>Panzer</b> IV. In terms of tanks that were capable of engaging and surviving a tank-vs-tank action, the Germans possessed just 73 <b>Panzer</b> IIIs and 52 <b>Panzer</b> IVs. The French had 176 SOMUA and 239 Hotchkisses. German tank units also contained 486 <b>Panzer</b> I and IIs, which were of dubious combat value given their losses in the Polish Campaign.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{rising to}} power in Germany, Adolf Hitler {{approved}} the creation of Germany's first <b>panzer</b> divisions.

No existing design appealed to Guderian. As a stopgap, the German Army ordered a preliminary vehicle to train German tank crews. This became the <b>Panzer</b> I.|$|E

5|$|The German attack went {{according}} to plan, with 3rd <b>Panzer</b> Army {{pushing through the}} middle nearly unopposed and then splitting its mobile forces north to complete the encirclement of Vyazma with 4th <b>Panzer</b> Army, and other units south to close the ring around Bryansk in conjunction with 2nd <b>Panzer</b> Army. The Soviet defenses, still under construction, were overrun and spearheads of the Second and Third <b>Panzer</b> Groups met at Vyazma on 10 October 1941.

5|$|The <b>Panzer</b> IV {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role during operations in 1943, including at the Battle of Kursk. Newer types, such as the Panther, were still experiencing crippling reliability problems that restricted their combat efficiency, so much of the effort fell to the 841 <b>Panzer</b> IVs that took part in the battle. Throughout 1943, the German army lost 2,352 <b>Panzer</b> IVs on the Eastern Front; some divisions were reduced to 12–18 tanks by the end of the year. In 1944, a further 2,643 <b>Panzer</b> IVs were destroyed, and such losses were becoming increasingly difficult to replace. Nevertheless, due to a shortage of replacement Panther tanks, the <b>Panzer</b> IV {{continued to}} form the core of Germany's armored divisions, including elite units such as the II SS <b>Panzer</b> Corps, through 1944.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Panzer</b> IV was {{partially}} succeeded by the Panther medium tank, which {{was introduced to}} counter the Soviet T-34, although the <b>Panzer</b> IV continued as a significant component of German armoured formations {{to the end of}} the war. The <b>Panzer</b> IV was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria. After the war, Syria procured <b>Panzer</b> IVs from France and Czechoslovakia, which saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War. 8,553 <b>Panzer</b> IVs of all versions were built during World War II, with only the StuG III assault-gun/tank destroyer's 10,086 vehicle production run exceeding the <b>Panzer</b> IV's total among Axis armored forces.|$|E
