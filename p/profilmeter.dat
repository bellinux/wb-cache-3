40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a simple and low cost alternative to deposited antireflective coatings (ARC) {{through the use of a}} diluted HF wet chemical etching technique to form AR layers of silicon dioxide. Soda-lime-silica, low-iron glasses were used as the glass substrates. The float glass was etched for a variety of time intervals and with four different concentrations of HF solutions (0, 5 M, 1 M, 5 M, 10 M). The optical properties were determined by UV-VIS spectroscopy. The microstructures were examined by SEM microscopy with EDAX analysis. The surface roughness after the wet chemical-etching was determined using an optical <b>profilmeter...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether changes of carotid wall shear stress induced by changes in blood viscosity after diuretic administration cause carotid arterial dilatation in elderly hypertensives, as reported in the cat. Arterial wall shear rate (ultrasound technique, <b>profilmeter</b> FRP III), the systo-diastolic diameter (echotracking technique) and the mean blood flow velocity and volume of the common carotid artery, the blood viscosity (rotational viscometer) and the finger arterial blood pressure (Finapress Ohmeda) were measured in 12 young volunteers (aged 25 +/- 2 years) and in 12 elderly hypertensives (aged 80 +/- 4 years) treated with short-acting calcium antagonists up to 24 h before the study, both at baseline and after intravenous furosemide infusion (0. 5 mg/min), when the haematocrit had increased by at least two percentage points. After furosemide administration the mean arterial blood pressure decreased and blood viscosity and carotid systolic shear stress increased in both groups. However, common carotid artery diameter increased only in the young controls but not in the elderly hypertensives. These data show that an increase in carotid shear stress caused by haemoconcentration induces carotid vasodilatation only in young healthy subjects, and not in elderly hypertensives. This effect may be related to impaired endothelium function and/or arterial wall mechanics...|$|E
