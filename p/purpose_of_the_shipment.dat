40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Affordable and {{reliable}} supply chain visibility {{is becoming increasingly}} important as <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network underlying supply chains is becoming orders of magnitudes higher compared to a decade ago. Moreover, this increase in complexity is starting to reflect on <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> goods and their availability to the consumers. Optimizing the physical distribution phase in supply chain by providing increased visibility to trading partners can directly reduce product cost. Current supply chain information systems often lack the ability to cost-effectively relay ground truth in- formation in near real time to all stakeholders and most importantly to the supplier and the customer during <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment.</b> This thesis presents a solu- tion that addresses this gap through a distributed architecture. The solution enables small, medium and large businesses to interact in a dynamic and shipment-centric manner through a private blockchain sub-ledger that digitizes <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> custody for each shipment. Information in this private ledger is augmented by a public event ledger that reflects <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> in real time.

50|$|Biermann and Riebodt {{began working}} with Michaelis, with Rieboldt {{reporting}} {{to him about the}} armaments work and especially about <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> airplane motors and warships. In 1937, the Resistance group disclosed a secret weapons shipment from Adolf Hitler to Spain's Francisco Franco.

Michaelis had contacts living abroad, in exile, who could help spread the word. One example of evidence was discovered in March 1937, when Dietrich slipped two unusual rifle cartridges to Biermann. Unlike normal munitions, these cartridges were unmarked, having no indication of manufacturer, date or type of bullet. Michaelis passed such information, along with reports of ship movements towards Spain and other materials to <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KPD in Basel, where it was then made public.|$|R

50|$|In May 2002, three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santorinis crewmembers were convicted, by a {{military}} tribunal, of attempting to smuggle weapons into Gaza.

40|$|This work {{considers}} <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> goods with stochastic shortages from {{factories to}} stores. It {{is assumed that}} in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> shipping <b>the</b> goods to various stores, some proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goods will be damaged (which will lead to shortage of goods in transit). <b>The</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damaged goods is added to <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment.</b> A proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total expected cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shortage goods {{is assumed to be}} recovered and should be deducted from <b>the</b> total cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment.</b> In order to determine the minimum transportation costs for the operation, we adopt dynamic optimization principles. The optimal transportation cost and optimal control policies <b>of</b> shipping <b>the</b> goods from factories to stores were obtained. We find that <b>the</b> optimal costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goods recovered could be determined. It was further found that <b>the</b> optimum costs <b>of</b> distributing <b>the</b> goods with minimum and maximum error bounds coincide only at infinity...|$|R
50|$|As {{long as the}} {{air waybill}} is neither dated nor signed twice, the goods do not fall within <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{conditions}} <b>of</b> contract and therefore the carrier will not accept any responsibility for the goods. <b>The</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air waybill and thus <b>the</b> contract <b>of</b> carriage expires upon delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> to <b>the</b> consignee (or his authorised agent).|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, during the Australian gold rushes, Long Jetty reached {{a period of}} maximum use whereby ships where {{constantly}} coming and going. Even at its full length, {{it was necessary to}} use lightering with smaller vessels to bring in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipments.</b> <b>The</b> opening <b>of</b> Fremantle Harbour eliminated the need for lightering and helped to make Long Jetty obsolete as an importing and exporting structure.|$|R
50|$|Since freight sent via LTL {{carriers}} {{is subject}} to misrouting or misloading {{it is a good}} practice to put the tracking number on each side of each piece <b>of</b> freight. If <b>the</b> destination state and zipcode are affixed to each side as well, misloading is less likely to occur. Even though it is not required it is good practice to affix a relatively large label including four letter carrier code, tracking number, destination station, and destination zipcode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> (i.e. ABFS123456789 GA 30301). The easier it is for dockworkers to identify an individual <b>shipment</b> <b>the</b> less likely it is to be put in the wrong place. The value or type of contents should not be advertised on the package to help reduce losses. If <b>the</b> only piece <b>of</b> identification is <b>the</b> tracking number the dockworker will have a harder time identifying <b>the</b> <b>shipments</b> pieces and as such <b>the</b> chances <b>of</b> freight being loaded onto the wrong trailer is greater thereby increasing the transit time and also increasing <b>the</b> chances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> being lost. Proper labels, bar codes, and RFID are important for proper routing and delivery.|$|R
