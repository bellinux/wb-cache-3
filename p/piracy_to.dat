25|$|Demographic Model: This model {{suggests}} that Scandinavia experienced a population boom {{just before the}} Viking Age began. The agricultural capabilities of the land were not enough {{to keep up with}} the increasing population. As a result, many Scandinavians found themselves with no property and no status. To remedy this, these landless men took to <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> obtain material wealth. The population continued to grow, and the pirates looked further and further beyond the borders of the Baltic, and eventually into all of Europe.|$|E

The insurgents were besieged in Gramvousa {{for more than two years}} and they had to resort to <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> survive. Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish–Egyptian and European shipping in the region. During that period the population of Gramvousa became organised and built a school and a church dedicated to the Panagia i Kleftrina ("Our Lady the piratess")—St Mary as the patron of the klephts.|$|E

25|$|During medieval times, Büsum was {{frequently}} visited by traders of the Hanseatic League. The Hansa {{was the main}} ally of Dithmarschen, but the peasants' republic never {{became part of the}} Hanseatic League itself. The people of the comparatively poor island Büsum often resorted to <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> better their lives, resulting in repeated conflicts. In 1420, Rackler Kersten and his men from Büsum sailed into the harbor of Hamburg to scuttle and loot Hanseatic trading ships. In retaliation, the Hamburgers pillaged and burned the island's church in Middeldorp. The new church was built in Norddorp and furnished with several items looted from the island Pellworm by the pirate Cord Widderich.|$|E
500|$|In United States v. Smith (1820), in {{an opinion}} by Justice Story, the Court upheld a {{conviction}} under the 1819 statute, holding that Congress {{could leave the}} definition of <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> the law of nations. After reviewing the history of foreign (primarily English) law, Justice Story declared: [...] "We have, therefore, no hesitation in declaring, that piracy, by the law of nations, is robbery upon the sea, {{and that it is}} sufficiently and constitutionally defined by the fifth section of the act of 1819." [...] In a rare dissent, Justice Livingston argued that Article One, Section Eight, Clause Ten obliged Congress to define piracy with more specificity. The facts in Smith were almost identical to those which Palmer had held could not be reached under the Crimes Act of 1790: a U.S. citizen pirate, commissioned by a government in Buenos Aires, had led a mutiny, seized a new ship, and then robbed a Spanish ship.|$|E
500|$|Piracy and banditry {{provided}} {{a significant and}} consistent supply of slaves, though {{the significance of this}} source varied according to era and region. Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted it. Whenever ransom was not paid or not warranted, captives would be sold to a trafficker. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as [...] "the old-fashioned" [...] way of life. Such was the case in Acarnania, Crete, and Aetolia. Outside of Greece, this was also the case with Illyrians, Phoenicians, and Etruscans. During the Hellenistic period, Cilicians and the mountain peoples from the coasts of Anatolia could also be added to the list. Strabo explains the popularity of the practice among the Cilicians by its profitability; Delos, not far away, allowed for [...] "moving myriad slaves daily". The growing influence of the Roman Republic, a large consumer of slaves, led to development of the market and an aggravation of piracy. In the 1st century BC, however, the Romans largely eradicated <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> protect the Mediterranean trade routes.|$|E

Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When {{they say that they}} left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that he dreamed of a simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They then tell Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E

Jackson, a Federal District Court judge in Norfolk, Virginia threw out the piracy charge, which dates from enactment in 1819 when piracy was defined only as robbery at sea. The penalty for piracy is mandatory life in prison. The U.S. government appealed the ruling. In March 2011 the five Somalis were sentenced to life for <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> run consecutively with the 80-year term.

The situation in the U.S. ports was starting to become dangerous. The Monroe administration, although interested in supporting the new republics of South America, shunned formal recognition for fear of a major conflict with Spain and its European allies and through the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams faced a negotiation with the Spanish Minister Luis de Adams y Onis in the territory of Florida and parts of Texas. In this negotiation, in the form of incessant correspondence, Ambassador Onis constantly protested what he saw as U.S. efforts to destabilize the Spanish colonies by allowing fleets of [...] "pirate" [...] working from Baltimore and New Orleans against the colonies' traffic. Monroe decided to pressure the district judges to refuse safe harbor to the pirates safe in Baltimore and finally asked Congress to prohibit the presence of armed foreign vessels in that port.

2500|$|England {{began to}} {{strongly}} turn against piracy {{at the turn}} of the 18th century, as it was increasingly damaging to the country's economic and commercial prospects in the region. The Piracy Act of 1698 for the [...] "more effectual suppression of Piracy" [...] made it easier to capture, try and convict pirates by lawfully enabling acts of <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "examined, inquired of, tried, heard and determined, and adjudged in any place at sea, or upon the land, in any of his Majesty's islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or factories." [...] This effectively enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary, rather than requiring that the trial be held in England. Commissioners of these vice-admiralty courts were also vested with [...] "full power and authority" [...] to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and [...] "to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony." [...] These new and faster trials provided no legal representation for the pirates; and ultimately led in this era to the execution of 600 pirates, which represented approximately 10 percent of the pirates active at the time in the Caribbean region. Being an accessory to piracy was also criminalised under the statute.|$|E

2500|$|Usually, {{the trials}} {{took place in}} England, {{due to the fact}} that the [...] "Admiralty feared that {{officials}} in the far-flung outposts of the empire could be bribed." [...] However, an issue with holding trials in England was that the pirates would have to be transported [...] "across vast distances." [...] The law regarding piracy trials was changed at the beginning of the eighteenth century, granting more relaxed rules and allowing for trials to take place in English colonies, so long as a Court of Admiralty was available. Pirates faced greater danger of being executed when the law changed, as it stated if a pirate was taken at sea, an official trial was not necessary, but the end result of execution was to be the same. An act in 1700 allowed for the expansion of the definition of <b>piracy</b> <b>to</b> include not just those [...] "who committed robbery by sea," [...] but also the [...] "mutineer who ran away with the ship" [...] as well as the [...] "sailor who interfered with the defense of his vessel" [...] under a pirate siege. In both 1717 and 1718, pardons were granted in order to [...] "rid the sea of robbers." [...] For example, Israel Hands, Blackbeard's henchman, was taken with fifteen other pirates to Williamsburg, Virginia to stand trial.
