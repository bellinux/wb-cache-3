50|$|Surfrider is a steel shuttle {{roller coaster}} at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast located at Oxenford, Gold Coast, Australia. The ride is an Intamin Half <b>Pipe</b> <b>roller</b> coaster {{that opened in}} September 2007.|$|E
50|$|Regular rail {{can cross}} its own track because {{the gaps in}} the rails for wheel flanges are narrow, {{permitting}} the bladed design. Round <b>pipe</b> <b>roller</b> coaster rails and box beam monorail rails usually have wheels riding at angles other than on top. These additional other angle wheels are a larger loading gauge, requiring big gaps in the rail (structure gauge) where rails cross or meet.|$|E
50|$|In February 2007, {{roller coaster}} parts began {{arriving}} in Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast's car park. The Gold Coast Bulletin later reported the ride {{as being an}} Intamin Half <b>Pipe</b> <b>roller</b> coaster with an opening date scheduled for the September school holidays. In late April, Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast officially confirmed this report by announcing the Surfrider. After a relatively short construction period, the ride was fully assembled by July 2007. The ride opened in September 2007.|$|E
50|$|Early {{hot blast}} stoves were troublesome, as thermal {{expansion}} and contraction could cause breakage of pipes. This was somewhat remedied by supporting the <b>pipes</b> on <b>rollers.</b> It was also necessary to devise new methods of connecting the blast pipes to the tuyeres, as leather could not longer be used.|$|R
50|$|The Chanhassen Skate Park was {{installed}} in September 1999. The park is located between City Hall and the downtown fire station. It features a wedge, quarter pipe, half <b>pipe,</b> hotbox, doobie <b>roller,</b> spine and grind rails.|$|R
40|$|Static {{structural}} {{analysis of a}} pipe during laying is usually performed by use of finite element analysis tools specialized for this purpose. In this paper, Abaqus/CAE, which is a general purpose FEA software, was used for a static non-linear {{structural analysis}} of a pipe during pipe laying. The pipe is modeled as a geometrically non-linear elastic beam supported by a vessel and its stinger in the overbend region and by the seabed in the sagbend region. We propose a new method for tensioner modeling based on friction contacts between the pipe and the tensioner. Contact interactions between the <b>pipe</b> and <b>rollers,</b> {{as well as between}} the pipe and the seabed, are also considered. Basic static analysis is enhanced with floating stinger implementation, a non-flat seabed profile and buoyancy tanks application. The model results for various test cases of pipe laying are compared with an industry standard pipe laying modeling tool...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the state-of-the-art {{information on the}} utilization of fly ash, silica fume and slag fume in various applications. In this paper, fly ash uses are classed into three main categories: low technology applications; medium technology applications; and, (3) high technology applications. The low technology applications {{include the use of}} fly ash in fills and embankments, pavement base and subbase courses, subgrade stabilization, landfill cover, soil improvement, land reclamations, slurried flowable ash, water pollution control, etc. The medium technology applications involve the use of fly ash in blended cements, lightweight aggregates, concretes, prestressed/precast concrete products, concrete <b>pipe,</b> <b>roller</b> compacted concrete, autoclaved cellular concrete, bricks, blocks, paving stones, high-strength ceramic products, filler in asphalt mixture, artificial reefs, etc. The high technology application of fly ash include metal recovery, fillers for composite materials and other applications, mineral wool, etc. Silica fume is available in several forms. Considerable amounts of research have been pursued on the utilization of silica fume as a construction material over the last decade. Typical properties of silica fume and its different uses in densified cement, blended cement, concrete, bricks, blocks, grouts, etc. have been briefly mentioned. The use of slag in cements, concrete, aggregate, flowable backfills, grouts, bricks, blocks, and other applications have also been discussed...|$|E
50|$|Signals were {{originally}} controlled by levers {{situated at the}} signals, and later by levers grouped together and connected to the signal by wire cables, or <b>pipes</b> supported on <b>rollers</b> (US). Often these levers were placed in a special building, known as a signal box (UK) or interlocking tower (US), and eventually they were mechanically interlocked to prevent the display of a signal contrary to the alignment of the switch points. Automatic traffic control systems added track circuits to detect the presence of trains and alter signal aspects to reflect their presence or absence.|$|R
5000|$|In construction, {{there are}} three main types of compactor: the plate, the [...] "jumping jack" [...] and the road roller. The roller type compactors are used for {{compacting}} crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate compactor (vibratory rammer) has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade, while the jumping jack compactor has a smaller foot. The jumping jack type is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water or gas supply <b>pipes</b> etc. Road <b>rollers</b> may also have vibrating rollers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There is a {{remarkable}} friction between drill string and borehole in extended-reach wells and horizontal wells due to large deviation angle, contact between drill string and borehole, non-rotation of drill string. The large friction and torque will induce blocked bit weight, low ROP, constrained drill string extension. This article summarizes the common used antifriction methods and tools in extended-reach wells, focusing on Non-Rotation Drill <b>Pipe</b> Protector (NRDPP), <b>roller</b> antifriction tools and vibration antifriction tools. The working principle, structure design, performance and field application of which are introduced. With the increasing numbering of complex structure wells which includes extended-reach well and horizontal well, antifriction technology has broad prospects for development...|$|R
50|$|As {{the tallest}} shed, Ruth has her work cut out, {{as she is}} 20 in too tall. As part of the redesign, though, Ruth had asked for a three-foot {{increase}} in height, which was accommodated by the experts by adding a 3 ft pony wall. Ruth, after tearing off the exterior sheeting, resolves to cut the shed where the main wall meets the pony wall and move the two pieces (each of which is easily under the height restriction), and reassemble it later. However, instead of adopting Jaime's approach (as Jaime had a similar problem and was successful at it), Ruth instead uses <b>pipes</b> as <b>rollers</b> to move {{the top half of}} the shed onto scaffolding, freeing the bottom half. However, she is stuck with what to do about getting the top half off the scaffolding. Resolving to weaken the scaffolding so that the top half easily drops onto the floor, the top of Ruth's shed collapses instead, crushing the pony wall and flattening her peaked roof. Ruth's shed is the last shed to make it out of the Handyman Rehabilitation Centre, but is now in three (incomplete) pieces (the bottom half of her shed and the two halves of what was her roof).|$|R
500|$|Riven {{has more}} complex and {{numerous}} puzzles than its forerunner and {{is set in a}} larger virtual world for players to explore. Whereas in Myst the objective of the game is to travel to different Ages to solve puzzles before returning to a [...] "hub Age", Rivens gameplay takes place on the five islands of the Age of Riven. Much of it consists of solving puzzles to access new areas of the islands, though players are also able to explore without fulfilling objectives. The volcanic landscape depicted, with its steep cliffs and crater lakes, is bestrewn with mechanical, Victorian-style artifacts such as elevators, <b>pipes,</b> levers and <b>roller</b> coaster-like transports. To solve the game, players must consider the purpose and physical principles of these artifacts as well as their role in the fictional culture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the processing and characterization {{of a new}} class of epoxy matrix composites reinforced with short fibers obtained from the scales of a fresh water fish (Labeo rohita). The functional groups involved {{in the formation of the}} resulting composite are identified. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis shows that the formation of hydrogen bonds occurring at the fiber-matrix interface between the oxygen atom of the epoxy and hydrogen atom of the polypeptide chain of fish scale is responsible for the formation of this new class of composites. These composites possess improved micro-hardness and exhibit tensile and flexural strengths marginally different from those of neat epoxy. These composites are expected to find applications as potential materials for conveyor belt <b>rollers,</b> <b>pipes</b> carrying pulverized coal in power plants, pump and impeller blades and also as low cost housing materials...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{semaphore}} signals were controlled by levers {{situated at the}} signals. Some early signals protruded {{from the roof of}} the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires (Continental Europe), or <b>pipes</b> supported on <b>rollers</b> (US). The levers were grouped together in a building known as a [...] "signal box" [...] (UK & Australia) or [...] "interlocking tower" [...] (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause some of the adjacent wires to 'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light signals from the mid 20th century.|$|R
40|$|A {{screw drive}} in-pipe robot is {{promising}} inspection equipment for small pipes. However, {{most of the}} existing screw drive in-pipe robots have problems of motion interference and slipping inside curved or irregular pipes. These problems result from the coupled relations among the steering motion, the motion speed and the load ability of the robot. In {{order to deal with}} the problems, the axiomatic design (AD) theory is applied to evaluate and analyze the existing designs. Then an uncoupled concept design based on the AD theory is proposed and the complete AD decomposition process is presented. After that, the proposed robot based on a tri-axial differential angle modulation mechanism is designed to realize the uncoupled concept. Finally, the uncoupled property is verified in a dynamics simulation system. The simulation results indicate that the motion speed, load ability and steering motion of the proposed robot can be adjusted individually compared with the robots that have inclining-angle-fixed rollers. Owing to the uncoupled design, the proposed robot can mechanically adapt to straight pipes and curved <b>pipes</b> with less <b>roller</b> slipping...|$|R
