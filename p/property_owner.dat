5|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of Cross and River Streets stands the Thompson Block, a historic building which was used as barracks in the Civil War. The Thompson Block suffered a bad fire early in the morning on September 23, 2009, and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets, installed shortly after the fire to stabilize the structure, blocked westbound traffic on Cross Street for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and the <b>property</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Brody v. Village of Port Chester (2003 and 2005), a takings case, Sotomayor first {{ruled in}} 2003 for a {{unanimous}} panel that a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> in Port Chester, New York {{was permitted to}} challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land {{should be used for}} a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.|$|E

5|$|The town of Hamilton was {{conceived}} by George Hamilton (a {{son of a}} Queenston entrepreneur and founder, Robert Hamilton), when he purchased farm holdings of James Durand, the local Member of the British Legislative Assembly, shortly after the War of 1812. Nathaniel Hughson, a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare {{a proposal for a}} courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly, which established a new Gore District, of which the Hamilton townsite was a member.|$|E
5|$|Apple River Fort, today {{known as}} the Apple River Fort State Historic Site, {{was one of many}} {{frontier}} forts hastily completed by settlers in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin following the onset of the 1832 Black Hawk War. Located in present-day Elizabeth, Illinois, United States, the fort at the Apple River settlement was built in less than a week. It {{was one of the few}} forts attacked during the war and the only one attacked by a band led by Black Hawk himself. At the Battle of Apple River Fort, a firefight of about an hour ensued, with Black Hawk's forces eventually withdrawing. The fort suffered one militia man killed in action, and another wounded. After the war, the fort stood until 1847, being occupied by squatters before being sold to a private <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> who dismantled the building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
50|$|<b>Property</b> <b>owners</b> and <b>property</b> {{managers}} can {{also come to}} terms through wholesale rental marketplaces. Through such marketplaces property managers compete against one another, bidding up the price offered and ultimately paid to <b>property</b> <b>owners.</b> By creating a market-derived price for properties’ rental weeks, such marketplaces often make it quick and easy for <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> and <b>property</b> managers to come to agreement and sign wholesale rental contracts.|$|R
5000|$|Comments by opponents: <b>Property</b> <b>owners</b> {{who receive}} {{the benefit of}} {{infrastructure}} improvements funded through the Texas Department of Agriculture grant programs {{should be required to}} pay taxes imposed on any resulting increase in the value of their property. Furthermore, to the extent the amendment permits the legislature to reduce the tax burden of those <b>property</b> <b>owners,</b> the amendment may result in a shift of that tax burden to other <b>property</b> <b>owners.</b> In a smaller city, that effect would be more pronounced because the shifted tax burden would be borne by a smaller number of taxpaying <b>property</b> <b>owners.</b>|$|R

5|$|D Charitable Foundation was {{established}} by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private school. Tax records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, {{the chief financial officer}} of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the <b>property</b> <b>owner,</b> Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed pursuant {{to an agreement}} between the General Services Administration (GSA) and Boston developer David Nassif, Sr. In July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation. GSA (the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> and manager for the U.S. federal government) began seeking to lease or build a structure to house the new agency in late 1965. Donald T. Kirwan, chief of GSA's leasing division, knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation, and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size. Nassif approached the RLA on April 21, 1966, and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th, 7th, D, and E Streets SW. In May 1967, GSA {{sent a letter to}} Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build. The $5.9 million land purchase was finalized on October 30, 1967. The cost of the structure is unclear. On November 15, 1967, Nassif had secured a $39 million construction loan. But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $27 million in July 1968. The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $26.5 million. The {{building was}} designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone, who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. On April 11, 1968, GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $98 million. John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{support for}} Diệm {{came from the}} Australian Catholic media. Diệm was a Catholic in a {{majority}} Buddhist country, and he had close religious links with the Vatican, who had helped him rise to power. He had stayed in a seminary run by Cardinal Francis Spellman in the United States in the early 1950s before his elevation to power. Diệm's elder brother Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic figure in Vietnam and a classmate of Spellman when the pair studied in Rome. Spellman was {{widely regarded as the}} most powerful Catholic figure in the United States and he helped to organise support for Diệm among American politicians, particularly Catholics. In 1957, Diệm dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary and ruled {{on the basis of a}} Catholic doctrine known as personalism. His younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu ran the secret and autocratic Catholic Cần Lao Party (Personalist Labor Party), which provided a clandestine network of support and police-state mechanisms to protect Diệm's rule. It counted many leading public servants and military officers among its members. Diệm also maintained land policies that were preferential to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> in the country. Their holdings were exempt from redistribution under land reform schemes, while the construction of Buddhist temples was restricted; military and civil service promotions were given preferentially to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.|$|E
