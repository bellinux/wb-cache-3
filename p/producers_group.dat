40|$|Poor {{organisation}} {{of agricultural}} markets in Poland {{remains one of}} the biggest problems for agricultural sector. There are about 510 agricultural <b>producer</b> <b>groups,</b> but only 2 % of Polish farmers selling for market are members. Knowledge on cooperation determinants and different aspects of <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> performance is crucial to build references for policy makers and producer groups&# 8217; managers. The aim of the article was to discuss factors affecting success of <b>producers</b> <b>groups</b> understood as a level of members&# 8217; satisfaction. Data for 2006 and 2011 from 30 <b>producers</b> <b>groups</b> in fruit and vegetable sector were analysed using logit model.

50|$|The model {{above is}} {{completely}} accurate {{only in the}} extreme case where no consumer belongs to the <b>producers</b> <b>group</b> {{and the cost of}} the product is a fraction of their wages. If the opposite extreme is taken, assuming that all consumers come from the producers' group, consumers' only purchasing power comes from the wages earned in production, and the product costs their whole wage, the graph looks radically different. Without tariffs, only those producers/consumers able to produce the product at the world price will have the money to purchase it at that price.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{reliability}} of cotton pickers is analysed and its importance in studying the performance of harvesting systems is examined. A theoretical development of farm machinery and specifically of cotton-picker reliability is presented and an algorithm based on the exponential distribution is developed. This algorithm is then applied to predict picker reliability, delays caused by machine breakdowns and their implications upon the cotton area harvested {{as well as the}} associated harvesting cost for a cotton <b>producers</b> <b>group</b> in Greece. The results obtained have shown a machine breakdown every 23. 7 h with an average repair time of 2. 86 h. Within a harvesting season, a cotton picker undergoes on average 12. 75 breakdowns and 4 days out of work. This means a reduction in the least cost area harvested of 20 % and an increase in the harvesting cost of 6. 5 %. (C) 2002 Silsoe Research Institute. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The north Queensland banana {{industry}} is {{under pressure from}} government and community expectations to exhibit good environmental stewardship. The {{industry is}} situated on the high-rainfall north Queensland coast adjacent to 2 natural icons, the Great Barrier Reef {{to the east and}} World Heritage-listed rain forest areas to the west. The main environmental concern is agricultural industry pollutants harming the Great Barrier Reef. In addition to environmental issues the banana industry also suffers financial pressure from declining margins and production loss from tropical cyclones. As part of a broader government strategy to reduce land-based pollutants affecting the Great Barrier Reef, the formation of a pilot banana <b>producers</b> <b>group</b> to address these environmental and economic pressures was facilitated. Using an integrated farming systems approach, we worked collaboratively with these producers to conduct an environmental risk assessment of their businesses and then to develop best management practices (BMP) to address environmental concerns. We also sought input from technical experts to provide increased rigour for the environmental risk assessment and BMP development. The producers' commercial experience ensured new ideas for improved sustainable practices were constantly assessed through their profit-driven 'filter' thus ensuring economic sustainability was also considered. Relying heavily on the producers' knowledge and experience meant the agreed sustainable practices were practical, relevant and financially feasible for the average-sized banana business in the region. Expert input and review also ensured that practices were technically sound. The pilot group producers then implemented and adapted selected key practices on their farms. High priority practices addressed by the <b>producers</b> <b>group</b> included optimizing nitrogen fertilizer management to reduce runoff water nitrification, developing practical ground cover management to reduce soil erosion and improving integrated pest management systems to reduce pesticide use. To facilitate wider banana industry understanding and adoption of the BMP's developed by the pilot group, we conducted field days at the farms of the pilot group members. Information generated by the pilot group has had wider application to Australian horticulture and the process has been subsequently used with the north Queensland sugar industry. Our experiences have shown that integrated farming systems methodologies are useful in addressing complex issues like environmental and economic sustainability. We have also found that individual horticulture businesses need on-going technical support for change to more sustainable practices. One-off interventions have little impact, as farm improvement is usually an on-going incremental process. A key lesson from this project has been the need to develop practical, farm scale economic tools to clarify and demonstrate the financial impact of alternative management practices. Demonstrating continued profitability is critical to encourage widespread industry adoption of environmentally sustainable practice...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of the}} experiment {{was to examine the}} medicating effects of alpha brainwaves on pain and anxiety. Three groups of five subjects each received biofeedback training with either alpha brainwaves (alpha group), the pre-recorded brainwaves of the alpha group (yoked group), or beta brainwaves (beta group). All subjects believed they were receiving alpha training. Their subjective evaluation of the intensity of cuff-induced pain was recorded along with the amount of alpha generated, pulse rate and blood pressure. The alpha and yoked (brain waves randomly and intermittently reinforced) groups showed no significant difference in enhancement of alpha over baseline measurements or in the reduction of blood pressure and pulse rate (physiological indicators of anxiety), however, both groups performed significantly better than the beta group. The alpha group was significantly better at controlling alpha and in increasing tolerance to pain over trials (p <. 10), however there was no overall difference between groups in tolerance to pain. Regardless of initial group assignment, "high" alpha producers generally showed a greater tolerance to ischemic pain than "low" alpha <b>producers.</b> <b>Group</b> differences were significant only at the p <. 20 level.
