5|$|CR492 intersects M-35 near Eagle Mills Location. M-35 {{approaches}} the county {{road from the}} north before it turns east to run concurrently with CR492. The two roadway designations cross a rail track before M-35 separates and turns south; traffic along the state highway must yield the right-of-way to traffic on the county road in the process. Eagle Mills is {{the location of the}} main LS rail yard and the former Pioneer <b>Pellet</b> <b>Plant.</b> CR492 curves away from this industrial area to the northeast. The roadway crosses Morgan Creek and enters the Morgan Heights area on the border of Negaunee Township and Marquette Township. This is the site of the first tuberculosis sanatorium in the Upper Peninsula built in 1911; the facility {{is said to have been}} haunted before the main buildings were torn down around 2002. The road continues east through forested lands in Marquette Township, rounding Dead Man's Curve and running downhill into the Morgan Meadows area. CR492 passes a convent of the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres before entering a residential area. The road curves north past these subdivisions, meeting the western end of CR500 (Grove Street). Further north, CR492 intersects Brookton Road before the southern segment terminates at US41/M-28 in the middle of Marquette Township's commercial corridor.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{engineering}} {{economic analysis}} of a biomass pelleting process was performed for conditions in North America. The pelletization of biomass consists {{of a series of}} unit operations: drying, size reduction, densifying, cooling, screening, and warehousing. Capital and operating cost of the <b>pelleting</b> <b>plant</b> was estimated at several <b>plant</b> capacities. <b>Pellet</b> production cost for a base case plant capacity of 6 t/h was about $ 51 /t of pellets. Raw material cost was the largest cost element of the total pellet production cost followed by personnel cost, drying cost, and pelleting mill cost. An increase in raw material cost substantially increased the pellet production cost. <b>Pellet</b> <b>plants</b> with a capacity of more than 10 t/h decreased the costs to roughly $ 40 /t of pellets. Five different burner fuels – wet sawdust, dry sawdust, biomass pellets, natural gas, and coal were tested for their effect on the cost of pellet production. Wet sawdust and coal, the cheapest burner fuels, produced the lowest pellet production cost. The environmental impacts due to the potential emissions of these fuels during the combustion process require further investigation...|$|R

50|$|The periods {{following}} the recessions of 1974-75 and 1981-83 were harsh ones for the iron ore industry. Cleveland-Cliffs shrank its operations, closing the Mather B Mine and the Pioneer <b>Pellet</b> <b>Plant</b> and associated Ore Improvement Plant in 1979. The Humboldt <b>Pellet</b> <b>Plant</b> closed in 1981 and the Republic Mine was idled in 1981 and closed for good in 1996, when Cliffs began turning the associated tailings ponds into compensatory wetlands for its other properties. Over {{half of the}} Marquette Iron Range employees were laid off and, in 1984, Cliffs withdrew from the Great Lakes shipping industry.|$|E

25|$|A new {{workshop}} at Bjørnevatn {{was completed in}} 1973 and the following year a new silo opened at Bjørnevatn, which also allowed for separating out ore with low iron content. Construction of a second pellets facility started in 1972 and was opened on 4 September 1974. This allowed the company's entire production to switch to pellets. Because the two <b>pellets</b> <b>plants</b> used a combined 20,000 tonnes of bentonite each year, a new import dock was built. The pellets production required increased freshwater access. This was fetched from Førstevatn, and to fill that lake, water was pumped from Svartakslavannet.|$|R
40|$|Iron ore pellets are a {{preferred}} feedstock for ironmaking. One method used for pelletizing is the grate-kiln process, first established in 1960. During the past decade, {{the establishment of}} new grate-kiln plants has increased rapidly, especially in China, and new constructors of <b>pellet</b> <b>plants</b> have started {{to operate in the}} market.

30|$|With due {{consideration}} of growing energy demand {{from the different}} industrial sectors, an essential strategy would be the development of highly integrated industrial sites. Such sites would serve to lower energy and resource consumption and, at the same time, complement one plant to another. For example, saw mills would supply huge biomass to other <b>pellet</b> <b>plants,</b> pulp and paper plant, and {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plants, and some portion of such biomass would be used to fulfill the internal heat requirements as well (Anderson and Toffolo 2013). Therefore, if these plants were combined it would reduce the energy and resource consumption and help reduce the environmental impacts.|$|R
40|$|As {{oil prices}} have risen {{dramatically}} lately, many people explore alternative ways of heating their residences and businesses {{in order to reduce}} the respective cost. One of the options usually considered nowadays is biomass, especially in rural areas with significant local biomass availability. This work focuses on comparing two different biomass energy exploitation systems, aiming to provide heat to a specific number of customers at a specific cost. The first system explored is producing pellets from biomass and distributing them to the final customers for use in domestic pellet boilers. The second option is building a centralised co-generation (CHP) unit that will generate electricity and heat. Electricity will be fed to the grid, whereas heat will be distributed to the customers via a district heating network. The biomass source examined is agricultural residues and the model is applied to a case study region in Greece. The analysis is performed from the viewpoint of the potential investor. Several design characteristics of both systems are optimised. In both cases the whole biomass-to-energy supply chain is modelled, both upstream and downstream of the pelleting/CHP units. The results of the case study show that both options have positive financial yield, with the <b>pelleting</b> <b>plant</b> having higher yield. However, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the <b>pelleting</b> <b>plant</b> yield is much more sensitive than that of the CHP plant, therefore constituting a riskier investment. The model presented may be used as a decision support system for potential investors willing to engage in the biomass energy field...|$|R

The Mather A Mine opened in the early 1940s and the Mather B shaft in the 1950s.
