5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse <b>perspiration</b> and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomic}} or involuntary nervous system, {{which is}} involved in the control of body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, is affected in two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but the impact is variable. Twenty percent may experience severe blood-pressure fluctuations and irregularities in the heart beat, sometimes {{to the point that the}} heart beat stops and requiring pacemaker-based treatment. Other associated problems are abnormalities in <b>perspiration</b> and changes in the reactivity of the pupils. Autonomic nervous system involvement can affect even those who do not have severe muscle weakness.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through <b>perspiration</b> and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} body wash after heavy work and <b>perspiration</b> under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very {{reluctant}} to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and <b>perspiration</b> while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous, as <b>perspiration,</b> or itchy skin.|$|E
25|$|Silk is {{resistant}} to most mineral acids, except for sulfuric acid, which dissolves it. It is yellowed by <b>perspiration.</b> Chlorine bleach will also destroy silk fabrics.|$|E
25|$|The global {{effects on}} the body include {{tachycardia}} (increased heart rate), vasodilation in skin (flushing), slower breathing, reduced appetite, and increased secretions and excretions such as <b>perspiration</b> and urination.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} ephedra {{consumption}} may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse <b>perspiration,</b> dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{and copper}} coins have a {{characteristic}} metallic smell that is produced upon contact with oils in the skin. <b>Perspiration</b> is chemically reduced upon contact with these metals, which causes the skin oils to decompose, forming with iron the volatile molecule 1-octen-3-one.|$|E
25|$|Protection: an {{anatomical}} barrier from pathogens {{and damage}} between {{the internal and}} external environment in bodily defense; Langerhans cells in the skin are part of the adaptive immune system. <b>Perspiration</b> contains lysozyme that break the bonds within the cell walls of bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Liquid latex {{may also}} be used as body paint. Aside the risk of contact allergy, wearing latex for a {{prolonged}} period may cause heat stroke by inhibiting <b>perspiration</b> and care should be taken to avoid the painful removal of hair when the latex is pulled off.|$|E
25|$|In the past, a woman's corset {{was usually}} worn over a chemise, a {{sleeveless}} low-necked gown made of washable material (usually cotton or linen). It absorbed <b>perspiration</b> {{and kept the}} corset and the gown clean. In modern times, a tee shirt, camisole or corset liner may be worn.|$|E
25|$|Some drummers wear special drummer's {{gloves to}} improve their grip on the sticks when they play. Drumming gloves often have a {{textured}} grip surface made of a synthetic or rubber material and mesh or vents on {{the parts of the}} glove not used to hold sticks, to ventilate <b>perspiration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Water based mediums, {{are great}} for clown make-up, i.e., for short term artistic or skin {{friendly}} make-ups, these are easy to apply, and easy to remove, with minimal damage to the skin, but water based make-up does not last a long while, and come off easily, even so with <b>perspiration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of buprenorphine are similar to those of other opioids and include: nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, cognitive and neural inhibition, <b>perspiration,</b> itchiness, dry mouth, shrinking of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), orthostatic hypotension, male ejaculatory difficulty, decreased libido, and urinary retention. Constipation and CNS effects are seen less frequently than with morphine.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaning {{over in his}} seat, and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to get his attention. After she {{asked him what he}} was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: <b>perspiration</b> from his feet dampened the TATP and prevented it from igniting.|$|E
25|$|After the insulin {{injection}} {{patients would}} experience various symptoms of decreased blood glucose: flushing, pallor, <b>perspiration,</b> salivation, drowsiness or restlessness. Sopor and coma—if the dose was high enough—would follow. Each coma would last {{for up to}} an hour and be terminated by intravenous glucose or via naso-gastric tube. Seizures sometimes occurred before or during the coma. Many would be tossing, rolling, moaning, twitching, spasming or thrashing around.|$|E
25|$|Ponies' coats easily became {{soaked with}} <b>perspiration</b> during exertion, thus necessitating {{constant}} attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast {{do not have}} sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.|$|E
25|$|While rubber {{is still}} used in textile manufacturing, its low {{tenacity}} limits {{its use in}} lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and <b>perspiration.</b> The textile industry turned to neoprene (polymer of chloroprene), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, spandex (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.|$|E
25|$|Underwear is worn for {{a variety}} of reasons. They keep outer {{garments}} from being soiled by <b>perspiration,</b> urine, semen, menstrual blood and feces. Women's brassieres provide support for the breasts, and men's briefs serve the same function for the male genitalia. A corset may be worn as a foundation garment to alter a woman's body shape. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including jockstraps and jockstraps with cup pocket and protective cup. Women may wear sports bras which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the ligaments of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.|$|E
25|$|Most {{animals have}} {{excretory}} systems for elimination of soluble toxic wastes. In humans, soluble wastes are excreted {{primarily by the}} urinary system and, {{to a lesser extent}} in terms of urea, removed by <b>perspiration.</b> The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. The system produces urine by a process of filtration, reabsorption, and tubular secretion. The kidneys extract the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water, sugars, {{and a variety of other}} compounds. The resulting urine contains high concentrations of urea and other substances, including toxins. Urine flows from the kidney through the ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra before passing from the body.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies of}} {{prepared}} learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males {{were far more}} difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of <b>perspiration</b> on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), {{these findings suggest that}} outgroup males may have been more of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|People {{choose to}} wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors {{for people who want}} to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or <b>perspiration.</b> This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.|$|E
25|$|Fashionable {{women of}} the Regency era wore several layers of undergarments. The first was the chemise, or shift, a thin garment with tight, short sleeves (and a low {{neckline}} if worn under evening wear), made of white cotton and finished with a plain hem that was shorter than the dress. These shifts were meant to protect the outer-clothes from <b>perspiration</b> and were washed more frequently than outer clothes. In fact, washer {{women of the}} time used coarse soap when scrubbing these garments, then plunged them in boiling water, hence the absence of color, lace, or other embellishments, which would have faded or damaged the fabric under such rough treatment. Chemises and shifts also prevented the transparent muslin or silk dresses from being too revealing.|$|E
25|$|When {{friction}} ridges {{come into}} contact with a surface that will take a print, material that is on the friction ridges such as <b>perspiration,</b> oil, grease, ink or blood, will be transferred to the surface. Factors which affect the quality of friction ridge impressions are numerous. Pliability of the skin, deposition pressure, slippage, the material from which the surface is made, the roughness of the surface and the substance deposited {{are just some of the}} various factors which can cause a latent print to appear differently from any known recording of the same friction ridges. Indeed, the conditions surrounding every instance of friction ridge deposition are unique and never duplicated. For these reasons, fingerprint examiners are required to undergo extensive training. The scientific study of fingerprints is called dermatoglyphics.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's {{senses of}} sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater {{distances}} than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced {{in a similar}} manner, allowing him to both hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify shapeshifting mutants despite other forms they may take. He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing, through concentration, {{as a type of}} natural lie detector, such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to <b>perspiration</b> when a lie is told.|$|E
25|$|The Tenifer process {{produces}} a matte gray-colored, nonglare {{surface with a}} 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of <b>perspiration.</b> Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates. During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed gas nitriding process. After applying the nitriding process, a black Parkerized decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of dark skin pigmentation {{is believed to}} have begun around 1.2 million years ago, in light-skinned early hominid species after they moved from the equatorial rainforest to the sunny savannas. In the heat of the savannas, better cooling mechanisms were required, which were achieved through the loss of body hair and development of more efficient <b>perspiration.</b> The loss of body hair {{led to the development of}} dark skin pigmentation, which acted as a mechanism of natural selection against folate depletion, and to a lesser extent, DNA damage. The primary factor contributing to the {{evolution of}} dark skin pigmentation was the breakdown of folate in reaction to ultraviolet radiation; the relationship between folate breakdown induced by ultraviolet radiation and reduced fitness as a failure of normal embryogenesis and spermatogenesis led to the selection of dark skin pigmentation. By the time modern Homo sapiens evolved, all humans were dark-skinned.|$|E
25|$|The {{strain of}} {{carrying}} the Premiership and Foreign Office {{contributed to his}} second stroke at 10 Downing Street after dinner {{on the evening of}} 23 June 1953. Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, {{and by the end of}} June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with <b>perspiration,</b> to lift himself upright from his chair. He joked that news of his illness had chased the trial of the serial killer John Christie off the front pages.|$|E
25|$|Liquids tend to {{have better}} thermal {{conductivity}} than gases, {{and the ability to}} flow makes a liquid suitable for removing excess heat from mechanical components. The heat can be removed by channeling the liquid through a heat exchanger, such as a radiator, or the heat can be removed with the liquid during evaporation. Water or glycol coolants are used to keep engines from overheating. The coolants used in nuclear reactors include water or liquid metals, such as sodium or bismuth. Liquid propellant films are used to cool the thrust chambers of rockets. In machining, water and oils are used to remove the excess heat generated, which can quickly ruin both the work piece and the tooling. During <b>perspiration,</b> sweat removes heat from the human body by evaporating. In the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning industry (HVAC), liquids such as water are used to transfer heat from one area to another.|$|E
25|$|The bite is {{immediately}} followed by local pain of a burning character; the limb soon swells and becomes discoloured, and within {{one to three}} hours great prostration, accompanied by vomiting, and often diarrhoea, sets in. Cold, clammy <b>perspiration</b> is usual. The pulse becomes extremely feeble, and slight dyspnoea and restlessness may be seen. In severe cases, which occur mostly in children, the pulse may become imperceptible and the extremities cold; the patient may pass into coma. In from twelve to twenty-four hours these severe constitutional symptoms usually pass off; {{but in the meantime}} the swelling and discoloration have spread enormously. The limb becomes phlegmonous, and occasionally suppurates. Within a few days recovery usually occurs somewhat suddenly, but death may result from the severe depression or from the secondary effects of suppuration. That cases of death, in adults as well as in children, are not infrequent {{in some parts of the}} Continent is mentioned in the last chapter of this Introduction.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} host location, female {{mosquitoes}} hunt their blood host by detecting organic substances such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol produced from the host, and through visual recognition. Mosquitoes prefer some people over others. The preferred victim's sweat simply smells better than others' {{because of the}} proportions of the carbon dioxide, octenol and other compounds that make up body odor. The most powerful semiochemical that triggers the keen sense of smell of Culex quinquefasciatus is nonanal. Another compound identified in human blood that attracts mosquitoes is sulcatone or 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, especially for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the odor receptor gene Or4. A {{large part of the}} mosquito’s sense of smell, or olfactory system, is devoted to sniffing out blood sources. Of 72 types of odor receptors on its antennae, at least 27 are tuned to detect chemicals found in <b>perspiration.</b> In Aedes, the search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until the perception of host stimulants, then it follows a targeted approach.|$|E
500|$|Khan's {{suit was}} made of {{reinforced}} latex, coloured steel-blue and fitted with micro-computer circuitry. Rampal's suit {{was made of}} three-inch thick solid rubber, and was red in color. Both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact. Wearing the suits created a number of difficulties for the actors. It took 20 minutes {{to put on the}} suits and 40 minutes to remove them. In addition, the non-porous nature of the suits created intense heat inside, causing excessive <b>perspiration</b> despite the presence of special air conditioning ducts. Khan later felt that the suits' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day; digital adjustments to the suits brought [...] "all the efforts to naught." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1805, {{the use of}} rectally applied {{tobacco smoke}} was so {{established}} {{as a way to}} treat obstinate constrictions of the alimentary canal that doctors began experimenting with other delivery mechanisms. [...] In one experiment, a decoction of half a drachm of tobacco in four ounces of water was used as an enema in a patient suffering from general convulsion where there was no expected recovery. The decoction worked as a powerful agent to penetrate and [...] "roused the sensibility" [...] of the patient to end the convulsions, although the decoction resulted in excited sickness, vomiting, and profuse <b>perspiration.</b> [...] Such enemas were often used to treat hernias. [...] A middle-aged man was reported in 1843 to have died following an application, performed to treat a strangulated hernia, and in a similar case in 1847 a woman was given a liquid tobacco enema, supplemented with a chicken broth enema, and pills of opium and calomel (taken orally). [...] The woman later recovered.|$|E
500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because she worried about other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] {{on her head and}} neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so you got this entirely organic sense that I was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly assumed she had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by <b>perspiration</b> and Turri would drain water from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At the end of each shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E
