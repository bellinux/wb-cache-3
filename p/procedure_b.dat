3000|$|The example {{presented}} above {{involved an}} easy choice because Procedure A yielded both a higher HR {{and a lower}} FAR than <b>Procedure</b> <b>B.</b> However, the issue becomes more complicated when the HR and FAR are both higher for one procedure than the other. For example, which procedure would be diagnostically superior if Procedure A yielded a HR of [...]. 80 and a FAR of [...]. 05, whereas <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> yielded a HR of [...]. 60 and a FAR of [...]. 02 ? The DR for <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> (. 60 /. 02 = 30) is higher than that for Procedure A (. 80 /. 05 = 16), so by that measure <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> would be preferred. However, this outcome would not actually identify <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> as being diagnostically superior. Why not? In brief, {{the reason is that}} {{it would be easy to}} selectively induce more conservative responding for Procedure A (e.g., using instructions that encourage a high degree of certainty before making an ID from the lineup), thereby lowering both the HR and the FAR for that procedure. Imagine that when conservative responding was encouraged for Procedure A, the HR dropped from [...]. 80 to [...]. 65 (still higher than <b>Procedure</b> <b>B,</b> with a HR of [...]. 60) and the FAR dropped from [...]. 05 to [...]. 02 (now equal to <b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> Under these conditions, Procedure A would clearly be the diagnostically superior procedure. Instead of switching from Procedure A to <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> to achieve a FAR as low as [...]. 02, it would make more sense to stick with Procedure A and to induce more conservative responding. In essence, that kind of comparison is what ROC analysis is all about, and it illustrates why ROC analysis is needed to unambiguously determine the diagnostically superior procedure.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} residual-based bootstrap methods à la GonÇalves and Perron (2014) {{to construct the}} confidence interval for structural impulse response functions in factor-augmented vector autoregressions. In particular, we compare the bootstrap with factor estimation (Procedure A) with the bootstrap without factor estimation (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> In theory, both procedures are asymptotically valid under a condition √T/N → 0, where N and T are the cross-sectional dimension and the time dimension, respectively. Even when √T/N → 0 is irrelevant, Procedure A still accounts for {{the effect of the}} factor estimation errors on the impulse response function estimate and it achieves good coverage rates in most cases. On the contrary, <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> is invalid in such cases and tends to undercover if N is much smaller than T. However, <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> is implemented more straightforwardly from the standard structural VARs and the length of the confidence interval is shorter than that of Procedure A in finite samples.

40|$|AbstractA new {{object-oriented}} {{approach is}} developed to classify glaciovolcanic landforms (Procedure A) and their landform elements boundaries (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> It utilizes the principle that glaciovolcanic edifices are geomorphometrically distinct from lava shields and plains (Pedersen and Grosse, 2014), and the approach is tested on data from Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland. The outlined procedures utilize slope and profile curvature attribute maps (20 m/pixel) and the classified results are evaluated quantitatively through error matrix maps (Procedure A) and visual inspection (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> In procedure A, the highest obtained accuracy is 94. 1 %, but even simple mapping procedures provide good results (> 90 % accuracy). Successful classification of glaciovolcanic landform element boundaries (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B)</b> is also achieved and this technique {{has the potential to}} delineate the transition from intraglacial to subaerial volcanic activity in orthographic view. This object-oriented approach based on geomorphometry overcomes issues with vegetation cover, which has been typically problematic for classification schemes utilizing spectral data. Furthermore, it handles complex edifice outlines well and is easily incorporated into a GIS environment, where results can be edited or fused with other mapping results. The approach outlined here is designed to map glaciovolcanic edifices within the Icelandic neovolcanic zone but may also be applied to similar subaerial or submarine volcanic settings, where steep volcanic edifices are surrounded by flat plains...|$|E
