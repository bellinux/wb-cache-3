The AAA changed its consumer fee schedule effective March 1, 2013. Under the current schedule, the AAA charges consumers a maximum fee of $200 (which is used to pay the AAA administrative fee), regardless of the type or amount of the consumer's claim; the business {{is responsible for the}} arbitrator fee, the hearing fee, and an AAA administrative fee.

50|$|Ordinarily, only <b>injunctive</b> <b>relief</b> is {{available}} {{under the new}} law.

The availability of monetary relief is a striking departure from state dilution laws, which have typically provided only <b>for</b> <b>injunctive</b> <b>relief.</b> Interestingly, the new law also provides that the ownership of a valid federal registration is a complete bar to the assertion of a dilution claim under state law, thereby effectively pre-empting state dilution claims against registered marks.|$|R
