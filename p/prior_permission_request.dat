30|$|The {{first step}} for a {{participating}} bank is to <b>request</b> <b>permission</b> from the Swiss Federal Department of Finance to participate. Such permission is necessary because cooperating {{with a foreign}} government to the extent required by the program without <b>prior</b> <b>permission</b> constitutes a breach of Art. 271 Abs. 1 of the Swiss penal code. 1 In July 2013, the Finance Department published a model request for banks to apply for such permission (EFD 2013).|$|R
40|$|In Apple’s iOS 6, when an app {{requires}} {{access to}} a protected resource (e. g., location or photos), the user is prompted with a <b>permission</b> <b>request</b> that she can allow or deny. These <b>permission</b> <b>request</b> dialogs include space for developers to optionally include strings of text {{to explain to the}} user why access to the resource is needed. We examine how app developers are using this mechanism and the effect that it has on user behavior. Through an online survey of 772 smartphone users, we show that <b>permission</b> <b>requests</b> that include explanations are significantly more likely to be approved. At the same time, our analysis of 4, 400 iOS apps shows that the adoption rate of this feature by developers is relatively small: around 19 % of <b>permission</b> <b>requests</b> include developer-specified explanations. Finally, we surveyed 30 iOS developers to better understand why they do or do not use this feature...|$|R
