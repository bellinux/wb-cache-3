2500|$|The main Japanese <b>position</b> <b>was</b> {{centred on}} Sanananda and Giruwa.

These were a series of posts which, apart from {{covering}} the approach to Sanananda, also denied the use of two branch tracks to Cape Killerton. The three outer defensive <b>positions</b> can <b>be</b> considered as being located {{at the corners of}} a triangle, while the main <b>position</b> <b>was</b> located at the centre of the base. [...] These <b>positions</b> <b>were</b> each separate but, initially at least, they could be readily resupplied and reinforced from the main position. The outer positions covered the likely approaches to Sanananda–Giruwa while the swamp effectively barred any attempt to by-pass these positions.|$|R

5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{in which the}} most powerful executive <b>position</b> <b>is</b> that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of direct democracy. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E

He predominantly played as a left back for Northampton and Bristol Rovers, but on his arrival at York he was converted to playing in left midfield.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is not {{extremely}} well known, {{and as a}} consequence, its phylogenetic <b>position</b> <b>is</b> not certain. In 2012 during a redescription of the taxon by Philip Mannion et al., it was recovered, in both cladograms, to be sister species to Supersaurus vivianae and together forming the most basal diplodocines. A 2012 cladogram, published by Mannion et al. and using a modified matrix of Whitlock (2011) found that Dinheirosaurus was more primitive than Torneria and more derived than Apatosaurus. However, a cladogram from 2014 found that their group was supported, but in fact more primitive than Apatosaurus, and therefore outside Diplodocinae.|$|E

Ammianus' report on the battle implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords.

5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this <b>position</b> <b>is</b> widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
