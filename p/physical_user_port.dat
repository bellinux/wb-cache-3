40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{researchers}} have embraced human-computer interface designs that include <b>physical</b> <b>user</b> interfaces augmented by computing power. These began with Weisser’s vision of ubiquitous computing and calm technology [8], and continued to notions of pervasive computing [1], tangible user interfaces [6], information appliances [7], ubiquitous media and reactive environments [2], interactive art installations (e. g., see SIGGRAPH Art Galleries), ambient displays [3], and context-aware computing [4]. The area is so new {{that we are still}} entranced by breakthrough examples of <b>physical</b> <b>user</b> interfaces. Indeed, many papers and proceedings are speckled with beautiful exhibits illustrating what can be done. While this is an exciting new area, everyday programmers face considerable hurdles if they wish to create even simple <b>physical</b> <b>user</b> interfaces. Most lack the necessary hardware training. Those willing to learn will find themselves spending most of their time building and debugging circuit boards, firmware and low-level wire protocols rather than building their <b>physical</b> <b>user</b> interface designs.

5000|$|Some of {{the oldest}} {{adapters}} are the C64 <b>user</b> <b>port</b> to RS232 converters. Those were standardized and originally designed to connect printers and other 3rd party hardware, including modems. Later, those adapters have also been adopted for disk drive emulation and even Internet connections. However, the most widespread adapters were probably the different disk drive and printer plug C64 serial bus to Parallel port adapter that evolved for transferring data between disk drives and parallel port supplied computers. Because of hard timing requirements on the C64 side, those are unfortunately not applicable to laptops or multitasking operation systems. There also exist a more limited number of adapters for the C64 tape interface. While the data transfer over the <b>user</b> <b>port</b> is usually limited to 2.4 kbit/s, the C64 expansion port cartridge interface supports transfer rates of one to two magnitudes higher through proprietary protocols. There exist C64 expansion port adapters that support both hard disks, memory cards, USB-disks and Ethernet connections.|$|R
