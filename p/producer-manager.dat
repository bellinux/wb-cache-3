Yost {{had previously been}} a member of the Echoes. The name [...] "the Classics" [...] came from the Classic drum set Yost owned. He was known in the Georgia/Florida area as the [...] "stand-up drummer" [...] because he played standing up. The Classics played Ventures covers, instrumental versions of [...] "Misty" [...] and [...] "Summertime". People started requesting vocals, so Dennis would say [...] "I can sing that," [...] and that was the beginning of the group's new direction.|$|E
5000|$|The song is {{the love}} song of a close family friend who babysits a young girl (actually the artist's manager's daughter), though {{for the first part}} of the song, the {{ambiguous}} text leads one to think that it is from one adult to another. The brief instrumental introduction is the sound of O'Sullivan whistling, before he comes in. The real Clair was the three-year-old daughter of O'Sullivan's <b>producer-manager,</b> Gordon Mills, and his wife, the model Jo Waring. The little girl's giggling is heard at the end of this song. The [...] "Uncle Ray" [...] mentioned in the song is O'Sullivan himself, a reference to his real name of Raymond O'Sullivan. The instrumental break in the middle section is done half a step up from A to B-Flat, before going back to A.|$|E

Hines' highest charting single was [...] "You" [...] (written by Tom Snow), which reached No. 2 on the Kent Music Report singles charts in October 1977.

Porter subsequently changed his mind about it. Aside from musical assistance Kennedy also designed Hines' performance costumes.|$|E

5000|$|Cole pulled {{together}} some L.A. session colleagues and cut his own psychedelic album: The Inner Sounds of the Id by 'The Id', recorded between 1965 and 1966 according to drummer Don Dexter. The musicians were: Jerry Cole (lead guitar, lead vocals, sitar), Don Dexter (drums, backing vocals), Glenn Cass (bass, backing vocals) {{and his brother}} Norman Cass (rhythm guitar, backing vocals). A massive collection of tracks was pared down to ten cuts and released by RCA in January 1967. The Animated Egg's self-titled album was released on the Alshire label in 1967 {{under the auspices of}} <b>producer-manager</b> Paul Arnold, who reportedly absconded with the unreleased Id material. However, shortly before his death, Cole determined that the Animated Egg tracks were probably recorded at a different session, and may have involved different musicians working with Cole. Either way, the Id and Animated Egg tapes were both subsequently recycled by Arnold for a series of releases including the 101 Strings' orchestral-overdubbed Astro-Sounds From Beyond the Year 2000. Cashing in on Jimi Hendrix's untimely death, many of the same tracks were also given new titles and released as a tribute album credited to The Black Diamonds. On October 15, 2006, Cole performed, as a lead guitarist, with his friend Dick Burns, of the original Dartells, as a [...] "New Dartell" [...] in the KVEN [...] "Boomer Blast" [...] oldies concert at the Oxnard Performing Arts Plaza, though he {{was not included in the}} then still uncompleted album Mo' Pastrami, which did include Freddy Cannon, Donny Brooks and Jewel Akens.|$|E
