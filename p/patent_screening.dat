We show that there are important complementarities among these instruments, and identify conditions under which they can be used to achieve either partial or complete screening. We simulate the model to study the welfare effects of different policy reforms. We show that intensifying patent office examination, frontloading patent fees and capping litigation costs all generate welfare gains, while replacing examination with a pure registration system reduces welfare...|$|E
40|$|Examination — {{the process}} of {{reviewing}} a patent application and deciding whether to grant the requested patent — improves patent quality in two ways. It acts as a substantive screen, filtering out meritless applications and improving meritorious ones. It also acts as a costly screen, discouraging applicants from seeking low-value patents. Yet despite these dual roles, the patent system has a substantial quality problem: it is both too easy to get a patent (because examiners grant invalid patents that should be filtered out by a substantive screen) and too cheap to do so (because examiners grant low-value nuisance patents that should be filtered out by a costly screen). This Article argues that these flaws in <b>patent</b> <b>screening</b> are both worse and better than has been recognized. The flaws are worse {{because they are not}} static, but dynamic, interacting to reinforce each other. This interaction leads to a vicious cycle of more and more patents that should never have been granted. When patents are too easily obtained, that undermines the costly screen, because even a plainly invalid patent has a nuisance value greater than its cost. And when patents are too cheaply obtained, that undermines the substantive screen, because there will be more patent applications, and the examination system cannot scale indefinitely without sacrificing accuracy. The result is a cycle of more and more applications, being screened less and less accurately, to give more and more low-quality patents. And although it is hard to test directly if the quality of patent examination is falling, there is evidence suggesting that this cycle is affecting the patent system. At the same time, these flaws are not as bad as they seem because this cycle may be surprisingly easy to solve. The cycle gives policymakers substantial flexibility in designing patent reforms, because the effect of a reform on one piece of the cycle will propagate {{to the rest of the}} cycle. Reformers can concentrate on the easiest places to make reforms (like the litigation system) instead of trying to do the impossible (like eliminating examination errors). Such reforms would not only have local effects, but could help make the entire patent system work better...|$|E

A female infant was diagnosed to have trisomy 21, atrio-ventricular septal defect and <b>patent</b> ductus. Newborn <b>screening</b> showed capillary TSH 43.8 mU/L(day 5), venous TSH > 150 mU/l and free T 4 15.1 pmol/L (day 12). Thyroid ultrasound showed a small gland with heterogenous echotexture and cystic changes. Scintigraphy showed normal uptake into an eutopic gland. The infant was treated with thyroxine and underwent cardiac repair at 69 days. Sequencing analysis of candidate genes involved in thyroid development revealed a new heterozygous mutation close to the transcription initiation site of the PAX 8 gene. Electromobility shift assay (EMSA) studies exhibited that the sequence at this position {{is not involved in}} specific protein binding. However, the mutant PAX 8 promoter showed a significantly reduced transcriptional activation of a luciferase reporter gene in vitro tested in HEK, PCCL 3 as well as in HeLa cells indicating that the mutation is very likely to lead to a reduced PAX 8 gene expression. Further study in infants with DS and TSH elevation are indicated to investigate {{whether or not there is}} a true association between DS and PAX 8 mutations.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contract}} theory, {{the terms}} [...] "screening models" [...] and [...] "adverse selection models" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably. An agent has private information about his type (e.g., his costs or his valuation of a good) before the principal makes a contract offer. The principal will then offer a menu of contracts in order to separate the different types. Typically, the best type will trade the same amount as in the first-best benchmark solution (which would be attained under complete information), a property known as [...] "no distortion at the top". All other types typically trade less than in the first-best solution (i.e., there is a [...] "downward distortion" [...] of the trade level). Optimal auction design (more generally known as Bayesian mechanism design) {{can be seen as}} a multi-agent version of the basic screening model. Contract-theoretic screening models have been pioneered by Roger Myerson and Eric Maskin.

40|$|Modern {{designers}} of graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, have obtained design patent protection for creative computer software displays, a realm previously limited to copyright. The difference in protection {{is important because}} design patents do not traditionally allow the same defenses - life fair use - associated with copyright. Apple 2 ̆ 7 s nearly billion dollar judgment against Samsung, which included such a GUI patent, brought this issue to the forefront. This article answers three emerging questions: 1. Aren 2 ̆ 7 t GUIs {{something that should be}} protected by copyright only? Why should there be a patent? The answer is relatively simple: the law has, since 1870, contemplated dual protection. The article traces the history to explain why the law could have evolved differently, but simply did not. 2. Display screens change, both before and after sale. How can someone <b>patent</b> an ephemeral <b>screen</b> design? It also turns out that ephemeral designs have been protected for some time. Even so, the article proposes some limitations on the protection of GUIs that should address the special nature of GUI design patents. 3. There are many differences between Apple 2 ̆ 7 s patent and Samsung 2 ̆ 7 s product. How can Apple own the idea of square icons in a grid with a dock bar at the bottom: This last question is the most intractable: determining when a design in infringing, and the role that functionality should play in that consideration. The bulk of this article is dedicated to answering this question. To answer the third question, the article draws on lessons from prior copyright disputes about GUIs. It first suggests that courts must act as gatekeepers, rather than allowing juries to determine which elements to disregard as functional. It then develops economic factors that can help the court determine whether a design element is functional, and whether to allow reuse by a competing program...|$|R

Unfortunately, the {{screening}} of candidate molecules for ion channels is mostly based on optical approaches that measure, as final readout, {{a cascade of}} events rather than direct channel activation. Overall these approaches are compatible with high throughput requirements but can be poorly predictive. Alternative methods, such as manual or automated patch clamp technologies, are valuable but expensive and time consuming. The poster illustrates the validation of a new Optical Method for Ion Channel <b>Screening</b> <b>patented</b> in Europe and pending acceptance in the USA (EP 2457088, WO 2011009825, US 13 / 386225).

When this platform was tested on different ion channel targets, the results were in good agreement with those reported in literature by gold standard approaches (manual and automated patch clamp). Finally, the platform was challenged with a small library of candidate molecules acting on the P 2 RX 7 ion channel and the results were compared with those obtained by FLIPR and QPatch. Also in this case, the results were comparable with those obtained by the established screening approaches. Overall, we demonstrate that this new platform allows the study of different ion channels, independently of the way they are operated, of their specific permeability, and of the extent of the ionic flux sustained at rest. This innovative platform provides an excellent compromise of cost per data point, throughput and prediction power in drug screening...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAltshuller <b>screened</b> <b>patents</b> {{in order}} to find out what kind of contradictions were {{resolved}} or dissolved by the inventors/inventions and the way this had been achieved. From this he developed a set of 40 inventive principles. Since the first Altshuller's formulation [1], the inventive principles have been largely used and studied by academic institutions and private companies operating in the product innovation field. Research on inventive principles is focused on improving principle definitions by providing a huge list of examples to be used as analogy and customizing definitions for specific domains (i. e. informatics, business, chemical, manufacturing and more others). Meanwhile, many authors worked on classifications and comparisons with other design models or problem solving methods. One of the reasons for this interest can be found in an attempt to reduce the degree of subjectivity in the use of this tool. This problem {{can be attributed to the}} high degree of abstraction with which many principles are written, inducing inevitably to a certain freedom of interpretation. In some cases, during the problem approaching, this ambiguity may lead the user not to fully capture the inventive essence. The goal of this work is to analyze all 40 principles from a new design perspective, i. e. the FBS (Functional Behaviour Structure theory) [2], {{in order to}} overcome their ambiguity and ameliorate their efficacy. New definitions have been conceived to make the user aware if he/she is acting on the function, the behavior or the structure of the device. This analysis has revealed that in many cases there is already a perfect matching between original Altshuller's definitions and FBS logic. That means a large part of the principles forces the user to act both on the function, the behaviour and the structure of the system. Where the matching with FBS is not complete, this classification/reformulation can help to enlarge the range of its interpretation/suggestions broadening the solution space. The potentiality of this work has been tested on a set of industrial case studies solved by 40 mechanical and management engineering students and by a group of TRIZ experts...|$|R
