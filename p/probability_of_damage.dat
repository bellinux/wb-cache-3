60|$|In {{the first}} place, it must {{by no means}} be supposed, because damage, or <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> to the {{interests}} of others, can alone justify the interference of society, that therefore it always does justify such interference. In many cases, an individual, in pursuing a legitimate object, necessarily and therefore legitimately causes pain or loss to others, or intercepts a good which they had a reasonable hope of obtaining. Such oppositions of interest between individuals often arise from bad social institutions, but are unavoidable while those institutions last; and some would be unavoidable under any institutions. Whoever succeeds in an overcrowded profession, or in a competitive examination; whoever is preferred to another in any contest for an object which both desire, reaps benefit from the loss of others, from their wasted exertion and their disappointment. But it is, by common admission, better for the general interest of mankind, that persons should pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequences. In other words, society admits no rights, either legal or moral, in the disappointed competitors, to immunity from this kind of suffering; and feels called on to interfere, only when means of success have been employed which it is contrary to the general interest to permit--namely, fraud or treachery, and force.|$|E

40|$|Private forest {{owners in}} {{southern}} Sweden consider wind damage {{to be one}} of the most problematic risks from an economic perspective. A potential climate change also raises the question of the possible impact of such a climate change on the risk <b>of</b> wind <b>damage.</b> Taking into consideration the spatial aspects, and the uncertain occurrence of windstorms over time and in space, this thesis aims at providing information to support the management of the risk <b>of</b> wind <b>damage</b> in south Swedish forestry. Computer models were used to assess the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> wind <b>damage</b> to forest stands, and to project forest stands within case study landscapes in southern Sweden. Although the topography is relatively gently in southern Sweden, it significantly influences the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> wind <b>damage</b> on a landscape scale. A possible cost-effective means to manage the risk <b>of</b> wind <b>damage</b> can be to target risk-reducing forestry measures to topographically induced wind exposed locations. To support the targeting of risk-reducing forestry measures a tool was constructed, accounting for different risk-preferences among forest owners, for the identification of stands with a high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> wind <b>damage.</b> The results emphasize the possibility to reduce the risk <b>of</b> wind <b>damage</b> by spatial forestry planning, taking wind shelter from topographic features and surrounding stands into consideration. Based on regional climate change scenarios, it cannot be ruled out that a climate change can lead to an increasing <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> wind <b>damage</b> in southern Sweden. In southernmost Sweden, a climate change very likely can lead to an increasing <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> wind <b>damage.</b> With implications for spatial forestry planning, the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> strong wind from the sector west to southwest is indicated to remain comparatively high. Shortening the lengths of rotation periods appears to be one possible means for forestry in southern Sweden to adapt to climate change...|$|R

40|$|The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> frost <b>damage</b> at {{the time}} of budburst on the lateral shoots of young trees of Picea sitchensis in Scotland, and at Masset on the Queen Charlotte Islands, was {{determined}} from (a) the dates of budburst, predicted from past temperature records using a thermal time / chilling model, and (b) the dates of last air frosts of — 2. 5 C. The mean date of budburst occurred between 6 and 13 May at a range of Scottish sites up to about 250 m altitude, but it occurred about 6 days later for each further 100 m increase in altitude up to 550 m. This resulted from an interplay between chilling and thermal time requirements for budburst. In different years, budburst dates ranged from mid-April to early June. From 1920 to 1960 there was a trend towards warmer springs and earlier dates of budburst, which has been reversed since 1960. Potentially damaging frosts have occurred near the date of budburst once every 3 years (on average) at Eskdalemuir and Braemar during the last 66 to 107 years, and once every 3 to 5 years in many upland plantation regions <b>of</b> Scotland. The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaging</b> frosts was greatest in the period 1930 to 1960 when bud-burst occurred relatively early, and has been relatively small since 1960, because budburst has occurred relatively late. Renewed warming of the climate in future may increase the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaging</b> frosts coinciding with the time of budburst. Masset, on the Queen Charlotte Islands, from where Britain has jmported most P. sitchensis seed, has relatively cool springs so that budburst occurs relatively late (averaging 18 May). Also there are few damaging frosts at Masset after late April. Consequently, potentially damaging spring frosts have occurred there only once in 65 years...|$|R

5000|$|The ADSS {{cable is}} {{suspended}} in the electrical field due to the phase conductors; this varies from a maximum at mid-span to zero at the grounded metal supports of the cable. In dry conditions, no current flows on the jacket of the cable, but moisture reduces the jacket insulation. Uneven distribution of moisture can result in formation of high-resistance [...] "dry bands" [...] which have a relatively high voltage across them. Dry bands tend to form at the supports. Voltage across the dry band can cause carbon tracks to form and erosion of the jacket material. If the voltage across the dry band is high enough, an arc may form which can damage the jacket. Dry-band arcing is more likely for cables installed under higher transmission voltage lines (220 kV and above). Even a few incidents of arcing along a dry band can cause severe permanent damage to the jacket, leading to subsequent failure of the cable. Relatively low sustained arc currents of a few milliamperes can cause eventual aging degradation of the cable. The magnitude of current available in an arc (and <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage)</b> depends on the geometry of the installation and is not simply correlated with the voltage of the transmission line. Wetting conditions near industrial plants or saltwater will have more severe effect on the jacket resistance than in freshwater rain or fog. While one measure to protect cables from dry-banding damage incorporates a semiconducting layer to equalize potential, a more feasible method uses externally applied protection within 50 metres of each support, since this is the area most susceptible to damage.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{parameters}} utilized {{to obtain a}} more reasonable performance for structures under earthquake excitations in seismic provisions. General considered parameters in seismic provisions are: PGA, importance factor (I) and typical inherent overstrength and global ductility capacity (R). It is well recognized that the main characteristic of the design of structures under seismic excitation is probabilistic rather than deterministic; therefore, it should be determined if whether the probability of structural damage decreases when such parameters change {{in the design of}} structures. In this paper, fragility curves are developed in order to evaluate these parameters. Fragility curves are employed for various probability parameters. These diagrams are utilized to demonstrate when a coefficient or a number of parameters are used to improve the performance level of a structure. Moreover, it guarantees that the probability of exceedance of the damage limit state decreases, as expected. These diagrams can further illustrate the effect of uncertainty of design parameters. After introducing fragility curves and the application procedure, the effect of the uncertainty of the PGA is displayed and discussed. The results reveal that by increasing the global ductility capacity (R), the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> exceedance is decreased; however, an increase in importance factor (I) for hospital buildings versus office buildings, cannot guarantee a decrease in the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> exceedance.

40|$|AbstractTo address {{many of the}} {{problems}} faced in hydrological engineering planning, design, and management, a detailed knowledge of flood event characteristics, such as flood peak, volume, and duration is required. Flood frequency analysis often focuses on flood peak values and provides a limited assessment of flood events. To develop effective flood management and mitigation policies, estimation of the scale of potential disasters, incorporating the effects of social factors and climate conditions, is required along with quantitative measures of flood frequency. The Japanese flood risk index, the flood disaster occurrence probability (FDOP), was established based on both natural and social factors. It represents the expectation <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> {{in the case of a}} single flood occurrence, which is estimated by integrating a physical-based approach as a Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) model with Gumbel distribution metrics. The resulting equations are used to predict potential flood damage based on gridded Japanese data for independent variables. This approach is novel in that it targets floods based on units of events instead of a long-term trend. Moreover, the FDOP can express relative potential flood risk while considering flood <b>damage.</b> The significance <b>of</b> the present study is that both the hazard parameters (which contribute directly to flood occurrence) and vulnerability parameters (which reflect conditions of the region where the flood occurred), including residential and social characteristics, were shown quantitatively to affect flood damage. This study examined the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> flood disaster occurrence using the TRIP model for Japan (J-TRIP), a river routing scheme that provides a digital river network covering Japan. The analysis was based on floods from 1976 to 2004 associated with flood inundation and sediment disasters. Based on these results, we estimated the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> flood <b>damage</b> officially reported for the whole region of Japan at a grid interval of 0. 1 degrees. The relationship between the magnitude of the rain hazard expressed as the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> exceedance and the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> flood <b>damage</b> officially reported was expressed as an exponential function by equalizing the whole region of Japan based on excess probability. Moreover, the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> flood <b>damage</b> occurrence according to social factors and changes in climate conditions were also examined. The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> flood <b>damage</b> occurrence is high, especially in regions of high population density. The results also showed the effect of the dam maintenance ratio on extreme flooding and flood <b>damage</b> frequency. The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> flood <b>damage</b> occurrence was expected to increase during extreme weather events at the end of this century.
