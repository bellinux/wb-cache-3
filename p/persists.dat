5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death.

This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E

40|$|Nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae strains {{isolated}} from {{patients with chronic}} bronchitis {{can be divided into}} those that <b>persist</b> in the lower respiratory tract and those that do not. We tested the hypothesis that <b>persisting</b> and nonpersisting strains differ in {{the extent to which they}} activate epithelial cells to produce two potent inflammatory mediators, interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8. A suspension of 10 (7) and 10 (8) colony forming units (cfu) x mL(- 1) of H. influenzae, <b>persisting</b> and nonpersisting, induced a dose- and time-dependent production of IL- 6 and IL- 8 by the human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma-derived cell line H 292, but levels of IL- 6 were lower after exposure to <b>persisting</b> H. influenzae (p < 0. 05). IL- 8 production showed a similar trend (p < 0. 02; analysis of variance). H. influenzae bacteria that adhered to H 292 cells were equally distributed over <b>persisting</b> and nonpersisting isolates and induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 levels similar to their nonadhering counterparts. The difference between <b>persisting</b> and nonpersisting H. influenzae was not due to cytotoxic, antimetabolic or antiproliferative effects on H 292 cells. Furthermore, pre-exposure of cells to <b>persisting</b> and nonpersisting isolates did not block subsequent IL- 1 beta-induced IL- 6 production. We conclude that <b>persisting</b> clinical isolates induce less interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 8 in H 292 cells than nonpersisting isolates, probably because they excrete lower amounts of a stimulus of H 292 cells. The stimulus is heat stable, hydrophilic and nonproteinous and probably not lipopolysaccharide alone. These findings support the suggestion that some strains of Haemophilus influenzae that <b>persist</b> in the airways of patients, may do so because they induce only a weak inflammatory respons...|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{individual}} neuroanatomical (MRI) and neuropsychological investigations {{were conducted}} for nine patients with unilateral neglect <b>persisting</b> at least 3 {{months after a}} cerebral vascular accident. The pattern of referrals, together with subsequent investigation, demonstrates that <b>persisting</b> neglect is rare in both right- and left-hemispheric lesioned patients. But while <b>persisting</b> neglect following a left-hemispheric lesion is even rarer than following a right-hemispheric lesion, it does occur. The neuroanatomical results indicate that <b>persisting</b> neglect {{may be associated with}} a different pattern of damage from acute neglect. In the nine patients investigated, <b>persisting</b> neglect reflected extensive lesions that involved three or more cortical lobes or subcortical regions. The results support previous findings that parietal lesions are common but not essential for <b>persisting</b> neglect. In the seven of nine neglect patients with parietal lesions, the rostral inferior parietal lobe and the parietal-frontal junction were involved. Of note was the finding that the brain regions most commonly implicated were the basal ganglia and the superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (including the frontal eye field). All of the patients with <b>persisting</b> neglect had a range of neuropsychological deficits, including extinction, personal neglect, and anosognosia for one or more aspects of their neglect. Although {{it was not possible to}} demonstrate a double dissociation with this pattern of results, the findings indicate that extinction and anosognosia are dissociable into function-specific forms.
