50|$|A {{component}} was a {{piece of}} code that provided various functions that may be invoked by clients. Each function was identified by a signed 16-bit integer <b>ID</b> <b>code.</b> Non-positive codes were reserved for predefined functions that should be understood by all components—open/close a component instance, query whether a function was supported, etc. The meanings of positive function codes depended on the type of component.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} fire consequences in complex underground networks, {{we want to}} implement a coupling between a <b>ID</b> ventilation <b>code</b> and a CFD model or a zone model. The project consists in 3 main steps: {{the development of a}} <b>ID</b> ventilation <b>code</b> whose programming structure will support a coupling with another code, the definition of exchange of boundary conditions between the 2 codes and the validation of this exchange. In this paper we present our new <b>ID</b> <b>code</b> developed in this framework. A case study shows the global reaction of the flow to a fire and proves the interest of keeping into account the whole network instead limiting the calculation domain to a zone closed to the accident...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{focuses on}} Class of Service Interconnection at inter- domain peering points. It specifies two new non-transitive attributes, which enable adjacent peers to signal Class of Service Capabilities and certain Class of Service admission control Parameters. The new "CoS Capability Attribute" is deliberately kept simple and denotes the general EF, AF Group and BE forwarding support across the advertising AS. The second "CoS Parameter Attribute" is of variable length and contains {{a more detailed}} description of available forwarding behaviours using the PHB <b>id</b> <b>Code</b> encoding. Each PHB <b>id</b> <b>Code</b> is associated with rate and size based traffic parameters, which will be applied in the ingress AS Border Router for admission control purposes to a given forwarding behaviour. The denoted Class of Service forwarding support is meant as the AS externally available (transit) Class of Service support...|$|R

40|$|This {{database}} of active coal impoundments was received {{in response to}} a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Pierce Greenberg on October 28, 2013.

S. Army Corps of Engineers <b>ID</b> <b>Code,</b> and date of dam creation. " The hazard potential status of each dam {{was not included in the}} request, following a conference call with MSHA on November 21, 2013 during which they indicated an intent not to disclose that information.
