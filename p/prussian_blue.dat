5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue,</b> a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20g per day of <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue</b> is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.|$|E

5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue</b> in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue</b> by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA soluble {{molecular}} analogue of photoresponsive Co/Fe <b>Prussian</b> <b>blues</b> {{is described}} within this report. As judged via {{a variety of}} spectroscopic, magnetic, and crystallographic methods, electron transfer within the octanuclear complex (below 250 K) converts paramagnetic red crystals into green diamagnetic ones. The color and magnetic changes {{are associated with the}} transformation of FeIIILS-CN-CoIIHS units into FeIILS-CN-CoIIILS fragments in manner that is identical to that found for the An[Co(OH 2) (6 - 6 m) ][Fe(CN) 6]m·xH 2 O (An = alkali metal cation) family of three-dimensional <b>Prussian</b> <b>blues.</b> Moreover, this intramolecular electron transfer can be quantitatively circumvented via rapid thermal quenching and reversed via simple white light irradiation at low temperatures. Remarkably the data suggests that thermally or photoinduced paramagnetic metastable phases are identical and exhibit long relaxation times that approach 10 years at 120 K...|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} is notoriously variable {{due to the}} presence of lattice defects, allowing it to be hydrated to various degrees as water molecules are incorporated into the structure to occupy cation vacancies. The variability of <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue's</b> {{composition is}} attributable to its low solubility, which leads to its rapid precipitation without the time to achieve full equilibrium between solid and liquid.|$|R
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue,</b> peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue,</b> vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue,</b> highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E

5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue</b> and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prussian</b> <b>blue</b> {{was first}} accidentally made around 1706, by heating {{substances}} containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other cyanides made subsequently (and named after it).

40|$|For {{the case}} of the commercially {{available}} metal-organic framework (MOF) structure Basolite (TM) F 300 or Fe (BTC) with BTC = benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylate, it is shown that the Fe(III/II) electrochemistry is dominated by reductive dissolution rather than ion insertion (which in marked contrast is dominating the behaviour of Fe(III/I) open framework processes in <b>Prussian</b> <b>blues).</b> Solid Fe(BTC) immobilised onto graphite or platinum working electrodes is investigated and it is shown that well-defined and reversible Fe(III/II) reduction responses occur only on platinum and in the presence of aqueous acid. The process is shown to follow a CE-type mechanism involving liberation of Fe(III) in acidic media, in particular for high concentrations of acid. Effective electrocatalysis for the oxidation of hydroxide to O- 2 (anodic water splitting) is observed in alkaline aqueous media after initial cycling of the potential into the reduction potential zone.

25|$|Caesium-137 {{is also a}} {{particular}} threat because it behaves like potassium and is taken up by cells throughout the body. Additionally, it has a long, 30-year half-life. Cs-137 can cause acute radiation sickness, and increase the risk for cancer because of exposure to high-energy gamma radiation. Internal exposure to Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the radioactive material to be distributed in the soft tissues, especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk. <b>Prussian</b> <b>blue</b> helps the body excrete caesium-137.|$|E

40|$|After the {{discovery}} of the phenomena of light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST), the functional properties of metal complexes have been studied intensively. Among them, cooperative phenomena involving low spin-high spin (spin-crossover) transition and magnetic ordering have attracted interests, and it has become necessary to formulate a unified description of both phenomena. In this work, we propose a model in which they can be treated simultaneously by extending the Wajnflasz-Pick model including a magnetic interaction. We found that this new model is equivalent to Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) Hamiltonian with degenerate levels. This model provides a unified description of the thermodynamic properties associated with various types of systems, such as spin-crossover (SC) solids and <b>Prussian</b> 1 <b>blue</b> analogues (PBA).

60|$|THE picturesque {{city and}} state of Heiligwaldenstein {{was one of those}} toy kingdoms of which certain parts of the German Empire still consist. It had come under the Prussian hegemony quite late in history--hardly fifty years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and Father Brown found {{themselves}} sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer. There had been not a little of war and wild justice there within living memory, as soon will be shown. But in merely looking at it one could not dismiss that impression of childishness which is the most charming side of Germany--those little pantomime, paternal monarchies in which a king seems as domestic as a cook. The German soldiers by the innumerable sentry-boxes looked strangely like German toys, and the clean-cut battlements of the castle, gilded by the sunshine, looked the more like the gilt gingerbread. For it was brilliant weather. The sky was as <b>Prussian</b> a <b>blue</b> as Potsdam itself could require, but it was yet more like that lavish and glowing use of the colour which a child extracts from a shilling paint-box. Even the grey-ribbed trees looked young, for the pointed buds on them were still pink, and in a pattern against the strong blue looked like innumerable childish figures.|$|R
