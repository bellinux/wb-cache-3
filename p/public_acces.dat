Statistical comparisons were made of both circulation and interlibrary loan (ILL) figures {{from the year before}} enhancement to the year after implementation. Data from sixteen libraries covering a seven-year period were studied {{in order to determine the}} degree to which patrons may or may not utilize increasingly broader OPAC ILL options over time. Results indicated that while ILL totals increased significantly after each OPAC enhancement, such gains did not result in significant corresponding changes in total circulation.

40|$|When {{the city}} centre {{is the major}} {{destination}} of the passengers, public transport vehicles will get fuller as they approach it. The disadvantage of time loss due to stops {{on the way to}} the centre is thus experienced by an increasing number of travellers. We demonstrate that optimal stop distances increase as vehicles get closer to the centre. This is at variance with the usual assumption of constant stop distances employed in this type of models. A Countervailing force is that urban densities increase as one approaches the centre. We demonstrate that there exist combinations of the various cost and density gradient parameters that result in constant stop distances as an optimal outcome. However, this is found for rather steep density gradients, so that the overall conclusion is that there are good reasons to let stop distances increase as one approaches the city centre.

The archive is a repository of public memory, and it comes into existence {{by an act of}} construction and collection - but also by acts of selection and exclusion—usually stretching over very long periods of time. The making of an archive takes place under particular economic, political, cultural and legal conditions of existence; my concern here is with the way in which changes in those legal conditions are currently transforming the quality of our dealings with the archive in the digital era, and thus the quality of ‘publicness’ of our <b>public</b> memory.

40|$|Proper {{management}} {{of water resources}} has got significant social and economic dimension. For this reason, it is an essential element of almost every national law, European Union law, and also international law in a broad sense. Legislative authority, during legislature process, should allway s balance private and public interests to adopt compromised solutions. Furthermore these solutions must be determined mostly by hydrology to be appropriate to the nature of waters and environment. Because of mentioned issues, it is very undesirable state of affairs when law simply does not fit to the object of its regulation. In Water Law Act of 2001 Polish legislator classifies lakes, depending upon the type of watercourse (natural or man-made) flowing into or out of the lake, among either flowing water or stagnant one. This regulation is against hydrological classification of lakes. Moreover this legal act introduces different treatment of dammed lakes in the context of public access to the lakeshores. Indicated problems have got significant impact on many aspects such as ownership of lakes, obligations of the owners of the lakes, lakes and environmental protection and, mentioned above, right to <b>public</b> <b>acces</b> to the lakes...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{electronic}} {{version of an}} article published in Economy and Society. © Copyright 1994 Taylor & Francis; Economy and Society is available online at [URL] recent years two factors have significantly affected the underlying conditions for the public circulation of ideas and information. On the one hand, the development of technologies for the electronic reproduction and dissemination of information has in principle made information limitlessly available; on the other hand, the process of legal regulation has, in all Western countries, constructed or affirmed property rights restricting and channelling the use of information. This paper analyses {{one of the most important}} recent American cases in intellectual property law, the 1984 Supreme Court majority and minority decisions in Sony vs Universal City Studios. It argues that, in allowing home video recording of off-air programmes and extending or at least upholding the doctrine of fair use, the Court’s decision nevertheless fails to challenge the philosophical contradictions in intellectual property doctrine which have allowed the progressive encroachment of private property rights on the <b>public</b> domain.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Dr. Sally YoungThis thesis reports {{the results of the}} most comprehensive study of political advertising in Australia. Over 1300 newspaper and television advertisements were analysed from the important post-war election of 1949 to the most recent federal election in 2001, using three complementary research methods-content analysis, discourse analysis and ad-mapping. The thesis engages with theoretical debates about the significance of elections, the 'effect' of political advertisements and the nature of civic discourse and political participation. It also examines claims of 'Americanisation', the impact of professionalisation, party convergence theory and theories of the mass media, including agenda setting, priming, framing and the impact of television. The results reveal that political advertising is central to the conduct of modern election campaigns. In some respects, political advertising has changed markedly over the past fifty years. There has been a declining emphasis on party in conjunction with a heightened focus on image, negativity and personalisation-in particular, negative personalisation and a focus on the opponent party leader. Some of these changes are of concern as they may have a detrimental impact on the political system and the way Australians elect their politicians. However, there are also some long-standing features of political advertising which have remained the same including narrow targeting, use of ads to set the public agenda, a homogenous conception of the audience, use of hard-hitting, negative discourse, appeals to voters' emotions and selfinterest, and a reliance on stereotypes to portray particular groups. These features demonstrate the many of the problems which have been identified as 'modern ills' are, in fact, deeply rooted in the past. Rather than spearheading any collapse of democracy, political advertisements are reflecting changes in the relationships between politicians, the media and the <b>public.</b> Open <b>Acces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1997 Paul Andrew Mees. This study examines the reasons behind the decline in public transport patronage in Melbourne between 1950 and 1990, through a comparison with Toronto. The share of urban travel undertaken by public transport has declined since the Second World War in all developed countries, but public transport patronage in Melbourne appears to have declined more rapidly than in most other industrialised cities. Public transport has, however, gained or held ground in Toronto, where the form of development is similar in many ways to Melbourne. Most accounts of Toronto’s success (particularly in Australia) regard transport/land-use integration as the critical factor. The contrasting analysis maintains that Melbourne’s urban form has changed over this period to a dispersed, car-oriented pattern. This study evaluates a different interpretation of the ‘Toronto model’. This is that Toronto has undergone similar urban changes to Melbourne since the war, but {{has found a way}} of operating public transport successfully in a relatively dispersed environment. The contrast with Melbourne, then, is not primarily in land-use patterns, but in policies towards the operation of <b>public</b> transport. Open <b>Acces...</b>|$|R

The paper is defending a hypothesis that many efforts are put to the supply side but too little attention is given to the side of demand. The process of the adoption of ICT is analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} ICT domestication theory. The methodology used in the study is based on the literature analyzes and case studies. The paper presents several projects as examples of fostering ICT demand: Rural Internet Access Points project, “Window to the Future ” initiative, etc. As a complex solution for considerably better use of the possibilities of information technologies among Lithuanian population currently developed libraries ’ <b>public</b> <b>acces...</b>|$|E
40|$|Drosophila melanogaster {{is widely}} used to {{decipher}} the innate immune system in response to various pathogens. The innate immune response towards persistent virus infections is among the least studied in this model system. We recently discovered a picorna-like virus, the Nora virus which gives rise to persistent and essentially symptom-free infections in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we have used this virus to study the interaction with its host and {{with some of the}} known Drosophila antiviral immune pathways. First, we find a striking variability {{in the course of the}} infection, even between flies of the same inbred stock. Some flies are able to clear the Nora virus but not others. This phenomenon seems to be threshold-dependent; flies with a high-titer infection establish stable persistent infections, whereas flies with a lower level of infection are able to clear the virus. Surprisingly, we find that both the clearance of low-level Nora virus infections and the stability of persistent infections are unaffected by mutations in the RNAi pathways. Nora virus infections are also unaffected by mutations in the Toll and Jak-Stat pathways. In these respects, the Nora virus differs from other studied Drosophila RNA viruses. <b>Public</b> Library Open <b>acces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of Cultural Studies ReviewThe recent international {{popularity of the}} Big Brother television franchise has highlighted {{some of the ways}} in which concepts of public and private space are being transformed in contemporary culture. The fact that the primary scene of action in Big Brother is a hybrid television studio fashioned as a domestic dwelling - a 'home' in which people live which being watched by others - brings into focus many issues raised by the increeasing mediatisation of what was formerly private space. In this sense, Big Brother forms a lighting rod from the ambivalent hopes and ambient fears produced by social and technological changes which have given new impetus to the modernist dream of the transparent society. In this essay, I want to reposition the Big Brother phenomenon in the context of an ealier debate about domestic space which occurred during the emergence of architectural modernism in the first decades of the twentieth century. At issue then was the physical construction of the home, particularly through the increasing use of glass as a design element. While glass architecture is even more prevalent in the persent, its spatial impact - particularly in terms of its capacity to alter the relationship between the 'inside' and the 'outside' - has now been matched or exceeded in many respects by the effects of electronic media. By tracing the parelledl between the unsettling spatial effects produced by both glass consturction and the electronic screen, I will sketch a cultural logic linking the modernist project of architectural transparency to the contemporary repositioning of the home as an interactive media centre. This shift corresponds to the emergence of a social setting in which personal identity is subject to new exigencies. As electronic media have both extended and transformed the spatial effects of glass construction, they have produced significant pressures on both private space and public sphere. Heightened exposure of the personal and the private is creating unpredictable consequences, no least in the <b>public</b> domain. Open <b>Acces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2001 Dr. Juliet Ella FleschA revised edition of this thesis was published as “From Australia with love : a history of modern Australian popular romance novels” by Fremantle Press, 2004. [URL] market romance fiction has attracted considerable scholarly attention, much of it unfavourable. Some scholars have accused it of perpetuating the subjection of women, of setting up inappropriate role models and unattainable (not to mention undesirable) goals for its readers. Others {{have seen in the}} popular romance, exemplified by the output of f-Harlequin Mills & Boon, the obliteration of individual difference with authors following a template or formula to produce an undifferentiated and unchanging product, to be consumed by an undiscriminating public. My thesis examines the romance novel in general, suggesting that the 'global phenomenon' is not as uniform as the term implies and revealing national differences in the publishing, marketing, authorship and readership. I argue that as well as being nationally distinctive, the production and consumption of romance fiction have not remained constant over time. I challenge the perception of these texts as unchanging and uniform, presenting evidence of change over time and differences within the work of individuals as well as between writers. I argue that within this diversity romance novels can be found which strongly endorse women’s rights and aspirations. I suggest that the world-view proposed by many novelists is more progressive than many critics have discerned, notably in terms of gender and race relations. The belief that the global appeal of romance fiction as entails the loss of national distinctiveness is also questionable. My thesis explores the Australianness of Australian mass market romance novels of {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century. I argue that the output of Australian authors remains distinct from that of American and British writers. There is an ‘Australian voice’ and it reflects and interprets Australian society for a local and world readership. Romance writers commonly assert that they reflect ‘community attitudes’ rather than attempting to change them. My thesis examines this claims in terms of the values implicitly and explicitly endorsed and concludes that the Australian romance novel of the end of the twentieth century reflects the more liberal and enlightened end of the spectrum of Australian <b>public</b> opinion.
