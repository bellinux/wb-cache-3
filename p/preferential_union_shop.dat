5000|$|More recently, however, {{historians have}} re-assessed the strike's success. Declared one historian, [...] "The {{failure of the}} strikers to win a <b>preferential</b> <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> did not detract from the {{significance}} of the struggle." [...] The success of the workers in overcoming racial divisions in one of the major cities of the Deep South is notable (and would rarely be achieved again until the 1960s), as is the unification of skilled and unskilled worker.|$|E
5000|$|By 1994, 9 {{percent of}} {{collective}} bargaining agreements in Canada required the closed shop, while 42.3 percent required the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> and 39.2 percent used the Rand formula. Just 3 percent used the agency shop, while 6.5 percent had the open shop. Alberta appointed an investigative committee in 1994 {{to see if}} adoption of American-style [...] "right to work" [...] laws would benefit the province. The committee strongly rejected the policy after Albertan employers strongly supported the <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b> <b>Union</b> <b>shop</b> clauses in Canadian collective bargaining agreements were enforceable.|$|R

5000|$|Japanese {{labor law}} treats large {{employers}} differently from small employers, and <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> provisions {{are much less}} likely to be negotiated in small workplaces. For example, Chalmers cites 1979 data showing that 50 percent of all workplaces in Japan had a <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> provision. But while 73 percent of employers with more than 1,000 workers had such agreements, just 59 percent of employers with 500 to 999 workers did so. Some agreements are ambiguously worded, making their enforcement problematic. Other <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> provisions are tied to various requirements that the union promote [...] "industrial peace", such as mandatory arbitration for all disputes and a relinquishment of the right to strike.|$|R

2500|$|The {{employers}} {{responded by}} attempting to make the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> the major strike issue. [...] The six largest employers first bolstered {{the resistance of the}} other manufacturers by declaring that the strike would be a long and arduous one. The steel companies then changed the strategy of their public relations campaign, emphasizing the union's proposal for a <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b> These changes in strategy reinforced the decision of the smaller producers to refuse to sign a contract on the union's terms. On July 3, all hold-out employers signed a [...] "no union shop" [...] pledge. Union president Philip Murray was forced onto the employer's ground in order to defend the <b>union</b> <b>shop,</b> which the organization had sought for more than 15 years.|$|R
