40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{landing gear}} is a landing gear (LG) capable of active adaptation to particular landing conditions {{by means of}} controlled hydraulic force. The objective of the adaptive control is to mitigate the peak force transferred to the aircraft structure during touch-down, and thus to limit the structural fatigue factor. This paper investigates the ultimate limits for improvement due to various strategies of active control. Five strategies are proposed and investigated numerically using a~validated model of a real, <b>passive</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> as a reference. Potential for improvement is estimated statistically {{in terms of the}} mean and median (significant) peak strut forces as well as in terms of the extended safe sinking velocity range. Three control strategies are verified experimentally using a laboratory test stand...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSemi-active {{landing gear}} can provide good {{performance}} of both landing impact and taxi situation, {{and has the}} ability for adapting to various ground conditions and operational conditions. A kind of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control algorithm (NMPC) for semi-active landing gears is developed in this paper. The NMPC algorithm uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization technique and chooses damping performance of landing gear at touch down to be the optimization object. The valve's rate and magnitude limitations are also considered in the controller's design. A simulation model is built for the semi-active landing gear's damping process at touchdown. Drop tests are carried out on an experimental <b>passive</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> systerm to validate {{the parameters of the}} simulation model. The result of numerical simulation shows that the isolation of impact load at touchdown can be significantly improved compared to other control algorithms. The strongly nonlinear dynamics of semi-active landing gear coupled with control valve's rate and magnitude limitations are handled well with the proposed controller...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of landing gear semi-active control for a small trainer aircraft in a multibody framework. The behavior of single <b>passive</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> drop test simulation models and of a complete aircraft landing simulation model, developed and implemented in the commercial multibody code ADAMS in previous works, is compared to the that of analogous models equipped with semi-active shock absorber controllers. The control strategy and the controller tuning and sensitivity tests are briefly outlined {{and the results of}} its application to the landing gears is presented. The reduction in peak vertical attachment load values for the landing gear drop tests ranges from 5 % to 35 %, depending on the test conditions, and in the complete aircraft landing simulation, it is in the order of 5 % to 20 %, once again depending on the particular landing configuration. Comparisons between the drop tests and complete landing simulations in corresponding conditions are made, and the significant sensitivity tests are repeated on the complete aircraft model. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When {{designing}} a <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control Langing gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the <b>passive</b> control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model and semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of <b>passive</b> control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{of an active}} control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> (ACOLAG) was developed and programmed for operation on a digital computer. The {{mathematical model}} includes theoretical subsonic aerodynamics; first-mode wing bending and torsional characteristics; oleo-pneumatic shock strut with fit and binding friction; closed-loop, series-hydraulic control; empirical tire force-deflection characteristics; antiskid braking; and sinusoidal or random runway roughness. The mathematical model was used to compute the loads and motions for a simulated vertical drop test and a simulated landing impact of a conventional (<b>passive)</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> designed for a 2268 -kg (5000 -lbm) class airplane. Computations were also made for a simply {{modified version of the}} passive gear including a series-hydraulic active control system. Comparison of computed results for the passive gear with experimental data shows that the active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> analysis is valid for predicting the loads and motions of an airplane during a symmetrical landing. Computed results for the series-hydraulic active control in conjunction with the simply modified passive gear show that 20 - to 30 -percent reductions in wing force, relative to those occurring with the modified passive gear, can be obtained during the impact phase of the landing. These reductions in wing force could result in substantial increases in fatigue life of the structure...|$|R
40|$|During {{hard landing}} or crash events of a {{helicopter}} there are impact loads that can be injurious to crew and other occupants as well as damaging to the helicopter structure. <b>Landing</b> <b>gear</b> systems are the first in line to protect crew and passengers from detrimental crash loads. The main focus {{of this research is}} to improve <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> systems of a lightweight helicopter. Magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) provide potential solutions to several engineering challenges in a broad range of applications. One application that has been considered recently is the use of magnetorheological (MR) dampers in helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> systems. In such application, the adaptive <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> systems have to continuously adjust their stroking load in response to various operating conditions. In order to support this rotorcraft application, there is a necessity to validate that MRFs are qualified for <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> applications. First, MRF composites, synthesized utilizing three hydraulic oils certified for use in <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> systems, two average diameters of spherical magnetic particles, and a lecithin surfactant, are formulated to investigate their performance for potential use in a helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The magnetorheology of these MR fluids is characterized through a range of tests, including (a) magnetorheology (yield stress and viscosity) as a function of magnetic field, (b) sedimentation analysis using an inductance-based sensor, (c) cycling of a small-scale MR damper undergoing sinusoidal excitations (at 2. 5 and 5 Hz), and (d) impact testing of an MR damper for a range of magnetic field strengths and velocities using a free-flight drop tower facility. The performance of these MR fluids was analyzed, and their behavior was compared to standard commercial MR fluids. Based on this range of tests used to characterize the MR fluids synthesized, it was shown that it is feasible to utilize certified <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> hydraulic oils as the carrier fluids to make suitable MR fluids. Another objective of this research is to satisfy the requirement {{of a helicopter}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper to enable adaptive shock mitigation performance over a desired sink rate range. It was intended to maintain a constant stroking force of 17 793 N (4000 lbf) over a sink rate range of 1. 8 - 7. 9 m/s (6 - 26 ft/s), which is a substantial increase of the high-end of the sink rate range from 3. 7 m/s (12 ft/s), in prior related work, to 7. 9 m/s (26 ft/s). To achieve this increase in the high-end of the sink rate range, a spiral wave spring-assisted <b>passive</b> valve MR <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper was developed. Drop tests were first conducted using a single MR <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper. In order to maintain the peak stroking load constant over the desired sink rate range, a bang-bang current control algorithm was formulated using a force feedback signal. The controlled stroking loads were experimentally evaluated using a single drop damper test setup. To emulate the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> system of a lightweight helicopter, an iron bird drop test apparatus with four spiral wave spring-assisted relief valves MR <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> dampers, was fabricated and successfully tested. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive MR <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper was theoretically and experimentally verified. The bang-bang current control algorithm successfully regulated the stroking load at 4000 lbf over a sink rate range of 6 - 22 ft/s in the iron bird tests, which significantly exceeds the sink rate range of the previous study (6 - 12 ft/s). The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive MR <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper with a spiral wave spring-assisted passive valve is theoretically and experimentally verified...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{landing gears}} are {{subjected}} {{to a wide range}} of excitation conditions with conflicting damping requirements. A novel solution to this problem is to implement semi-active damping using magnetorheological (MR) fluids. In part 1 of this contribution, a methodology was developed that enables the geometry of a flow mode MR valve to be optimized within the constraints of an existing <b>passive</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The device was designed to be optimal in terms of its impact performance, which was demonstrated using numerical simulations of the complete landing gear system. To perform the simulations, assumptions were made regarding some of the parameters used in the MR shock strut model. In particular, the MR fluid's yield stress, viscosity, and bulk modulus properties were not known accurately. Therefore, the present contribution aims to validate these parameters experimentally, via the manufacture and testing of an MR shock strut. The gas exponent, which is used to model the shock strut's nonlinear stiffness, is also investigated. In general, it is shown that MR fluid property data at high shear rates are required in order to accurately predict performance prior to device manufacture. Furthermore, the study illustrates how fluid compressibility can have a significant influence on the device time constant, and hence on potential control strategies...|$|E
40|$|One major task of an {{aircraft}} landing gear is the absorption of vertical energy which will mostly result either from the landing impact of from overrunning bumps and other ground irregularities. The necessity to limit the applied landing gear loads at the high stroke velocities at touch-down leads to damping characteristics which provide only lillte damping action at less vehement movements. Aircraft with high fuselage flexibility are therefore prone to vibration and resonance phenomena. The vonventional approach of developing the landing gear separetely from the airframe with only simple models to represent the aircraft ground dynamic properties seems no longer appropriate. Multibody system simulationis proposed as the basic software tool of an interdisciplinary development process which {{takes into account the}} elastic interaction between the aircraft components. The multibody system technique is aimed towards the simulation of the dynamics of a technical system in its entity, thus forming a core element of computer aided engineering software. Bi-directional interfaces to other software packages allow the integration of modeling and analysis data from a broad range of engineering disciplines. A case study demonstrates the optimization of a large transport {{aircraft landing gear}} layout in a multidisciplinary design environment. The aim is to improve the aircraft ride comfort on uneven runways without loss of landing impact absorbing qualities. Two landing gear concepts are considered: a conventional <b>passive</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and a semi-active landing gear...|$|E
40|$|Depending on the {{different}} sink speeds, angles of attack and masses; aircraft landing gears could face {{a wide range of}} impact conditions which may possibly cause structural damage or failure. Thus, in hard landing scenarios, the landing gear must absorb sufficient energy in order to minimize dynamic stress on the aircraft airframe. Semi-active control systems are the recent potential solutions to overcome these limitations. Among semi-active control strategies, those based on smart fluids such as magneto-rheological (MR) fluids have received recent attraction as their rheological properties can be continuously controlled using magnetic or electric field and they are not sensitive to the contaminants and the temperature variation and also require lower powers. This thesis focuses on modeling of a MR damper for landing gear system and analysis of semi-active controller to attenuate dynamic load and landing impact. First, <b>passive</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> of a Navy aircraft is modeled and the forces associated with the shock strut are formulated. The passive shock strut is then integrated with a MR valve to design MR shock strut. Here, MR shock strut is integrated with the landing gear system modeled as the 2 DOF system and governing equations of motion are derived in order to simulate the dynamics of the system under different impact conditions. Subsequently the inverse model of the MR shock strut relating MR yield stress to the MR shock strut force and strut velocity is formulated. Using the developed governing equations and inverse model, a PID controller is formulated to reduce the acceleration of the system. Controlled performance of the simulated MR landing gear system is demonstrated and compared with that of passive syste...|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise of aircraft on {{approach has been}} a focus of the aerospace community for many years. The present paper describes a method that predicts the noise from the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> accounting for local flow variations due to the wing ge-ometry, {{the interaction of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with high-lift devices, and a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometry. The prediction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise is performed using the <b>Landing</b> <b>Gear</b> Model and Acoustic Pre-diction code (LGMAP) developed at The Pennsylvania State University. A line of sight algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> Two-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the noise change due to the change in local flow velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> A three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of isolated LGMAP representations of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow features caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for the prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with the high lift devices.
