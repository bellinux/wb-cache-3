Price is a key management lever for firm performance (McKinsey 2002) and key determinant of purchasing decision for a consumer (Bishop 1984, Doyle 1984, Sawyer and Dickson 1984, Schechter 1984). However, customers do not remember exact price but have a band of prices that are acceptable (Monroe 1973) (Olson 1976) (Monroe 1969). This research uses Just Noticeable Difference (JND) theory as the theoretical lens to study online <b>pricing</b> <b>thresholds</b> in a retail service industry. This quantitative field study uses three and half years of non-contractual transactional and customer level data from a B 2 C company to evaluate the hypotheses. Two phased investigations are conducted. Study 1 empirically determines the <b>pricing</b> <b>threshold</b> range for the service industry. Study 2 examines the effect of pricing action on purchase frequency based on customer heterogeneity and competitive prices. Contributions are three-fold. Theoretically, the study furthers the conceptual understanding of the <b>pricing</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the digital marketplace by using real customer level data. Second, the application of JND theory in a non-contractual B 2 C sector confirms that <b>pricing</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the service industry are higher than consumer goods industry.

40|$|Abstract—Forecasting {{short-term}} electricity {{market prices}} {{has been the}} focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low fore-casting errors has not been always possible. However, certain ap-plications, such as demand-side management, do not require exact values for future prices but utilize specific <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. In this paper, classification of future electricity market prices with respect to pre-specified <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> is introduced. Two alternative models based on support vector machines are proposed in a multi-class, multi-step-ahead price classification context. Numerical results are provided for classifying prices in Ontario’s and Alberta’s markets.

This paper introduces smooth transition regression models to study threshold-based price elasticity of the top 4 brands across 20 fast-moving consumer good categories. Threshold-based price elasticity is found for 76 % of all brands: 29 % reflect historical benchmark prices, 16 % reflect competitive benchmark prices, and 31 % reflect both types of benchmarks. The authors demonstrate asymmetry for gains versus losses on three levels: the threshold size and the sign and {{the magnitude of the}} elasticity difference. Interestingly, they observe latitude of acceptance for gains compared to the historical benchmark, but saturation effects in most other cases. Moreover, category characteristics influence the extent and the nature of threshold-based price elasticity, while individual brand characteristics impact the size of the <b>price</b> <b>thresholds.</b> From a managerial perspective, the paper illustrates the sales, revenue, and margin implications for price changes typically observed in consumer markets. kinked demand curve, smooth-transition regression models, time-series analysis, asymmetric <b>price</b> <b>thresholds,</b> empirical generalizations...|$|R

Oil and gas companies that lease federal lands and waters agree to pay the federal government royalties on the resources extracted and produced from these leases. In 1995 [...] a time when oil and natural gas prices were significantly lower than they are today [...] Congress passed the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA), which authorized the Department of the Interior's (Interior) Minerals Management Service (MMS) to provide "royalty relief" on oil and gas produced in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico from leases issued from 1996 through 2000. This "royalty relief" waived or reduced the amount of royalties that companies would otherwise be obligated to pay. In implementing the DWRRA for leases sold in 1996, 1997, and 2000, MMS specified that royalty relief would only be applicable if oil and gas prices were below certain levels, known as "price thresholds," thereby protecting the government's royalty interests should oil and gas prices increase significantly. MMS did not include <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> for leases it issued in 1998 and 1999. Because oil and natural gas prices have risen significantly in recent years, the omission of <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> on the leases issued in 1998 and 1999 has resulted in significant foregone royalties to the federal government. In an effort to recoup some of these royalties, Interior is currently negotiating with some of the oil and gas companies that own these leases. Congress has also been considering legislative actions to recoup foregone royalty revenues on these leases or to encourage companies to negotiate with MMS. In addition to the foregone royalties on the 1998 and 1999 leases, one company, Kerr-McGee, is currently pursuing a legal challenge to the Interior's authority to place <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> on any deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000 under the DWRRA. If successful, this legal challenge would lead to additional foregone royalties on leases issued in 1996, 1997, and 2000. We reported to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in January 2007 that the royalty relief for leases issued under the DWRRA will likely cost the federal government billions of dollars, but that the final costs have yet to be determined. At that time, MMS' most recent estimates of forgone royalties were made in October 2004. In light of these findings, Congress asked us to evaluate the potential for foregone royalties resulting from the omission of <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> on the leases issued in 1998 and 1999.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Oil and gas production from federal lands and waters is critical to meeting the nation's energy needs. This production provided about 31 percent of all oil and 29 percent of all natural gas produced in the United States in fiscal year 2007. Every five years, the federal government decides the areas in the offshore waters of the United States it will offer for leasing and establishes a schedule for individual lease sales. The Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) has conducted these sales at least once per year {{for at least the}} past 30 years. During the sales, oil and gas companies bid for the rights to explore and develop the oil and gas resources on these leases and also agree to pay the federal government royalties on the resources produced. In 1995, a time when oil and natural gas prices were significantly lower than they are today, Congress passed the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA), which authorized MMS to provide "royalty relief" on oil and gas produced in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico from certain leases issued from 1996 through 2000. This "royalty relief" waived or reduced the amount of royalties that companies would otherwise be obligated to pay on the initial volumes of production from leases, which are referred to as "royalty suspension volumes. " The DWRRA also authorized the Secretary of the Interior to provide royalty relief to promote oil and gas development or to increase production from leases in the Gulf of Mexico. In implementing the DWRRA for leases sold in 1996, 1997, and 2000, MMS specified that royalty relief would be applicable only if oil and gas prices were below certain levels, known as "price thresholds," with the intention of protecting the government's royalty interests if oil and gas prices increased significantly. MMS did not include these same <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> for leases it issued in 1998 and 1999, and this action raised Congressional concerns that the federal government would lose billions of dollars in forgone revenues. We reported in April 2007 that MMS's failure to include <b>price</b> <b>thresholds</b> on leases issued in 1998 and 1999 under the DWRRA would likely cost the federal government billions of dollars in forgone royalties, but precise costs were impossible to determine because of uncertain future prices and production levels.
