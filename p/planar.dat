5|$|Circle inversions {{correspond}} to {{a subset of}} MÃ¶bius transformations on the Riemann sphere. The <b>planar</b> Apollonius problem can {{be transferred to the}} sphere by an inverse stereographic projection; hence, solutions of the <b>planar</b> Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the <b>planar</b> problem are possible besides the common ones described below.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A <b>planar</b> graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a <b>planar</b> graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected <b>planar</b> graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected <b>planar</b> graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some <b>planar</b> graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Rega {{released}} its 5th generation on Rega 3 turntables, {{and returned to}} its original name, <b>Planar</b> 3. A significant redesign, the 2016 <b>Planar</b> 3 features almost all new parts but still shares its basic engineering with its older siblings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Planar</b> graphs, {{and other}} {{families}} of sparse graphs, {{have been discussed}} above: they have linearly many maximal cliques, of bounded size, that can be listed in linear time. In particular, for <b>planar</b> graphs, any clique can have at most four vertices, by Kuratowski's theorem.|$|E
5|$|This {{follows from}} the fact that finding Hamiltonian cycles in maximal <b>planar</b> graphs is NP-complete. In a maximal <b>planar</b> graph, the book {{thickness}} is two if and only if a Hamiltonian cycle exists. Therefore, it is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given maximal <b>planar</b> graph is two.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with its}} use in graph theory, the duality of <b>planar</b> graphs has {{applications}} in several other areas of mathematical and computational study.|$|E
5|$|An st-planar graph is a {{connected}} <b>planar</b> graph {{together with}} a bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented <b>planar</b> graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the dual}} graph {{depends on a}} {{particular}} embedding, the dual graph of a <b>planar</b> graph is not unique {{in the sense that}} the same <b>planar</b> graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs. In the picture, the blue graphs are isomorphic but their dual red graphs are not. The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the outer face of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{position}} may {{be expressed}} directly in geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for global models or in a map projection <b>planar</b> coordinates for regional models.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} <b>planar</b> graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented <b>planar</b> graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected <b>planar</b> graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E
5|$|Many of the equivalences between primal and dual graph {{properties}} of <b>planar</b> graphs fail to generalize to nonplanar duals, or require additional care in their generalization.|$|E
5|$|One stable N-heterocyclic carbene has a {{structure}} analogous to borazine with one boron atom {{replaced by a}} methylene group. This results in a <b>planar</b> 6-electron compound.|$|E
5|$|<b>Planar</b> symmetries {{have for}} millennia been {{exploited}} in artworks such as carpets, lattices, textiles and tilings.|$|E
5|$|Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride, exist both in {{tetrahedral}} {{and square}} <b>planar</b> geometries. The tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic, whereas the square <b>planar</b> complexes are diamagnetic. In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes, they {{contrast with the}} divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which form only square-planar geometry.|$|E
5|$|Testing the {{existence}} of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along the spine of the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. And, although every <b>planar</b> graph has book thickness at most four, it is unknown whether there exists a <b>planar</b> graph whose book thickness is exactly four.|$|E
5|$|The duality between Eulerian and bipartite <b>planar</b> graphs can be {{extended}} to binary matroids (which include the graphic matroids derived from <b>planar</b> graphs): a binary matroid is Eulerian {{if and only if}} its dual matroid is bipartite. The two dual concepts of girth and edge connectivity are unified in matroid theory by matroid girth: the girth of the graphic matroid of a <b>planar</b> graph {{is the same as the}} graph's girth, and the girth of the dual matroid (the graphic matroid of the dual graph) is the edge connectivity of the graph.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed <b>planar</b> technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when <b>planar</b> transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival <b>planar</b> formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
5|$|A <b>planar</b> graph {{with four}} or more {{vertices}} is maximal (no more edges can be added while preserving planarity) {{if and only if}} its dual graph is both 3-vertex-connected and 3-regular.|$|E
5|$|An {{unconformity}} {{lies between}} the Catskill Formation and the Spechty Kopf Formation. The sandstone {{in the latter}} formation are mostly cross-bedded, although some areas have <b>planar</b> bedding. The Llewellyn Formation, containing conglomerate and sandstone {{is found in the}} Spring Run and Sugar Notch Run sub-watersheds.|$|E
5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all <b>planar</b> graphs may be transformed by <b>planar</b> duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding <b>planar</b> problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the <b>planar</b> problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although <b>planar</b> transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. <b>Planar</b> transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|Important {{milestones}} in {{the later}} development of book embeddings include the proof by Mihalis Yannakakis in the late 1980s that <b>planar</b> graphs have book thickness at most four, and the discovery in the late 1990s of close connections between book embeddings and bioinformatics.|$|E
5|$|In the two {{examples}} above, {{the field is}} the field of the real numbers and {{the set of the}} vectors consists of the <b>planar</b> arrows with fixed starting point and of pairs of real numbers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Organic amines {{react with}} TiCl4 to give {{complexes}} containing amido (R2Nâ-containing) and imido (RN2â-containing) complexes. With ammonia, titanium nitride is formed. An illustrative reaction is {{the synthesis of}} tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium Ti(NMe2)4, a yellow, benzene-soluble liquid: This molecule is tetrahedral, with <b>planar</b> nitrogen centers.|$|E
5|$|Reuleaux's {{original}} {{motivation for}} studying the Reuleaux triangle was as a counterexample, showing that three single-point contacts {{may not be enough}} to fix a <b>planar</b> object into a single position.|$|E
5|$|The medial graph {{of a plane}} graph is {{isomorphic}} to {{the medial}} graph of its dual. Two <b>planar</b> graphs can have isomorphic medial graphs {{only if they are}} dual to each other.|$|E
5|$|The <b>planar</b> {{aromatic}} chromophore {{portion of}} the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, as evidenced by several crystal structures.|$|E
25|$|An upward <b>planar</b> graph is a {{directed}} acyclic graph {{that can}} be drawn in the plane with its edges as non-crossing curves that are consistently oriented in an upward direction. Not every <b>planar</b> {{directed acyclic graph}} is upward <b>planar,</b> and it is NP-complete to test whether a given graph is upward <b>planar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>planar</b> {{separator}} theorem {{states that}} every n-vertex <b>planar</b> graph can be partitioned into two subgraphs of size at most 2n/3 by {{the removal of}} O(ân) vertices. As a consequence, <b>planar</b> graphs also have treewidth and branch-width O(ân).|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} defined by {{recursive}} subdivision of triangles, the Apollonian networks have several other equivalent mathematical characterizations. They are the chordal maximal <b>planar</b> graphs, the chordal polyhedral graphs, and the <b>planar</b> 3-trees. They are the uniquely 4-colorable <b>planar</b> graphs, and the <b>planar</b> graphs with a unique Schnyder wood decomposition into three trees. They are the maximal <b>planar</b> graphs with treewidth three, a class of graphs that can be characterized by their forbidden minors or by their reducability under Y-Î transforms. They are the maximal <b>planar</b> graphs with degeneracy three. They are also the <b>planar</b> graphs on a given number of vertices that have the largest possible number of triangles, the largest possible number of tetrahedral subgraphs, the largest possible number of cliques, and the largest possible number of pieces after decomposing by separating triangles.|$|E
25|$|The 3-coloring problem remains NP-complete even on 4-regular <b>planar</b> graphs. However, k-coloring of a <b>planar</b> graph is in P, {{for every}} k>3, since every <b>planar</b> graph has a 4-coloring (and thus, also a k-coloring, for every kâ¥4); see Four color theorem.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>planar</b> graph is locally outerplanar. However, {{not every}} locally outerplanar graph is <b>planar.</b>|$|E
25|$|When a <b>planar</b> graph G has maximum vertex degree three, {{its line}} graph is <b>planar,</b> and every <b>planar</b> {{embedding}} of G {{can be extended}} to an embedding of L(G). However, there exist <b>planar</b> graphs with higher degree whose line graphs are nonplanar. These include, for example, the 5-star K1,5, the gem graph formed by adding two non-crossing diagonals within a regular pentagon, and all convex polyhedra with a vertex of degree four or more.|$|E
