25|$|Partially {{hydrolysed}} <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> {{makes for}} another non-toxic medium for protein electrophoresis. The gels are slightly more opaque than acrylamide or agarose. Non-denatured proteins can be separated according to charge and size. They are visualised using Napthal Black or Amido Black staining. Typical starch gel concentrations are 5% to 10%.|$|E
40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} normal potato, waxy potato, yam and sweet <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> were examined and compared. Normal potato and waxy <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> displayed the B-type x-ray diffraction pattern, whereas yam and sweet potato displayed the CA- and C-type, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns of Naegeli dextrins of normal potato and waxy potato remained the B-type, {{but those of}} yam and sweet potato changed to the A-type. 31 P-NMR showed the phosphorus contents of the starches to be primarily phosphate monoesters with no detectable phospholipid {{in any of the}} four <b>starches.</b> Normal <b>potato</b> and waxy <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> displayed lower proportions (13 and 14. 8...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} size of amylopectin (AP) and amylose (AM), AP {{chain length}} distribution, crystallinity and granular structure (morphology and granule size distribution) of five wild type <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> (wtps), five AM free <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> (amfps), four high-AM <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> (haps), one wild type cassava starch (wtcs) and one AM free cassava starch (amfcs) were investigated {{and related to}} their gelatinisation characteristics. Starches {{with higher levels of}} short chains [degree of polymerisation (DP) 6 – 9 and DP 10 – 14) ] had lower gelatinisation onset (To), peak (Tp) and conclusion (Tc) temperatures, whereas higher contents of longer chains (DP 18 – 25 and DP 25 – 80) led to higher gelatinisation temperatures. Gelatinisation enthalpies (¿H) increased with degree of crystallinity. The granules of wtps were larger than those of amfps and haps, respectively. No differences in morphology were observed between wtps and amfps granules, but the haps granules had more irregular surfaces and showed multi-lobed granules...|$|R
50|$|Starch {{molecules}} arrange {{themselves in}} the plant in semi-crystalline granules. Each plant species has a unique starch granular size: rice starch is relatively small (about 2μm) while <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> have larger granules (up to 100μm).|$|R
25|$|In Korean cuisine, sweet <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> is used {{to produce}} dangmyeon (cellophane noodles). Sweet {{potatoes}} are also boiled, steamed, or roasted, and young stems are eaten as namul. Pizza restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Domino's in Korea are using sweet potatoes as a popular topping. Sweet potatoes are also used in the distillation {{of a variety of}} Soju.|$|E
25|$|According to its label, Spam's basic {{ingredients}} are pork, with ham meat added, salt, water, modified <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> as a binder, sugar, and sodium nitrite as a preservative. Natural gelatin is formed during cooking in its tins {{on the production}} line. Many have raised concerns over Spam's nutritional attributes, in large part due to its high content of fat, sodium, and preservatives.|$|E
25|$|Passover cake recipes {{call for}} <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> or Passover cake flour made from finely {{granulated}} matzo instead of regular flour, {{and a large}} amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use matzo farfel (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For families with Eastern European backgrounds, borsht, a soup made with beets, is a Passover tradition.|$|E
50|$|Food processing—especially crops {{grown and}} {{produced}} in the district—is common. Škrobárny Pelhrimov processes <b>potatoes</b> (<b>starch,</b> animal feed and mash).

50|$|<b>Potato</b> <b>starches</b> are {{commonly}} added in instant noodles to enhance gelling properties and water-holding capacities of noodles. Gelling properties could enhance the elasticity and chewiness of instant noodles, and water holding capacities could improve the smooth and shiny look of noodles after cooking and shorten the cooking time.|$|R
25|$|Kissel or kisel is a viscous fruit dish, {{popular as}} a dessert {{and as a}} drink. It {{consists}} of the sweetened juice of berries, like mors, but it is thickened with cornstarch, <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> or arrowroot; sometimes red wine or fresh or dried fruits are added. It {{is similar to the}} Danish rødgrød and German Rote Grütze. Swedish blåbärssoppa is a similarly prepared bilberry dessert, although only fresh or frozen bilberries, not dried berries are used to prepare it.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{isozymes}} may {{be almost}} identical in function, they may differ in other ways. In particular, amino acid substitutions {{that change the}} electric charge of the enzyme (such as replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid) are simple to identify by gel electrophoresis, and this forms {{the basis for the}} use of isozymes as molecular markers. To identify isozymes, a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer, and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by gel electrophoresis. Historically, this has usually been done using gels made from <b>potato</b> <b>starch,</b> but acrylamide gels provide better resolution.|$|E
25|$|Autochrome, {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} color process, {{was introduced by}} the Lumière brothers in 1907. Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of <b>potato</b> <b>starch,</b> which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency, the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing {{the color of the}} subject by the additive method. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} properties of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) starches prepared from rice, wheat, and <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> were studied. Rice and wheat OSA starches {{had significantly higher}} peak viscosity (PV), hot paste viscosity (HPV), and cool paste viscosity (CPV), but <b>potato</b> OSA <b>starch</b> had only significantly higher CPV, relative to the native starch. The gel hardness was higher with lower degree of substitution (DS) but lower with higher DS OSA compared to native starch. The swelling volumes (SV) of rice and wheat OSA starches were significantly higher compared to native starch, but the SV of <b>potato</b> OSA <b>starch</b> was slightly lower at high DS. The gelatinization temperature (GT) of rice OSA starches was sharply lower at low DS; for wheat OSA starch it was slightly lower even at high DS, but <b>potato</b> OSA <b>starches</b> had higher GT than the native starch. The enthalpy of all the OSA starches decreased gradually with increased DS. This study showed that the magnitude of changes in {{physical properties}} of OSA-modified starches depends not only on their DS {{but also on the}} botanical origin of the native starches. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Malonic acid (up to 37.5% w/w) {{has been}} used to {{cross-link}} corn and <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> to produce a biodegradable thermoplastic; the process is performed in water using non-toxic catalysts.

50|$|The starch {{industry}} extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot, and wheat, rice, and <b>potato</b> <b>starches.</b> To a lesser extent, sources of refined <b>starch</b> are sweet <b>potato,</b> sago and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted {{from more than}} 50 types of plants.|$|R
25|$|While {{there are}} close to 4,000 {{varieties}} of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, {{each of which has}} particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples—based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. Floury, or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.|$|E

Ingredients include {{proprietary}} formulations of proteins (slow-cooked soy, wheat and pea), organic flours (kamut, amaranth, millet, quinoa), <b>potato</b> <b>starch,</b> modified vegetable gum, organic beet fibers, and carrot fibers.|$|E
2500|$|Jewish cooks {{use both}} matzo meal and <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> for {{pastries}} during Passover. [...] Whisked whole eggs or egg whites are frequently {{used to make}} pastries without leavening agents, such as angel and sponge cakes (<b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> replacing cake flour) and coconut and almond macaroons.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{molecular}} characterization of starch polysaccharides to determine solution structure. Studies of amylose and <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> of different origins were {{carried out by the}} static light scattering, dynamic light scattering, and HPSEC-MALLS methods. Molecular parameters such as M-w, R-g, A(2), molar mass distribution, D-z, R-h, the structure-dependent rho-parameter, and osmotic modulus for amylose were determined. The M-w of amylose was found to be in the range from 1 x 10 (5) to 1 x 10 (6) g mol(- 1). The M-w of <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> was much higher, that is, in the range of 23 - 37 x 10 (6) g mol(- 1). The R-g of the amylose samples was in the range of 24 - 71 nm, and that of the <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> was between 130 and 150 nm. The intensity-time correlation function showed one diffusive relaxation motion for amylose as well as for starch. The diffusion coefficients of the amylose prepared from starch by several methods were in the range of 2. 7 - 9. 1 x 10 (- 8) cm(2) s(- 1), and those of the starches were 1 magnitude lower between 4. 8 and 6. 7 X 10 (- 9) cm(2) s(- 1). The rho-parameter of amylose was calculated as having values between 1. 5 and 2. 2, and that of starches was calculated to be an average value of 0. 62. The assumed solution behavior of amylose in dimethyl sulfoxide corresponds to that of a flexible chain, while the behavior of starch more closely resembles that of a spherelike structure...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} key {{ingredients}} in wheat based noodles: Wheat flour, water, and salt. Other than {{the three main}} ingredients, USDA regulations allow instant noodles to contain palm oil, seasoning, sodium phosphates, <b>potato</b> <b>starches,</b> gums, and other ingredients. Knowing the composition of instant noodles is crucial to understanding the physical chemical properties of the product; therefore, the function of each ingredient listed above is specified below.|$|R
25|$|Although uncompetitive economically, asphalt can be {{made from}} nonpetroleum-based {{renewable}} resources such as sugar, molasses and rice, corn and <b>potato</b> <b>starches.</b> Asphalt can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil, which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills. Use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently.|$|R

40|$|The {{gelatinization}} of waxy (very low amylose) {{corn and}} <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) (up to ∼ 1 GPa) {{was investigated in}} situ using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on samples held in a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The starch pastes, made by mixing starch and water in a 1 : 1 ratio (by weight), were pressurized and measured at room temperature. During HHP, both SAXS peak areas (corresponding to the lamellar phase) of waxy corn and <b>potato</b> <b>starches</b> decreased suggesting the starch gelatinization increases with increasing pressure. As pressure increased, lamellar peak broadened and the power law exponent increased in low q region. 1 D linear correlation function was further employed to analyse SAXS data. For both waxy potato and waxy corn starches, the long period length and the average thickness of amorphous layers decreased when the pressure increased. While for both of waxy starches, {{the thickness of the}} crystalline layer first increased, then decreased when the pressure increased. The former is probably due to the out-phasing of starch molecules, and the latter is due to the water penetrating into the crystalline region during gelatinization and to pressure induced compression...|$|R
