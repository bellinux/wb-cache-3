25|$|Jackson's {{career was}} not free of incidents. During the 1978 Gator Bowl, Jackson missed Ohio State Head Coach Woody Hayes' infamous <b>punch</b> <b>of</b> Clemson {{defensive}} lineman Charlie Bauman. Bauman had intercepted a pass and was {{pushed out of}} bounds on the Ohio State sidelines, and a frustrated Hayes threw a forearm at Bauman's throat. Jackson (and color commentator Ara Parseghian) failed to see or comment on Hayes' actions, which had been captured from a different vantage point on camera. No replay of the actual incident was available in the booth during the telecast, as the television crew was working with limited replay capability. In addition to this, no sideline reporter was available to provide information on {{the cause of the}} unsportsmanlike penalties that occurred as a result. This led to accusations that Jackson was protecting Hayes, who was later fired for the incident.|$|E

Merritt was led by the one-two <b>punch</b> <b>of</b> Casey Pierro-Zabotel and Wade MacLeod, who finished third and fourth respectively in BCHL scoring. Zabotel posted 116 points in 55 games while MacLeod chipped in 105 points in 60 games. Zabotel also represented the Centennials on the gold medal winning team at the inaugural World Junior A Challenge. The post-season saw the Cents fight hard only to lose in the seventh game of the opening round against the Trail Smoke Eaters. After the season, Zabotel won Interior Conference most valuable player, marking the first time ever that a Centennials player had claimed that award in back to back seasons. At the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, Zabotel became just the fourth player in franchise history to be drafted directly to the NHL when the Pittsburgh Penguins chose him in the 3th round, 80th overall. He is the highest player ever drafted directly from the Centennials to the NHL.|$|E

25|$|StingRays are {{generally}} {{known for the}} <b>punch</b> <b>of</b> their sound, making them very suitable for rock/funk applications and excellent for slapping, and for being of extremely high build quality. The 6-bolt neckplate {{is an example of}} this. The neck is also quite wide, especially compared to that of Fender Jazz Bass-type models (although a neck with a narrower nut was optional in the 70s and is again as of 2010 called the Stingray SLO Special), as well as having the above-mentioned truss-rod adjustment mechanism that allows players to adjust the truss-rod without removing the neck. Some users have also noticed an audible difference in volume between the lower three strings (E, A, D) and the highest G string, with the G string suffering from a lack of volume - conversely many users do not experience this, and recordings demonstrate an even volume across the strings, suggesting EQ choice in a live setting may be responsible. This problem has not been observed in 5-string StingRays. The Music Man StingRay comes in 4 & 5 string versions with the choice of bolt-on and neck-through construction (as of 2015).|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{opened their}} next road trip with a 5–4 defeat to the Milwaukee Brewers that snapped the six game win streak. The Brewers won on a walk-off double by George Kottaras off of Javy Guerra {{in the bottom}} of the ninth. The Dodgers {{suffered}} their second straight defeat in walk-off fashion the next night when Nyjer Morgan scored on a sacrifice fly by Ryan Braun {{in the bottom of}} the 10th inning. Matt Kemp hit his seventh home run of the season in the series finale to help the Dodgers avoid the sweep. Two good defensive plays at third base by Jerry Hairston, Jr. helped the Dodgers hold on to a 4-3 victory. The Dodgers next traveled to Houston for a matchup with the Astros. In the opener, the one-two <b>punch</b> <b>of</b> Kemp & Ethier again accounted for all the Dodgers runs in a 3–1 victory. Clayton Kershaw picked up his first win of the season in the next game as he struck out nine and only allowed three hits in seven scoreless innings. Kemp hit his ninth home run of the season and James Loney his first in the Dodgers 5-1 win over the Astros. The Dodgers road trip ended on a sour note as they got pounded by the Astros 12–0. Billingsley allowed nine runs in only 3 innings, including a grand slam home run by Jordan Schafer.|$|E

During the first stage, both pugilists {{fought in the}} middle of the ring, while he focused on attacking the body while the challenger employed jabs. During the second and third rounds, Mayol pressured the offensive, managing to land a moderate amount of punches. In the fourth round, Calderón began pursuing the offensive, while avoiding Mayol’s punches. This continued in the following chapter, but a head clash opened another laceration on his forehead, he continued the contest, but was more aggressive from this point onwards. Calderón’s corner tried to stop the bleeding, but the referee suspended the contest during the sixth round after these attempts proven unsuccessful. The fight was declared a technical draw, with both fighters receiving a 58-56 card while the third judge scored in 57-57. An immediate rematch was scheduled three months later. Calderón began this contest by effectively avoiding Mayol’s constant attack, while throwing limited punches. This pattern continued during the following three rounds. In the fifth, Mayol connected his best <b>punch</b> <b>of</b> the fight, winning the round. To retaliate, Calderón became more aggressive, throwing more combinations. The seventh round began with exchanges from both boxers, but a head clash opens another laceration that stops the fight. The contest was declared a technical decision, with the judges offering scores of 68-65 twice for Calderón and 68-65 for Mayol.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} for correcting the eccentricity in slight clearance <b>punching</b> <b>of</b> ultra-high strength steel sheets having low ductility {{was developed to}} improve the quality of sheared edges <b>of</b> <b>punched</b> holes. In this process, a moving die was employed in order to correct the eccentricity between the punch and die and to ease the setting of tools. The gap between the die and holder allowed the eccentric die to move, and thus the die became concentric after several strikes. For the moving die, the depth of the shiny burnished surface on the sheared edge increased and that of the rough fracture surface decreased. It was found that the application of moving die in slight clearance is indispensable for high quality <b>punching</b> <b>of</b> ultra-high strength steel sheets...|$|R

500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{commercial and}} critical reception. It reached a peak position of number three on Billboard Classical Albums chart and remains the Oregon Symphony's best-selling album as of 2013. In his review for Deseret News, music critic William S. Goodfellow wrote that each work contained [...] "sophistication and substance". Goodfellow said of Schwanter's composition: [...] "The more exotic scoring... {{as well as}} Schwantner's minimalistic treatment of the music's more militant episodes, gives it a drive and dramatic <b>punch</b> <b>of</b> its own." [...] The album features Raymond Bazemore as narrator; Goodfellow described Bazemore's [...] "occasionally sing-song narration" [...] in New Morning for the World as [...] "Lincolnesque". He wrote that Flagello's work contained [...] "writing of remarkable clarity and Italianate warmth", but thought Bazemore's voice sounded hoarse towards the end and preferred the solo sections in New Morning for the World. The Seattle Times Melinda Bargreen called the album [...] "strong and emotionally convincing", and praised [...] "excellent performances with strong soloists". She wrote that both works were composed in [...] "styles that are distinctively modern, but tonal and accessible". Bargreen described Bazemore's voice as [...] "deeply affecting" [...] and complimented DePreist for conducting [...] "with an obvious passion for the music, drawing remarkably detailed and virtuosic performances from his orchestra." [...] Tim Smith of the Sun-Sentinel said both works were [...] "well worth hearing" [...] and encouraged orchestras to explore the pieces, along with works by other African-American composers, to provide the public with broader programming. Smith described New Morning for the World as [...] "remarkably lyrical" [...] and [...] "quite dramatic"; he found Bazemore's sing-song narration to be [...] "too affected" [...] but found the conclusion [...] "touching" [...] and complimented the orchestra for its overall [...] "sturdy, communicative" [...] performance. Smith called Flagello's score [...] "unabashedly romantic" [...] and described as effective the work of Bazemore, DePreist and the orchestra.|$|E
