40|$|A {{series of}} four {{experiments}} are presented which contrast {{the hypothesis that}} synonymy is semantically represented with the hypothesis that synonymy is lexically represented. They also {{stress the importance of}} task focal information in the interpretation of experimental results. Current mental models appear to operate with the implicit assumption that synonymy is represented semantically. The findings of Biggs and Marmurek (1983, 1990), that synonymous word-picture prime-target presentations produced greater naming facilitation than their repeated counterparts, run counter to the semantic representation hypothesis. The current investigations manipulated the type and degree of <b>processing</b> <b>overlap</b> between prime and target items by using specific tasks for primes and targets. In Experiment 1 primes were named and targets were categorized. This removed lexical overlap, present in Biggs and Marmurek, and made task focal information different for primes and targets. The results showed greater facilitation in the repeated word-picture condition than in the corresponding synonymous condition. In Experiment 2 primes were categorized and targets were named. This manipulation re-instated lexical <b>processing</b> <b>overlap</b> in the word-picture conditions, while maintaining differences in focal information. The results showed statistically significant and equivalent facilitation for word-picture presentations in repeated and synonymous conditions. In Experiment 3 primes and targets were independently categorized. This manipulation removed lexical <b>processing</b> <b>overlap,</b> and made prime and target focal information similar. The results for repeated and synonymous word-picture presentations replicated those in Experiment 2. Experiment 4 required subjects to respond 2 ̆ 2 yes 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2 about category inclusiveness to pairs of sequentially presented items. The results indicated that response latencies for synonymous word-picture pairs were significantly faster than for those pairs in the repeated condition and that those conditions were faster than the related condition. Errors in the repeated and synonymous conditions were approximately equal and much lower than in the related condition. Combined error and response latency patterns suggested focal information was lexically based. These results favour the lexical hypothesis of synonym representation. Further discussion focuses on the implications of focal information monitoring for the interpretation of experimental outcomes...|$|E
40|$|In semi-structured text retrieval, <b>processing</b> <b>overlap</b> {{techniques}} {{are used to}} reduce the amount of overlapping (thus redundant) information returned to the user. The existence of redundant information in result lists is caused by the nested structure of semi-structured documents, where the same text fragment may appear in several of the marked up elements (see Figure 1). In consequence, when retrieval systems perform a focused search on this type of documents and use the marked up elements as retrieval objects, very often result lists contain overlapping elements. In retrieval applications where it is assumed that the user does not want to see the same information twice, it may be needed to reduce or completely remove this overlap and return a ranked list of no overlapping elements. Thus, depending on the underlying user model and retrieval application, different <b>processing</b> <b>overlap</b> {{techniques are}} used in order to decide, given a set of relevant but overlapping elements, what are the most appropriate elements to return to the user. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Although the problem of overlap in semi-structured text retrieval is as old as the semi-structured documents themselves, no much work has been published on processing techniques for reducing or removing overlap. Some related work can be found in the area of passage retrieval, where approaches that use a varying window size for passage selection might produce result lists with overlapping passages. However, most of this work is performe...|$|E
40|$|The LASS theory {{proposes that}} Language and Situated Simulation both play central roles in {{conceptual}} processing. Depending on stimuli and task conditions, different mixtures {{of language and}} simulation occur. When a word is processed in a conceptual task, it first activates other linguistic forms, such as word associates. More slowly, the word activates a situated simulation to represent its meaning in neural systems for perception, action, and mental states. An fMRI experiment tested the LASS account. In a first scanning session, participants performed the property generation task to provide a measure of conceptual processing. In a second scanning session a week later, participants performed two localizer tasks measuring word association and situated simulation. Conjunction analyses supported predictions of the LASS theory. Activations early in conceptual <b>processing</b> <b>overlapped</b> with activations for word association. Activations late in conceptual <b>processing</b> <b>overlapped</b> with activations for situation generation. These results, along {{with others in the}} literature, indicate that conceptual processing uses multiple representations, not one. Furthermore, researchers must be careful drawing conclusions about conceptual processing, given that different paradigms are likely to produce different mixtures of language and simulation. Whereas some paradigms produce high levels of linguistic processing and low levels of simulation, other paradigms produce the opposite pattern...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} {{examined the effects}} of conceptual processing on the implicit test of fragment completion. At study, subjects either generated a sentence to a word pair, solved a fragment (this fragment was paired with another word), or counted the number of vowels in a word pair.

This sentence also contained the other member of the studied pair. The fragment could be completed with the studied word or with another reasonable alternative. The results revealed functional independence between the two fragment completion tests. For the conceptual fragment completion test, a large depth of processing effect was found. On the standard fragment completion test, the moderate group yielded priming effects that were double as compared to the other two groups.

40|$|Prospective memory (ProM) is {{the ability}} to {{remember}} and carry out a planned intention in the future. ProM performance can be improved by instructing participants to prioritize the ProM task over the ongoing task. However, the improvement of ProM performance by emphasizing the relative importance typically restricted to situations in which the overlap between processing requirements of the ProM task and the ongoing task is low. Thus, additional processing resources are allocated to the ProM task and consequently, a cost emerges for the ongoing task. The aim {{of the present study was}} to further investigate this relationship. Participants were asked to respond to either semantic or perceptual ProM cues, which were embedded in a complex ongoing short term memory task. We manipulated absolute rather than relative importance by emphasizing the importance of the ProM task to half of the participants (i. e., without instructing them to prioritize it over the ongoing task). The results revealed that importance boosted ProM performance independent of the <b>processing</b> <b>overlap</b> between the ProM task and the ongoing task. Moreover, no additional cost was associated with absolute importance. These results challenge the view that importance always enhances the allocation of resources to the ProM task...|$|E

As such it has been used extensively in research investigating the nature of representations across various levels of the visual processing hierarchy. [...] In doing so researchers have found that repetition suppression appears to occur on multiple processing levels; dependent on the stimuli being processed and the processing level at which the experimental manipulation is directed; with reductions in neural activity to repeated stimuli occurring in regions involved with the initial processing of those features.

40|$|Guard periods {{are widely}} used to avoid inter block {{interference}} in wireless communication systems. The independent processing of each data block enables computational efficient data estimation, however, the necessary insertion of guard periods produces a transmission overhead and reduces the throughput of the respective transmission system. By using overlapping techniques a block-wise data estimation can be realized without using guard periods. With this modification, either the throughput of the system can be increased or the code rate of the forward error correction code can be reduced. Based on the latter option we will propose two optimized channel coding schemes for the overlapping based system. The first uses a reduced code rate while the second exploits the characteristic error distribution of the overlapping based data estimator. The bit error performance of the resulting transmission systems is finally compared to a common cyclic prefix based transmission system.

40|$|The {{effects of}} five single-amino-acid {{substitution}} mutations within the signal sequence of yeast prepro-alpha-factor {{were tested in}} yeast cells. After short pulse-labelings, {{virtually all of the}} alpha-factor precursor proteins from a wild-type gene were glycosylated and processed by signal peptidase. In contrast, the signal sequence mutations resulted in the accumulation of mostly unglycosylated prepro-alpha-factor after a short labeling interval, indicating a defect in translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. Confirming this interpretation, unglycosylated mutant prepro-alpha-factor in cell extracts was sensitive to proteinase K and therefore in a cytosolic location. The signal sequence mutations reduced the rate of translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum by as much as 25 -fold or more. In at least one case, mutant prepro-alpha-factor molecules were translocated almost entirely posttranslationally. Four of the five mutations also reduced the rate of proteolytic processing by signal peptidase in vivo, even though the signal peptide alterations are not located near the cleavage site. This study demonstrates that a single-amino-acid substitution mutation within a eucaryotic signal peptide can affect both translocation and proteolytic processing in vivo and may indicate that the recognition sequences for translocation and <b>processing</b> <b>overlap</b> within the signal peptide...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the neural processing of actions versus objects. Some have reported distinct areas subserving each item type, while others have found highly overlapping networks. These inconclusive results {{could be due to}} the use of different methodologies and tasks, {{as well as to the}} different ways these items are defined [...] i. e., as semantic concepts (actions vs. objects) or as lexical/grammatical entities (nouns vs. verbs). The aim of this fMRI study was to evaluate whether the semantic processing of actions and objects can be linked to distinct brain regions, and whether different tasks result in different patterns of activation in the same set of participants. Healthy native speakers of Italian saw and heard action and object stimuli presented in three different ways: black and white line drawings (picture-naming), single printed words (reading), and aurally-presented words (repetition). Overall, across two of the three tasks, actions produced more activation than objects in left precentral gyrus, bilateral middle and superior temporal gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, and right cerebellum. At no time did objects result in greater activation than actions. These findings suggest that the brain networks supporting action and object <b>processing</b> <b>overlap.</b> Furthermore, the fact that the type of task can influence the relative degree of action versus object activation differences most likely reflects the effect of presentation modality (i. e., pictures vs. written/spoken words) on the processing of one conceptual category versus the other...|$|E

To investigate {{the extent to which the}} cortical neural networks underlying object- and action-naming <b>processing</b> <b>overlap,</b> we performed electrostimulation mapping (ESM), which is a neurosurgical mapping technique routinely used to examine language function during brain-tumor resections. Forty-one right-handed patients who had surgery for a brain tumor were asked to perform overt naming of object and action pictures under stimulation. Overall, 73 out of the 633 stimulated cortical sites (11. 5 %) were associated with stimulation-induced language interferences. These interference sites were very much localized (< 1 cm(2)), and showed substantial variability across individuals in their exact localization. Stimulation interfered with both object and action naming over 44 sites, whereas it specifically interfered with object naming over 19 sites and with action naming over 10 sites. Specific object-naming sites were mainly identified in Broca's area (Brodmann area 44 / 45) and the temporal cortex, whereas action-naming specific sites were mainly identified in the posterior midfrontal gyrus (Brodmann area 6 / 9) and Broca's area (P = 0. 003 by the Fisher's exact test). The anatomical loci we emphasized are in line with a cortical distinction between objects and actions based on conceptual/semantic features, so the prefrontal/premotor cortex would preferentially support sensorimotor contingencies associated with actions, whereas the temporal cortex would preferentially underpin (functional) properties of objects.

Is {{this more than}} an analogy? “Musical approaches” to teaching Cantonese suggest that the keys to mastering tone lie in musical analogies, while popular belief suggests that musicians have an advantage in learning languages with complex tone such as Cantonese. But what, if any, {{is the basis for}} these notions? Recent work shows that both native and non-native speakers with musical training do have an advantage, not only for tonal but also for segmental perception (Pang 2012). Such behavioral results suggest that the mental resources used for tonal and musical <b>processing</b> <b>overlap</b> (Mok & Zuo 2012). An aspect of the equivalence between linguistic tone and musical pitch which can be confirmed empirically involves intervals (Chow 2012, Yiu 2013). While the F 0 interval between tone 1 [55] and tone 3 [33] is two to three semitones, the interval between the level tones 6 [22] and 3 [33] corresponds to a semitone, just as in Jones and Woo’s notation. These patterns have Implications for the representation of tone. Chan (1987) showed that tone pairs 25 / 55 and 23 / 33 are interchangeable, suggesting that tonal offsets are relevant to tone-melody mapping. Yet this fact is not captured by analyses positing tonal registers and features such as [+/- raised] (Yip 2001). The equivalences between musical and tonal intervals are reflected in the in tone-melody mapping at cadences, where particular tones serve as tonal targets {{at the end of a}} melody. As shown by Ho (2010), in Canto-pop major key songs end on either tone 3 [33] or tone 5 [23]; given that melodies typically end on the keynote, the choice of tonal target at the ending reflects the placement of the semitone between the keynote and the leading note, which may be sounded either in the melody or the accompanying harmony. We show that this pattern is highly consistent for major keys songs ending on the keynote, which consistently end on 23 or 33 tones. The patterns for minor key melodies are more variable, reflecting the differing placement of semitones in the various forms of minor scale. This evidence calls for a representation in which tonal offsets are explicitly represented, in order for them to be targeted by rules of tone-melody mapping and to serve as targets at cadences. This conclusion supports an analysis proposed for independent reasons in Lee (2014), in which both onsets and offsets are specified...|$|E

Yet, many pre-vious cortical neurophysiology {{studies have examined the}} visual and motormodalities in isolation, largely ignoring questions of large-scale cross-modal integration. To address this issue, we analyzed event-related local field potentials simultaneously recorded from multiple visual, motor, and executive cortical sites in monkeys performing a visuomotor pattern discrimination task. The timing and cortical location of four aspects of event-related activities were examined: stimulus-evoked activation onset, stimulus-specific processing, stimulus category [...] specific processing, and response-specific pro-cessing. Activations appeared earliest in striate cortex and rapidly thereafter in other visual areas. Stimulus-specific processing began early in most visual cortical areas, some at activation onset. Early onset latencies were also observed in motor, premotor, and pre-frontal areas, some as early as in striate cortex, but these early-activating frontal sites did not show early stimulus-specific process-ing. Response-specific processing began around 150 ms poststimulus in widespread cortical areas, suggesting that perceptual decision formation and response selection arose through concurrent pro-cesses of visual, motor, and executive areas.

The phenotypes of sym single mutants are essentially wild type. mec- 8; sym- 1 embryos arrest during embryonic elongation and exhibit defects in the attachment of body muscle to extracellular cuticle. sym- 1 can encode a protein containing a signal sequence and 15 contiguous leucine-rich repeats.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{noxious stimuli}} induce a {{suppression}} of cortical alpha activity, yet {{little is known}} about whether increasing alpha activity affects the processing of noxious stimuli. We have previously shown that visual alpha stimulation reduces experimental pain. Here, we demonstrate that increasing alpha power causes a reciprocal suppression of acute nociceptive processing. METHODS: We attempted to increase cortical alpha activity through visual entrainment at 8  Hz, 10  Hz and 12  Hz to investigate the influence on the electrophysiological pain response. Moderately painful laser-heat stimuli were delivered following 10  minutes of visual entrainment across the alpha range. RESULTS: Alpha power increased significantly relative to the 1  Hz control condition following 8  Hz and 10  Hz visual stimulation. Significant reductions in the P 2 peak amplitude of the laser-evoked potential were found following visual entrainment at 10  Hz; the frequency stimulation resulting in the largest reduction in pain perception. Source analysis revealed that, following the 10  Hz stimulation, sources of increased alpha power and decreased nociceptive <b>processing</b> <b>overlapped</b> in precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, with further reductions in nociceptive processing in insula cortex. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we are aware, this is the first study to provide direct evidence that experimental induction of increased alpha power suppresses the cortical processing of acute pain. SIGNIFICANCE: While it is known that visual stimulation can increase the brain's oscillatory alpha rhythms, here, we show that this increase in alpha power occurs alongside reduced cortical processing of nociception, as measured with EEG. This establishes an objective marker of alpha entrainment-based analgesia that may be useful in the development of neuromodulatory treatments for clinical pain...|$|R
