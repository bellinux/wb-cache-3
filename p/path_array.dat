By analyzing {{a large number}} of isochromosomes of the long arm of chromosome X (i(Xq)), using whole genome tiling <b>path</b> <b>array</b> comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), ultra-high resolution targeted aCGH and sequencing, we provide evidence that the FoSTeS and MMBIR mechanisms can generate large-scale gross chromosomal rearrangements leading to the deletion and duplication of entire chromosome arms, thus suggesting an important role for DNA replication-based mechanisms in both the development of genomic disorders and cancer. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanisms of dicentric i(Xq) (idic(Xq)) formation and show that most idic(Xq) chromosomes result from non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between palindromic low copy repeats (LCRs) and highly homologous palindromic LINE elements. We also show that nonrecurrent-breakpoint idic(Xq) chromosomes have microhomology-associated breakpoint junctions and are likely catalyzed by microhomology-mediated replication-dependent recombination (MMRDR) mechanisms such as FoSTeS and MMBIR.

Extensive bioinformatics analysis indicated in excess of 110 genes within the region and we also noted unfinished sequence on chromosome 6 q in the Human Genome Database, between 58 and 61. 2 Mb. Forty three genes within the RP 25 interval were considered as good candidates for mutation screening. Direct sequence analysis of the selected genes in 7 Spanish families with arRP revealed a total of 244 sequence variants, of which 67 were novel but none were pathogenic. This, together with previous reports, excludes 60 genes within the interval (∼ 55 %) as disease causing for RP.

Secular variation in stable isotope ratios and major/minor elemental composition records inter-annual and intra-annual changes in the environmental parameters or animal behavior for extant and extinct species. A polished specimen is attached to a stage beneath a fixed micro-milling head, and viewed on a large-screen monitor via a color digital camera. Growth bands (analogous to tree rings) are generally a result of variable accretion rates in biogenic carbonates. These growth features are first digitized in real-time as a series of three-dimensional coordinates. To better characterize complex growth features, intermediate coordinates are interpolated using a cubic spline fit through the digital points. Intermediate sampling paths, which mimic less visible daily growth banding, are in turn calculated between digitized curves.

Here, we demonstrate the applicability of RAD markers for both individual and bulk-segregant genotyping. First, we show that these markers can be identified and typed on pre-existing microarray formats.

We demonstrate the utility of the former approach by using a tiling <b>path</b> <b>array</b> for the fruit fly to map a recombination breakpoint, and the latter approach by creating and using an enriched RAD marker array for the threespine stickleback. The high number of RAD markers enabled localization of a previously identified region, as well as a second region also associated with the lateral plate phenotype.

We report on a girl presenting with an UMS like phenotype, a dysmorphic facies, and mental retardation. Mutation analysis of TBX 3 and G-banded chromosome analysis from lymphocytes were performed. We used microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) to investigate the patient's genomic DNA for submicroscopic aberrations. No mutation of the TBX 3 gene was detected in our patient and chromosome analysis revealed a normal female karyotype (46,XX).

Although the majority of data {{in the public domain}} are gene expression profiles, and expression analysis software are available, the increase of array CGH studies has enabled integration of high throughput genomic and gene expression datasets. However, tools for direct mining and analysis of array CGH data are limited. Hence, there is a great need for analytical and display software tailored to cross platform integrative analysis of cancer genomes. Results We have created a user-friendly java application to facilitate sophisticated visualization and analysis such as cross-tumor and cross-platform comparisons. To demonstrate the utility of this software, we assembled array CGH data representing Affymetrix SNP chip, Stanford cDNA arrays and whole genome tiling <b>path</b> <b>array</b> platforms for cross comparison.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteochondromas (cartilage-capped bone tumors) {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} treated of all primary benign bone tumors (50 %). In 15 % of cases, these tumors occur {{in the context of a}} hereditary syndrome called multiple osteochondromas (MO), an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by the formation of multiple cartilage-capped bone tumors at children's metaphyses. MO is caused by various mutations in EXT 1 or EXT 2, whereby large genomic deletions (single-or multi-exonic) are responsible for up to 8 % of MO-cases. Methods Here we report on the first molecular characterization of ten large EXT 1 - and EXT 2 -deletions in MO-patients. Deletions were initially indentified using MLPA or FISH analysis and were subsequently characterized using an MO-specific tiling <b>path</b> <b>array,</b> allele-specific PCR-amplification and sequencing analysis. Results Within the set of ten large deletions, the deleted regions ranged from 2. 7 to 260 kb. One EXT 2 exon 8 deletion was found to be recurrent. All breakpoints were located outside the coding exons of EXT 1 and EXT 2. Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) mediated by Alu -sequences, microhomology mediated replication dependent recombination (MMRDR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) were hypothesized as the causal mechanisms in different deletions. Conclusions Molecular characterization of EXT 1 - and EXT 2 -deletion breakpoints in MO-patients indicates that NAHR between Alu- sequences as well as NHEJ are causal and that the majority of these deletions are nonrecurring. These observations emphasize once more the huge genetic variability which is characteristic for MO. To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing large genomic deletions in EXT 1 and EXT 2. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 2000 live births have an apparently balanced translocation and {{that the risk of}} congenital abnormalities in these carriers is approximately double that seen amongst individuals with normal karotypes. To date, less than 50 de novo reciprocal balanced translocations have been sequenced across the breakpoint junctions and little is understood about the mechanisms that may cause these non-recurrent rearrangements. The aim of this thesis is to investigate methods of translocation breakpoint mapping. The results showed that array painting onto a Whole Genome Tile <b>Path</b> <b>array</b> followed by array painting onto a custom-made NimbleGen oligonucleotide array and subsequent amplification of the translocation junctions by long range PCR was the most efficient method tested for generation sequence across translocations. Analysis of the sequence generated showed that in the three patients studied, three of the six breakpoints directly disrupted a gene; CENTG 2 in a patient with a t(2; 7) (q 37. 3;p 15. 1) and PTPRZ 1 and DACH 1 in a patient with a t(7; 13) (q 31;q 21. 3). As an alternative approach, generation and screening of a custom-made fosmid library using flow sorted derivative chromosomes from an additional patient was used to generate sequence across the translocation breakpoints. This approach is useful for translocations in which additional complexity at the breakpoints confounds other methods for breakpoint mapping and sequencing. The fosmid library approach developed for the mapping of translocation breakpoints has also been applied to the mapping of viral integration into the human genome furthering our understanding of the integrated virus.

40|$|Eukaryotic {{chromatin}} is {{organised into}} {{a hierarchy of}} topologically constrained loop structures. Matrix Attachment Regions (MARs) are genomic sequences that mediate the anchoring of chromatin to the insoluble proteinaceous fraction of the nucleus known as the nuclear matrix. Since only a few MARs have been characterised so far, their role in genomic structure and function is not well understood. The aim of this thesis {{is to use the}} human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) as model region to provide novel insights into the relationship between chromatin folding mediated by MARs and gene expression. This large locus contains critical genes for immunity and is associated with more diseases than any other genomic region. Classical MHC genes are expressed in a cell type specific pattern, and can be induced by cytokines such as IFN-γ. MARs were identified across the entire MHC in uninduced fibroblasts, IFN-γ induced fibroblasts and B lymphoblastoid cells. Expression array analysis showed that these cell types exhibit different MHC expression profiles. MARs were first isolated treating nuclei with hypertonic buffers followed by nuclease digestion and then mapped by hybridizing them onto a novel tiling <b>path</b> <b>array</b> for the MHC. The suitability of this array platform to study DNA-protein interactions was verified using hybridisations of CIITA-enriched DNA and DNA enriched in H 3 -K 9 /K 14 acetylation. The findings reveal that MARs are unevenly distributed across the MHC, and that they can be classified into three classes: constitutive, cell type specific and transcriptiondependent. These sequences are mainly positioned in intergenic regions and in close proximity to the MHC class boundaries, subdividing the locus into physical domains. By comparing the position of MARs in uninduced fibroblasts, IFN-γ induced fibroblasts and B lymphoblastoid cells, transcriptional activation of the MHC was found to be associated with a reconfiguration of chromatin architecture resulting from the formation of additional genomic anchors. These results suggest that the dynamic tethering of chromatin is linked to transcriptional regulation. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} present work was to characterize the genetic and clinical diversity of such tumors by high resolution arrayCGH profiling. Methods: Based on a 32 K BAC whole-genome tiling <b>path</b> <b>array</b> and using 50 - 250 K Affymetrix SNP array platforms for verification, DNA copy number profiles were generated for 34 consecutive high-risk or lethal outcome neuroblastomas. In addition, age and MYCN amplification (MNA) status were retrieved for 112 unfavorable neuroblastomas of the Swedish Childhood Cancer Registry, representing a 25 -year neuroblastoma cohort of Sweden, here used for validation of the findings. Statistical tests used were: Fisher's exact test, Bayes moderated t-test, independent samples t-test, and correlation analysis. Results: MNA or segmental 11 q loss (11 q-) was found in 28 / 34 tumors. With two exceptions, these aberrations were mutually exclusive. Children with MNA tumors were diagnosed at significantly younger ages than those with 11 q-tumors (mean: 27. 4 vs. 69. 5 months; p= 0. 008; n= 14 / 12), and MNA tumors had significantly fewer segmental chromosomal aberrations (mean: 5. 5 vs. 12. 0; p< 0. 001). Furthermore, in the 11 q-tumor group a positive correlation was seen between the number of segmental aberrations and the age at diagnosis (Pearson Correlation 0. 606; p= 0. 037). Among nonMNA/non 11 q-tumors (n= 6), one tumor displayed amplicons on 11 q and 12 q and three others bore evidence of progression from low-risk tumors due to retrospective evidence of disease six years before diagnosis, or due to tumor profiles with high proportions of numerical chromosomal aberrations. An early age at diagnosis of MNA neuroblastomas was verified by registry data, with an average of 29. 2 months for 43 cases that {{were not included in the}} present study. Conclusion: MNA and segmental 11 q loss define two major genetic variants of unfavorable neuroblastoma with apparent differences in their pace of tumor evolution and in genomic integrity. Other possible, but less common, routes in the development of aggressive tumors are progression of low-risk infant-type lesions, and gene amplifications other than MYCN. Knowledge on such nosological diversity of aggressive neuroblastoma might influence future strategies for therapy. De två sista författarna delar sistaförfattarskapet. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Natural killer (NK) cell {{lymphoma}} {{encompasses a}} related spectrum of diseases and {{is among the}} most aggressive of all lymphoid malignancies. The nasal type is characterized by necrotic lesions in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, or palate, whereas patients suffering from the aggressive type might die within a short time from disseminated disease or multi-organ failure. It is a relatively rare disease and is generally more common in Asians than in other races. Since it has not been well characterized until recently, the identification of genetic alterations would provide important insights into the genomic mechanism of lymphomagenesis. Hypotheses: NK cell lymphoma pathogenesis occurs via multiple genomic alterations and the critical alterations will be present in multiple NK cell lines. Objective: Alignment of high resolution genomic profiles from multiple NK cell lines will reveal minimal regions of alteration important in the pathogenesis of NK-cell lymphoma. Experimental Approach: To determine segmental DNA copy number changes across an entire genome, whole genome tiling <b>path</b> <b>array</b> is employed to evaluate segmental DNA gains and losses which may contain oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Currently, the whole genome has been arrayed as 26, 819 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) derived amplified fragment pools spotted in duplicate (53, 638 elements) resulting in tiling resolution with complete coverage of the sequenced human genome. Results: Whole genome array CGH was used to generate high resolution segmental copy number profiles of seven NK cell lymphoma cell lines (HANK 1, KHYG- 1, NK- 92, NK-YS, SNK 1, SNK 6, and KAI 3). Alignment of these profiles with the human genome map has resulted in fine-mapping the regional losses of 6 q. Numerous novel regions, including gain of 5 p 15. 33, and loss of 4 q 21. 23 -q 32. 1, 9 p 21. 1 -p 22. 3, and 12 q 24. 32 -q 24. 33 were also identified in at least five (> 70 %) of these cell lines. Conclusions: The generation of the high resolution segmental copy number profiles by array CGH allows the identification of genomic alterations of NK-cell lymphomas as well as the candidate genes involved in the pathogenesis of NK-cell lymphoma. Novel candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes identified in this study will provide further insights into the genetic basis of lymphomagenesis.

40|$|Debris flows {{occur in}} mountainous regions during {{rainfall}} and {{can result in}} disastrous consequences to downstream facilities if appropriate mitigation measures are not taken. Common mitigation measures include flow impeding structures within the flow <b>path.</b> An <b>array</b> of baffles {{is a type of}} flow impeding structure used primarily to reduce the mobility of landslide debris. However, they are usually designed on an empirical and prescriptive basis and the degree of impedance resulting from an array of debris flow baffles is not well understood. This paper presents a series of systematic flume tests examining the influence of baffle row number on reduction of debris frontal velocity. Photoconductive sensors installed {{at the base of the}} flume channel have been used to measure the average frontal velocity of the debris flow downstream of the array of baffles. Results show that one row is ineffective in reducing the debris frontal velocity. Two to three rows of baffles exhibit notable frontal velocity reduction...|$|R
40|$|Wavelike {{disturbances}} {{were observed}} in the ionosphere following several nuclear explosions in early 1960 's. Supersonic shock waves within the atmosphere generated by large rockets can cause ionospheric electron density perturbations. A CW phase <b>path</b> Doppler <b>array</b> in the New York area was operated during the Saturn-Apollo 12 and 13 launches and recorded Doppler frequency fluctuations due to rocket launchings. Cross correlation and power spectral analyses of the phase path-path Doppler frequency variation records showed that the phase velocities of the signal arrivals were from south of the array with 700 - 800 m/sec corresponding to periods {{in the range of}} 2 to 4 minutes. Ionograms taken every 60 seconds from Wallops Islands showed clearly ionospheric disturbances due to rockets. The group velocities were estimated to be of the order of 450 m/sec 1 obtained from the earliest visible disturbances seen on CW phase path Doppler records and ionograms together with the rocket trajectory data...|$|R

One says that an n × n polygonal path Tuscan-(n − 1) square exists if {{and only if}} an ∞ × n singly periodic Costas array exists. The other gives a construction for K orthogonal (n + 1) × (n + 1) Latin squares, if an n × (n + 1) circular Tuscan-K array exists. We review Tuscan- 2 squares found by computer, and discuss nine questions...|$|R
