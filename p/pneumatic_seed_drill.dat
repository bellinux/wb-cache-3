40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{measurement}} of transverse inequality of seed rate of the pneumatic seed drills. The first section describes the types of sowing, divisions of seeders and a description of the most common sowing units. The practical part is devoted to measurement of transverse inequality of seed rate of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill.</b> The changes in accuracy of seed rate of the older seed drill were being monitored. Additional measurements were carried out with the seal insert mounted in a distribution head. This measurement simulated sowing in rows with row spacing 50 cm. The current trends in creation of crops are presented. The discussion contains important information acquired during the measurement. The conclusion summarizes the findings of the thesis...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to detect the {{possible}} loss of a. i. imidacloprid through the fan drain of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> during corn sowing operations. The experiment regarded Gaucho ® dressed corn seeds. In order to detect air contamination, paper filters were positioned at the air output of the fan; in addition grass and flower samples from green areas near fields were collected immedi-ately after the corn had been sown. Residues of imidacloprid were found both in the paper filters and in the grass and flowers samples. Quantity of imidacloprid in the paper filters increased with increasing exposure times. The results confirm that the air is contaminated by a. i. imidacloprid during normal sowing operations using Gaucho ® dressed corn seeds.

40|$|In 2000, beekeepers {{from the}} Italian region of Friuli {{reported}} losses {{of a high}} number of bee hives during the spring season. At the time of this bee incident farmers in Friuli had started to drill their corn fields and some of the seeds had been treated with the seed dressing product Gaucho (active ingredient: imidacloprid). Reports by some French beekeepers on suspected impacts of seed dressed sunflowers on honeybees made some Italian beekeepers to believe {{that there might be a}} link between their bee losses and the use of Gaucho seed dressing on corn <b>seed.</b> During <b>drilling,</b> dust particles are emitted by the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> ma-chines which may also contain abraded seed dressing particles. In response to this concern, further investigations were conducted to examine whether corn crops, seed-treated with Gaucho will pose a risk to honey bees. In October 2001 and June 2002, two field trials were conducted in Germany with Italian and German commercial maize seeds to investigate the possible abrasion of Gaucho from seed-treated maize during sowing with a pneumatic drilling machine. The results show an average emission rate of only 4 % on the <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> rate with a standard dressing formulation. Formulations with adjuvants diminished abrasions even more. In parallel, a replicated cage test with honey bees was conducted to examine whether the recorded abrasion rates could ad-versely affect honeybee colonies foraging on flowering plants with simulated deposits of emitted dust particles. From the findings of this replicated cage study it can be concluded that deposition rates which were much higher than those potentially emitted fro...|$|R
40|$|As {{blooming}} neighbouring crops mustard (2009) {{and winter}} oilseed rape (2010) were used, contaminated by seed treatment dust at the sowing of winter oilseed rape seed (Elado® treated seeds from 2008, medium dust abrasion values, 2009) and maize seeds respectively (Poncho Pro ® treated seeds from 2008, high dust abrasion values, 2010). For sowing of maize a pneumatic vacuum operated precision air planter {{with at least}} 90 % drift reduction by re-equipping technology and for rape a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was used. Additional to the cages, petri dishes were set up at different levels and in specific distances from the field edge of the drill area (1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 m) at free cut areas of the neighbouring culture before application. Previously the dishes were prepared for an oral feeding test (once with sugar water smeared fresh mustard leaf and another time with honey layer). Behaviour and mortality of the bees were observed and documented in laboratory for 48 hours. |$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of sowing is the {{distribution}} of seeds at an optimal depth with adequate seed spacings. The results of the optimal sowing, in both horizontal and vertical directions, are better germination and sprouting, as well as increased yield and reduced influence of plants on each other’s space for growing, regarding the available light, nutrients and moisture. Quality of horizontal and vertical seed distribution {{is influenced by the}} distance between rows, sowing depth, pre-sowing preparation, seed drill, seeding mechanism, sowing density, and operator’s skills. The arithmetic mean of spacing (Am), standard deviation for spacings between the plants (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) are usually used for representation of sowing evenness. Assuming that the seeds are of good germination quality, the yield is directly dependent on the sowing quality and organization of plants per unit of surface area. A well prepared plot was sown with 20 corn seed hybrids from different FAO maturity groups. The sowing was performed with precision <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> INO Becker Aeromat 2, which ejects individual seeds by using the overpressure. After sprouting, no statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the sowing of hybrids from different FAO maturity groups and their characteristics. When the yield is concerned, biological characteristics of hybrids are much more influential than the quality of sowing. This is true only if the tractor implement for wide row planting is properly adjusted...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{widespread}} use of corn seed hybrids dressed with the systemic insecticide Gaucho ® (a. i. imidacloprid), has been frequently linked, by beekeepers with bee colony losses registered during the corn sowing season. On the basis of a preliminary experiment, where the loss of imidacloprid from the pneumatic seed drills was highlighted, the aim {{of the study was to}} verify both the amount of contamination and the persistence of the active ingredient on leaves and flowers of spontaneous plants growing near corn fields in which Gaucho ® dressed seeds had been used. The observations were carried out in north eastern Italy on five different commercial corn hybrid seeds, three dressed with Gaucho ® [hybrids 2 (H 2), 4 (H 4) and 5 (H 5) ], one with a new adjuvant (H 5). The escape of the active ingredient from the fan drain of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was monitored using paper filters, whereas samples of grass and flowers were collected from the borders of sown fields. Meteorological data were registered. The samples (paper filters, grass and flowers) were analyzed using a gas chromatography method. Paper filters on the output of the drill fan have shown, at different concentrations, an escape of imidacloprid from the fan for each kind of Gaucho ® dressed seed; the order of magnitude of the escape ranged on average for H 2, H 4 and H 5 from 120 to 240 µg of imidacloprid for 1 g of paper filter at 240 seconds. Therefore the new adjuvant did not eliminate the loss of active ingredient. Even if at different concentrations for each kind of Gaucho ® dressed hybrid, imidacloprid was found the same day of sowing o...|$|E
30|$|Neonicotinoids This {{group of}} highly {{effective}} insecticides {{have been widely}} used in the past 20  years for seed treatment (seed coatings). These “systemic” active substances are taken up by the seedling, offering protection against sucking insects and some chewing insects. In 2008, the spread of abrasion dust from coated <b>seeds</b> spread by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drilling</b> equipment led to a massive poisoning of bee colonies in south-western Germany [16]. The importance of the airborne distribution of abrasion dust had been underestimated in the EU approval for the active substances and in PPP testing. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reassessed the risk of the main neonicotinoids for honey bees and wild pollinators (e.g., bumble bees) {{in the light of the}} new scientific findings and found serious gaps in the data—in particular concerning long-term toxicity. For many applications, EFSA concluded that an unacceptable risk was indicated or could not be excluded. As a consequence, the EU Commission banned these critical applications in 2013 and called on the producers to provide the missing data [17]. It remains to be seen what decisions will be reached by the EFSA, the EU Commission and the national authorities on the basis of the data that is provided and in consideration of the massive criticism of this group of substances by scientists [18] and environmental and nature conservation associations (e.g., [19]).|$|R

5000|$|A <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> is {{a device}} that sows the seeds for crops by {{metering}} out the individual seeds, positioning them in the soil, and covering them to a certain average depth.

40|$|Abstract: At {{the present}} time, {{the most widely}} used machine for seed and oilseed {{planting}} is a <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with a roller-type-metering device. Due to nonuniform spacing of seeds along the rows and lack of control on planting depth, this machine aggravates the growth related problems and degrades the quality of a sensitive crop such as oilseed rape. To solve the above-mentioned problems, an attempt was made to develop a precision <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with a roller-type-metering device and a depth control system. Some of the design parameters affecting the uniformity of seed distribution were studied from the view point of roller and brush geometry. Computer software packages were used to design the machine and simulate its operational performance. In the laboratory test, {{it was found that the}} precision <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> performed satisfactorily and its speed and vibration did not affect the performance of metering system significantly. In the field test, a uniform distribution of seed with a reasonable spacing along the row planting was achieved and seed scattering was found to be within an acceptable range.
