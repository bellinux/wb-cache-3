It is recognized that the discontent with the length of <b>panty</b> <b>hoses</b> is still remaind under the new size products. Therefore, the development of various sizes toward the length of <b>panty</b> <b>hoses</b> is desired. 3. The good fitness is precious factor for the consumer next to the price and color. 4. It is important that the information and knowledge of the size of <b>panty</b> <b>hoses</b> must be diffused for the consumer...|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, Karl Hurm {{increasingly}} integrated {{objects of}} everyday life into his paintings, in order to add a third dimension. Fragments of <b>panty</b> <b>hoses,</b> shoelaces, brush bristles, chain links, wire mesh, string bags, twigs and beechnuts were pasted into compositions in the collage technique. Chewing gum, pressed flat into moulds as bas-reliefs, slightly raise figures above the surface to produce sculptural effects. During that same period, Karl Hurm also experimented with different surfaces like old furnace doors, iron plates, metal sheets, or pieces of wood as base materials {{in order to create}} paintings that seem to have originated in distant prehistoric times. The specific fabrics and structures were interpreted and accentuated by the colours.|$|R

50|$|Conditioning plays a {{huge part}} {{in the concept of}} persuasion. It is more often about leading someone into taking certain actions of their own, rather than giving direct commands. In {{advertisements}} for example, this is done by attempting to connect a positive emotion to a brand/product logo. This is often done by creating commercials that make people laugh, using a sexual undertone, inserting uplifting images and/or music etc. and then ending the commercial with a brand/product logo. Great examples of this are professional athletes. They are paid to connect themselves to things that can be directly related to their roles; sport shoes, tennis rackets, golf balls, or completely irrelevant things like soft drinks, popcorn poppers and <b>panty</b> <b>hose.</b> The important thing for the advertiser is to establish a connection to the consumer.|$|E
50|$|Women {{have worn}} {{foundation}} garments, such as corsets and brassieres, {{for a very}} long time. Some have been essential to the fashion trends of the time.

Specialist retailers include Frederick’s of Hollywood and Victoria’s Secret. Specialist online retailers include Classic Shapewear,Bradelis New York, Bare Necessities and Her Room. The industry continues to grow each year. For example, the UK-based retail chain Debenhams recorded a 75% increase in shapewear sales between 2009 and 2013. Factors contributing to such increases include: fashions that emphasize body shape; technological advances in garment design and light-weight fabrics; re-branding of pantie girdles as panties; media items about celebrities wearing shapewear; and recommendations in fashion makeover television programmes and the media. Prominent brand names include Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, Spanx, Maidenform and Just My Size.|$|E

50|$|In {{the process}} of maceration, the carcass is first skinned and defleshed by hand as much as is practical, and all {{internal}} organs are removed. In this process, extra care is taken when removing the eyeballs, ears and jugular muscles, because some bones are shallow and brittle, such as the thickened external acoustic opening of many mammals. The tongue is usually left in place, because of its attachment to hyoid bones. Severed parts of the carcass are sometimes kept in nylon <b>panty</b> <b>hose.</b> Water is then put in a container and maintained a constant temperature, usually 35 °C though not warmer than 50 °C. Washing powder with enzymes (like Biotex) may be added, as it will soften the tissue. A mild detergent or emulsifier is sometimes used to remove fatty acids from the bone. When the carcass is put in the container, putrefying bacteria begin (or continue) to consume the soft tissue cells of the carcass, {{and will continue to}} do so as long as the temperature remains constant. After a few days, the water is replenished to maintain the bacteria, and some additional flesh may be cut away. Most medium-sized animals (like dogs) are macerated within about ten days.|$|E
