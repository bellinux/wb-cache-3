500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|At their reunion shows, the New York Dolls {{performed}} [...] "You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory", with member Sylvain Sylvain {{singing the}} lead vocal and sometimes changing the title lyric to [...] "I can't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> you, Johnny." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Went to luncheon in {{the ballroom}} in the White House. James Roosevelt took us in to see his father, President Roosevelt. He said, 'It's about time you came. How can I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> all of you? Which is the oldest? You are all so big.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not {{distress}} yourself," [...] I said, although I was a {{good deal}} disturbed myself. [...] "We shall get home very well. You shall put your hand on my shoulder, while I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> you. Then you can screw up my machine a good deal higher, and it will support us both. In this way I am sure that we shall get on very well." ...|$|R
5000|$|Garneau said: [...] "I {{asked for}} a picture and she said 'no problem', so I just <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her shoulder. In sport, we do that all the time. The Queen said, 'I {{remember}} you - you were a cyclist - I hope business is good now'." [...] Garneau was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1999 and a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 1997.|$|R
2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She said with a choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E

60|$|They all paused. I {{had thrown}} myself beside {{her in an}} agony of {{helpless}} grief, and <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> held her tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely. So gravely that I could not help {{feeling that he was}} in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself.|$|R
60|$|She {{rested her}} hand appealingly on mine, and sent my pulse fluttering. My heart was surely {{in my eyes}} for a moment. The dear and lovely woman! And she was so much the woman, {{clinging}} and appealing, sunshine and dew to my manhood, rooting it deeper and sending through it the sap of a new strength. I was for <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her, as when {{in the midst of}} the seal herd; but I considered, and refrained.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{little man}} can play," [...] he declared. [...] "He has {{it in his}} fingers. We shall hear now the waltzes that I love. Ah, Miss Julia, why is this not Paris! Why can I not get up and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> your waist and whisper in your ear as we float round and round in a waltz? Stupid questions! I am too short to dance with you, for one thing, and much too fat, But one loves to imagine. Listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|I leant {{across and}} <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him; I {{suppose it was}} un-English; {{there are times when}} one forgets these points. [...] "I did not know! I did not know," [...] I cried.|$|E

"Well," [...] said Gabriel, {{looking up}} at the roof, [...] "wimmen is bashful ez a general thing, and thar's about only one way ez a man can get at 'em, and that ez, by being kinder keerless and bold.

60|$|I {{never said}} a word to her at first. I just strode across the cave and grasped her by the wrists, and when she struggled, I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her so as to pinion her hands to her sides. She fought like a tigress, but I took my free hand and pushed her head back--I imagine that I had {{suddenly}} turned brute, that I had gone back a thousand million years, and was again a veritable cave man taking my mate by force--and then I kissed that beautiful mouth again and again.|$|R

She looked much smaller than the last time I saw her or at least as I remembered her. We kissed, I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her, and her hand {{squeezed}} my hip reassuringly.

60|$|This {{use of our}} given names {{had come}} about quite {{as a matter of}} course, and was as unpremeditated as it was natural. In that moment I could have <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her and drawn her to me. I should {{certainly}} have done so out in that world to which we belonged. As it was, the situation stopped there in the only way it could; but I was left alone in my little hut, glowing warmly through and through with a pleasant satisfaction; and I knew that a tie, or a tacit something, existed between us which had not existed before.|$|E

[...] And then he added, [...] "Yes, I do have one regret, and a monstrous big one, too. I'd sure like to have the winning of you all over again. I'd like to go sneaking around the Piedmont hills looking for you. I'd like to meander into those rooms of yours at Berkeley for the first time. And there's no use talking, I'm plumb soaking with regret that I can't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> you again that time you leaned your head on my breast and cried in the wind and rain." ...|$|E

60|$|Lys shuddered, and I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her {{and drew}} her to me; and thus we sat {{throughout}} the hot night. She {{told me of}} her abduction and of the fright she had undergone, and together we thanked God that she had come through unharmed, because the great brute had dared not pause along the danger-infested way. She {{said that they had}} but just reached the cliffs when I arrived, for on several occasions her captor had been forced to take to the trees with her to escape the clutches of some hungry cave-lion or saber-toothed tiger, and that twice they had been obliged to remain for considerable periods before the beasts had retired.|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} petted nor fondled him, but now I sat upon {{the ground and}} <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his heavy neck I stroked and coaxed him, talking in my newly {{acquired}} Martian tongue as I would have to my hound at home, as I would have talked to any other friend among the lower animals. His response to my manifestation of affection was remarkable to a degree; he stretched his great mouth to its full width, baring the entire expanse of his upper rows of tusks and wrinkling his snout until his great eyes were almost hidden by the folds of flesh. If you have ever seen a collie smile you may have some idea of Woola's facial distortion.|$|R

The Swift One and I turned and went away quietly through the trees toward the cave, while the Folk gathered overhead and showered down abuse and twigs and branches upon their ancient enemy.

yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes

5000|$|Despite his stellar three-year {{record of}} SEC championships and top-three NCAA {{national}} performances, the University of Florida Athletic Association released him in October 1993 following {{an episode of}} the ESPN television show Outside the Lines which recounted Ivey's history of romantic involvement with several of his previous swimmers {{before he became a}} coach at the University of Florida, and made allegations of sexual harassment against him. [...] Ivey had been previously married three times, including his second wife who was an 18-year-old swimmer at the time he married her. [...] Ivey denied the charges of misconduct, saying [...] "I was told that <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> a girl and using foul language was deemed reason enough" [...] for the University of Florida to fire him. [...] ESPN did not interview Ivey, nor did he answer on air any of the allegations by ESPN. [...] His Florida women's swimmers issued a unanimous statement supporting him, and stated publicly they did not complain about nor witness any inappropriate behavior.|$|R

She was such a childlike, {{sensible}} young person that I {{did not think it}} necessary to ask any permission for this action, nor even to allude to its necessity.|$|R

5000|$|The woman's {{daughter}} had been flicking and pinching my daughter from behind. It was harmless child's play, but it made my daughter uncomfortable and confused. So I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her as protection. The little girl kept clipping <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> I turned and told her softly, [...] "That was my arm." [...] The girl's mother asked what was going on, and I told her what had happened. She denied her {{daughter had}} even touched me. What happened next took me by surprise. She began hurling abuse and accused me of reaching behind our seats and touching her daughter. Of course, I had not done anything of the sort. This accusation hit me pretty hard. At this point, I considered moving to another spot on the bus. However, the woman then launched into a racist rant that continued for the longest 15 minutes of my life. I thought to myself, [...] "What would Rosa Parksdo?" [...] She would stay put. So I did, especially since it is 2013. Jeremy Fernandez ...|$|R
50|$|Kitchener was {{determined}} to have a railroad rather the boats on the Nile supply his army as he advanced into the Sudan, and assigned its construction to a Canadian railroad builder, Sir Percy Girouard. As Girouard built the railroad from Cairo to supply Kitchener's army as it advanced on Khartoum, Townshend often had time for leave. On 8 May 1898 {{during a visit to}} Paris, Townshend wrote about his latest encounter with Cahen D'Anvers: At last we were together. I had long loved Alice Cahen D’Anvers and she loves me. Before luncheon, while we stood looking at the log fire in the library, I told her that whether I left the Sudan directly after Khartoum depended on her. If she would marry me I would leave it directly after we had taken Khartoum. Then she said: “If it depends on me you will not stay in the Sudan very long.” I drew her to me and kissed her, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her dear neck. It was worth waiting for, and all I had suffered last year, to be rewarded like this.|$|R
5000|$|Freundlich {{has been}} in a {{relationship}} with actress Julianne Moore since 1996, when they met on the set of The Myth of Fingerprints. When casting Moore's character, Mia, Freundlich explains that he “was looking for someone who had a lot of complication, a lot of sadness under the surface, and betrayed very, very little of it in her face.” During filming, Freundlich recalls seeing Moore standing outside, exposed to the elements without a coat: [...] "I came up to her and stood with my back to the wind. I didn’t want her to be cold, and I also didn’t want to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her, or smother her, because I didn’t know her that well...Even though I couldn’t have articulated it then, I understood that I could keep her warm up to a point. But then the rest was going to be for her to do. We connected in that moment on an unspoken level, where she knew I saw that flame in her, and understood it, and was willing not to suffocate it but to protect it.” [...] They married on August 23, 2003. The couple have a son, Caleb (born December 4, 1997) and a daughter, Liv Helen (born April 11, 2002). Moore has appeared in all of Freundlich's feature films with the exception of Catch That Kid (2004), The Rebound (2009), and Wolves (2017).|$|R
