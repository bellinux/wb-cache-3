50|$|The {{arboretum}} at Ooty {{was established}} in 1992 with an aim of conserving native and indigenous trees; it occupies 1.58 ha near Ooty lake. It was established during the year 1992 and maintained by Department of Horticulture with Hill Area Development Programme funds. The micro watershed area leading to Ooty lake where the arboretum is now located, had been neglected and the feeder line feeding water to Ooty was contaminated with urban waste and agricultural chemicals. The area is the natural habitats of both indigenous and migratory birds.

5000|$|Modern {{livestock}} hurdles, {{known as}} panels or [...] "pipe panels" [...] in the USA, {{are used for}} sorting, handling or loading animals where <b>permanent</b> <b>fencing</b> is impractical or uneconomic. They are made of steel or aluminium, and vary in size. For sheep, they are usually 6 ft long and 3 ft high, while for cattle they are commonly 9 ft or more long and 5 ft high. They are usually joined by pins or hooks, both {{to each other and}} to handling facilities such as a cattle crush. While individual hurdles are easily knocked over by animals, when joined in a ring or to solid objects they make a secure fence. Single hurdles are often used as a temporary gate or to block a gap in a hedge. Hurdles are often supplied in a set together with a mobile cattle crush and a trailer for easy transport.|$|E
50|$|Fences tend to {{fall into}} three basic categories, {{temporary}} (less than two years lifespan), semi-permanent (two to five years lifespan) and permanent (greater than two years lifespan). The materials used to construct them tend to vary with {{the length of time}} the fence is to remain operable. A temporary fence is normally constructed from UV-stabilised polythene sheet or woven geotextile. Semi-permanent fences are usually constructed from 1mm thick plastic panels. Permanent fences are usually constructed from rigid plastic or galvanised steel panels. In the case of temporary fencing materials, the underground return is created by folding the material at a &deg; angle along the base of the trench, and the top overhang by rolling the top edge of the membrane over a number of times to create a roll. For <b>permanent</b> <b>fencing,</b> the underground return is sometimes omitted and instead the fence is buried deeper (usually 300 mm). The top overhang is created by making a fold in the material at the manufacturing stage.|$|E

Six manufacturers are selling electric fence equipment, and all have well-illustrated leaflets or booklets giving details of erection. In addition, many farmers, encouraged by Massey College, have kept costs very low by using standard bobbin insulators (Type 436) or short pieces of polythene water-pipe as insulators.

40|$|Fencing {{costs are}} one of the most {{expensive}} aspects of livestock grazing. The type of fence constructed greatly impacts the cost per foot, total cost, and annual ownership cost. In addition, the shape of the paddocks affects the amount of materials needed and labor required for construction of the fence. This publication compares the costs of building a quarter-mile (1, 320 feet) straight perimeter fence with four different types of <b>permanent</b> <b>fencing</b> plus temporary interior fencing. These are: woven wire, barbed wire, high-tensile non-electric, high-tensile electrifi ed and temporary interior fencing. The type of fencing selected varies by personal choice and the species of livestock to be confi ned. In general all confi gurations shown can be used with cattle, woven wire and high-tensile electrifi ed can be used with sheep, and woven wire can be used with hogs. The list of materials needed for each type of fenc-ing is from Costs of Cattle Fencing for Grazing Areas (see references at the end of the article). Costs were adjusted to 2011 prices provided by a number of Iowa retailers, although prices may vary. Labor was valued at $ 15. 05 per hour for wo-ven wire and $ 16. 25 per hour for barbed wire, the average fence building custom charges reported in AgDM File A 3 - 10, 2011 Iowa Farm Custom Rate Survey.

40|$|Mulkey, Inc. is {{participating}} in a stream restoration study with the Ecosystem Enhancement Program in Yadkin County, North Carolina. The {{purpose of this study}} is to restore approximately 4, 300 linear feet of Rocky Branch, a second order stream locatedin the western Piedmont of North Carolina. Stream restoration in North Carolina is generally conducted to provide compensatory mitigation for stream impacts from both highway construction and private development. Since the late 1990 s, North Carolina has served at the forefront for stream restoration activities due to the state’s tremendous population growth and stringent water quality standards. In an effort to provide mitigation for the state’s needs in an efficient manner, the Ecosystem Enhancement Program was created in 2003 under an agreement with the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. There are approximately 400 streams and wetland restoration projects that are currently under development across 54 watersheds in North Carolina. Those resources having the greatest repair needs are prioritized and the Ecosystem Enhancement Program works with public and private organizations in an effort to restore, to enhance and to preserve wetlands, streams, and buffers, statewide. The Ecosystem Enhancement Program serves as the nucleus for consolidating and streamlining mitigation activities within the state. The project presented here is one of the many projects this program administers in an effort to meet the ever growing mitigation needs in the state. The Rocky Branch site comprises approximately 24 acres of pasture and woodlands immediately adjacent to the Interstate 77 corridor in Yadkin County, North Carolina. The project site has a drainage area of approximately 3. 1 square miles and is part of the South Yadkin River Watershed. The site was once heavily forested, but over the last 100 years has been cleared primarily for pasture and row crops. Cattle have been a significant part of the land-use since the early part of the 20 th century and their impact is highly visible through compaction, erosion, and denuded vegetation along the stream. The objectives of the Rocky Branch stream restoration project were and continue to be: 1) to provide mitigation for future needs in the area, 2) to improve water quality by excluding cattle from the stream, 3) to provide a stable and functional stream channel, 4) to improve the overall quality of the stream and riparian areas and 5) to provide long-term protection of the project through a conservation easement. The restoration of Rocky Branch’s main channel and its associated tributary were completed using methods based on the work of David L. Rosgen, PhD, which emphasize the use of natural stability concepts. The stream restoration project created a new stream channel with the appropriate dimension, pattern, and profile for its specific location within the watershed. The new channel contains in-stream boulder structures which provide grade control, bank stabilization, and aquatic habitat. Boulder structures used in conjunction with this project include cross vanes, rock vanes, and j-hooks. The stream banks were stabilized using erosion control matting, native seed mixes, bare root seedlings, rootwads, and live vegetation stakes. A permanent riparian buffer was established using native vegetation specific to the region. Vernal pools were established throughout the riparian buffer to provide habitat, water storage capacity and micro-topography. To protect the project from disturbance, <b>permanent</b> <b>fencing</b> was established around the entire site. As is true for projects of this type, an as-built report documenting stream restoration and enhancement is developed to provide a baseline for future monitoring or success criteria. A monitoring program will be implemented to document system development and progress toward achieving the success criteria as stipulated in the mitigation requirements for the project permit. Monitoring will take place over a 5 -year period or until final success criteria are achieved...|$|E

40|$|Degradation in {{semi-arid}} Karoo rangelands {{has been}} ascribed to over-utilization by livestock and variations in rainfall regime. The understanding of vegetation dynamics in confined plant-herbivore systems is {{hampered by the}} difficulty in uncoupling biotic and abiotic determinants of vegetation change, and a paucity of long-term studies. Vegetation change in <b>permanent</b> <b>fenced</b> and open plots in Karoo National Park was monitored over 10 years, largely falling within a high rainfall phase. Herbivore pressure more than tripled during this period with notable increases in the larger ungulates and ostrich. No clear correlation could be established between rainfall and vegetation parameters. Rangeland condition improved and species richness increased over time. Annual grass cover decreased and perennial grass cover increased with time following a change in land use from small-stock farming to conservation and reintroduction of wild ungulates. Changes were more rapid in exclosures than in areas exposed to herbivory. Rangeland condition was closely correlated with canopy spread cover. To differentiate rainfall-induced fluctuations from directional changes in vegetation dynamics caused by herbivory, monitoring needs to be conducted for extended periods that include various rainfall cycles. The value of vegetation monitoring would be greater if additional data were collected to measure persistence of uncommon species. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|R
