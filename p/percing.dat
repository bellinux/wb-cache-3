50|$|Interned {{with his}} fellow conspirators, Barin Ghosh had {{carefully}} planned to stage a jail-break. Careful plans were made to overpower guards with acid, bombs and with arms smuggled into the jail {{with the help of}} Samiti members and of family members. By the last week of August, Barin was able to obtain two revolvers, a R.I.C. 0.45 calibre and an Osborne 0.38 calibre revolver. However, the accused soon realised that Goswami knew more than anticpitated, and his evidence may implicate many accused including the Ghosh Brothers. A decision was taken by Hem Chandra Das to silence Naren. On 29 August, Kanailal Dutt feigned abdominal colic and gained admission to the Jail hospital, from where he sent word to Naren of wishing to turn approver, along with Satyen Bose. Naren, believing the ruse, walked into the Hospital ward to meet the duo with the jail overseer. Armed with the two revolvers smuggled in at Barin's request, Sen and Dutta chased Goswami down the jail corridors. The overseer accompanying Goswami, warden Higgins, attempted to overpower Dutt but was shot through the wrist. Another overseer named Lynton tried to overpower Sen, but the latter broke free. Both Sen and Dutt shotGoswami multiple times, hitting his hip and <b>percing</b> his spine, wounding him fatally. Sen and Dutta, emptying their cylinders into Goswami's lifeless body, gave themselves up once they realised Goswami was dead. Dutta later pleaded guilty, was convicted and hanged. Sen was initially declared not guilty by jury, but the verdict was returned to the high court which returned a guilty verdict and awarded him death sentence.|$|E
40|$|The chapter analyses, in a {{comparative}} law and interdisciplinary way,the status of jewish and muslim circumcision in Belgian Law. Differing from Sweden or Germany, Belgium has no specific legal norms about religious circumcisions. Nevertheless, a proportionnaly {{high number of}} cases have adressed this ritual, as a right or as a problem. The chapter analyses this case law, and develops a more conceptual analysis through the study of some conceptual analogies used by judges (like tatoo or <b>percing)</b> and also their uncertainty towards medical appraisal of ritual medical acts. Finally, the chapter concludes that the main permanent approach is a pragmatical one : training, dialogue, compromise instead of prohibition...|$|E

Moda, bireylerde popülerliği amaçladığı gibi onlara farklı yaşam tarzlarını sunarak da onları bu kültürün bir parçası konumuna getirmektedir. Bu yolla bireyleri sürekli tüketime teşvik eden moda onlara kendi düşüncelerini yansıtan birtakım kodlarla birlikte sunulmaktadır. Birey ise kendi ruhuna ve düşüncesine uygun giysiyi tüketmekte ve kendisi hakkında sözlü ya da yazılı iletişim kurmadan modanın görselliğini kullanarak duruşunu çevresine çoğu zaman böylesi bir yolla iletmeyi tercih etmektedir. Bu durumu anlamak için de birtakım görsel kodları çözümlemek gerekmektedir. Bu çalışmada, insanların neden özellikle bazı giysileri ve renkleri tercih ettikleri, renklerin altında yatan iletilerin neler olduğu saptanarak giysilerin neden düşünseli somut kılan araçlar oldukları tespit edilmeye çalışılmıştır. Bu amaçla moda dünyasındaki giysiler iletişim bağlamında modelleri, renkleri ve aksesuarlarına göre görsel kodları açımlayabilmek adına göstergebilimsel çözümleme yöntemi kullanılarak analiz edilmiştir. Bunun için moda blogları, fotoğraf paylaşım siteleri ve televizyonlarda yayınlanan moda uzantılı popüler programlar çalışmanın ana evrenini oluşturmuştur. Bu çerçevede elde edilen bulguların değerlendirilmesi yalnızca araştırma kapsamındaki sonuçları ortaya koymak adına gereklidir. Çalışmanın sonucunda, giysilerin modanın bir parçası olarak özünde çeşitli düşüncelerle kodlandıkları, giysilerdeki ayrıntıların dahi topluma bir anlam ilettikleri tespit edilmiştir. In {{a globalized}} world, {{one of the}} effects of popular culture, which is a {{consequence}} of capitalism, is undoubtedly fashion. As well as aiming popularity among individuals, fashion make them a part of popular culture by providing different lifestyles to them. In this way, while encouraging individuals to consumption, fashion is presented to them by codes which reflect their own thoughts. Individuals consume the clothing which is suitable to their spirit and thoughts and reflect themselves by using fashion’s visuality without having a word either via verbal or written communication. To understand this situation, some visual codes are needed to be resolved. In this study, why people choose some specific clothing items and colors, what messages lie beneath those colors and why clothes make thoughts concrete are tried to be identified. With this aim, clothes in fashion world are analyzed by semiotics to decipher the visual codes according to their colors, models and accessories in a communicational context. In this study that is aimed to explain visual codes of fashion as a nonverbal mode of representation, semiotical codes which fashion involves are important in terms of depth of the study. In this study, clothes has been analyzed to be able to understand visual elements that fashion presents. In the first part constitute from the reflections of clothes to communication according to their styles, fabric, style, detail and cuttings has been centered. In here, triangle, sharp and keen forms that refer to the nature of men has been implied. In this analyze over styles that political position and patriarchal society structure linked to each other, it is discussed that curvaceous styles reflect feminine and agreeable message as well. Moreover, in this part, fashion system of Roland Barthes is determinative. Fashion system shows which clothing types reflect comfort or seriousness. For example, it can be seen here what kind of clothing styles make elites as ‘elite’. In addition to the identity of elite class, it gives a status and prestige to them as well. Secondly in the analyze, it has been seen that some of the colours have different codes according to their field of use. This analyze is important because those messages they involve in the society need to be understood. Particularly, combining colours with some other colours cause a differentiation on the messages. It is pointed out that colours lead to different meanings on different styles. In this chapter colours according to their meanings involved in nonverbal communication, it has been given place to some kind of features of colours as well. In total, under the title of eleven different colour category like purple, yellow, red, white, black blue, pink, orange, green, brown and rainbow has been analyzed in relation to each other in a holistic sense. It has been identified that messages during communication process colours convey have some differences. Lastly in the analyze, it has been identified that beside of style and colours accessories affect communication process as well. The study deals with elements of fashion in the frame of holism, according to accessories communication reflections of clothes has been evaluated too. Accessories in here, written under three different tittle like <b>percing,</b> tattoo and earring. While piercing and earring has been approached as an ornament, tattoo bear qualification of a accessory done over body. It was prominent that use of all those accessories convey different point of views during nonverbal communication process. In addition, it has been seen that messages in the accessories are perceieved in different dimensions. When approached from a historical perspective, all the accessories from the past till today were evaluated in relation to human body politics. According to this, it has been seen that accessory users affected and also have been affected by other cultures. It has been stated that every single accessory have a different quality than others. People give messages to society by the way of their bodies by using those accessories that enable them to change their bodies. In addition this situation represents a person different than other people, in some certain situations it includes the messages desired to be given. This is presented in this study by taking into consideration of signifiers (style, colour, accessory) and sifnified (messages of fashion elements include). Beside of Barthes’s denotation and connotation conceptions, it has been seen that myths has a role in here. Because, sign systems like advertisement and fashion exist in a society lead by myths. On the other hand, colour used on clothing, style and accessories involve human body into cultural process. At this point, clothes {{are one of the most}} important tools of adding people a gender over bodies. Clothes as a tool of stimulating people to consume more by way of popular culture, has a role of determination of life styles. Meanings and messages that clothes contain has been based in this study other than their main functions like keeping body from outsider effects and covering. From this, it is known that fashion has a leading role over the popularisation of clothing. Fashion uses clothes and elements of clothes like styles, colours and accessories as an expression of thoughts. Thus, abstract thoughts become concrete on clothes. This becomes common on the society because of the fashion cycle and covering the majority. Accordingly, fashion becomes one of the leading fields concerning nonverbal communication in the world of clothing. It is quite necessary to evaluate the visual elements of fashion world for the sake of understanding communicative codes. Fashion blogs, photo sharing websites and popular TV programs about fashion are the universe of this study. Evaluation of this data gained through this framework is only necessary to introduce the results of this study. At the end of this study, clothes as part of fashion, are concluded to be coded with various thoughts in themselves and even the details on the clothing forward some meaning to the society...|$|E

He was of half French Canadian and Nez <b>Percé</b> descent and was said to have received his nickname from his love of the game of poker. Poker Joe was familiar with Montana and the routes through the Rocky Mountains to reach the Great Plains and guided the Nez <b>Percé</b> in their flight. He spoke good English and served as an interpreter and adviser to Chief Joseph and other Nez <b>Percé</b> leaders. He was the chosen trail boss and guide of the Nez <b>Percé</b> people following the Battle of the Big Hole, in which the Nez <b>Percé</b> won a costly victory against pursuing U.S. forces in southwest Montana. He kept the Nez <b>Percé</b> ahead of the army for the following seven weeks. He led the Nez <b>Percé</b> on a trek to the Missouri River, covering between 500 and 700 miles.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} treaty {{between the}} U.S. {{government and the}} Nez <b>Perce,</b> signed in 1855, established a reservation that acknowledged the ancestral homelands of the Nez <b>Perce.</b> In 1860, the discovery of gold on the Nez <b>Perce</b> Indian Reservation brought an uncontrolled influx of miners and settlers into the area. Despite numerous treaty violations, the Nez <b>Perce</b> remained peaceful.|$|R

The Nez <b>Percé</b> fought a delaying {{action against the}} 7th Infantry Regiment (United States) here on August 9 and 10, 1877, during their failed attempt to escape to Canada. This action, the Battle of the Big Hole, was the largest battle fought between the Nez <b>Percé</b> and U.S. Government forces in the five-month conflict known as the Nez <b>Perce</b> War. In 1992 the park was made a part of Nez <b>Perce</b> National Historical Park, which consists of 38 separate locations in five different states, following the flight of the Nez <b>Percé</b> tribe from the U.S. Cavalry.|$|R
50|$|In August and September 1877, Doane and his Crow Indian scouts {{played a}} key role in the {{ultimate}} capture of Chief Joseph and the Nez <b>Perce</b> during the Nez <b>Perce</b> War. Shortly after Chief Joseph's escape from the Battle of the Big Hole, the Nez <b>Perce</b> moved into Yellowstone. Doane and his scouts blocked their retreat down the Yellowstone River and forced Chief Joseph and the Nez <b>Perce</b> to escape East via the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River. This ultimately put the Nez <b>Perce</b> within striking distance of Colonel Miles forces. Chief Joseph and the Nez <b>Perce</b> surrendered to Miles near the Canada-US border in October 1877.|$|R
50|$|Several {{bands of}} Nez <b>Perce</b> {{actively}} resisted attempts to restrict them to reservation. This refusal, repeated after an ultimatum delivered by General Howard in May 1877, escalated into the Nez <b>Perce</b> War, and the now-celebrated attempt by Chief Joseph {{to lead a}} large band of non-reservation Nez <b>Perce</b> to Canada. After suffering defeat at the Battle of Big Hole on August 9-10, the Nez <b>Perce</b> traveled south, hoping to flank Howard's force and reach Canada via a route further east. Howard attempted to cut off this flanking maneuver by beating the Nez <b>Perce</b> to Camas Meadow, but reached that area August 19, {{one day after the}} Nez <b>Perce</b> had departed.|$|R

He, along with Chief Joseph, directed the 1877 retreat from eastern Oregon into Montana and onward toward the Canada-US border during the Nez <b>Perce</b> War. He led the Alpowai band of the Nez <b>Perce,</b> which included the communities of Asotin, Alpowa, and Sapachesap along the Clearwater River in Idaho.

Several nontreaty bands gathered at Tolo Lake in early June 1877 in anticipation of moving to the Nez <b>Perce</b> reservation. In response to the forced move and other hostile actions, several young Nez <b>Perce</b> people took actions that precipitated the Nez <b>Perce</b> War.|$|R
50|$|The Nez <b>Perce</b> in Yellowstone Park was {{the flight}} of the Nez <b>Perce</b> Indians through Yellowstone National Park between August 20 and Sept 7, during the Nez <b>Perce</b> War in 1877.

McWhorter wanted to present the Nez <b>Perce</b> perspective to help preserve their cultural identity. The Nez <b>Perce</b> had gone through much change since the signing of the Walla Walla treaties on June 11, 1855: [...] "It had taken the commissioners less than a month to acquire over thirty million acres of land in three future states…and added a fresh layer to the shifting sands of Indian identity along the Columbia River".
