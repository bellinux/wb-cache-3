In many industries, the <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> higher-quality products offer a smaller assortment of flavors, colors, sizes, patterns, textures, fragrances, tones, styles, models, designs, types or other options. This paper explores when and why <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> super-premium products should find it profitable to offer a smaller assortment than the <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> nonpremium products. We derive a Nash equilibrium both on prices and product assortments for a triopoly. At the Nash equilibrium, we show that additional product quality, increased consumer price-sensitivity and greater assortment costs discourages product assortment. We also show that a larger market potential, greater competitive costs and sharper competition encourage more assortment by the super-premium producer. marketing, competition...|$|R
