2500|$|The PRR also {{desired to}} apply the duplex {{principle}} to freight haulage, and the Q1 was the first experiment in that direction. It was a 4-6-4-4 fast freight locomotive delivered in May 1942. Like the B's George H. Emerson it had the second pair of cylinders facing backwards, and all were fitted with standard Walschaerts valve gear. The wheels were of [...] diameter (ill suited for freight hauling) and the engine was streamlined more like a <b>passenger</b> <b>engine.</b> The streamlining was later removed as it restricted maintenance work. The rear facing cylinders were also problematic, partially due to the inconvenient placement of being directly below the engine's firebox. Furthermore, the large drivers and smaller than adequate firebox grate area {{may have contributed to}} further problems as well. The limited firebox size was also a direct cause of the backwards facing cylinders. The lone Q1, PRR 6130, was constructed at the PRR's Altoona Works in 1942.|$|E

6000|$|Like a {{reckless}} warrior, who by a bold and sudden push sometimes gains single-handed {{the centre of}} an enemy's position before he is discovered and assailed on every side, straight forward Mrs Durby ran into the very midst of a brisk traffic, before any one discovered her. Suddenly a passenger-train {{came up with the}} usual caution in such circumstances, nevertheless at a smart rattling pace, for [...] "usual caution" [...] {{does not take into account}} or provide for the apparition of stout elderly females on the line. The driver of the <b>passenger</b> <b>engine</b> saw her, shut off steam, shouted, applied the brakes and whistled furiously.|$|E
60|$|We {{have already}} hinted {{that the weather}} was not fine. Mrs Durby's {{umbrella}} being up, hid the approaching train. As for screaming steam-whistles, the worthy woman had come to regard intermittent whistling as a normal condition of railways, which, like the crying of cross babies, meant little or nothing, and had only to be endured. She {{paid no attention to}} the alarm. In despair the driver reversed his engine; fire flew from the wheels, and the engine was brought to a stand, but not until the buffers were within three feet of the nurse's shoulder. At that moment she became aware of her danger, uttered a shriek, as we have said, that would have done credit to the whistle of a small engine, and, bending her head with her umbrella before her, rushed frantically away on another line of rails. She did not observe, poor soul, that a goods train was coming straight down that line towards her,--partly because her mental vision was turned in terror to the rear, and partly because the umbrella obscured all in advance. In vain the driver of the goods engine repeated the warnings and actions of the <b>passenger</b> <b>engine.</b> His had more speed on and was heavier; besides, Mrs Durby charged it at the rate of full five miles an hour, with the umbrella steadily in front, and a brown paper parcel swinging wildly on her arm, as if her sole desire on earth was to meet that goods engine in single combat and beat out its brains at the first blow. Certain it is that Mrs Durby's career would have been cut short then and there, if tall Joe Turner, the guard, had not been standing at the tail of his own train and observed her danger. In the twinkling of an eye he dropped his slow dignified air, leaped like a panther in front of the goods engine, caught Mrs Durby with both hands--any how--and hurled her and himself off the line,--not a moment too soon, for the buffer of the engine touched his shoulder as they fell together to the ground.|$|E

50|$|The small 2-2-2 <b>passenger</b> <b>engine</b> {{was quite}} {{successful}} over easier runs and five more were ordered in May 1860. During 1871 it was converted to 2-4-0 configuration to handle heavier loads and steeper gradients on the newer lines.|$|E
50|$|The Hitachi {{traction}} motors {{are the ones}} used on freight engines. It was a challenge to put these in a <b>passenger</b> <b>engine</b> due to weight constraints. So the transformer is aluminum foil-wound and aluminum chequered plates are used for reducing the weight.|$|E
50|$|The Su was the {{standard}} <b>passenger</b> <b>engine</b> on most mainline routes {{and it was}} only on the key trunk lines that the IS class 2-8-4, or later the P36 4-8-4, would be used. Therefore, the majority of passenger miles were hauled by an Su (ะกั).|$|E
50|$|Fifteen 0-4-4T {{suburban}} <b>passenger</b> <b>engines,</b> the R1 class (based on Kirtley's R {{class of}} 1891) were built by Sharp, Stewart & Co in November and December 1900.|$|R
50|$|Five 4-4-0 express <b>passenger</b> <b>engines</b> of Stirling's B class, {{which had}} been {{introduced}} on the SER in 1898, were built at Ashford in June and July 1899.|$|R
50|$|The H {{class of}} 0-4-4T {{suburban}} <b>passenger</b> <b>engines</b> comprised 64 locomotives built at Ashford between 1904 and 1909, {{with a final}} two completed in 1915 after Wainwright's retirement.|$|R

50|$|Penn Central started {{rebuilding}} RS-3s in 1972, using {{parts from}} retired EMD <b>passenger</b> <b>engines.</b> The RS3m rebuild program started in 1972 and continued until 1978 under Conrail. The bankrupt Penn Central needed more reliable local and secondary service locomotives {{and had a}} surplus of passenger locomotives. The result is a locomotive that has the frame, body and trucks from an ALCO RS3, but using fan assemblies and EMD 567 prime movers from retired <b>passenger</b> <b>engines,</b> such as the EMD E8, {{in place of the}} original ALCO 244 prime movers.|$|R
50|$|The D {{class of}} 4-4-0 express <b>passenger</b> <b>engines</b> {{comprised}} 51 locomotives built between 1901 and 1907, of which 30 were built by four different contractors, and 21 were {{built by the}} SECR at Ashford.|$|R
5000|$|The early <b>passenger</b> <b>engines</b> used on {{the line}} were 2-4-0s. At {{the end of the}} 19th century and, after the line had been upgraded, the Caledonian Railway {{introduced}} the very successful 4-4-0 Dunalastair class of locomotives.|$|R

5000|$|The railway also {{no longer}} allowed horse-drawn {{passenger}} carriages {{to use the}} line. The existing freight engines were extremely slow. Hackworth was asked to develop something lighter and faster, and built the [...] "Globe" [...] in 1830, the first specialist <b>passenger</b> <b>engine.</b> It was also {{said to be the}} first to use cranked axles, successfully at least.|$|E
50|$|Before the T1, {{the last}} {{production}} express <b>passenger</b> <b>engine</b> the PRR had produced was the K4s of 1914, produced until 1928. Two experimental enlarged K5 locomotives were produced in 1929, {{but they were}} not considered enough of an improvement to be worthwhile. After that the PRR's attention switched to electrification and the production of electric locomotives; apparently the railroad had no need for more steam locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Until the {{appointment}} of Dugald Drummond, unlike most other British railways, almost all engines had outside cylinders, and the 0-6-0 arrangement was quite rare, goods engines being of type 2-4-0 or 0-4-2. <b>Passenger</b> <b>engines</b> were normally 2-2-2.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most {{railroad}} locomotives, the F (and E) series {{used the}} body as a structural element, similar to a truss bridge. EMD has not repeated this construction, as their modern <b>passenger</b> <b>engines</b> have a non-structural โcowlโ type body.|$|R
50|$|During {{the steam}} era, the depot had a continual {{allotment}} of eight freight and two <b>passenger</b> <b>engines.</b> During {{the peak of}} the steam era, an average of 30 trains during any 24-hour period required banking from Valley Heights to Katoomba.|$|R
5000|$|Pennsylvania Railroad E8A #5764 {{was built}} in 1952 by Electro-Motive Division. This unit was the last <b>passenger</b> <b>engine</b> built for the Pennsy. Other numbers for this engine were PC 4264, MBTA 4264 and BDT 5764. It was last used by the Tennessee Central Railroad from whom its private owner {{purchased}} it.

The Class 25 roof cabling was later applied to all Class 22 and 23 locos as they passed through the works. They were painted dark blue with a yellow band low on the body. Unlike the other 1950's locomotives, Class 25.5's nose and side numbers plus their SNCB logos were in chrome rather than being painted on.|$|E
5|$|Under LSWR and Southern Railway {{ownership}} {{they had}} been successful suburban <b>passenger</b> <b>engines,</b> although with the increased availability of newer, standard designs, many of the class were diagrammed {{to take on a}} new role as reliable branch line engines, especially in Southern England.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Railway made three-chime train whistles. These {{were all}} distinctive, having {{top-mounted}} levers.
