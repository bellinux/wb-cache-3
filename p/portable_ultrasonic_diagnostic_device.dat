40|$|In scalp skin examinations, it is {{difficult}} to find a previously treated region on a patient’s scalp through images captured by a camera attached to a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>device</b> because the zoom lens on camera has a small field of view. Thus, doctors manually record the region on a chart or manually mark the region. However, this process is slow and inconveniences the patient. Thus, we propose a new system for tracking the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>device</b> for the scalp skin of patients. Our research is novel in four ways. First, our proposed system consists of two cameras to capture the face and the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>device.</b> Second, the user can easily set the position of camera to capture the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>device</b> by manually moving a frame to which the camera is attached. Third, the position of patient’s nostrils and corners of the eyes are detected to align the position of his/her head more accurately with the recorded position from previous sessions. Fourth, the position of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>device</b> is continuously tracked during the examination through images that help detect the position of the color marker attached to the device. Experimental results show that our system has a higher performance than conventional method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Korean medicine, pulse {{diagnosis}} {{is one of}} the important methods for determining the health status of a patient.

We point out some confusing issues that have been naively accepted without strict verification: original pressure pulse waveform and derivative pressure pulse waveform, pressure signals and other signal types, and minutely controlled pressure exertion issues. We then consider some technical and clinical issues to achieve the development of a pulse <b>diagnostic</b> <b>device</b> that is appropriate both technically and in terms of Korean medicine. We hope to show the history of pulse <b>diagnostic</b> <b>device</b> research in Korea and propose a proper method to research and develop these devices...|$|R
