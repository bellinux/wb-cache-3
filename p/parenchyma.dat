5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including <b>parenchyma,</b> xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant <b>parenchyma)</b> as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the Queensland Herbarium {{published}} a taxonomic revision of Brachychiton; he classified B. rupestris {{in the section}} Delabechea along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree. A third species, from southeast Queensland, has been recognised but not yet described. Unique to the section, all three species have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood <b>parenchyma.</b> The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily Sterculioideae (previously family Sterculiaceae) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae. It is only distantly related to Sterculia, belonging to a different clade within the Sterculioideae.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} bark {{is known as}} the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by <b>parenchyma</b> cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the <b>parenchyma,</b> do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with <b>parenchyma</b> cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color is}} white. The spores are smooth, {{ellipsoidal}} to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, and measure 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16–20 by 4–5μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The cap cuticle is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4–9μm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble <b>parenchyma</b> of higher plants), and measure 5–10μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The {{precursor}} to tomato systemin is transcribed as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem <b>parenchyma</b> cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung <b>parenchyma.</b> Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (<b>parenchyma)</b> between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the kidney}} and urinary tract (CAKUT) include renal <b>parenchyma,</b> kidneys, and urinary collecting system.|$|E
25|$|The {{pineal body}} {{consists}} in humans of a lobular <b>parenchyma</b> of pinealocytes surrounded by connective tissue spaces. The gland's surface {{is covered by}} a pial capsule.|$|E
25|$|True {{polyploidy}} rarely {{occurs in}} humans, although polyploid cells occur in highly differentiated tissue, such as liver <b>parenchyma</b> and heart muscle, and in bone marrow. Aneuploidy is more common.|$|E
25|$|Mustards, vesicating agents, {{have been}} {{primarily}} used in warfare. They damage the upper airway mucosa. Pulmonary edema rarely occurs because mustard rarely affects the lung <b>parenchyma</b> and alveoli.|$|E
25|$|Phloem tissue {{consists}} of conducting cells, generally called sieve elements, <b>parenchyma</b> cells, including both specialized companion cells or albuminous cells and unspecialized cells and supportive cells, such as fibres and sclereids.|$|E
25|$|Hyperkalemia {{develops}} {{when there}} is excessive production (oral intake, tissue breakdown) or ineffective elimination of potassium. Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in aldosterone deficiency) or due to causes in the kidney <b>parenchyma</b> that impair excretion.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the {{underlying}} condition for MS is, some damage is {{triggered by a}} CSF unknown soluble factor, which is produced in meningeal areas and diffuses into the cortical <b>parenchyma.</b> It destroys myelin {{either directly or indirectly}} through microglia activation.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} the full breast-lift and of the modified breast-lift techniques are limited to the surgical incisions used to address the skin envelope of the breast, not the internal <b>parenchyma,</b> {{the substance of the}} breast.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} cirrhosis {{is the development}} of scar tissue that replaces normal <b>parenchyma.</b> This scar tissue blocks the portal flow of blood through the organ, raising the blood pressure and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that normally stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic <b>parenchyma</b> (due to inflammation) leads to activation of stellate cells, which increases fibrosis (through production of myofibroblasts) and obstructs hepatic blood flow. In addition, stellate cells secrete TGF-β1, which leads to a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down the fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.|$|E
25|$|Intraradical {{mycelium}} {{was observed}} in root intracellular spaces, and arbuscules were observed in the layer thin wall cells similar to palisade <b>parenchyma.</b> The fossil arbuscules appear {{very similar to those}} of existing AMF. The cells containing arbuscules have thickened walls, which are also observed in extant colonized cells.|$|E
25|$|Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: CBCT with {{contrast}} {{confirms that}} the proper artery is selected to deliver the therapy. The contrast enhances the <b>parenchyma</b> supplied by the selected artery and therefore reveals if the vasculature also supplies the tumor. Post treatment noncontrast CBCT confirms lipiodol staining of the tumor, which improves operator confidence of complete tumor coverage or further treatment.|$|E
25|$|Almost all aneurysms rupture {{at their}} apex. This leads to {{hemorrhage}} in the subarachnoid space {{and sometimes in}} brain <b>parenchyma.</b> Minor leakage from aneurysm may precede rupture, causing warning headaches. About 60% of patients die immediately after rupture. Larger aneurysms have a greater tendency to rupture, though most ruptured aneurysms are less than 10mm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Patients with TSC {{can develop}} {{progressive}} {{replacement of the}} lung <b>parenchyma</b> with multiple cysts. This process is identical to another disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Recent genetic analysis {{has shown that the}} proliferative bronchiolar smooth muscle in TSC-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis is monoclonal metastasis from a coexisting renal angiomyolipoma. Cases of TSC-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis recurring following lung transplant have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Signals can {{be either}} {{subdural}} or epidural, but are not taken from within the brain <b>parenchyma</b> itself. It has not been studied extensively until recently due to the limited access of subjects. Currently, the only manner to acquire the signal for study is {{through the use of}} patients requiring invasive monitoring for localization and resection of an epileptogenic focus.|$|E
25|$|Enveloping the root, {{and often}} {{containing}} more biomass than the Hartig net interface, is a hyphal sheath {{known as the}} mantle. There exists considerable variation {{in the structure of}} the mantle, ranging from a loose network of hyphae to a structured and stratified arrangement of tissue. Often, these layers resemble plant <b>parenchyma</b> tissue and are referred to as pseudoparenchymatous.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuity}} between the brain interstitial fluid and the CSF {{was confirmed by}} H. Cserr and colleagues from Brown University and Kings College London. The same group postulated that interstitial solutes in the brain <b>parenchyma</b> exchange with CSF via a bulk flow mechanism, rather than diffusion. However other work from this same lab indicated that the exchange of CSF with interstitial fluid was inconsistent and minor, contradicting the findings of Grady and colleagues.|$|E
25|$|As {{concentrations}} of Aspergillus proteases increase, the immunological effect switches from pro-inflammatory to inhibitory, and further reduces phagocytic ability to clear Aspergillus. Ultimately, repeated acute episodes lead to wider scale damage of pulmonary structures (<b>parenchyma)</b> and function via irreversible lung remodelling. Left untreated, this manifests as progressive bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis {{that is often}} seen in the upper lobes, and can {{give rise to a}} similar radiological appearance to that produced by tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|With {{increasing}} pressure and {{progression of the}} hernia there will be distortion of the brainstem leading to Duret hemorrhages (tearing of small vessels in the <b>parenchyma)</b> in the median and paramedian zones of the mesencephalon and pons. The rupture of these vessels leads to linear or flamed shaped hemorrhages. The disrupted brainstem can lead to decorticate posture, respiratory center depression and death. Other possibilities resulting from brain stem distortion include lethargy, slow heart rate, and pupil dilation.|$|E
25|$|Laparoscopic cyst {{decortication}} (also {{referred to}} as marsupialization) consists in the removal {{of one or more}} kidney cysts through laparoscopic surgery, during which cysts are punctured, and the outer wall of the larger cysts is excised with care not to incise the renal <b>parenchyma.</b> This procedure can be useful for pain relief in patients with ADPKD, and is usually indicated after earlier cyst aspiration has confirmed that the cyst to be decorticated is responsible for pain.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{cells in}} a {{multicellular}} plant contain chloroplasts. All green {{parts of a}} plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green. The plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually <b>parenchyma</b> cells, though chloroplasts {{can also be found}} in collenchyma tissue. A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell. A typical chlorenchyma cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.|$|E
25|$|As {{cirrhosis}} can {{be caused}} by many different entities which injure the liver in different ways, cause specific abnormalities may be seen. For example, in chronic hepatitis B, there is infiltration of the liver <b>parenchyma</b> with lymphocytes. In cardiac cirrhosis there are erythrocytes and a greater amount of fibrosis in the tissue surrounding the hepatic veins. In primary biliary cholangitis, there is fibrosis around the bile duct, the presence of granulomas and pooling of bile. Lastly in alcoholic cirrhosis, there is infiltration of the liver with neutrophils.|$|E
25|$|The {{metabolic}} {{functioning of}} sieve-tube members {{depends on a}} close association with the companion cells, a specialized form of <b>parenchyma</b> cell. All of the cellular functions of a sieve-tube element are {{carried out by the}} (much smaller) companion cell, a typical nucleate plant cell except the companion cell usually has a larger number of ribosomes and mitochondria. The dense cytoplasm of a companion cell is connected to the sieve-tube element by plasmodesmata. The common sidewall shared by a sieve tube element and a companion cell has large numbers of plasmodesmata.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound (US) {{is often}} the first imaging and {{screening}} modality used. On US, HCC often appears as a small hypoechoic lesion with poorly defined margins and coarse irregular internal echoes. When the tumor grows, it can sometimes appear heterogeneous with fibrosis, fatty change, and calcifications. This heterogeneity can look similar to cirrhosis and the surrounding liver <b>parenchyma.</b> A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 60 percent (95% CI 44-76%) and specificity was 97 percent (95% CI 95-98%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard. The sensitivity increases to 79% with AFP correlation.|$|E
25|$|Stem usually {{consist of}} three tissues, dermal tissue, ground tissue and {{vascular}} tissue. The dermal tissue covers the outer {{surface of the}} stem and usually functions to waterproof, protect and control gas exchange. The ground tissue usually consists mainly of <b>parenchyma</b> cells and fills in around the vascular tissue. It sometimes functions in photosynthesis. Vascular tissue provides long distance transport and structural support. Most or all ground tissue may be lost in woody stems. The dermal tissue of aquatic plants stems may lack the waterproofing found in aerial stems. The arrangement of the vascular tissues varies widely among plant species.|$|E
25|$|Edward Charles Jeffrey {{was one of}} {{the early}} evo-devo {{researchers}} of the 20th century. He performed a comparative analyses of the vasculatures of living and fossil gymnosperms and {{came to the conclusion that}} the storage <b>parenchyma</b> has been derived from tracheids. His research focussed primarily on plant anatomy in the context of phylogeny. This tradition of evolutionary analyses of plant architectures was further advanced by Katherine Esau, best known for her book The Plant Anatomy. Her work focussed on the origin and development of various tissues in different plants. Working with Vernon Cheadle, she also explained the evolutionary specialization of the phloem tissue with respect to its function.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{pancreatitis}} (acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis) {{is characterized by}} acute inflammation and necrosis of pancreas <b>parenchyma,</b> focal enzymic necrosis of pancreatic fat and vessel necrosis (hemorrhage). These are produced by intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes. Lipase activation produces the necrosis of fat tissue in pancreatic interstitium and peripancreatic spaces as well as vessel damage. Necrotic fat cells appear as shadows, contours of cells, lacking the nucleus, pink, finely granular cytoplasm. It is possible to find calcium precipitates (hematoxylinophilic). Digestion of vascular walls results in thrombosis and hemorrhage. Inflammatory infiltrate is rich in neutrophils. Due to the pancreas lacking a capsule, the inflammation and necrosis can extend to include fascial layers {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pancreas.|$|E
