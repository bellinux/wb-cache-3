5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a <b>protoplast,</b> whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E

Only a low incidence (< 10 %) of expansion-induced lysis was observed in <b>protoplasts</b> {{isolated from}} acclimated (ACC) leaves, and the predominant form of injury following cooling to the LT 50 (− 25 °C) was loss of osmotic responsiveness. The tolerable surface area increment (TSAI) which resulted in lysis of 50 % of a population (TSAI 50) of NA <b>protoplasts</b> osmotically expanded from isotonic solutions was 1122 ± 172 square micrometers. Similar values were obtained when the <b>protoplasts</b> were osmotically expanded from hypertonic solutions.

The TSAI 50 of ACC <b>protoplasts</b> expanded from isotonic solutions (2145 ± 235 square micrometers) was approximately double that of NA <b>protoplasts</b> and increased following osmotic contraction. Osmotic contractions were readily reversible upon return to isotonic solutions. During freeze-induced dehydration, endocytotic vesicles formed in NA <b>protoplasts</b> whereas exocytotic extrusions formed on the surface of ACC <b>protoplasts.</b> During osmotic expansion following thawing of the suspending medium, the endocytotic vesicles remained in the cytoplasm of NA <b>protoplasts</b> and the <b>protoplasts</b> lysed before their original volume and surface area were regained.

2500|$|Endomycorrhizas are {{variable}} {{and have been}} further classified as arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizas. [...] Arbuscular mycorrhizas, or AM (formerly known as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas, or VAM), are mycorrhizas whose hyphae enter into the plant cells, producing structures that are either balloon-like (vesicles) or dichotomously branching invaginations (arbuscules). The fungal hyphae do not in fact penetrate the <b>protoplast</b> (i.e. {{the interior of the}} cell), but invaginate the cell membrane. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the hypha and the cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them.|$|E
2500|$|When arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungal hyphae {{encounter the}} root of a host plant, an appressorium or 'infection structure' forms on the root epidermis. From this structure hyphae can penetrate into the host’s parenchyma cortex. [...] AM need no chemical signals from the plant to form the appressoria. AM fungi could form appressoria on the cell walls of “ghost” cells in which the <b>protoplast</b> had been removed to eliminate signaling between the fungi and the plant host. However, the hyphae did not further penetrate the cells and grow in toward the root cortex, which indicates that signaling between symbionts is required for further growth once appressoria are formed.|$|E
40|$|Micro-osmotic {{manipulation}} {{was used}} to determine the influence of osmotic contraction on the expansion potential of individual <b>protoplasts</b> isolated from rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma) leaves. For <b>protoplasts</b> isolated from leaves of nonacclimated plants (NA <b>protoplasts),</b> osmotic contraction in sufficiently hypertonic solutions (> 1. 53 osmolal) predisposed the <b>protoplasts</b> to lysis during osmotic expansion when they were returned to isotonic conditions (0. 53 osmolal). In contrast, for <b>protoplasts</b> isolated from leaves of cold acclimated plants (ACC <b>protoplasts),</b> osmotic contraction in either 2. 6 or 4. 0 osmolal solutions was readily reversible. Following osmotic contraction, the resting tension (γr) of NA <b>protoplasts</b> was similar to that determined for <b>protoplasts</b> in isotonic solutions (i. e. 110 ± 22 micronewtons per meter). In contrast, γr of ACC <b>protoplasts</b> decreased from 164 ± 27 micronewtons per meter in isotonic solutions to values close to zero in hypertonic solutions. Following expansion in hypotonic solutions, γr's of both NA and ACC <b>protoplasts</b> were similar for area expansions over the range of 1. 3 to 1. 6. Following osmotic contraction and reexpansion of NA <b>protoplasts,</b> hysteresis was observed in the relationship between γr and surface area—with higher values of γr at a given surface area. In contrast, no hysteresis was observed in this relationship for ACC <b>protoplasts.</b> Direct measurements of plasma membrane tension (γ) during osmotic expansion of NA <b>protoplasts</b> from hypertonic solutions (1. 53 osmolal) revealed that γ increased rapidly after small increments in surface area, and lysis occurred over a range of 1. 2 to 8 millinewtons per meter. During osmotic expansion of ACC <b>protoplasts</b> from hypertonic solutions (2. 6 osmolal), there was little increase in γ until after the isotonic surface area was exceeded. These results are discussed in relation to the differences in the behavior of the plasma membrane of NA and ACC <b>protoplasts</b> during osmotic contraction (i. e. endocytotic vesiculation versus exocytotic extrusion) and provide a mechanistic interpretation to account for the differential sensitivity of NA and ACC <b>protoplasts</b> to osmotic expansion from hypertonic solutions...|$|R

2500|$|Bacteria {{produce a}} single {{endospore}} internally. The spore is sometimes {{surrounded by a}} thin covering known as the exosporium, which overlies the spore coat. The spore coat, which acts like a sieve that excludes large toxic molecules like lysozyme, is resistant to many toxic molecules and may also contain enzymes {{that are involved in}} germination. The cortex lies beneath the spore coat and consists of peptidoglycan. The core wall lies beneath the cortex and surrounds the <b>protoplast</b> or core of the endospore. The core contains the spore chromosomal DNA which is encased in chromatin-like proteins known as SASPs (small acid-soluble spore proteins), that protect the spore DNA from UV radiation and heat. [...] The core also contains normal cell structures, such as ribosomes and other enzymes, but is not metabolically active.|$|E
2500|$|The cell {{envelope}} {{is composed}} of the plasma membrane and cell wall. As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall {{is to protect the}} cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as Mycoplasma) contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. Since the cell wall is required for bacterial survival, but is absent in some eukaryotes, several antibiotics (notably the penicillins and cephalosporins) stop bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis, while having no effects on human cells which have no cell wall only a cell membrane. There are two main types of bacterial cell walls, those of gram-positive bacteria and those of gram-negative bacteria, which are differentiated by their Gram staining characteristics. [...] For both these types of bacteria, particles of approximately 2nm can pass through the peptidoglycan. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a <b>protoplast</b> while if it's partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics such as penicillin inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections.|$|E

40|$|<b>Protoplasts</b> were {{isolated}} from extensor and flexor regions of open pulvini of the nyctinastic tree Samanea saman. Both types of <b>protoplasts</b> undergo many changes during isolation. Extensor <b>protoplasts</b> are univacuolate in vivo, but some become multivacuolate. All flexor <b>protoplasts</b> are univacuolate. In an open pulvinus, extensor cells {{have a higher}} osmotic pressure than flexor cells. However, both types of <b>protoplasts</b> can be isolated with optimal yield using the same osmoticum (0. 5 molar sorbitol) in the digestion medium. This suggests that some leakage of osmoticum occurs during harvest or digestion, especially from extensor tissue. Despite these changes, both types of <b>protoplasts</b> extrude protons in response to 10 micromolar fusicoccin (1. 6 - 1. 8 nanoequivalent/ 106 protoplasts/minute), demonstrating that the <b>protoplasts</b> are metabolically active and that proton transport mechanisms {{must be at least}} partially functional. The changes in vacuolar structure and osmotic pressure are what one might expect if the <b>protoplasts,</b> which are isolated from open pulvini, take on characteristics of cells in a closed pulvinus...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to detect [alpha]-amylase gene expression and [alpha]-amylase secretion from individual barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Himalaya) aleurone <b>protoplasts.</b> <b>Protoplasts</b> are incubated in liquid media with or without hormones and embedded in a thin film of agarose and starch, where they remain viable for up to 24 h. [alpha]-Amylase secreted by individual <b>protoplasts</b> digests the starch, and starch hydrolysis is visualized after 45 min by staining the preparation with I 2 KI. After I 2 KI staining, secreting <b>protoplasts</b> are surrounded by a clear, starch-free halo visible by light microscopy. The formation of starch-free halos {{is dependent on the}} synthesis and secretion of [alpha]-amylase and is not caused by carry-over of preformed enzyme from incubation media. Treating <b>protoplasts</b> with inhibitors of protein synthesis or exposing them to anaerobic conditions for 2 h before embedding them in agarose prevents the formation of halos. When [alpha]-amylase secretion is observed by counting the percentage of secreting <b>protoplasts,</b> the data are comparable to that obtained by measuring [alpha]-amylase secretion from a population of cells. The response of individual <b>protoplasts</b> to gibberellic acid (GA 3) and abscisic acid measured by the thin-film method is almost identical to the response of populations of <b>protoplasts</b> to these hormones, validating the utility of this method. Although not generally practical for quantifying secretion, the thin-film method is uniquely useful in distinguishing secreting from nonsecreting <b>protoplasts.</b> In none of our experiments did more than 60 % of the <b>protoplasts</b> secrete [alpha]-amylase when exposed to GA 3, even though more than 95 % of the <b>protoplasts</b> in the preparations were viable. Similar results were obtained when the response to GA 3 was assayed at the level of gene transcription by visualizing the transient expression of a plasmid containing the promoter from [alpha]-amylase fused to the reporter gene glucuronidase in single <b>protoplasts.</b> The thin-film secretion assay also revealed that the response of a population of <b>protoplasts</b> to GA 3 was not uniform with time. The effect of GA 3 treatment was to gradually increase the percentage of responding <b>protoplasts</b> up to a maximum of 50 to 60 %.
