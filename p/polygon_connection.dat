Hari Krishna Abstract — The present work is an {{endeavor}} towards {{analyzing the}} different multi-pulse converters {{in solving the}} harmonic problem in a three-phase converter system. The effect of {{increasing the number of}} pulses on the performance of AC to DC converters is analyzed. This paper presents the design and analysis of a novel 30 -pulse ac–dc converter for harmonic mitigation under varying loads. The proposed multi pulse (30 -pulse) ac-dc converter is based on a polygon-connected autotransformer with reduced magnetics. The proposed ac–dc converter is able to eliminate lower than 29 th order harmonics in the ac supply current. Auto transformer is modified The resulting supply current is near sinusoidal in shape with low total harmonic distortion and a nearly unity power factor. Moreover, the design of an to make it suitable for retrofit applications, where presently a 6 -pulse diode bridge rectifier is used. To validate the proposed approach, various power-quality indices are presented under varying loads. The proposed ac–dc converter is found to be suitable for retrofit applications with a large load variation and where harmonic reduction is more stringent. The laboratory prototype of the proposed autotransformer-based 30 -pulse ac–dc converter is developed and test results are presented which validate the developed design procedure and the simulation models of this ac–dc converter.

For general instances, the boundary of the image is given by two highly singular curves. We determine these curves and show how they demarcate the "flattened soccer ball".

40|$|A {{number of}} Landsat-based {{coniferous}} forest stratum maps {{have been created}} of the Eldorado National Forest in California. These maps were produced in raster image format which is not directly usable by the U. S. Forest Service's vector-based Wildland Resource Information System (WRIS). As a solution, raster-to-vector conversion software has been developed for processing classified images into polygonal data structures. Before conversion, however, the digital classification images must be simplified to remove high spatial variance ('noise', 'speckle') and meet a USFS ten acre minimum requirement. A post-processing (simplification) strategy different from those commonly used in raster image processing may be desired for preparing maps for conversion to vector format, because simplification routines typically permit diagonal connections {{in the process of}} reclassifying pixels and forming new <b>polygons.</b> Diagonal <b>connections</b> are often undesirable when converting to vector format because they permit polygons to effectively cross over each other and occupy a common location. Three alternative methodologies are discussed for simplifying raster data for conversion to vector format...|$|R
