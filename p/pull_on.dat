5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope {{was attached to}} ballast, {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and outward. The area had a strong <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E
5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E

5|$|On 6 January 1975, CINCPAC {{placed the}} 31st Marine Amphibious Unit on 96-hour alert {{to move the}} {{evacuation}} fleet into position off Kampong Som (previously Sihanoukville) in the Gulf of Thailand {{for the implementation of}} Operation Eagle <b>Pull.</b> <b>On</b> 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the Gulf of Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E
5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E

5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E
5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E

Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} {{research}} on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann's study. He found that when he asked {{a group of men}} to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> a rope, that they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this {{was the result of the}} individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the rope.|$|E

25|$|Slab suction (gravity): Plate motion {{driven by}} local {{convection}} currents that exert a downward <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> plates in subduction zones at ocean trenches.
