40|$|Plant {{response}} to drought stress {{depends on the}} physiological and biochemical response of the individual plant. Plant resistant toward the drought stress is controlled by so many genes that identification toward the drought stress resistant plant could use one or several characters related to drought. In order {{to find out the}} relationship between stomata density and the drought stress resistant plant, observation on the stomata density at the lower leave epidermis of various rice (Oryza sativa L.) somaclones originated from radiated callus using gamma ray. The observed varieties are Gajahmungkur, Towuti, and IR 64. The plant observed is the ones selected drought resistant by using <b>PEG,</b> <b>root</b> penetration test to paraffin layer, and proline content test. Stomata density observation on several somaclone shows that the radiation treatment to the three varieties may change the stomata width, length and density. Stomata with the lower density than the control shows the higher resistant to the drought viewed from the variable of filled grain, at the stress treatment given in the experiment. Gajahmungkur variety, which is basically higher land rice, has the lower density of stomata than that of Towuti and IR 64. In conclusion, the stomata density can be applied as one indicator on the stress resistant level of rice...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{defining}} {{aspects of the}} kauri trees's unique ecological niche is {{its relationship with the}} soil below. Much like podocarps, it feeds in the organic litter near the surface of the soil through fine root hairs. This layer of the soil is composed of organic matter derived from falling leaves and branches as well as dead trees, and is constantly undergoing decomposition. On the other hand, broadleaf trees such as māhoe derive a good fraction of their nutrition in the deeper mineral layer of the soil. Although its feeding root system is very shallow, it also has several downwardly directed <b>peg</b> <b>roots</b> which anchor it firmly in the soil. Such a solid foundation is necessary to prevent a tree the size of a kauri from blowing over in storms and cyclones.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} water {{stress on the}} {{behaviour}} of hydroponically-grown seedlings of 3 durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) cvs. differing in drought resistance (Kabir 1, drought sensitive; Omrabi 5 and Haurani, drought resistant) were investigated under controlled environmental conditions. Fresh weight (FW), water content (WC), osmotic potential (Psi(s)), organic and inorganic solute concentrations in roots and shoots were measured after 7 days of exposure to polyethylene glycol (PEG at 0, 10 or 20 %) and after 2 and 7 days of recovery following stress relief. Water stress decreased FW WC and Psi s, and increased root to shoot ratio (R/S) and soluble sugar, proline and other amino acid concentrations in both roots and leaves of all cvs. Water stress effect on inorganic solutes was different depending on the ion nature and on the plant part. Most of the significant changes were recorded in response to 20 % <b>PEG.</b> <b>Roots</b> and shoots roughly reacted {{in the same way}} to water stress but differed in terms of the intensity and rapidity of the responses. After stress relief, almost all parameters returned to control level; however, for some of them, roots and shoots differed in the rapidity of their recovery. Growth parameters as well as organic solute accumulation revealed differences in the behaviour of the 3 different cvs. when confronted to water stress. Our results demonstrated the high plasticity of durum wheat at the vegetative stage and suggest that the maintenance of higher root growth and osmotic adjustment in water stress conditions could confer an improved resistance of this species to drought...|$|R

The conjunction of the animal's stout teeth, massive lower jaw, and broad rostrum are indicative of an primordially crushing apparatus. T. eurycephalus may have preyed upon other ichthyosaurs: a bony element (basisphenoid) observed to be clenched between the teeth of BMNH R1157 (its holotype) may in fact belong to a victim.|$|R
50|$|Root {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} those caused by all nematodes including a reduction in number of feeder roots and root stunting, but root knot nematodes cause unique symptoms on roots and pods. Nematodes cause galls (knots) to form on both roots and pods of the peanut, and these galls are highly diagnostic for root-knot nematode presence compared to other nematodes affecting peanut. The presence of galls on <b>roots,</b> <b>pegs</b> and pods appears as single or multiple wart-like growths {{that may or may not}} be discolored. As root knot nematode infection progresses, and generally later in the season, secondary root and pod rots cause further damage and eventual death of the plants.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{demonstrated that}} ammonium nutrition enhances the drought tolerance of rice seedlings compared to nitrate nutrition {{and contributes to}} a higher root water uptake ability. It remains unclear why rice seedlings maintain a higher water uptake ability when supplied with ammonium under drought stress. Here, we focused {{on the effects of}} nitrogen form and drought stress on root abscisic acid (ABA) concentration and aquaporin expression using hydroponics experiments and stimulating drought stress with 10 % PEG 6000. Drought stress decreased the leaf photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductivity and increased the leaf temperature of plants supplied with either ammonium or nitrate, but especially under nitrate supply. After 4 h of <b>PEG</b> treatment, the <b>root</b> protoplast water permeability and the expression of root PIP and TIP genes decreased in plants supplied with ammonium or nitrate. After 24 h of <b>PEG</b> treatment, the <b>root</b> hydraulic conductivity, the protoplast water permeability, and the expression of some aquaporin genes increased in plants supplied with ammonium compared to those under non-PEG treatment. Root ABA accumulation was induced by 24 h of PEG treatment, especially in plants supplied with ammonium. The addition of exogenous ABA decreased the expression of PIP and TIP genes under non-PEG treatment but increased the expression of some of them under PEG treatment. We concluded that drought stress induced a down-regulation of aquaporin expression, which appeared earlier than did root ABA accumulation. With continued drought stress, aquaporin expression and activity increased due to root ABA accumulation in plants supplied with ammonium...|$|R
40|$|Three {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy of fumigant and nonfumigant nematicides for control of Meloidogyne arenaria race 1 on peanut. Methyl bromide, 1, 3 -D, methyl isothiocyanate, and methyl isothiocyanate mixtures were applied 7 or 8 days preplant either broadcast or in-the-row. Aldicarb, ethoprop, fenamiphos, and F 5145 were applied at different rates and by different methods at-plant or at early flowering. Of the 32 treatments evaluated, only seven resulted in yield increases (P = 0. 05), although early season vigor was high in all treated plots.

40|$|The {{population}} development of Ditylenchus destructor in the <b>roots,</b> <b>pegs,</b> hulls, and seeds of eight peanut (Arachis hypogaea) genotypes was {{studied in the}} greenhouse. Although all genotypes tested were good hosts for D. destructor, differences in host suitability were observed. Invasion of the plant parts by Ditylenchus destructor proceeded more slowly in genotypes with long growth periods. During {{the second half of}} the growth period of these genotypes, D. destructor populations emigrated from the hulls and seeds into the soil but reinfected the pods after a few weeks. The genotypes with the longest growth periods supported the highest number of nematodes when each genotype was harvested at its usual harvest time.

40|$|Wheat is an {{important}} cereal crop worldwide that often suffers from moisture deficits at the reproductive stage. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) -treated hydroponic conditions create negative osmotic potential which is compared with moisture deficit stress. An experiment was conducted in a growth chamber to {{study the effects of}} <b>PEG</b> on <b>root</b> hair morphology and associated traits of wheat varieties. Plants of 13 wheat varieties were grown hydroponically and three different doses of PEG 6000 (w/v) : 0 % (control), 0. 3 % and 0. 6 % (less than − 1 bar) were imposed on 60 days after sowing for 20 days’ duration. A low PEG concentration was imposed to observe how initial low moisture stress might affect root hair development. PEG-treated hydroponic culture significantly decreased root hair diameter and length. Estimated surface area reduction of root hairs at the main axes of wheat plants was around nine times at the 0. 6 % PEG level compared to the control plants. Decrease in root hair diameter and length under PEG-induced culture decreased “potential” root surface area per unit length of main root axis. A negative association between panicle traits, length and dry weight and the main axis length of young roots indicated competition for carbon during their development. Data provides insight into how a low PEG level might alter root hair development...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} mechanisms {{involved in}} inhibition of maize (Zea mays L.) leaf-elongation growth following addition of non-penetrating osmolyte {{to the root}} medium. The elongation rate of the first true leaf remained inhibited for 4 h after addition of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG; - 0. 5 MPa water potential), despite progressive osmotic adjustment in the growing leaf tissues. Thus, inhibition of leaf growth {{did not appear to}} be directly related to loss of leaf capacity to maintain osmotic potential gradients. Comparative cell-wall-extension capacities of immature (still expanding) leaf tissues were measured by creep extensiometry using whole plants. Reductions in irreversible (plastic) extension capacity (i. e. wall hardening) were detected minutes and hours after addition of <b>PEG</b> to the <b>roots,</b> by both in vivo and in vitro assay. The onset of the wall-hardening response could be detected by in vitro assay only 2 min after addition of PEG. Thus, initiation of wall hardening appeared to precede transcription-regulated responses. The inhibition of both leaf growth and wall-extension capacity was reversed by removal of PEG after 4 h. Moreover, wall hardening could be induced by other osmolytes (mannitol, NaCl). Thus, the leaf responses {{did not appear to be}} related to any specific (toxic) effect of PEG. We conclude that hardening of leaf cell walls is a primary event in the chain of growth regulatory responses to PEG-induced water deficits in maize. The signaling processes by which PEG, which is not expected to penetrate root cell walls or membranes, might cause cell-wall hardening in relatively distant leaves was also investigated. Plants with live or killed roots were exposed to <b>PEG.</b> The killed <b>roots</b> were presumed to be unable to produce hormonal or electrical signals in response to addition of PEG; however, inhibition of leaf elongation and hardening of leaf cell walls were detected with both live and killed roots. Thus, neither hormonal signaling nor signaling via induced changes in surface electrical potential were necessary, and hydraulic signals appeared to generate the leaf responses...|$|R
40|$|Two {{growth chamber}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of defoliation on the growth and development of peanuts. In Experiment one, peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L., cv. Flogiant) were uniformly defoliated by hand at 25, 50, 75 and 100 % at the pod or the pod-filling stage. In experiment two, 25 and 75 % of the young leaves were removed by hand at the vegetative or the pod-performing stage. Results of these study showed that defoliation lowered the leaf, stem, <b>root,</b> <b>peg</b> and pod masses. The growth stage of the plants determines the variables that would be most affected. The reduction in mass due to defoliation lasted for {{four to six weeks}} when defoliation were at the pod-forming or the pod-filling stage and about two to three weeks when 25 % of the young leaves were removed at the vegetative stage. Plants defoliated at the 75 % level gave greater priority for peg and pod growth than plants defoliated at the 25 % level. Defoliated plants have the lighter pods at harvest...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the influence of altered water availability on stomatal patterns of leaves. A baseline study of leaves stomatal indices, (stomatal as a proportional of all epidermal cells) stomatal density, (number of stomatal per unit area of epidermis) epidermal cell density, epidermal cell length and stomatal length and width was made in wheat, and sorghum cultivars; Saudi Red, Funk, Indian White, Morgon 854, Morgon 856 and Pioneer 8 ss in relation to water limitation. Seedlings of wheat and sorghum cultivars grown under water limitation showed increases in their stomatal density, epidermal cell density and trichome index in response to reduced watering frequency. Stomatal index of the two species, however, were not altered in the same way. In sorghum there was no apparent change in stomatal index in relation to water limitation treatment but stomatal density and trichome index increased. In wheat there was a marked reduction in the stomatal index in response to water limitation but there were increases in trichome indices and stomatal densities of all parts of the leaves. Wheat plants grown under water limitation imposed by polyethylene glycol (<b>PEG)</b> treatments to <b>roots</b> showed marked reductions in their growth compared with controls. Stomatal density was found to increase in response to PEG treatments while stomatal index decreased. Incubation of newly-germinated wheat seedlings in PEG resulted in an inhibition of growth of coleoptiles. However, the density of stomata decreased, unlike what was seen in leaf tissues. When wheat coleoptiles were subjected to conditions of limited water availability guard mother cell (GMC) production appeared not to be influenced by water status of the tissues. Wheat coleoptiles grown under different periods of light showed slight decreases in stomata density compared to the controls. Abscisic acid treatment was able to substitute for water limitation treatments by reducing stomatal index in both leaves and coleoptiles whilst increasing the production of trichomes in leaves. However, in coleoptile the same treatment reduced both the GMC index as well as stomata index. Salinity treatments, inhibited seed germination and were found to decrease stomatal index. Incubation of wheat seedlings in PEG resulted in a yellow pigmentation of the roots. The pigment was tentatively identified. However, {{it was not possible to}} distinguish whether the pigment was a specific metabolite of <b>PEG</b> in the <b>roots</b> or was produced by a non-biological conversion of PEG...|$|R

Plot composition (percent yellow, percent green, percent straw or dormant turf) components were affected by herbicides to various extents on March 27, April 20, and April 27. Percent plot yellow turf was least in occurrence for BARRICADE, PENDULUM, and SURFLAN at 25 days after the first treatment. At 25 days after the first application (March 27) PENDULUM produced the lowest amount of green turf (13 %) among treated turfs.

40|$|Osmotic stress {{adversely}} {{affects the}} growth, fruit quality and yield of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai). Increasing the tolerance of watermelon to osmotic stress caused by {{factors such as}} high salt and water deficit is {{an effective way to}} improve crop survival in osmotic stress environments. Roots are important organs in water absorption and are involved in the initial response to osmosis stress; however, few studies have examined the underlying mechanism of tolerance to osmotic stress in watermelon roots. For better understanding of this mechanism, the inbred watermelon accession M 08, which exhibits relatively high tolerance to water deficits, was treated with 20 % polyethylene glycol (<b>PEG)</b> 6000. The <b>root</b> samples were harvested at 6 h after PEG treatment and untreated samples were used as controls. Transcriptome analyses were carried out by Illumina RNA sequencing. A total of 5246 differentially expressed genes were identified. Gene ontology enrichment and biochemical pathway analyses of these 5246 genes showed that short-term osmotic stress affected osmotic adjustment, signal transduction, hormone responses, cell division, cell cycle and ribosome, and M 08 may repress root growth to adapt osmotic stress. The results of this study describe the watermelon root transcriptome under osmotic stress and propose new insight into watermelon root responses to osmotic stress at the transcriptome level. Accordingly, these results allow us to better understand the molecular mechanisms of watermelon in response to drought stress and will facilitate watermelon breeding projects to improve drought tolerance...|$|R
40|$|In young {{cucumber}} seedlings, the peg is a polar {{outgrowth of}} tissue that functions by snagging the seed coat, thereby freeing the cotyledons. The {{development of the}} peg {{is thought to be}} gravity-dependent and has become a model system for plant-gravity response. Peg development requires rapid cell expansion, a process thought to be catalyzed by alpha-expansins, and thus was a good system to identify expansins that were regulated by gravity. This study identified 7 new alpha-expansin cDNAs from cucumber seedlings (Cucumis sativus L. cv Burpee Hybrid II) and examined their expression patterns. Two alpha-expansins (CsExp 3 and CsExp 4) were more highly expressed in the <b>peg</b> and the <b>root.</b> Earlier reports stated that pegs tend not to form in the absence of gravity, so the expression levels were compared in the pegs of seedlings grown in space (STS- 95), on a clinostat, and on earth (1 g). Pegs were observed to form at high frequency on clinostat and space-grown seedlings, yet on clinostats there was more than a 4 -fold reduction in the expression of CsExp 3 in the pegs of seedlings grown on clinostats vs. those grown at 1 g, while the CsExp 4 gene appeared to be turned off (below detection limits). There were no detectable differences in expansin gene expression levels for the pegs of seedlings grown in space or in the orbiter environmental simulator (OES) (1 g) at NASA. The microgravity environment did not affect the expression of CsExp 3 or CsExp 4, and the clinostat did not simulate the microgravity environment well...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{damaging}} types of abiotic stresses that causes significant annual yield losses, and poses a serious threat to sustainable agriculture. However, like other stressors, the drought triggers in plants a wide range of responses that are implemented at the molecular, cellular and organism level and aimed at reducing the damaging effects and formation of plant tolerance to water deficit. The study of plant adaptive responses to drought and interpretation of mechanisms to enhance drought tolerance requires adequate and reliable methods of experimentation and objective methods for assessment of research results. The review examined three types of current models that are used in experiments on the effect of drought on plants, namely, soil, water, and agar models. The main advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed including models with drought conditions simulation by providing <b>PEG</b> in the <b>root</b> medium but the choice of optimal model should be determined depending on the specific problems solved by the experimenter. Currently, researchers have a wide range of methodological approaches and tools for objective assessment of changes in physiological and biochemical parameters of plants in response to the drought. Among the most common are methods associated with the assessment of such parameters as stomatal conductance, photosystem II efficiency using PAM fluorometry, accumulation of osmotically active substances. Special attention is given to methods of assessing the activity of the antioxidant systems in plants, primarily of ascorbate-glutathione cycle as one of the most efficient methods in screening species and varieties of plants on drought tolerance. It should concluded that for the successful development of new strategies aimed at the improvement of drought resistance of plants the acquisition of knowledge is required with the use of current molecular biological methods based on the application of metabolomics and proteomic analyses of plants...|$|R
40|$|An apoplastic pathway, the {{so-called}} bypass flow, {{is important for}} Na+ uptake in rice under saline conditions. The primary aim of this thesis was to identify the point of entry for bypass flow into rice roots subjected to salinity. Investigations using lateral rootless mutants (lrt 1, lrt 2), a crown rootless mutant (crl 1), their wild types (Oochikara, Nipponbare and Taichung 65, respectively) and seedlings of rice cv. IR 36 showed that the entry point, quantified using trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS), {{was not at the}} sites of lateral root emergence. However, PTS was identified in the vascular tissue of lateral roots using both epifluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy of sections stained with berberine-aniline blue and Fluorol Yellow 088 revealed that an exodermis was absent in the lateral roots, suggesting that the lack of the exodermis allowed PTS to pass through the cortical layers, enter the stele and be transported to the shoot via the transpiration stream. These findings suggest a role for the lateral roots of rice in bypass flow. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and silicon (Si) to the culture solution significantly reduced Na+ uptake to the shoot by reducing bypass flow through the lateral <b>roots.</b> <b>PEG</b> was found to be more effective than Si. It was also shown that changing the relative humidity in the air around the shoots had a significant effect on the magnitude of bypass flow and the flux of water across the roots: the greater the flux of water through the roots, the greater the Na+ uptake and bypass flow. Furthermore, results showed that recombinant inbred lines of rice with low Na+ transport possessed low magnitudes of bypass flow, whereas lines with high Na+ transport had a high degree of bypass flow, indicating that bypass flow {{could be used as a}} criterion for screening salt resistance in rice varieties...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{confirms}} that using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as an osmotic agent to imitate water shortage {{was not so}} easy in practice, due to PEG toxicity effects and frequent contaminations. Two new approaches were developed to alleviate those problems, one using a raft covered with a membrane to prevent <b>PEG</b> entry in <b>roots,</b> and one using solidified PEG media. The raft trials were done on corn, hexaploid and tetraploid wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, Agrotricum; those in solid media, with corn, hexaploid and tetraploid wheat, barley, sorghum and pearl millet. Different species respond differently to PEG-induced osmotic stress. In our trials, the most sensitive cereal was corn, and this finding correlates with the lower osmotic pressure of the sap (a constitutive trait in corn seedlings). Corn responded to osmotic stress by a very poor rate of elongation of the coleoptile, especially when the highest stress (32 % PEG) was used. This behavior was also observed {{in the field in}} dry years, for example in the Sahel area. Compared to this sensitive cereal species, all other cereals tested were more resistant. Hexaploid and tetraploid wheat, triticale, and Agrotricum kept capacity to elongate roots when submitted to a high osmotic stress, but the higher stress reduced root length considerably. Barley kept rooting ability like other cereals, but was able to develop more aerial biomass, seminal roots, and ramifications. Barley root hair was also longer and covered a higher proportion of the root. Those adaptive features likely explain part of the good adaptation of barley to dry Mediterranean areas. Preliminary results on solid media also showed relationships between drought resistance and the osmoresistance response, at least when comparing species. Roots of species adapted to hot climate, like pearl millet and sorghum, had few seminal roots but displayed a strong gravitropism under osmotic stress. The ease of use of solidified PEG media shows promise for future larger scale trials. Applications of solidified PEG media for research beyond cereal crops is envisioned...|$|R

AnÃlises {{in silico}} nos genomas de soja e de outras leguminosas disponÃveis em bancos de dados revelaram famÃlias gÃnicas de 3 a 6 membros com estrutura conservada de 2 Ãxons e 2 Ãntrons. Dentre as espÃcies analisadas (Glycine max, Cajanus cajan, Vigna unguiculata, Medicago truncatula e Phaseolus vulgaris) G. max foi a que apresentou o maior nÃmero de genes, classificados como EF 1 &# 945; 1 a; 1 b; 1 c; 2 a; 2 b e 3 apÃs anÃlise filogenÃtica.

Para as anÃlises durante o desenvolvimento, quatro genes de expressÃo estÃvel (UKN 1, SKIP 16, EF 1 &# 946; e MTP) foram tambÃm utilizados. Os genes EF 1 &# 945; foram mais estÃveis em cotilÃdones (EF 1 &# 945; 3 e EF 1 &# 945; 1 c); epicÃtilos (EF 1 &# 945; 1 b, EF 1 &# 945; 2 b e EF 1 &# 945; 1 a); hipocÃtilos (EF 1 &# 945; 1 a e EF 1 &# 946;); vagens (EF 1 &# 945; 2 a e EF 1 &# 945; 2 b) e raÃzes (EF 1 &# 945; 2 a e UKN 1) e menos estÃveis em folhas trifolioladas/unifolioladas (UKN 1 e SKIP 16) e sementes em germinaÃÃo (EF 1 &# 946; e SKIP 16). Em folhas sob condiÃÃes de estresse, anÃlises atravÃs do GeNorm revelaram que quatro genes (EF 1 &# 945; 2 a > 1 b > 2 b > 1 a) apresentaram classificaÃÃo de estabilidade semelhante nos estresses por AS e PEG. JÃ em raÃzes, distinto padrÃo de estabilidade foi encontrado: EF 1 &# 945; 2 a > 1 c > 2 b > 1 b > 1 a > 3 para PEG e EF 1 &# 945; 1 c > 3 > 2 a > 1 a > 2 b > 1 b para AS. Tais resultados foram confirmados usando o programa NormFinder. A despeito das variaÃÃes de expressÃo gÃnica em diferentes tecidos em desenvolvimento e condiÃÃes de estresse, foram determinados genes EF 1 &# 945; que podem ser usados para normalizar ensaios de PCR em tempo real em soja e leguminosas (tribo Phaseoleae) vez que genes EF 1 &# 945; ortÃlogos foram identificados entre essas diferentes espÃcies. The {{elongation}} factor 1 alpha (EF 1 &# 945;) {{is responsible for}} binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome, acting thus the elongation phase of protein synthesis. The EF 1 &# 945; in plants is encoded by a multigene family with variable number of genes among species. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize, analyze phylogenetic and elucidate the expression profile of EF 1 &# 945; genes in soybean during development, as well as select (s) gene (s) of the most stable reference for qRT-PCR assays in the development and conditions stress. In silico analyses in the genomes of soybean and other leguminous plants available in databases revealed gene families 3 - 6 members with conserved structure of 2 exons and 2 introns. Among the analyzed species (Glycine max, Cajanus cajan, Vigna unguiculata, Phaseolus vulgaris and Medicago truncatula) G. max was the one with the largest number of genes classified as EF 1 &# 945; 1 a, 1 b, 1 c, 2 a, 2 b and 3 after phylogenetic analysis. The EF 1 &# 945; gene expression was studied in different tissues (flowers, pods, seeds, cotyledons, trifoliate and unifolioladas leaves, roots, hypocotyls and epicotyls) during the development of soybean. Expression analyses by qPCR revealed that the EF 1 &# 945; genes are functional and expressed in all tissues, however exhibit differential expression dependent on the tissue and developmental stage. Relative expression between genes members showed predominance of expression for 5 of the 6 genes analyzed: EF 1 &# 945; 1 a: no predominance of expression; EF 1 &# 945; 1 b: Germination and development hypocotyl; EF 1 &# 945; 1 c: pods development; EF 1 &# 945; 2 a: pods development, unifoliate and trifoliate leaves; EF 1 &# 945; 2 b: pods development, unifoliate leaves; EF 1 &# 945; 3 : Germination, flowers, roots, early stages development (hypocotyl and epicotyl). These data, together with the leaves and roots subjected to stress conditions (PEG and AS) were used to assess the stability of expression of different EF 1 &# 945; genes soybean through the programs GeNorm and NormFinder. For the analyses during development, four stable genes (UKN 1, SKIP 16, EF 1 &# 946; and MTP) were also used. EF 1 &# 945; genes were more stable in cotyledons (EF 1 &# 945; 3 and EF 1 &# 945; 1 c); epicotyls (EF 1 &# 945; 1 b, 2 b and 1 a), hypocotyls (EF 1 &# 945; 1 a, EF 1 &# 946; and EF 1 &# 945; 1 c); pods (EF 1 &# 945; 2 a and EF 1 &# 945; 2 b) and roots (EF 1 &# 945; 2 b and UKN 1) and less stable in trifoliate/unifoliolate leaves (UKN 1 and SKIP 16) and germinating seeds (EF 1 &# 946; and SKIP 16). In leaves under stress conditions, through GeNorm analyses revealed that four genes (EF 1 &# 945; 2 a> 1 b> 2 b> 1 a) showed similar stability in the classification of stress for AS and <b>PEG.</b> Already in <b>roots,</b> distinct pattern of stability was found: EF 1 &# 945; 2 a> 1 c> 2 b> 1 b> 1 a> 3 for PEG and EF 1 &# 945; 1 c> 3 > 2 a> 1 a> 2 b> 1 b to AS. These results were confirmed using the program NormFinder. In spite of changes in gene expression in different tissues in development and stress conditions were determined EF 1 &# 945; genes that can be used to normalize the qPCR assays in soybean and others leguminous plants (Phaseoleae tribe) seeing that EF 1 &# 945; genes orthologous were identified between these different species...|$|R
