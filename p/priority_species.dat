5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan <b>priority</b> <b>species)</b> {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one <b>priority</b> <b>species,</b> Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Viability {{of single}} species can be {{understood}} only {{in the context of}} ecological interactions with the other species and the environment. Monitoring multispecies interactions and their environment is critical for analysis of community dynamics, multispecies habitat conservation plans and for adaptive ecosystem management programs. In this study, three simple methods (scaling exponent of Taylor’s power law, resource exploitation competition and interspecies mean crowding coefficients) based on abundance were applied to estimate multiple tree species interactions along the Northeast China Transect. This transect was identified as a middle-latitude transect for terrestrial ecosystem studies by Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem Program of IGBP. Our analyses show the differences and similarities of these three methods because each one emphasizes different aspects of multispecies interaction measurement. The combined use of these three methods can provide an easy and simple way to estimate multispecies interactions based on abundance of each tree species and their change under environmental change. The suggested approach could help identify indicator species for monitoring, improve population viability analysis, and set <b>priorities</b> <b>species</b> conservation...|$|R

40|$|The {{goals of}} the trace {{chemistry}} group were to identify the processes relevant to aerosol and aerosol precursor formation occurring within aircraft gas turbine engines; that is, within the combustor, turbine, and nozzle. The topics of discussion focused on whether the chemistry of aerosol formation is homogeneous or heterogeneous; what species are important for aerosol and aerosol precursor formation; what modeling/theoretical activities to pursue; what experiments to carry out that both support modeling activities and elucidate fundamental processes; {{and the role of}} particulates in aerosol and aerosol precursor formation. The consensus of the group was that attention should be focused on SO 2, SO 3, and aerosols. Of immediate concern is the measurement of the concentration of the species SO 3, SO 2, H 2 SO 4 OH, HO 2, H 2 O 2, O, NO, NO 2, HONO, HNO 3, CO, and CO 2 and particulates in various engines, both those currently in use and those in development. The recommendation was that concentration measurements should be made at both the combustor exit and the engine exit. At each location the above species were classified into one of four categories of decreasing importance, Priority I through IV, as follows: Combustor exit: <b>Priority</b> I <b>species</b> - SO 3 :SO 2 ratio, SO 3, SO 2, and particulates; Priority II species: OH and O; <b>Priority</b> III <b>species</b> - NO and NO 2; and <b>Priority</b> IV <b>species</b> - CO and CO 2. For the Engine exit: <b>Priority</b> I <b>species</b> - SO 3 :SO 2 ratio, SO 3, SO 2,H 2 SO 4, and particulates; Priority II species: OH,HO 2, H 2 O 2, and O; <b>Priority</b> III <b>species</b> - NO, NO 2, HONO, and HNO 3; and <b>Priority</b> IV <b>species</b> - CO and CO 2. Table I summarizes the anticipated concentration range of each of these species. For particulate matter, the quantities of interest are the number density, size distribution, and composition. In order to provide data for validating multidimensional reacting flow models, it would be desirable to make 2 -D, time-resolved measurements of the concentrations of the above species and, in addition, of the pressure, temperature, and velocity. A near term goal of the experimental program should be to confirm the nonlinear effects of sulfur speciation, and if present, to provide an explanation for them. It is also desirable to examine if the particulate matter retains any sulfur. The recommendation is to examine the effects on SOx production of variations in fuel-bound sulfur and aromatic content (which may affect the amount of particulates formed). These experiments should help us to understand if there is a coupling between particulate formation and SO, concentration. Similarly, any coupling with NOx can be examined either by introducing NOx into the combustion air or by using fuel-bound nitrogen. Also of immediate urgency is the need to establish and validate a detailed mechanism for sulfur oxidation/aerosol formation, whose chemistry is concluded to be homogeneous, because there is not enough surface area for heterogeneous effects. It is envisaged that this work will involve both experimental and theoretical programs. The experimental work will require, in addition to the measurements described above, fundamental studies in devices such as flow reactors and shock tubes. Complementing this effort should be modeling and theoretical activities. One impediment to the successful modeling of sulfur oxidation is the lack of reliable data for thermodynamic and transport properties for several species, such as aqueous nitric acid, sulfur oxides, and sulfuric acid. Quantum mechanical calculations are recommended as a convenient means of deriving values for these properties. Such calculations would also help establish rate constants for several important reactions for which experimental measurements are inherently fraught with uncertainty. Efforts to implement sufficiently detailed chemistry into computational fluid dynamic codes should be continued. Zero- and one-dimensional flow models are also useful vehicles for elucidating the minimal set of species and reactions that must be included in two- and three-dimensional modeling studies...|$|R
