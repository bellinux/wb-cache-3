25|$|Increased {{participation}} {{of women in}} the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country <b>panel</b> <b>study</b> found this fertility factor effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well. International United Nations data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{investigated}} {{factors that}} influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a <b>panel</b> <b>study</b> with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination. It {{has been argued that}} by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.|$|E

This is an essential and accessible introduction for those contemplating the use of <b>panel</b> <b>studies</b> for the first time and will be an invaluable resource for both practising researchers and the commissioners of research...|$|R

40|$|Accompanying {{the call}} for {{increased}} evidence-based policy the developed world is implementing more longitudinal <b>panel</b> <b>studies</b> which periodically gather information about the same people {{over a number of}} years. <b>Panel</b> <b>studies</b> distinguish between transitory and persistent states (e. g. poverty, unemployment) and facilitate causal explanations of relationships between variables. However, they are complex and costly. A growing number of developing countries are now implementing or considering starting <b>panel</b> <b>studies.</b> The objectives of this paper are to identify challenges that arise in <b>panel</b> <b>studies,</b> and to give examples of how these have been addressed in resource-constrained environments. The main issues considered are: the development of a conceptual framework which links macro and micro contexts; sampling the cohort in a cost-effective way; tracking individuals; ethics and data management and analysis. <b>Panel</b> <b>studies</b> require long term funding, a stable institution and an acceptance that there will be limited value for money in terms of results from early stages, with greater benefits accumulating in the study's mature years.

25|$|Procrastination is {{considerably}} more widespread in students {{than in the}} general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point. A 2014 <b>panel</b> <b>study</b> from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct. This study argues that academic misconduct {{can be seen as}} a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.|$|E
2500|$|Research has {{identified}} {{a number of}} demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating, including age, gender and grade point average. Older students, females, and students with higher academic achievement are less likely to cheat, whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do so. Students involved in [...] extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies, or may have more demands on their time, which interfere with their studies, creating a greater incentive to cheat. [...] It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college. Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a morality test and his likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a pre-conventional stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a post-conventional stage). [...] Higher academic procrastination was also found to increase the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct (using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, and fabrication or falsification of data) as well as the variety of academic misconduct. This German <b>panel</b> <b>study</b> among thousands of university students argues that academic misconduct might be a coping-strategy to overcome the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as lower performance.|$|E

40|$|The key {{characteristics}} of <b>panel</b> <b>studies</b> include repeated measures {{for a more}} or less stable sample over time. The core challenge in documenting <b>panel</b> <b>studies</b> is the documentation of these repeated measures (usually questions) and the resulting variables because various reasons can require modifications of measures over time - resulting in comparable but not identical data structures. The DDI standard provides not one but multiple options for the documentation of panel data. In this workshop we like to present various options and discuss their feasibility for common use cases. The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) will provide the primary use case, but participants are also invited to introduce and discuss their own use cases. The workshop starts with a short introduction of both <b>panel</b> <b>studies</b> and the DDI standard. Therefore, no previous knowledge of the DDI standard is required to participate in the workshop.

To follow young people who grow up with greater uncertainties in their life and migration patterns, it requires an extraordinary amount of communication efforts compared to regular <b>panel</b> <b>studies</b> (Cotter et al. 2005).
