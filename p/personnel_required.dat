5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of pilots and wireless operators/gunners, with 100 pilots and 200 other <b>personnel</b> <b>required.</b> In {{the short term}} the OTU course was reduced to get the crews out to operational commands faster. It now took no longer than a month compared with the {{six to eight weeks}} considered necessary. This reduced the number of fit pilots, and the quality of pilots overall. The number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it had to have a well-stocked general training programme. Coastal Command did not possess such an administration. Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying. Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the various military items, there were old versions of standard passenger carriages.

25|$|Sarvatra Bridge layer: {{the bridge}} can be {{deployed}} over water and land obstacles to provide 75 metres of bridge-length for battle tanks, supply convoys and troops. The system {{consists of a}} light aluminum alloy scissors bridge and was approved for production in March 2000 trials. One complete set of the multi span mobile bridging system includes five truck-mounted units with a bridge-span of 15 metres each. The system is designed to take {{the weight of the}} Arjun MBT, by far the heaviest vehicle in the Army's inventory. Microprocessor based control system reduces the number of <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> to deploy and operationalise the bridge. The bridging equipment is carried on a Tatra Kolos chassis and the system is built by Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML).|$|E
25|$|The United States Government {{implemented}} an unscheduled leave {{policy for}} federal employees on Friday February 5 {{and shut down}} four hours early {{in an effort to}} clear metropolitan Washington before substantial snow accumulations began. Numerous school districts in the metro DC area announced closures for Friday February 5 well in advance, although District of Columbia Public Schools and some Maryland schools held a half day of class. Many districts had used all their built-in snow days and some began scheduling classes on upcoming holidays (for example, Fairfax County on February 15, the Monday of President's Day weekend). Late on Sunday February 7, the Office of Personnel Management announced that the United States Government would again be closed on Monday February 8, with only emergency/essential <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> to report, and numerous school districts again canceled classes between February 9–11.|$|E
25|$|The convenience, low cost, and {{mobility}} {{of this method}} distinguish it from conventional testing and are the primary reasons for its growing popularity. The method is convenient because all required sound system, power generation and distribution and data acquisition and control equipment is brought to the test site. Equipment is usually leased for each test event. There is no large investment in a facility, equipment or <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> {{on the part of}} the customer. A diesel generator is the preferred power source, therefore providing clean on-site electrical power in a consistent configuration for connection to the MSI power distribution equipment. This removes the demand for large quantities of power from the test facility. In addition, testing can be performed at a much lower cost per test compared to the installation, operation and maintenance of a more standard high intensity reverberant acoustic chamber system. Finally, mobility allows this test method to be performed at almost any time and place in the normal test article integration and test flow. The test equipment is completely portable and no special facility or infrastructure is required.|$|E

2500|$|The AAF used {{a series}} of test {{batteries}} and interviews to ascertain the job experience and mental equipment of recruits. [...] An important phase of the classification of recruits was the interview which uncovered such civilian experiences as skills derived from employment or hobbies and the extent and type of schooling. The objective was to establish a relationship between civilian occupational experiences and a job specialty that would be most useful to the AAF. After the interview a classifier reviewed the recruit’s papers and made a recommended assignment to an MOS. [...] By 1938, high school diplomas or direct, qualifying experience was required for entry in the Air Corps Technical School at Chanute Field, IL, but by World War II, the requirement was dropped to accommodate the vast numbers of <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> to operate a vast Air Force.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, 834th had {{operational}} control over 315th Air Division Lockheed C-130 Hercules assigned on temporary duty in South Vietnam. [...] PACAF {{was reluctant to}} permanently station C-130s in Vietnam because of the additional support <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> in an area with a mandated troop ceiling and crowded bases and the flexibility that would be lost in scheduling the planes, which provided airlift throughout the western Pacific. [...] Detachment 1 controlled C-130s operating from Tan Son Nhut while Detachment 2 controlled operations from Cam Ranh Bay Air Base. These replaced Detachments 4 and 5 of the 315th Air Division and were joined by Detachment 3 at Tuy Hoa Air Base by 1968. [...] In addition, the 834th supervised transport operations (primarily Douglas C-47 Skytrains) of the Vietnamese Air Force and a squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam). [...] The 834th's 315th Wing also performed defoliation missions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, {{mechanical}} refrigeration began to replace ice-based systems. Soon after, mechanical refrigeration units replaced the [...] "armies" [...] of <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> to re-ice the cars. The plug door was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.'s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car. By the mid-1970s, the few remaining ice bunker cars were relegated to [...] "top-ice" [...] service, where crushed ice was applied atop the commodity.|$|E

2500|$|The UT Dallas founders, Eugene McDermott, Cecil Howard Green and J. Erik Jonsson, {{purchased}} Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI) on December 6, 1941, the {{day before}} the attack on Pearl Harbor. With the increase in defense contracts the General Instrument Division of GSI grew {{to the point of being}} reorganized as Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) in 1951 with GSI a wholly owned subsidiary. Qualified <b>personnel</b> <b>required</b> by TI were not readily available in the Dallas-Fort Worth area because the region's universities did not provide enough graduates with advanced training in engineering and physical sciences. TI was forced to recruit talent from other states during its expansion and the founders observed in 1959 that [...] "To grow industrially, the region must grow academically; it must provide the intellectual atmosphere, which will allow it to compete in the new industries dependent on highly trained and creative minds". To compensate for this shortage they established the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest in 1961. The institute initially was housed in the Fondren Science Library at Southern Methodist University. Land for the center was acquired by Jonsson, McDermott, and Green in Richardson in 1962 and the first facility, the Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Science (later named the Founders Building), opened on the grounds of the present-day UTD campus in 1964. The Graduate Research Center of the Southwest was renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS) in 1967 and in 1969 the founders transferred the land and assets of SCAS to the State of Texas. On June 13, 1969 Governor Preston Smith signed the bill adding the institution to the University of Texas System and creating the University of Texas at Dallas. In 1969 the school accepted its first students. Physics, biology and geological sciences were the first PhD degrees offered. Francis S. Johnson served as interim president and William B. Hanson was named the director of the Division of Atmospheric and Space Sciences now known as the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences.|$|E
