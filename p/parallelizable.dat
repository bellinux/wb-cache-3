25|$|A simple {{example of}} a nontrivial tangent bundle {{is that of the}} unit sphere S2: this tangent bundle is nontrivial as a {{consequence}} of the hairy ball theorem. Therefore, the sphere is not <b>parallelizable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The n-dimensional torus is {{the product}} space of n circles. Its Euler {{characteristic}} is 0, by the product property. More generally, any compact <b>parallelizable</b> manifold, including any compact Lie group, has Euler characteristic 0.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{there is}} no non-vanishing section of the tangent bundle of even spheres, so the tangent bundle is not trivial—i.e., S2n is not a <b>parallelizable</b> manifold, and in {{particular}} does not admit a Lie group structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} homogeneous space {{concept is}} a special case of that of principal bundle: it means a principal bundle with base a single point. In other words the local theory of principal bundles {{is that of a}} family of principal homogeneous spaces depending on some parameters in the base. The 'origin' can be supplied by a section of the bundlesuch sections are usually assumed to exist locally on the basethe bundle being locally trivial, so that the local structure is that of a cartesian product. But sections will often not exist globally. For example a differential manifold M has a principal bundle of frames associated to its tangent bundle. A global section will exist (by definition) only when M is <b>parallelizable,</b> which implies strong topological restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this process}} might sound slow, {{it is very}} cache-local and highly <b>parallelizable</b> {{due to the lack}} of {{register}} dependencies and therefore in fact has excellent performance on modern out-of-order execution CPUs. A red-black tree for example performs much better on paper, but is highly cache-unfriendly and causes multiple pipeline and TLB stalls on modern CPUs which makes that algorithm bound by memory latency rather than CPU speed. In comparison, a bitwise trie rarely accesses memory, and when it does, it does so only to read, thus avoiding SMP cache coherency overhead. Hence, it is increasingly becoming the algorithm of choice for code that performs many rapid insertions and deletions, such as memory allocators (e.g., recent versions of the famous Doug Lea's allocator (dlmalloc) and its descendents).|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{example is}} the case that the family of vector spaces is constant, i.e., there is a fixed vector space V such that V(x)=V for all x in X: in this case there is a copy of V for each x in X and these copies fit together to form the vector bundle X×V over X. Such vector bundles are said to be trivial. A more complicated (and prototypical) class of examples are the tangent bundles of smooth (or differentiable) manifolds: to every point of such a manifold we attach the tangent space to the manifold at that point. Tangent bundles are not, in general, trivial bundles: for example, the tangent bundle of the sphere is non-trivial by the hairy ball theorem. In general, a manifold is said to be <b>parallelizable</b> if and only if its tangent bundle is trivial.|$|E
25|$|Algorithms {{are usually}} {{discussed}} {{with the assumption}} that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to parallel algorithms or distributed algorithms. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a network. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally <b>parallelizable.</b> Some problems have no parallel algorithms, and are called inherently serial problems.|$|E

500|$|Amdahl's law only {{applies to}} {{cases where the}} problem size is fixed. In practice, as more {{computing}} resources become available, they tend to get used on larger problems (larger datasets), and the {{time spent in the}} <b>parallelizable</b> part often grows much faster than the inherently serial work. In this case, Gustafson's law gives a less pessimistic and more realistic assessment of parallel performance: ...|$|E
500|$|Stable {{homotopy}} {{groups of}} spheres {{are used to}} describe the group Θn of h-cobordism classes of oriented homotopy n-spheres (for n ≠ 4, this is the group of smooth structures on n-spheres, up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism; the non-trivial elements of this group are represented by exotic spheres). More precisely, there is an injective mapwhere bP'n+1 is the cyclic subgroup represented by homotopy spheres that bound a <b>parallelizable</b> manifold, πn'S is the nth stable homotopy group of spheres, and J is the image of the J-homomorphism. This is an isomorphism unless n is of the form 2kminus&2, in which case the image has index 1 or 2 [...]|$|E
500|$|Since , {{it shows}} that {{a small part of}} the program which cannot be parallelized will limit the overall speedup {{available}} from parallelization. A program solving a large mathematical or engineering problem will typically consist of several <b>parallelizable</b> parts and several non-parallelizable (serial) parts. If the non-parallelizable part of a program accounts for 10% of the runtime (p = 0.9), we can get no more than a 10 times speedup, regardless of how many processors are added. This puts an upper limit on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units.

2500|$|Further, codimension 0 immersions do not {{behave like}} other immersions, which are largely {{determined}} by the stable normal bundle: in codimension 0 one has issues of fundamental class and cover spaces. For instance, there is no codimension 0 immersion , despite the circle being <b>parallelizable,</b> which can be proven because the line has no fundamental class, so one does not get the required map on top cohomology. Alternatively, this is by invariance of domain. Similarly, although S3 and the 3-torus T3 are both <b>parallelizable,</b> there is no immersion [...] – any such cover {{would have to be}} ramified at some points, since the sphere is simply connected.|$|E
2500|$|By definition, a {{manifold}} M {{is framed}} if {{and only if}} the tangent bundle TM is stably trivial, meaning that for some trivial bundle E the Whitney sum [...] is trivial. [...] For example, the n-dimensional sphere Sn is framed for all n, but <b>parallelizable</b> only for n=1,3,7 (by results of Bott-Milnor and Kervaire).|$|E
2500|$|... de Sitter phase {{associated}} with S3. Another {{point of view}} is that since the Geometrization conjecture (a generalization of the Poincaré conjecture) requires one to understand all locally homogeneous geometries on closed three manifolds, using Ricci flow one may consider Bianchi classification [...] used to study cosmological models. What one may add to this scenario is that such a transition may require a torsion in order to make S3 (or other Bianchi cosmological models) <b>parallelizable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Covering {{and packing}} LPs {{can be solved}} {{approximately}} in nearly-linear time. That is, if matrix [...] is of dimension [...] and has [...] non-zero entries, then there exist algorithms that run in time [...] and produce [...] approximate solutions to given covering and packing LPs. The best known sequential algorithm of this kind runs in time , and the best known parallel algorithm of this kind runs in [...] iterations, each requiring only a matrix-vector multiplication which is highly <b>parallelizable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The tangent bundle comes {{equipped}} with a natural topology (described in a section below). With this topology, the tangent bundle to a manifold is the prototypical example of a vector bundle (a fiber bundle whose fibers are vector spaces). [...] A section of [...] is a vector field on , and the dual bundle to [...] is the cotangent bundle, which is the disjoint union of the cotangent spaces of [...] [...] By definition, a manifold [...] is <b>parallelizable</b> {{if and only if}} the tangent bundle is trivial.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{if we have}} a multiset, in {{a program}} it is {{represented}} as a map from elements to their numbers. Elements are called keys in this case. The number of distinct keys may be too big, and in this case the multiset is being sharded. To finalize reduction properly, the [...] "Shuffling" [...] stage regroups the data among the nodes. If we do not need this step, the whole Map/Reduce consists of mapping and reducing; both operation are <b>parallelizable,</b> the former due to its element-wise nature, the latter due to associativity of the monoid.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{obstruction}} to {{the existence}} of an immersion [...] is the stable normal bundle of M, as detected by its characteristic classes, notably its Stiefel–Whitney classes. That is, since Rn is <b>parallelizable,</b> the pullback of its tangent bundle to M is trivial; since this pullback is the direct sum of the (intrinsically defined) tangent bundle on M, TM, which has dimension m, and of the normal bundle ν of the immersion i, which has dimension , for there to be a codimension k immersion of M, there must be a vector bundle of dimension k, ξ'k, standing in for the normal bundle ν, such that [...] is trivial. Conversely, given such a bundle, an immersion of M with this normal bundle is equivalent to a codimension 0 immersion of the total space of this bundle, which is an open manifold.|$|E
2500|$|Each tangent {{space of}} an n-dimensional {{manifold}} is an n-dimensional vector space. If U {{is an open}} contractible subset of [...] M, {{then there is a}} diffeomorphism from TU to U × Rn which restricts to a linear isomorphism from each tangent space T'x'U to {x} × Rn [...] As a manifold, however, TM is not always diffeomorphic to the product manifold M × Rn. When it is of the form M × Rn, then the tangent bundle is said to be trivial. Trivial tangent bundles usually occur for manifolds equipped with a 'compatible group structure'; for instance, in the case where the manifold is a Lie group. The tangent bundle of the unit circle is trivial because it is a Lie group (under multiplication and its natural differential structure). It is not true however that all spaces with trivial tangent bundles are Lie groups; manifolds which have a trivial tangent bundle are called <b>parallelizable.</b> Just as manifolds are locally modelled on Euclidean space, tangent bundles are locally modelled on U × Rn, where U is an open subset of Euclidean space.|$|E
50|$|A {{classical}} {{problem was}} to determine which of the spheres Sn are <b>parallelizable.</b> The zero-dimensional case S0 is trivially <b>parallelizable.</b> The case S1 is the circle, which is <b>parallelizable</b> as has already been explained. The hairy ball theorem shows that S2 is not <b>parallelizable.</b> However S3 is <b>parallelizable,</b> {{since it is the}} Lie group SU(2). The only other <b>parallelizable</b> sphere is S7; this was proved in 1958, by Michel Kervaire, and by Raoul Bott and John Milnor, in independent work. The <b>parallelizable</b> spheres correspond precisely to elements of unit norm in the normed division algebras of the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions, which allows one to construct a parallelism for each. Proving that other spheres are not <b>parallelizable</b> is more difficult, and requires algebraic topology.|$|E
