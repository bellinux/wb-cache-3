40|$|Inclusive <b>photoproton</b> spectra {{have been}} {{measured}} at five laboratory angles and two photon energies: 159 and 198 MeV. A quasi-monochromatic photon beam, obtained by positron annihilation in-flight on a liquid hydrogen target, was {{used and the}} photon spectrum was measured on-line by a pair spectrometer. The experimental proton spectra are well described by assuming a dominant photon absorption mechanism by np quasi-deuteron pairs in the nucleus, provided that rescattering effects are taken into account...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} noted in {{previous}} experiments that the ratio between the photoneutron and <b>photoproton</b> disintegration channels of 106 Cd might be considerably different from predictions of statistical models. The thresholds of these reactions differ by several MeV and the total astrophysical rate of photodisintegration of 106 Cd, which is mostly produced in photonuclear reactions during the p-process nucleosynthesis, might be noticeably different from the calculated value. In this work the bremsstrahlung beam of a 55. 6 [*]MeV microtron and the photon activation technique is used to measure yields of photonuclear reaction products on isotopically-enriched cadmium targets. The obtained results are compared with predictions of statistical models. The experimental yields are used to estimate photodisintegration reaction rates on 106 Cd, which are then used in nuclear network calculations {{to examine the effects}} of uncertainties on the produced abundences of p-nuclei...|$|E
40|$|Photonuclear {{processes}} {{can play}} an important role in the detection of nuclear materials. For this purpose, in this study, the (γ,n) and (γ,p) cross sections as functions of photon energy in medium weight nuclei were calculated. Calculations have been made of the cross sections for some of the (γ,n) and (γ,p) reactions in 28 Si, 32 S, 56 Fe and 63 Cu nuclei using the TALYS 1. 6 nuclear code with incident photons of 7 – 40 MeV. These calculated cross sections are compared with each other and with the earlier experimental results from the literature (EXFOR). Calculated results (56 Fe(γ,n), 63 Cu(γ,n), 56 Fe(γ,p) and 63 Cu(γ,p) cross sections) are in very good agreement with the experimental data. However, because of the Coulomb barrier, the <b>photoproton</b> cross sections for 32 S, 56 Fe and 63 Cu target nuclei, are smaller than the photoneutron cross sections...|$|E

40|$|The first {{measurements}} of the differential cross section from d({gamma},p) n up to 4. 0 GeV were performed at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF, formerly CEBAF). Bremsstrahlung photons from electron beam impinging on a copper radiator and a liquid deuterium target were employed for this experiment. The experiment was performed in Hall C where the <b>photoprotons</b> at forward angles in the center-of-mass were detected in the High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) and <b>photoprotons</b> at backward angles were detected in the Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS). The bremsstrahlung photon energy was reconstructed from the measured proton momentum and angle using the two-body kinematics. We report the cross section results at the proton center-of-mass angles of 37 {degree} and 90 {degree}. These results are in good agreement with previous lower energy measurements. The 90 {degree} data continue to show the constituent-counting-rule behavior up to 4 GeV. The results will be compared with models based on QCD {{as well as those}} based on meson-exchange theory...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{reported}} (1, 2) {{for the production of}} deuterons in the disintegration of copper and sulfur by bromsstrahlung before 24 Mev. energy. In the more direct of these investigations (1), the presence of a deuteron group was inferred on the basis of range and grain-density measurement in nuclear emulsions, and led to a ratio of photodeuterons to <b>photoprotons</b> cited as 0. 31 for copper. Due to the bearing which such a large deuteron group must have on the theory of photonuclear processes, an independent investigation of the photodeuteron yield from copper was undertaken...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of a proton from a halo-nucleus by absorption of a gamma-photon {{in the presence}} of a strong laser beam is studied. It is shown that the maximum value of the total cross section, when plotted as a function of the gamma-photon energy, is considerably larger than those obtained from experimental data of <b>photoproton</b> cross sections in stable nuclei. Furthermore, the angular distribution and the energy spectrum of the emitted proton exhibit a strong dependence on field geometries, polarizations and strengths. The second project deals with the photoproduction of pion pairs via multiphoton absorption from an intense x-ray laser wave colliding with an ultrarelativistic proton. By setting the pion-proton coupling constant to g_sigma approx. 7. 8, we reproduce the photoproduction cross section for the process gamma + p -> p + pi+ + pi- at 440 MeV as measured with the DAPHNE detector at MAMI. With this choice, we find reasonable agreement with the experimental data in the energy range from threshold up to approx. 480 MeV. The results was compared with other works on multiphoton mu+ mu- production. Although the muon mass is substantially smaller than the pion mass, pi+pi- production is found to be dominant in the frequency range between approximately 150 and 210 MeV...|$|E
40|$|Energy-transfer {{reactions}} {{are the key}} for living open systems, biological chemical networking, {{and the development of}} life-inspired nanoscale machineries. It is a challenge to find simple reliable synthetic chemical networks providing a localization of the time-dependent flux of matter. In this paper, we look to photocatalytic reaction on TiO 2 from different angles, focusing on proton generation and introducing a reliable, minimal-reagent-consuming, stable inorganic light-promoted proton pump. Localized illumination was applied to a TiO 2 surface in solution for reversible spatially controlled inorganic <b>photoproton</b> isometric cycling, the lateral separation of water-splitting reactions. The proton flux is pumped during the irradiation of the surface of TiO 2 and dynamically maintained at the irradiated surface area {{in the absence of any}} membrane or predetermined material structure. Moreover, we spatially predetermine a transient acidic pH value on the TiO 2 surface in the irradiated area with the feedback-driven generation of a base as deactivator. Importantly we describe how to effectively monitor the spatial localization of the process by the in situ scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) measurements for pH and the scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) for local photoelectrochemical studies without additional pH-sensitive dye markers. This work shows the great potential for time- and space-resolved water-splitting reactions for following the investigation of pH-stimulated processes in open systems with their flexible localization on a surface...|$|E

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The spectrum of <b>photoprotons</b> produced by 500 mev bremsstrahlung on hydrogen and deuterium has been measured at laboratory angles of 29. 7 [degrees], 41. 2 [degrees], and 51. 8 [degrees]. The protons were detected by a three scintillation counter telescope. The first counters were in coincidence {{and the third}} was in anticoincidence. Absorbers {{placed in front of}} and between the counters fixed the range of the particles observed, and the specific ionization in the front counter identified the protons. From the hydrogen data the [ [...] . ] cross section of hydrogen was obtained, which agrees with the results of Oakley and Walker (1). The contribution of the deuterium photodisintegration reaction was subtracted from the deuterium counting rate and the deuterium to hydrogen ratio of recoil protons from meson production was obtained. This ratio is also calculated from the deuterium [ [...] . ] and hydrogen [ [...] . ] cross sections, by means of the spectator model of the deuteron (photons interact with only one of the deuterium nucleons). The initial motion of the target nucleon in the deuteron is taken into account. The calculated ratio is in agreement with the measured ratio if one corrects the spectator model for the fact that 11 % of the mesons produced in deuterium are reabsorbed producing photodisintegration. The method of analysis developed is applied to other deuterium photomeson experiments...|$|R
