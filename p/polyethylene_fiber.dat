5000|$|Wicker is not {{actually}} a material, but {{a method of}} weaving. The word {{is said to be}} derived from the Scandinavian word [...] "vika" [...] which means [...] "To bend." [...] Traditionally, natural plant materials were used to manufacture a variety of different products including baskets, trays, indoor and outdoor furniture. Wicker was originally made from natural fibers, such as rattan, a material derived from the so-called rotan tree, a vine like plant. The term rattan is sometimes used interchangeably with wicker, but in fact depicts the fiber used to create the wicker work. Rattan is somewhat elastic and often used to produce baskets, hampers and chairs. The branch-like material is woven together for the purpose of constructing various wicker items. Resin wicker is a similar looking material. Synthetic <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fiber</b> resin wicker is generally durable, resistant to the sun's UV radiation and water.

40|$|We {{report the}} growth of ZnO {{nanowires}} on nonwoven <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fibers</b> using a simple hydrothermal method at a temperature below the boiling point of water. The ZnO nanowires were grown from seed ZnO nanoparticles affixed onto the fibers. The seed ZnO nanoparticles, with diameters of about 6 – 7 nm, were synthesized in isopropanol by reducing zinc acetate hydrate with sodium hydroxide. The growth process {{was carried out in}} a sealed chemical bath containing an equimolar solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylene tetramine at a temperature of 95 °C over a period of up to 20 h. The thickness and length of the nanowires can be controlled by using different concentrations of the starting reactants and growth durations. A 0. 5 mM chemical bath yielded nanowires with an average diameter of around 50 nm, while a 25 mM bath resulted in wires with a thickness of up to about 1 μm. The length of the wires depends both on the concentration of the precursor solution as well as the growth duration, and in 20 h, nanowires as long as 10 μm can be grown.

40|$|The {{influence}} of tensile deformation on gel-spun and hot-drawn ultrahigh molecular weight <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fibers</b> has been investigated. In high modulus <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fibers</b> no deformation energy {{is used to}} break chemical bonds during deformation, and flow is predominantly present next to elastic behavior. Flow is reversible after tensile deformation to small strains, but becomes irreversible when yielding occurs. Stress relaxation experiments {{were used to determine}} the elastic and flow contribution to tensile deformation. A simple quantitative relation could then be derived for the stress-strain curve that directly links yield stress to modulus. Experimental stress-strain curves could be reasonably described by this relation. Flow during tensile deformation is shown to be correlated with the introduction of the hexagonal phase in crystalline domains. A mechanism of flow is proposed in which, at first, tie molecules or intercrystalline bridges are pulled out of crystalline blocks (reversible), followed by the break-up of crystalline blocks through slip of microfibrils past each other (stress-induced melting, irreversible) ...|$|R

However, the mechanical strength of acrylic resin is not adequate for long-term clinical performance of dentures. Consequently, fracture is a com- mon clinical occurrence, which often occurs in the midline of denture base. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cold cure and heat cure acrylic resins, rein- forced with glass <b>fibers,</b> <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fibers,</b> and metal wire for denture base repair. Materials and Methods: Ninety specimens were prepared and allocated to nine groups. Ten specimens were included in the control group, and 80 were allocated to 8 experi- mental groups. In the experimental groups, the specimens were sectioned into two halves from the middle, and were then divided into two main groups: one group was repaired with heat cure acrylic resin, and the other with cold cure acrylic resin. Each group was di- vided into 4 subgroups: unreinforced, reinforced with glass <b>fibers,</b> <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fibers,</b> and metal wire.

The mean fracture toughness (MPa. m½) was compared by One-way ANOVA, followed by the Scheffe analysis. Fracture toughness between fiber-reinforced PMMA and BAC resin was compared by the independent samples t test. Results: For the controls, the fracture toughness for PMMA resin (0. 91) was significantly lower than for the BAC resin (1. 19). Glass fiber reinforcement produced significantly higher fracture toughness for both, PMMA (1. 48) and BAC (1. 82) resin, but the <b>Polyethylene</b> <b>fibers</b> did not (0. 95 for PMMA and 1. 23 for BAC resin).
