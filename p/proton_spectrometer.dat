More exclusive final states (for instance jet production in diffraction) add new understanding of the diffractive phenomena.

Calculations of the diffractive cross-section in the small Bjorken x limit have been performed. We have used the microscopic QCD formalism of distractive DIS to find higher twist corrections to the transverse structure functions and predict the diffractive slope and azimuthal asymmetries. We establish duality correspondence between diffraction into low-mass continuum and vector meson production, and calculate the diffractive contribution to the spin structure functions. * *This work received partial support from the US DOE grant DE- FG 02 - 96 ER 40994.
