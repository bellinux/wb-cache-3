40|$|<b>Project</b> manager <b>selection</b> is {{generally}} {{based on a}} resume review, an interview and verbal or written references. This three step selection process has not changed for many years, yet a global online survey conducted {{as part of this}} research shows a low level of stakeholder satisfaction with project managers selected using this process. Considering recent advances in our understanding of project manager effectiveness, improvements in staff selection processes and the impact of the project manager on stakeholder satisfaction, this is unsatisfactory. The objective of this research is to demonstrate that focusing on candidate skills, experience and qualities while conducting a more comprehensive and structured <b>project</b> manager <b>selection</b> process than the conventional three step process of a resume review, candidate interview and reference check results in higher stakeholder satisfaction with the project manager selected. Using a design science approach the author shows that the commonly used three step selection process is unsound due to the incidence of bias in each step and how the low level of satisfaction with current <b>project</b> manager <b>selection</b> processes can be improved. The analysis conducted in this study shows that skills, experience and qualities are the key dimensions that should be examined in order to select a project manager who will meet or exceed stakeholder expectations. This research also shows that a more comprehensive selection process consisting of a role analysis, resume review, personality assessment, structured interview and reference check results in higher stakeholder satisfaction with the selected project manager. These activities were combined into a Project Manager 5 Step Selection Process which was validated using contemporary theory, quantitative techniques and case studies. This research has improved our understanding of the dimensions which must be considered in <b>project</b> manager <b>selection.</b> It has also shown the essential selection techniques that should be used in <b>project</b> manager <b>selection.</b> These understandings have been used {{in the development of a}} practical tool that can be used to improve an organisationâs <b>project</b> manager <b>selection</b> processes.

40|$|Adequately {{considering}} {{interactions among}} IT/IS {{projects in the}} process of constructing an IT/IS project portfolio is an important requirement for IT/IS <b>project</b> portfolio <b>selection.</b> Especially interactions caused by the simultaneous utilization of scarce resources are very common and of high relevance for IT/IS <b>project</b> portfolio <b>selection</b> problems. In the literature, resource interactions are already incorporated into technically sophisticated optimization models, but it is assumed that the necessary input data are entirely available to the planner. The identification and assessment of resource interactions are not supported sufficiently and thus, the applicability of these optimization models in business practice is severely aggravated. In this article we extend the prevailing definitions of resource interactions in the literature by introducing allocation, performance, and sourcing interactions. Using these three types of interactions, we present a structured identification process for resource interactions among IT/IS projects, which is the main contribution of this article. Further, we present a tailored mathematical decision model that accounts for the identified interactions.
