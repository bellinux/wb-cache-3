2500|$|As Jordan, Price was {{famed for}} her surgically {{enhanced}} breasts. At 19 {{she had the}} first in a succession of breast-enhancement surgeries, increasing her natural 32B to a 32FF. Unhappy with her breasts from an early age and despite her family's objections, she went ahead with the procedure because she felt that, as a glamour model, she did not look [...] "as sexy or [...] womanly" [...] as other models. She has since had many enhancements, as well as reductions, on her breasts in addition to later having liposuction on her hips and thighs, fat implanted into her lips to boost her pout, and a nose job. She told a reporter, [...] "Some people may be famous for creating a <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpener.</b> I'm famous for my tits." [...] Price was later barred from Page Three in The Sun with their adoption of a policy to only use [...] "all natural" [...] models.|$|E
2500|$|Blackstone Partners {{carried out}} a review in 2006. They {{submitted}} a 113-page report in January 2007. Blackstone Partners were [...] "asked {{to determine if the}} facilities division had [...] "effective governance."" [...] The report showed [...] "high costs of repairs, lots of workers and spotty results, and managerial “silos” that made it hard for principals to figure out whom to approach to get a job done." [...] Blackstone Partners gave 43 recommendations in the report. The school board claims a few have been {{carried out a}}nd others are in the works. When surveyed about a wide range of topics, the worst result was the school board’s maintenance and construction division. Eighty percent of principals didn't believe the maintenance and construction division delivered good value for the money TDSB director Chris Spence [...] "To use a football analogy, we are trying to move the yardstick. There is no quick fix." [...] The Toronto Star reported that in recent investigation showed little has changed since that review. A high school principal [...] "raised questions about the $143 cost of installing a <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpener</b> and the $19,000 cost of installing a sign on the school’s front lawn." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} case. From it {{he took a}} letter-knife, a <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpener,</b> a glass globe paperweight, a box of thumb tacks, a stapler, some clips, a plastic ashtray, and some things Thacher could not identify. He placed the objects {{in a row in}} front of him on the table top. Then he closed the sample case.|$|E
50|$|Auto-stop {{electric}} <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> {{are able}} to sense when {{the tip of the}} pencil is long enough and then stop. In basic automatic <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> the lead may become too long and break, and so users must be careful to time the action.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} in {{scissors}} and rulers, Westcott extended its product line with other office {{tools such as}} paper trimmers, <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> math kits, etc. The Westcott iPoint family of electric <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> is Acme United’s best-selling product with sales reaching $11 million in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> were {{introduced}} in 1940. They work on the same principle as manual ones, but the cylindrical cutter is (or cutters are) rotated by an electric motor. Some electric <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> are powered by batteries rather than being plugged into a building's electrical system, making them more portable.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{development}} of dedicated <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> a <b>pencil</b> was sharpened by whittling it with a knife. <b>Pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> made this task much easier and gave a more uniform result. Some specialized types of pencils, such as carpenter's pencils, are still usually sharpened with a knife, due to their flat shape. However, since the 2000s, a fixed-blade device with a rotatable collar has become available.|$|R

50|$|In May 2011, tourism {{officials}} in Logan, Ohio put on display, in its regional welcome center, hundreds of <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> {{which had been}} collected by Rev. Paul Johnson, an Ohio minister who died in 2010. Johnson, a World War II veteran, had kept his {{collection of more than}} 3,400 sharpeners in a small shed, outside his home in Carbon Hill in southeast Ohio. He had started collecting after his wife gave him a few <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> as a gift in the late 1980s. He kept them organized into categories, including cats, Christmas, and Disneyland. The oldest was 105 years old.|$|R
50|$|Other {{implements}} indirectly {{associated with}} writing include erasers for pen and <b>pencil,</b> <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> <b>pencil</b> extenders, inkwells, blotter paper, and rulers and related drawing instruments.

50|$|French {{mathematician}} Bernard Lassimonne {{applied for}} the first patent (French patent #2444) on pencil sharpeners in 1828, {{but it was not}} until 1847 that the <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpener</b> in its recognizable modern form was invented by fellow Frenchman Thierry des Estivaux. The first American <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpener</b> was patented by Walter K. Foster of Bangor, Maine in 1855. Electric pencil sharpeners for offices have been made since at least 1917.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to knives, blades and tools, X-Acto produces office supplies including <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> paper trimmers, staplers and hole punches. X-Acto sharpeners are electric, battery or manual. X-Acto has {{three types of}} trimmers: razor, rotary, and guillotine.|$|R
50|$|But that wasn’t {{the end for}} Westcott. It {{had become}} such a {{well-known}} brand that Acme United started using the name {{on a wide variety}} of school and office products such as trimmers, <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> erasers, math tools, craft tools, etc.|$|R
5000|$|One {{effect of}} this was that [...] "during World War II rotary <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> were outlawed in Britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood, and pencils had to be {{sharpened}} in the more conservative manner - with knives." ...|$|R

50|$|The axes of {{all gears}} are usually parallel, but for special cases like <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> and differentials, {{they can be}} placed at an angle, {{introducing}} elements of bevel gear (see below). Further, the sun, planet carrier and ring axes are usually coaxial.|$|R
50|$|Because Westcott {{was such}} a strong brand, Acme United started selling dozens of other school and office items, like scissors, <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> and paper {{trimmers}} under the Westcott name. Nowadays, Westcott sells 60 to 80 million scissors and 15 to 18 million rulers worldwide annually.|$|R
50|$|As the {{majority}} of students in public schools are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for the right-handed, from <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> to scissors to desks. The consequences to left-handed students can vary from decreased academic performance or physical ailments to nothing at all.|$|R

The major competitor in the safety category is Johnson & Johnson.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the Great Depression, Hunt reduced operations, {{recovering}} {{with the}} development of the gold-plated stainless steel pen, which was boosted by the company's invention of a special patented tip. In 1942 regulations on stainless steel stopped production of <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners</b> and specialty metal items. The sale of silver alloy nibs kept the company viable during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|Normal pencils, chalk, and crayons {{all share}} the {{characteristic}} that they cannot [...] "run out". The useful life of these implements is {{closely linked to}} their physical existence.

50|$|Westcott is {{also known}} for its line of iPoint {{electric}} <b>pencil</b> <b>sharpeners.</b> The original iPoint, the iPoint Evolution, and the iPoint Orbit all won a Good Design Award from the Chicago Athenaeum, Museum of Architecture and Design in the office products category.
