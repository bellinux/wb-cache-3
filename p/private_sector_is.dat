Ohio has a developing technology sector and {{is home to}} over 28,000 employers that employ nearly 820,000 people; its rate of technology operations is 14% higher than the US average. Between 2006 and 2014, Ohio's employment {{is expected to grow}} by 290,700 jobs, or approximately 5.0%. Personal income grew an average of 3.1% in 2008. About 659,900 people are employed in Ohio's manufacturing sector. Major manufacturing employers include AK Steel, Timken, and Honda. In 2007, foreign-based companies employed 229,500 Ohioans, led by Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|The {{tendency}} for research to {{flow from the}} public to the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by Ruben Sinisterra, {{a researcher at the}} Federal University of Minas Gerais who has been developing drugs to alleviate hypertension. Brazilian universities now have the capacity to develop nanoscale materials for drug delivery, he says, but ‘our domestic pharmaceutical companies don’t have internal capabilities in research and development, so we have to work with them to push new products and processes out to market’.|$|E
25|$|The lack of pledged {{funds and}} {{potential}} {{reliance on the}} <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> controversial and has been criticized by developing countries. Though the Green Climate Fund is an important institution for ensuring {{the implementation of the}} Paris Agreement, its future financial viability is by no means guaranteed. The USA had pledged $ 3 billion, of which $ 2 billion are outstanding. Since US President Donald Trump has announced his nation’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June, this money is unlikely to flow in the next few years. Some observers worry that other major donor countries – including Japan, Britain and Germany – will not make up for the shortfall.|$|E

25|$|A {{major step}} {{has been the}} government's {{promotion}} of NGOs, which are a new concept in China. Many of the larger domestic groups are actually government funded, and those not affiliated with the government are required {{to go through a}} complicated registration procedure to be officially endorsed, although there might be a relaxation of these policies in the future. The presence of international NGOs is also increasing. The ability of NGOs to work with high-risk groups, especially those that engage in behaviors deemed to be illegal or immoral, and to provide care and outreach where overstretched health services cannot, is recognized. The <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> also being encouraged to undertake prevention and education activities.|$|E
25|$|BOT contracts. The {{most common}} form of private sector {{participation}} in water supply and sanitation in China is through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts where the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> in charge of large upstream or downstream infrastructure without being directly involved in serving users. Experience with BOT contracts has been mixed. For example, the local government of Lianjiang had the 100,000 m3/day Tangshan water treatment plant built by SUEZ under a BOT contract in 1999. However, the water demand had been grossly overestimated, so that the plant lay idle while the local government had to pay for substantial minimum volumes without using them, which evidently pushed up tariffs. After lengthy negotiations, the local government finally bought back the plant in 2009.|$|E

The <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> the least active player in research activity in Morocco. The REMINEX Corporation (Research on Mines and Exploitation) is the most prominent research performer in the private sector, and is a subsidiary of Omnium Nord Africain, the largest privately owned mining group in Morocco. The most recent figures available {{on the number of}} research staff in Morocco are those provided by the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education, Professional Training and Scientific Research in its 2002–2003 annual report. According to this report, Morocco had 17 390 research staff in 2002–2003. The majority (58%) were employed in the university sector.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 Iran’s {{forest area}} totaled about 11 million hectares, {{approximately}} 7 {{percent of the}} country’s surface area. Adequate rainfall and a favorable climate have created 1.5 million hectares of dense forest in the Caspian region. The remainder is distributed among western forests (3.6 million hectares), southern forests (434,000 hectares), desert forests (620,000 hectares), and forests scattered in other locations. Supervised by the Department of Natural Resources, the Caspian forests produced 820,000 cubic meters of timber products in 2004, more than 90 percent of which was for industrial use. The largest and most valuable woodland areas are in the Caspian region and the northern slopes of the Elburz Mts., {{where many of the}} forests are commercially exploitable and include both hardwoods and softwoods. Although forests and pastures are nationalized and 12 percent of forested land is nominally protected, forest destruction by the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> routine. Limited forest areas, mismanagement, and destruction have compelled Iran to import lumber and wood products. In addition, forest fires destroy 20,000 hectares of forest area each year. Between 1954 and 2004, an estimated 41 percent of Iran’s forest land was lost. According to the former director of Iran’s Department of Environment (Iran), the rate of destruction of forestland amounts to 100,000 hectares per year. The cutting of trees is rigidly controlled by the government, which also has a reforestation program.|$|E
