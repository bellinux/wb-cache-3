25|$|A {{four-stroke}} cylinder {{produces a}} power stroke only every other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being <b>pumping</b> <b>losses.</b> This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher volumetric efficiency and lower <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the four-stroke cycle in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|E
25|$|Designing Stirling engine heat {{exchangers}} is {{a balance between}} high heat transfer with low viscous <b>pumping</b> <b>losses,</b> and low dead space (unswept internal volume). Engines that operate at high powers and pressures require that {{heat exchangers}} on the hot side be made of alloys that retain considerable strength at high temperatures and that don't corrode or creep.|$|E
25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E

50|$|Hydroelectric dams with {{reservoirs}} can {{be operated}} to provide peak generation {{at times of}} peak demand. Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high. The net effect is similar to pumped storage, but without the <b>pumping</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E

40|$|Internal {{exhaust gas}} {{recirculation}} (EGR) is an effective strategy to reduce <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> and improve fuel economy using mixture dilution than traditional external EGR. In this paper, the internal EGR was obtained by exhaust gas trap (EGT) using the negative valve overlap (NVO) method. The effects of EGT on the part-load characteristics, including energy conversion, combustion and emission characteristics were studied in a direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engine. The experimental results showed that EGT can save fuel consumption by 5 - 16 % due to reduced <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> and improved combustion efficiency, while it also can increase the engine cyclic variation and combustion duration. The engine cyclic variation increases with increasing of the EGT level; this can be overcome by advancing spark timing to stabilize the combustion. The flame propagation and compression combustion occurred simultaneously when high EGT level and high compression ratio were adopted; the combined combustion can reduce combustion duration but increase the engine cyclic variation. The stratified mixture using the two-stage injection strategy can reduce the engine cyclic variation and shorten the combustion duration so as to improve the thermal efficiency. Moreover, the second injection mass ratio and timing take an important effect on the combustion and emission characteristics in DISI engines using EGT strategy.

2500|$|By comparison, a {{turbocharger}} {{does not}} place a direct mechanical {{load on the}} engine, although turbochargers place exhaust back pressure on engines, increasing <b>pumping</b> <b>losses.</b> This is more efficient because while the increased back pressure taxes the piston exhaust stroke, much of the energy driving the turbine {{is provided by the}} still-expanding exhaust gas that would otherwise be wasted as heat through the tailpipe. In contrast to supercharging, the primary disadvantage of turbocharging is what is referred to as [...] "lag" [...] or [...] "spool time". This is the time between the demand for an increase in power (the throttle being opened) and the turbocharger(s) providing increased intake pressure, and hence increased power.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{effect of}} {{regeneration}} in a Stirling engine {{is to increase}} the thermal efficiency by 'recycling' internal heat that would otherwise pass through the engine irreversibly.

5000|$|Early {{intake valve}} closing (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by closing the intake valve earlier than normal. This involves closing the intake valve midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake valve closing greatly reduces <b>pumping</b> <b>losses.</b> [...] Studies have shown early intake valve closing reduces <b>pumping</b> <b>losses</b> by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% at partial load conditions. A possible downside to early intake valve closing is that it significantly lowers {{the temperature of the}} combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions.|$|E
50|$|Pumping brakes {{are often}} used where a pump is already part of the machinery.

50|$|The free-piston linear generator's great {{versatility}} {{comes from}} {{the absence of a}} crankshaft, removing a great <b>pumping</b> <b>loss,</b> giving the engine a further degree of freedom. The combustion can be two-stroke engine or four-stroke engine. However, a four-stroke requires a much higher intermediate storage of energy, the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, to propel the piston through the four strokes. With the absence of a crankshaft, a gas spring would need to power the piston through the intake, compression and exhaustion stokes. Hence the reason why most of the current research focuses on the two-strokes cycle.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{a liquid}} pump can't simply draw air. The feed {{line of the}} pump and the {{internal}} body surrounding the pumping mechanism must first be filled with the liquid that requires pumping: An operator must introduce liquid into the system to initiate the pumping. This is called priming the <b>pump.</b> <b>Loss</b> of prime is usually due to ingestion of air into the pump. The clearances and displacement ratios in pumps for liquids, whether thin or more viscous, usually cannot displace air due to its compressibility.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{consumer}} and legislation requirements, big investments on key technology strategies {{have been made to}} ensure fuel consumption is reduced. Recent technologies for gasoline engines are lean combustion technologies (including direct injection and homogenous charged compression ignition), optimizing intake and exhaust valve timing with valve lift and also cylinder deactivation system (CDA) have been practised to improve the engine efficiency. In this study, the purpose is to investigate the engine behaviour when running at different cylinder deactivation (CDA) strategies. One-dimensional engine model software called GT-Power is used to predict the engine performances. There are total of five strategies that have been studied which include normal mode, spark plug off mode, cylinder deactivation mode, intake normal with exhaust off mode, and intake off with exhaust normal mode. Engine performance outputs of each strategy are predicted and compared at BMEP of 3 bars with engine speed of 2500 rpm. Also, the effect of CDA strategies on in-cylinder pressure and <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> are performed. The study shows that all of these cylinder deactivation strategies are significantly reduce the <b>pumping</b> <b>loss</b> (PMEP) and fuel consumption, furthermore increasing the thermal efficiency of the engine.

50|$|MIVEC {{switches}} {{to the higher}} cam profile as engine speed increases, and drops back to the lower cam profile as engine speed decreases. The reduced valve overlap in low-speed mode provides stable idling, while accelerated timing of the intake valve's closing reduces backflow to improve volumetric efficiency, which helps increase engine output as well as reduce lift friction. High-speed mode {{takes advantage of the}} pulsating intake effect created by the mode's high lift and retarded timing of intake valve closure.

40|$|Ground couple {{heat pump}} {{performance}} is {{to a great}} extent depending on the GHEX (Ground Heat Exchangers), the ground loop. The conventional GHEX for vertical bore holes looks as a U when it is installed in the ground and therefore called a U-loop. In order to improve thermal performance expressed in terms of W per installed boreholes meter sometime double U-loops are installed in the borehole. However, a conventional U-loop doesn’t utilize the investment that the borehole constitutes in the very best way. It has to operate at high mass flow, i. e. turbulent flow, in order to offer high heat transfer performance from the fluid in the pipe to the ground. High flows means high <b>pump</b> <b>losses</b> and hence electric consumption. If the GHEX could operate with lower flows, preferably in the laminar flow regime the <b>pump</b> <b>losses</b> could be reduced considerably. Further more, in the conventional U-loop there is a heat transfer between the flow upward and the flow downwards which reduce heat transfer from the fluid in the U-loop to the ground. There are new ideas coming up regarding more efficient GHEX. The most promising type of GHEX seams to be a type that is often called coaxial pipe. This paper describes a recent developing work on such type of coaxial GEHX, which is also characterized by having one of the legs thermal insulated. 2.
