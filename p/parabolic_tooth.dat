40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of both linear and <b>parabolic</b> <b>tooth</b> profile modification on the dynamic response of low-contact-ratio spur gears. The effect of {{the total amount of}} modification and the length of the modification zone were studied at various loads and speeds to find the optimal profile modification for minimal dynamic loading. Design charts consisting of normalized maximum dynamic load curves were generated for gear systems operated at various loads and with different tooth profile modification. An optimum profile modification can be determined from these design charts to minimize the dynamic loads of spur gear systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} aided design {{procedure is}} presented for minimizing dynamic effects on high contact ratio gears by modification of the tooth profile. Both linear and <b>parabolic</b> <b>tooth</b> profile modifications of high contact ratio gears under various loading conditions are examined and compared. The effects of {{the total amount of}} modification and the length of the modification zone were systematically studied at various loads and speeds to find the optimum profile design for minimizing the dynamic load and the tooth bending stress. Parabolic profile modification is preferred over linear profile modification for high contact ratio gears because of its lower sensitivity to manufacturing errors. For parabolic modification, a greater amount of modification at the tooth tip and a longer modification zone are required. Design charts are presented for high contact ratio gears with various profile modifications operating under a range of loads. A procedure is illustrated for using the charts to find the optimum profile design...|$|E
