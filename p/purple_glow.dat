6000|$|In {{the blue}} mist {{spreading}} from twisted threads that stood upright in the bowls of pipes, the forecastle appeared as vast as a hall. Between the beams a heavy cloud stagnated; and the lamps surrounded by halos burned each {{at the core}} of a <b>purple</b> <b>glow</b> in two lifeless flames without rays. Wreaths drifted in denser wisps. Men sprawled about on the deck, sat in negligent poses, or, bending a knee, drooped with one shoulder against a bulkhead. Lips moved, eyes flashed, waving arms made sudden eddies in the smoke. The murmur of voices seemed to pile itself higher and higher as if unable to run out quick enough through the narrow doors. The watch below in their shirts, and striding on long white legs, resembled raving somnambulists; while now and then one of the watch on deck would rush in, looking strangely over-dressed, listen a moment, fling a rapid sentence into the noise and run out again; but a few remained near the door, fascinated, and with one ear turned to the deck. [...] "Stick together, boys," [...] roared Davis. Belfast tried to make himself heard. Knowles grinned in a slow, dazed way. A short fellow with a thick clipped beard kept on yelling periodically:--"Who's afeard? Who's afeard?" [...] Another one jumped up, excited, with blazing eyes, sent out a string of unattached curses and sat down quietly. Two men discussed familiarly, striking one another's breast in turn, to clinch arguments. Three others, with their heads in a bunch, spoke all together with a confidential air, and {{at the top of their}} voices. It was a stormy chaos of speech where intelligible fragments tossing, struck the ear. One could hear:--"In the last ship"--"Who cares? Try it on any one of us if-------." ...|$|E
6000|$|I shall always {{remember}} the first I took: out of the Porta del Popolo, to where the Ponte Molle, whose single arch sustains a weight of historic tradition, compels the sallow Tiber to flow between its four great-mannered ecclesiastical statues, over {{the crest of the}} hill and along the old posting-road to Florence. It was mild midwinter, the season peculiarly of colour on the Roman Campagna; and the light was full of that mellow <b>purple</b> <b>glow,</b> that tempered intensity, which haunts the after-visions of those who have known Rome like the memory of some supremely irresponsible pleasure. An hour away I pulled up and at the edge of a meadow gazed away for some time into remoter distances. Then and there, it seemed to me, I measured the deep delight of knowing the Campagna. But I saw more things in it than I can easily tell. The country rolled away around me into slopes and dells of long-drawn grace, chequered with purple and blue and blooming brown. The lights and shadows were at play on the Sabine Mountains--an alternation of tones so exquisite as to be conveyed only by some fantastic comparison to sapphire and amber. In the foreground a contadino in his cloak and peaked hat jogged solitary on his ass; and here and there in the distance, among blue undulations, some white village, some grey tower, helped deliciously to make the picture the typical [...] "Italian landscape" [...] of old-fashioned art. It was so bright and yet so sad, so still and yet so charged, to the supersensuous ear, with the murmur of an extinguished life, that you could only say it was intensely and adorably strange, could only impute to the whole overarched scene an unsurpassed secret for bringing tears of appreciation to no matter how ignorant-- archaeologically ignorant--eyes. To ride once, in these conditions, is of course to ride again and to allot to the Campagna a generous share of the time one spends in Rome.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. F. R. Pickersgill's [...] "Contest of Beauty" [...] (No. 515.), and Mr. Uwins's [...] "Vineyard Scene in the South of France," [...] were, after Mr. Mulready's works, {{among the}} most {{interesting}} pieces {{of color in the}} Exhibition. The former, very rich and sweet in its harmonies, and especially happy in its contrasts of light and dark armor; nor less in the fancy of the little Love who, losing his hold of the orange boughs, was falling ignominiously without having time to open his wings. The latter was a curious example of what I have described as abstraction of color. Strictly true or possible it was not; a vintage is usually a dusty and dim-looking procedure; but there were poetry and feeling in Mr. Uwins's idealization of the sombre black of the veritable grape into a luscious ultramarine <b>purple,</b> <b>glowing</b> among the green leaves like so much painted glass. The figures were bright and graceful in the extreme and most happily grouped. Little else that could be called color was to be seen upon the walls of the Exhibition, {{with the exception of the}} smaller works of Mr. Etty. Of these, the single head, [...] "Morning Prayer," [...] (No. 25.), and the [...] "Still Life" [...] (No. 73.), deserved, allowing for their peculiar aim, the highest praise. The larger subjects, more especially the St. John, were wanting in the merits peculiar to the painter; and in other respects it is alike painful and useless to allude to them. A very important and valuable work of Mr. Harding was placed, as usual, where its merits could be but ill seen, and where its chief fault, a feebleness of color in the principal light on the distant hills, was apparent. It was one of the very few views of the year which were transcripts, nearly without exaggeration, of the features of the localities.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{observers}} {{have made a}} connection between star jelly and the Paramount movie The Blob, in which a gelatinous monster slime falls from space.

5000|$|The {{gameplay}} of Undying {{in general}} follows the precepts of the first-person shooter genre. The game simulates the main character's (Patrick Galloway's) {{point of view}} for the player, who uses a variety of weapons to defeat enemies within the game while making his or her way {{through a series of}} levels. As with most FPSs, Galloway has a certain amount of health, represented by a cross symbol and corresponding number at the bottom center-left of the screen. Each time the player is hurt by an enemy the health number is continually reduced until it reaches zero, at which point Galloway dies - an event which is usually marked by a unique to each enemy type third-person cut scene which shows his gruesome final moments. To prevent this, health can be replenished when low using health packs. Patrick's maximum health can also be increased when using the alternate mode of a certain weapon, however it drains quickly back to the standard amount of health. Another aspect of the gameplay of Undying - and one which makes it somewhat similar in terms of ambience to traditional role-playing video games - is that along with its set of offensive weapons, the player is able to use a wide range of magical spells. Spells consume a certain amount of Galloway's magical energy, or [...] "Mana", which is represented by a flask icon and corresponding number on the bottom center-right of the screen. This energy slowly regenerates itself over time. Magical tatto pickups called [...] "Arcane Whorls" [...] permanently increase mana regeneration rate, while amulets called [...] "Mana Wells" [...] increase maximum mana by 10 up to 200. Once the player acquires a spell, it may be boosted in power each time the gamer finds an [...] "Amplifier Stone", which are <b>purple</b> <b>glowing</b> crystals scattered throughout levels of the game. The player can simultaneously wield weapons in his left hand and cast magical spells with his right; the power of both the weapons and the spells increase accordingly as the game progresses.|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{suggests}} that the universe of the Time Traveller is not ours, but a slightly different one, coherent with Wells novels (whereas Nebogipfel's original timeline created by {{the publication of the}} time traveller's first travel in The Time-Machine, according to what he relates of it to the time traveller, appears to be much more similar to ours). Nuclear energy is produced by a material called carolinum and not uranium. Carolinum allows plattnerite to be produced relatively easily.

A cyclotron operator prepared radioactive sodium for an experiment, and Kamen was surprised that the resulting sodium had a <b>purple</b> <b>glow,</b> indicating {{it was much more}} intensely radioactive than could be produced in a cyclotron. Kamen recognized immediately that the sodium must have been irradiated in a nuclear reactor elsewhere in the facility. Because of wartime secrecy, he had not been aware of the reactor's existence.
