Student Constables do not serve as the university's primary security service as they are legally not peace officers, nor are they registered as a private security service under the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. The university's administration operates its own security service which is registered in Ontario as a private security service. As of March 2012, the Student Constables are funded through a mandatory $10 fee levied on undergraduates annually by the AMS.|$|E

It assigns <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> other <b>peers</b> who are 'close in IP' to its neighbors prefix range in an attempt to use locality.

40|$|We {{consider}} a model with two backbones and {{a finite number}} of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) connected to the backbones. ISPs decide on private peering agreements, comparing the benefits of private <b>peering</b> <b>to</b> costs. Intra-backbone <b>peering</b> refers <b>to</b> <b>peering</b> between ISPs connected <b>to</b> the same backbone, whereas inter-backbone <b>peering</b> refers <b>to</b> <b>peering</b> between ISPs connected <b>to</b> different backbones. We formulate the model as a two-stage game. In the first stage, ISPs decide on peering agreements. In the second stage they compete in prices a la Bertrand. We examine the effects of peering on profits of ISPs. Peering affects profits through two channels - reduction of backbone congestion which we call the symmetric effect and ability to send traffic bypassing or circumventing congested backbones which we call the asymmetric effect. The first has a negative or ambiguous effect while the second has a generally positive effect on firm profits. The two often act against each other making the net effect ambiguous. We also conduct simulations <b>to</b> determine pairwise stable <b>peering</b> configurations in a six-provider model and find that there is a paucity of inter-backbone peering in asymmetric settings.

The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments. For people suffering from life altering diseases, PatientsLikeMe offers its members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and research patient data related to their condition. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. SparkPeople offers community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In a {{peer-to-peer}} inference system, each peer can reason locally but {{can also}} solicit some of its acquaintances, which are peers sharing part of its vocabulary. In this paper, we consider peerto-peer inference systems in which the local theory of each peer {{is a set of}} propositional clauses defined upon a local vocabulary. An important characteristic of peer-to-peer inference systems is that the global theory (the union of all peer theories) is not known (as opposed to partition-based reasoning systems). The contribution of this paper is twofold. We provide the first consequence finding algorithm in a peer-to-peer setting: it is anytime and computes consequences gradually from the solicited <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> that are more and more distant. We exhibit a sufficient condition on the acquaintance graph of the peer-to-peer inference system for guaranteeing the completeness of this algorithm. We also present first experimental results that are promising. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture for distributed computational economies based on peer-to-peer bartering. Our architecture {{is based on}} the position that computational economies ought to be bootstrapped based on a layer of simple and robust resource exchange. The architecture is comprised of three pieces: (i) resource discovery, (ii) secure resource peering, and (iii) bartering. Together, these pieces address the end-to-end problem of describing, discovering, and exchanging distributed resources in a secure and decentralized manner. Key in our approach is the ability to securely exchange resources across delegated paths of trust. This, combined with secure resource <b>peering,</b> allows <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> engage in resource exchange with directly connected <b>peers,</b> in addition <b>to</b> <b>peers</b> whom they do not have direct bartering relationships with. Given the bartering economy as a base, we envision an evolutionary path towards more complex scenarios by layering richer functionality at higher layers...|$|R
