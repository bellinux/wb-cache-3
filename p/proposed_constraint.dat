40|$|Nonnegative matrix {{factorization}} (NMF) is an algorithm {{used for}} blind source separation. It {{has been reported}} that NMF algorithms can be utilized as an effective means to extract features from a motor-imagery related EEG spectrum, which is often used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). BCI systems enable users to control electrical devices without moving their body parts, and are often tasked with interpreting a user’s intentions through motor-imagery related EEG features. In other words, they require EEG signal classification in order to reflect user intentions. In this study, constraints are placed on NMF and kernel NMF (KNMF) algorithms to increase the discriminability between two classes by increasing the energy difference between their potential sources in a spectral EEG signal. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, the IDIAP database, which contains the motor-imagery related EEG spectrum of three subjects, was adopted to test the discrimination between two classes. Using the database, the classification accuracy of the <b>proposed</b> <b>constraint</b> was 75 %, which was 7 % higher than what was obtained through NMF without a constraint.

40|$|In {{the design}} activity, part {{geometry}} is assembled {{together to create}} an assembly model. The number of parts can range from a few tens to a few millions and typically the relationships among them construct a closed-loop with under-constrained states in a constraint graph. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust 3 D constraint solving method for determining part positions in closed-loop assemblies with under-constrained states. The <b>proposed</b> <b>constraint</b> solving process consists of two steps: 1) cut operation and 2) paste operation. In the cut operation, the closed-loop constraint graph is first converted into an open-kinematic chain graph by removing a 'cut' constraint and determining kinematic joints from assembly constraints. Then, an initial kinematic configuration satisfying all the assembly constraints of the open-chain graph is computed incrementally. In the paste operation, the final assembly configuration of the closed-loop assembly is determined by pasting the 'cut' constraint and by simultaneously reconfiguring the initial kinematic chain that satisfies the 'cut' constraint. The <b>proposed</b> <b>constraint</b> solving method combines the simplicity of an incremental solving approach with the universality of a simultaneous solving approach. Thus, the proposed approach can maximize the efficiency and robustness of an assembly constraint solver...|$|E

Earlier, we <b>proposed</b> <b>constraints</b> on tolerance and segregation parameters for a phase-coding approach, within cortical circuits, to address this question [21]. The purpose of the present paper is twofold. First, we conduct simulation studies that explore the effectiveness of the <b>proposed</b> <b>constraints.</b> Second, we place the studies in a broader context of synchrony-driven recruitment learning [56, 71] which brings together von der Malsburg’s temporal binding [75] and Feldman’s recruitment learning [10]. A network based on Valiant’s neuroidal architecture [71] is used to implement synchronydriven recruitment learning. Complementing similar approaches, we use a continuous-time learning procedure allowing computation with spiking neurons. The viability of the proposed binding scheme is investigated by conducting simulation studies which examine binding errors. In the simulation, binding errors cause the formation of illusory conjunctions among features belonging to separate objects. Our results indicate that when tolerance and segregation parameters obey our <b>proposed</b> <b>constraints,</b> the sets of correct bindings are dominant over sets of spurious bindings in reasonable operating conditions. We also improve the stability of the recruitment method in deep hierarchies for use in limited size structures suitable for computer simulations.
