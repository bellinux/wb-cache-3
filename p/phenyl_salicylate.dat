40|$|O/W {{emulsions}} as parenteral formulation vehicles {{have the}} capacity to stabilize drug substances prone to hydrolysis. When using emulsion formulations the knowledge of the physical chemical parameters governing the degradation kinetics of an active ingredient is important. Using kinetic measurements in this thesis, essential parameters were studied with respect to their influence on the hydrolysis of <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> as model drug. The studies were designed stepwise leading from one-phase systems over two-layer oil over water systems to emulsion systems. On the first stage the hydrolysis of <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> was observed in separate phases: No degradation was detected in the oil-phase, whereas the hydrolysis in the aqueous-phase was found to be accelerated by non-ionic isotonizing agents typically used in parenteral fat emulsions. Using different oil phases the two-layer system initially served the determination of the distribution coefficients of the model drug and its degradation products between the oil and the water phase. The measurements also revealed that the material transport of the drug from the oil to the water phase was fast compared to its hydrolysis. Hence the concentration of <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> in the aqueous phase remained constant and the chemical decomposition followed a zero order kinetic. Approaching the conditions of an emulsion the two-layer system was then used to study the influence of the emulsifier lecithin on the degradation kinetics. It was shown that an increase in the emulsifier content afforded an increase of drug concentration in the aqueous phase thus the degradation rate. The interfacial layer of emulsifier did not act as a diffusion barrier. Neither did the viscosity of different oils, which may reduce the diffusion velocity of <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate,</b> influence the degradation rate. The increase of the interfacial area of an emulsion system compared to the two-layer system led to a faster degradation of <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate.</b> The use of tocopherol as oil phase with extremely high viscosity or an interfacial layer condensed by means of cholesterol confirmed for the emulsion system that the degradation rate of <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> could not be reduced significantly by impeding the mass transport through the viscosity of the oil or an interfacial barrier. Only when using so called nanostructured lipid carriers, i. e. a solid lipophilic phase dispersed in water, a system with significantly decelerated hydrolysis was found. The kind of both oil and emulsifier has impact on the degradation kinetics. The distribution of <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> and the emulsifier between the two phases govern the concentration of the drug and hence its degradation rate in the aqueous phase.

The study has concentrated on the elucidation and comparison of molecular dynamics of salol subjected to different local environments, namely in bulk, in a dilute CCl 4 solution, and under spatial confinement in nanoporous sol-gel glasses. Contrary to most of the previous picosecond dynamics studies performed by means of Raman line profile analysis, we have employed in this paper a novel approach that enables the extraction of valuable short-time dynamics information through spectra fitting in the frequency domain. As a result, strongly overlapping vibrational lines can be put in focus. The analysis has shown a systematic dependence of vibrational relaxation on the local environment around a salol molecule. The magnitude of the vibrational relaxation time τ V decreases in the sequence dilute solution [...] >bulk liquid [...] >confined liquid, indicating the modification of interactions when passing from the dilute solution to confined geometries.

The changes in second moments of vibrations as well as the observed blueshifts of the Raman peaks in confinement suggest the strengthening of repulsion between salol molecules in the restricted space.

The method is sensitive enough to detect trace amounts (~µM/L) of the product generated from cross reactivity between the drugs and the vehicle. The developed method also allows analysis of various topical products containing salicylate and nicotinate esters in their formulations. Applying this method, the degradation profiles of salicylates, nicotinates, p-hydroxy benzoate, o-methoxy benzoate and aspirin prodrugs in alkaline media are determined. The profile for alkyl salicylate degradation {{is found to be}} first order (A [...] -? B) When the alcoholic radical {{is similar to that of}} the ester. In alcohol having a radical different from that of the ester function, the degradation is found to proceed through competitive transesterification and hydrolysis. The intermediates are identified following synthesis and isolation. The rate and extent of transesterification depends on the proportion of alcohol present in the system. Equations are presented to model the time profiles of reactant and product concentration. The reactions are base catalysed and the predominant pathway involves a concerted solvent attack upon the salicylate anion. Competitive hydrolysis of both ester components also follows this mechanism at moderate pH values but rates increase under strongly alkaline conditions as direct hydroxide attack becomes significant. In contrast, transesterification is independent of base concentration once full ionization is accomplished. The competitive hydrolysis is modelled using equations involving the dielectric constant of the medium. A range of other esters are also shown to undergo base-catalysed transesterification. In non-alcoholic solution <b>phenyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> undergoes a concentration-dependent oligomerisation which yields salsalate among the products.

Research efforts are directed towards finding cheap and efficient UV-absorbers to protect such light sensitive materials. Phenyl salicylates and hydroxybenzophenones constitute families of UV-absorber compounds, and this has necessitated this research.

The study of chemotherapeutic efficiency was carried out on the model of localized purulent Staphylococcus infection on albino mice weighting 14 – 16 g. S. aureus ATCC 25923 strains were used as infectious agents. The contamination was performed subcutaneously to the right side of mice’s skin after depilation. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: the 1 st group – infected mice without treatment (control); the 2 nd group – infected mice treated with a ciprofloxacin; the 3 rd group – infected mice treated with a Ciprofloxacin and Decamethoxin combination; the 4 th group – infected mice treated with a combined drug on the base of mutual prodrugs (Hexamethylenetetramine and <b>Phenyl</b> <b>salicylate).</b> Results. The efficiency of mono- and combined antimicrobial agents under experimental Staphylococcus wound infection conditions was studied.
