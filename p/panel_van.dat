5000|$|In Australia, local <b>panel</b> <b>vans</b> were a {{development}} of the Australian [...] "ute" [...] (a variety of pickup also based on a car chassis). <b>Panel</b> <b>vans</b> were also especially popular with younger car buyers in Australia during the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|<b>Panel</b> <b>vans</b> {{were first}} offered by Holden from December 1953 in the FJ model, and by Ford Australia from May 1961, {{based on the}} XK Falcon. Painters, electricians, and general labourers quickly found <b>panel</b> <b>vans</b> ideal for their trades, as the cargo bay {{offering}} extended capacity otherwise wasted in passenger space, and a highly customisable interior, without the bulk or extended dimensions of other longer-base vans. Australian police forces also purchased fleets of <b>panel</b> <b>vans</b> to use in a black maria, or paddywagon, role. These were known formally as Divisional Vans and in slang as Divvy Vans.|$|R

5000|$|In Australia, <b>panel</b> <b>vans</b> were a {{development}} of the Australian [...] "ute" [...] (utility), a variety of pickup based on a car chassis. In the U.K., this body style {{is referred to as}} a [...] "car-derived van", and in American as a [...] "sedan delivery". The first <b>panel</b> <b>vans</b> were manufactured locally by Holden and Ford Australia in the late 1950s, but did not become popular until the mid-1960s. Other foreign brands of enclosed vans manufactured or assembled in Australia included Volkswagen, Morris Minor, and Chrysler. <b>Panel</b> <b>vans</b> enjoyed tremendous popularity in Australia throughout the 1970s, but by the late 1980s, they began to slowly disappear from Australian roads as demand fell and major manufacturers slowly ceased building them.|$|R
5000|$|Younger {{drivers were}} {{especially}} attracted to <b>panel</b> <b>vans,</b> for reasons {{such as the}} ease with which a mattress could be installed within the cargo bay. Consequently, <b>panel</b> <b>vans</b> also attracted nicknames such as [...] "sin bins," [...] "shaggin' wagons," [...] "mobile virgin conversion units", [...] "screw canoes," [...] "Scooby-Doo mobiles" [...] (after the Mystery Machine of the Hanna-Barbera animated cartoons), and [...] "fuck trucks". This kind of activity was frequently carried out at the local drive-in theatre. During the 1970s it also became fashionable to decorate the exterior sides with murals, often painted with intricate detail. Along with the Volkswagen Kombi, <b>panel</b> <b>vans</b> were very popular with surfers (or wanna-be's), as it was convenient to sleep in the cargo bay during surfing [...] "safaris", as well as carry boards and other equipment.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard <b>panel</b> <b>vans,</b> 250 JU chassis were also made available to specialist manufacturers for conversion into motor homes ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>panel</b> <b>van</b> {{variant of}} the Logan was {{launched}} on 23 January 2007, in Bucharest. It is a small business oriented vehicle, with 2,500 litre loading space and 800kg payload. The Logan VAN {{is more or less}} an MCV without the rear side windows and therefore has the same safety features and uses the same engines as the other models (except the 1.6 16v engine). Production of this model was stopped in August 2012. Since its launch, over 53,000 units were manufactured. The <b>panel</b> <b>van</b> version is still produced at AvtoVAZ.|$|E

They are also purpose-designed to be {{utilitarian}} base model MPVs / people carriers, for a range of such vehicles.

25|$|When the XF Falcon {{passenger}} car range {{was replaced by}} the redesigned EA series, the XF commercials (utility and <b>panel</b> <b>van)</b> continued unchanged due to there being no EA series versions. The XF commercial models continued unchanged stylistically, but over time would gain the EB series engine updates.|$|E
25|$|The XH series Falcon {{utility and}} van, {{released}} in 1996, were essentially XG models facelifted {{to resemble the}} contemporary Falcon EF sedans and wagons. The XH also gained an all-new front suspension and {{rack and pinion steering}} from the EA–EL series cars. This meant changes to the frame and bodywork, from the firewall forward. The turret (roof) panel on the utility was now domed and lost its squared-off appearance, increasing interior head room. By this time, the popularity of the <b>panel</b> <b>van</b> had faded and Ford released their final Falcon <b>panel</b> <b>van</b> in 1997 as part of the revised XH II series. It was also with this model that the V8 engine was re-introduced into the Falcon utility commercial vehicle range. After 20 years, the fourth generation Falcon was discontinued in June 1999.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of an A$700million {{development}} the Ford EA Falcon introduced in 1988, bore a passing resemblance to the European Ford Scorpio. Under the skin, however, it remained an entirely Australian design, and is credited as the first Falcon model to employ wind tunnel testing. The EA was also only produced in sedan and station wagon body styles, with the previous-model (XF) utility and <b>panel</b> <b>van</b> continuing in production.|$|E
25|$|Launched in October 1989, the Series II {{brought with}} it a four-speed {{automatic}} transmission, body-coloured B-pillars, and the 3.2-litre engine was dropped.
