5|$|Beckett's surgery, which {{included}} his having a rib removed, {{made him a}} question mark for the Dodgers heading into 2014. He returned to the Dodgers on April 9 and made his first start since the previous May, allowing four runs in four innings. On May 13, he <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first win since 2012.|$|E
5|$|On June 4, Sánchez <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{first major}} league win. With the score tied at {{six in the}} {{eleventh}} inning against the New York Mets, Sánchez entered the game and pitched a scoreless inning. The Giants won the game 7–6 in the twelfth on an RBI single by Pedro Feliz.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{struck out}} 12 batters in seven innings {{in the first}} game of the 2013 National League Division Series. That was the third most strikeouts by a Dodger pitcher in the playoffs, behind only Koufax (15 in the 1963 World Series) and Carl Erskine (14 in the 1953 World Series). His six {{straight}} strikeouts in the game tied a MLB postseason record set by Tim Belcher in the second game of the 1988 World Series. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first career postseason victory in that game.|$|E

5|$|Kershaw was {{selected}} to the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his third straight selection. In July, he compiled a 4–1 record and 1.34 ERA in six starts and was awarded his second National League Pitcher of the Month Award. On September 2, Kershaw <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> 200th strikeout of 2013, joining Hall of Famers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale as the only starters in Dodgers history with at least 4 consecutive seasons of more than 200 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} improved for {{the following}} race in Bahrain though, as Webber <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first point for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him starting 14th and {{marked the first time}} he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1. He was unable to continue his point scoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in San Marino and a lack of grip in Spain meant that he could do no better than 13th and 12th in those races.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt was not {{expected}} to make the Kansas City Royals' roster in 2002, but he {{was added to the}} bullpen after he had an 0.64 ERA and fourteen strikeouts (to go with just two walks) in fourteen innings in Spring training. His major league debut came on April 6 against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched two innings, giving up three hits and a run in a 140 loss. On April 24, Affeldt <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first major league win by pitching 3.2 innings of relief in an 82 win over the Detroit Tigers.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz came off the disabled list. Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz got hurt again. On June 13, he <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he {{was placed on the}} disabled list with a strained rib cage, but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E
5|$|For the 1987 season, Kulwicki secured primary {{sponsorship}} from Zerex Antifreeze {{and changed}} his car number to seven. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first career pole {{position in the}} season's third race, at Richmond. Later that season, he again qualified fastest at Richmond and Dover. Kulwicki came close to winning his first Winston Cup race at Pocono, finishing second after winner Dale Earnhardt passed him on the last lap. With nine top10 finishes, eleven DNFs, and an average finish of 18.2 in 29events; Kulwicki finished 15th in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Affeldt again {{spent the}} entire season in the bullpen for the Giants. On March 28, the Giants {{extended}} his contract through the 2011 season with an option for 2012. Affeldt <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first save with the Giants in a 6–3 victory over the Atlanta Braves on April 11. He struggled {{for most of the}} season and was placed on the disabled list on July 24 with an oblique strain. After rehabbing in the minors, Affeldt returned to the Giants on August 18. He finished the season with four saves and a 4.14 ERA in fiftythree games.|$|E

By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held.|$|E
5|$|Mackin scored {{his first}} goal for York in a 2–1 away defeat to Forest Green Rovers on 6 March 2010, with his shot taking a {{deflection}} off David Brown. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> 10th yellow card {{of the season}} in a 0–0 away draw with Altrincham, which resulted in a two-match suspension. He played in both legs of York's play-off semi-final victory over Luton, which finished 2–0 on aggregate. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May 2010, which York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished the season with 45 appearances and 1 goal for York and signed a new one-year contract with the club in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Raymond {{made the}} Canucks' roster out {{of training camp}} and made his NHL debut on the team's top line with Henrik and Daniel Sedin. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first NHL point, an assist, in the season-opener against the San Jose Sharks on October 5, 2007. Soon thereafter, he was sent down to the Moose for a two-day assignment after having been a healthy scratch.

While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose and walked up to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E

5|$|Kershaw had a 41 inning {{scoreless}} inning streak {{that ended}} {{in the top of}} the sixth inning on July 10 when, with two outs, Chase Headley homered to left field at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw's streak was, at the time, tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning streak in MLB history. He won the pitcher of the month award again in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win it two months in a row. He was 4–0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> 200th strikeout of the season on September 2, the fifth year in a row he had reached that number, trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters. He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).|$|E
5|$|Mills {{returned}} to Notts County on 26 September 1994 after re-signing {{for a fee}} of £50,000, having made one Premier League appearance for Leicester by that point in 1994–95. Making his debut in a 2–0 away defeat to Reading in the First Division on 1 October 1994, he played regularly at right back before moving to left back {{towards the end of}} 1994–95 after Craig Short {{returned to}} the team. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> last playing honour this season as part of the team that won the Anglo-Italian Cup after County beat Ascoli 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium. However, County were relegated to the Second Division after finishing 24th in the First Division, with Mills making 43 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Nolan captained Newcastle for {{the first}} time in a 5–1 win against Cardiff City taking over for the absent Nicky Butt and Alan Smith. After an 11-game goal drought, Nolan <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> 11th league goal of the season on 20 February against Preston North End in a 3–0 win. He {{followed}} this up with the final goal in Newcastle's 6–1 home drubbing of Barnsley two games later. He was voted as the Championship Player of the Year at the Football League Awards on 16 March. On 5 April 2010, Newcastle United secured automatic promotion to the Premier League, after fellow contenders Nottingham Forest failed to beat Cardiff City. Newcastle took to the field hours later, in front of 48,750 fans, and Nolan scored the winner with a scissor-kick in the 2–1 win over Sheffield United.|$|E
