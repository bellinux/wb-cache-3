40|$|I. The vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) was {{examined}} in four alert monkeys during rotations {{of the head}} about torsional, vertical, horizontal, and intermediate axes. Eye positions and axes were recorded in three dimensions (3 -D). Visual targets were used to optimize gaze stabilization. 2. Axes of eye rotation during slow phases showed small but systematic deviations from collinearity with the axes of head rota-tion. These noncollinearities apparently resulted from vector sum-mation of torsional, vertical, and horizontal VOR components with different gains. 3. VOR gain was lowest about a head-fixed torsional axis that was correlated with the primary gaze direction, as determined by Listing’s law for saccades. As a result, rotation of the head about a partially torsional axis produced noncollinear slow phases, with axes that tilted toward Listing’s plane. 4. During slow phases, eye position changed {{not only in the}} direction of rotation, but also systematically in other directions. Even axes of eye rotation within Listing’s plane caused eye posi-tion {{to move out of the}} plane to a torsional position that was then held. Thus Listing’s law for saccades cannot be a product of <b>plant</b> <b>mechanics.</b> 5. VOR slow phases were simulated with the use of a model that incorporated 3 -D rotational kinematics into the indirect path and the oculomotor plant. This demonstrated that the observed pattern of position changes is the expected consequence of rotat-ing the eye about a fixed axis and that to hold these positions the indirect path must employ a 3 -D velocity-to-position transformation. 6. Quick phases not only corrected the violations of Listing’s law produced by slow phases but anticipated them by directing the eye toward a plane rotated in the direction of head rotation. This was modeled by inputting the vestibular signal to a Listing’s law operator that is shared by the quick phase and saccadic systems...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{complexity}} of the interactions between aquatic biological systems and their physical environment is a critical condition for the sustainable management of aquatic environments. In such ecosystems, aquatic vegetation holds a central place by influencing flow and turbulent processes, thus playing a major role both from an engineering and ecological point of view. However, the characterisation of the hydrodynamics of vegetated flows is facing several issues due to {{the complexity}} of the plant-flow interactions. In such a complex system, the plant's biomechanical properties are a key parameter governing the interplay between the living organism and its physical environment: a variation of the <b>plant’s</b> <b>mechanics</b> in time or space will generally imply changes in these regulation processes, which in turn can lead to major changes in the physical/ecological environment. The consideration of mechanical interactions, however, is fairly new to engineers, biologists and ecologists, as it defines an interface between engineering and ecology. As a consequence, this area of research has remained mostly unexplored and a lot of processes are to be discovered {{at the edge of the}} different disciplines. This thesis deepened the level of the understanding of plant-flow mechanical interactions and of the plant structural properties, in order to improve the parametrisation of aquatic vegetation in hydraulic and coastal research. Measurement techniques and experimental protocols were developed to collect plant biomechanical properties and a methodology for the collection of such data was provided based on the flexibility of the plant elements. New methods to design plant surrogates for hydraulic experimentation were further investigated based on mechanical similarity. In parallel, this thesis reviewed the measurement techniques commonly used to measure drag forces on submerged plants, and developed a theoretical framework to estimate random wave and random wave-plus-current induced drag forces on submerged plants. This framework is based on the definition of a drag coefficient for a given type of plant. Moreover, the common drag coefficient formulations were discussed, identifying possibilities for a standardisation of the formulations for oscillatory and steady flows. Finally, in order to understand the effects of the development of a biological community at an interface fluid/solid, the example of marine biofouling was investigated through flow visualisation. The methodologies developed in this thesis are to be used in ongoing projects and will trigger new research activities at NTNU and elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{finite element}} (FE) method {{has been used}} in recent years to {{simulate}} overturning processes in trees and to better comprehend <b>plant</b> anchorage <b>mechanics.</b> We aimed at understanding the fundamental mechanisms of root-soil reinforcement by simulating direct shear of rooted and non-rooted soil. Two- (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) FE simulations of direct shear box tests were carried out using readily available software for routine strength assessment of the root-soil composite. Both rooted and non-rooted blocks of soil were modelled using a simplified model of root distribution and root material properties representative of real roots. Linear elastic behaviour was assumed for roots and the soil was modelled as an ideally plastic medium. FE analysis showed that direct shear tests were dependent on the material properties specified for both the soil and roots. 2 D and 3 D simulations of direct shear of non-rooted soil produced similar results and any differences between 2 D and 3 D simulations could be explained with regard to the spatial complexity of roots used in the root distribution model.

We report the mechanical properties of cell wall analogues based on cellulose hydrogels to elucidate the contribution of xyloglucan or arabinoxylan as examples of two hemicelluloses displaying different interactions with cellulose. We subjected the hydrogels to mechanical pressures to emulate the compressive stresses experienced by cell walls in planta. Our results revealed {{that the presence of}} either hemicellulose increased the resistance to compression at fast strain rates. However, at slow strain rates, only xyloglucan increased composite strength. This behaviour could be explained considering the microstructure and the flow of water through the composites confirming their poroelastic nature. In contrast, small deformation oscillatory rheology showed that only xyloglucan decreased the elastic moduli. These results provide evidence for contrasting roles of different hemicelluloses in <b>plant</b> cell wall <b>mechanics</b> and man-made cellulose-based composite materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{coordination}} of cell division and cell expansion {{are critical to}} normal development of tissues.

Limited by experimental accessibility it remains unknown how cell division and expansion cooperatively affect tissue growth dynamics. Employing a cell-based two dimensional tissue simulation we investigate the regulatory role {{of a range of}} cell division rules on tissue growth dynamics and in particular on the spatial heterogeneity of growth. We find that random cell divisions only add noise to the growth and therefore increase growth heterogeneity, while cell divisions according to the shortest new wall or along the direction of maximal mechanical stress reduce growth heterogeneity by actively enhancing the regulation of growth by mechanical stresses. Thus, we find that, beyond tissue geometry and topology, cell divisions affect the dynamics of growth, and that their signature is embedded in the statistics of tissue growth...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with addressing how <b>plant</b> tissue <b>mechanics</b> {{is related to the}} micromechanics of cells. To this end, we propose a meshfree particle method to simulate the mechanics of both individual plant cells (Parenchyma) and cell aggregates in response to external stresses. The model considers two important features in the plant cell: (1) the cell protoplasm, the interior liquid phase inducing hydrodynamic phenomena, and (2) the cell wall material, a viscoelastic solid material that contains the protoplasm. In this particle framework, the cell fluid is modeled by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), a meshfree method typically used to address problems with gas and fluid dynamics. In the solid phase (cell wall) on the other hand, the particles are connected by pairwise interactions holding them together and preventing the fluid to penetrate the cell wall. The cell wall hydraulic conductivity (permeability) is built in as well through the SPH formulation. Although this model is also meant to {{be able to deal with}} dynamic and even violent situations (leading to cell wall rupture or cell-cell debonding), we have concentrated on quasi-static conditions. The results of single cell compression simulations show that the conclusions found by analytical models and experiments can be reproduced at least qualitatively. Relaxation tests revealed that plant cells have short relaxation times ([1]μs - [10]μs) compared to mammalian cells. Simulations performed on cell aggregates indicated an influence of the cellular organization to the tissue response, as was also observed in experiments done on tissues with a similar structure. status: publishe...|$|R
