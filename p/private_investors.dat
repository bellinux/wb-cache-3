In 2000, the At-Bristol centre opened on semi-derelict land at Canon's Marsh {{and some of}} the existing Grade II listed buildings were refurbished and reused. It was funded with £44.3 million from the National Lottery, the Millennium Commission, South West of England Regional Development Agency, and a further £43.4 million from Bristol City Council and commercial partners, including Nestlé. <b>Private</b> <b>investors</b> are also constructing studio apartment buildings.|$|E

On 2 July 1946, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, several large shipping companies and other <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> reestablished Det Norske Luftfartselskap (DNL), with the state owning 20% and the shipping companies 49%. This airline was granted a 20-year monopoly on domestic and international flights.

5|$|In 1987, Billboard {{was sold}} again to Affiliated Publications for $100 million. Billboard Publications Inc. became a {{subsidiary}} of Affiliated Publications called BPI Communications. As BPI Communications, it acquired The Hollywood Reporter, Adweek, Marketing Week and Mediaweek. It purchased Broadcast Data Systems, which is a high-tech firm for tracking music airtime. <b>Private</b> <b>investors</b> from Boston Ventures and BPI executives re-purchased a two-thirds interest in Billboard Publications for $100 million and more acquisitions followed.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, it covered the {{entertainment}} industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque shows. It also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.|$|E

The company {{remained}} independent until 1905, when ALCO purchased it; ALCO continued building new steam locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913. ALCO used the Rogers facilities through the 1920s as a parts storage facility and warehouse, but eventually sold {{the property to}} <b>private</b> <b>investors.</b> Today, several Rogers-built locomotives exist in railroad museums around the world, and the plant's erecting shop is preserved as the Thomas Rogers Building; it is the current location of the Paterson Museum, whose mission is to preserve and display Paterson's industrial history.|$|E
5|$|The Covent Garden Estate {{was part}} of Beecham Estates and Pills Limited from 1924 to 1928, after which it was managed by a {{successor}} company called Covent Garden Properties Company Limited, owned by the Beechams and other <b>private</b> <b>investors.</b> This new company sold some properties at Covent Garden, while becoming active in property investment {{in other parts of}} London. In 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the Covent Garden area, including the market, were sold to the newly established government-owned Covent Garden Authority for £3,925,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{proposed that}} the municipality buy shares for NOK150,000. When the issue was debated in the municipal council on 9 June, it met with resistance from representatives from Tranby in the west of Lier, who stated that they felt that the railway would have no impact on them, and that the municipality should only buy shares for NOK75,000. It resulted in a compromise where the municipality bought shares for NOK100,000. A year later, the municipality purchased shares for an addition NOK30,000. The other major shareholders were Drammen Municipality with NOK30,000, Buskerud County Municipality with NOK50,000 and <b>private</b> <b>investors,</b> who supplied NOK174,050.|$|E

5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and <b>private</b> <b>investors.</b> He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Final {{assembly}} for the A321 would be, as a {{first for}} any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing {{it would be more}} productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and <b>private</b> <b>investors.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1999, then-Emir (now King) Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa began {{a reform}} process and in 2001 exiles {{were told they}} could come back. Rejecting an offer to become a cabinet {{minister}} and leaving his leading position in the opposition, al-Jamri returned from the United Kingdom in December 2001, eight months after his father had obtained a consent from the Emir to establish two newspapers. Initially, he was sceptical about the king's reform plan, but al-Jamri received a personal invitation by the king and was given a large margin of freedom of expression. Al-Jamri, backed by 39 other <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> (US$5.3 million capital) had initially planned to establish two independent newspapers, Al-Wasat in Arabic and Gulf Observer in English.|$|E

5|$|On 5 October 1999, {{the club}} and the {{municipality}} signed a letter of intent which indicated that the two would cooperate constructing a new venue along with <b>private</b> <b>investors.</b> The final contract was made with Reinertsen on 20 April 2000, and other involved investors included Fokus Bank, Gjensidige NOR, I. K. Lykke, Eiendomspar, Siemens and Trondheims Næringsbygg. The club received a 47% share of the stadium company, while the municipality received 14% {{in exchange for the}} company taking over the ownership of the land and existing structure. As compensation for losing Lerkendal as an athletics venue, the municipality spent NOK32 million upgrading Øya stadion as the city's new main athletics stadium. NOK20 million was financed by Rosenborg, while the remainder was spent using public funds.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} idea {{of building}} a railway between Norway's two largest cities was launched by Hans Gløersen on 24 August 1871 in Bergensposten. The forest supervisor in Voss suggested building the railway via Voss and Hallingdal {{to connect with the}} Krøderen Line. Back in 1866 the same person had launched the idea of the Jæren Line. Within days of the launch of the Bergen Line the city council had assimilated support for the suggestion. In 1872 the railway director Carl Abraham Pihl and two engineers went on a survey tour to look at the suggested line. At the time it was common that proposals for railways came from local initiative, and that local municipalities and <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> would then pay about 20% of the investments, the state covering the rest, mostly through foreign debt.|$|E
5|$|Anna Jai {{moved with}} about 70 former slaves to the Arlington {{neighborhood}} of Jacksonville {{to live out}} her remaining years. The ownership of the island and farms immediately following its sale by Gibbs is unknown, but after the American Civil War, the Freedmen's Bureau managed the island and recently emancipated freedmen lived in the former slave quarters and farmed the land. A New Hampshire farmer named John Rollins purchased the island in 1869 and, finding agriculture in Florida not as successful as he wished, transitioned the island into a tourist resort, building a large luxury hotel and attracting celebrities such as banker William Astor and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe. The slave quarters were displayed as tourist attractions. After the hotel burned down in 1888, the Rollins family successfully cultivated citrus until a freeze in 1894 destroyed their crop. Rollins' daughter's family {{was the last to}} live in the main house; she sold the island to <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> in 1923.|$|E

5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to <b>private</b> <b>investors.</b> The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E
5|$|Public {{debate about}} {{constructing}} a railway from Lillesand {{up the valley}} following the river Tovdalselva started in the mid-1880s. At the time, lumber was being floated down the river, but low levels of water was causing irregular operations and the piling of lumber in Flaksvand. In 1889, the government for received an application for a concession. Costs were estimated at NOK462,000 and the line {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway on 22 June 1891. At the same time, the line received a state funding of NOK200,000. Half of this was share capital, the other half was a subsidy. Aust-Agder County Municipality also gave a grant of NOK20,000, and bought shares for the same amount. Of the share capital of NOK417,350, NOK850 was from <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> and the rest from municipalities. The largest owner was Lillesand Municipality, who bought shares for NOK181,000. Concession was granted by royal resolution on 31 August 1892, and lasted 30 years from the date of the opening of the railway.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg started laying {{plans for}} further {{construction}}, at first looking at {{construction of a}} new grandstand on the east end. In May 1998, Lerkendal Eiendom AS, owned 44% by Rosenborg, was established to build three new grandstands, including removing the running track to make it a football-only stadium. An alternative was to move and build an all-new stadium at Ranheim. Following the announcement of the Ranheim plans, Mayor Anne Kathrine Slungård stated that {{she did not want to}} sell Lerkendal, as she wanted public ownership of cultural infrastructure. In April 1999, Trondheim Municipality's chief of administration, Knut Sæther, recommended that the municipality sell Lerkendal to Rosenborg, who would then along with <b>private</b> <b>investors</b> be free to construct the necessary facilities. At the time, the municipality estimated the value of Lerkendal to between NOK50 and 100 million. The football district stated they were in favor of conversion of Lerkendal, and that they feared that if Rosenborg moved Lerkendal would incur high costs on the municipality, giving Granåsen as an example of a little used skiing facility which used half the municipal funding for sports venues.|$|E
