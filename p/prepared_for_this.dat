This modification would increase the capacity of each train from 18 to 20, and the hourly capacity of the coaster from 1400 to 1600 riders per hour. Kingda Ka's station is <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> modification, with entrance gates for the currently-nonexistent row of seats.|$|E
5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on Flore ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The {{battered}} Favorite led with an attempt to round Amphion and rake her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers {{to bear on the}} British squadron. Hoste was <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to wear, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised. Favorite, which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{influenced}} the {{decision made by}} the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and {{the commander of the}} Australian Military Forces, General Thomas Blamey, wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the New Guinea Campaign and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be better <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> responsibility than the Australian Army's militia forces or US Army units. The commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty in finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{continued}} to make progress in the liberation of France, and on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter-offensive (Operation Lüttich) from Vire towards Avranches. The operation included LSSAH, Das Reich, 2nd, and 116th Panzer Divisions, with support from infantry and elements of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen under SS-Oberstgruppenführer Paul Hausser. These forces were to mount an offensive near Mortain and drive west through Avranches to the coast. The Allied forces were <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> offensive, and an air assault on the combined German units proved devastating. On 21 August, 50,000 German troops, including most of the LSSAH, were encircled by the Allies in the Falaise Pocket. Remnants of the LSSAH which escaped were withdrawn to Germany for refitting. Paris was liberated on 25 August, and {{the last of the}} German forces withdrew over the Seine by the end of August, ending the Normandy campaign.|$|E

Moloney and Stairs were quite <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> eventuality.

He <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> canvas by taking multiple photographs of his students frolicking at this location- and overall portrays a happy physical unselfconsciousness seen through the perspective of age- a nostalgia for youth. By the 1880s this nostalgia for youth was a veneer carefully disguising a latent homosexuality. In contrast there were poets and painters who would contrast free young beauty of bodies in the water with the approaching grind of maturity and responsibility. Henry Tuke loved to paint naked bathers in a soft idealised style deliberately avoiding overt sexuality.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 the Soviet Red Army {{advanced}} {{to the outskirts of}} Vilnius. This change in the tides of war brought both joy and fear to the surviving Jews of the HKP camp who understood that the SS would try to kill them {{in the days before the}} German retreat. Many <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> eventuality by discreetly making hiding places in the camp in secret bunkers, in walls, and in the rafters of the attic. A large and crucial unknown was one of timing — the prisoners needed to know when the SS killing squads were coming so they could successfully implement plans to escape or hide. As the sounds of fighting grew closer the level of tension within the camp became palpable.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under {{command of}} his son, Ibrahim Pasha. Britain, France, and Russia intervened {{to protect the}} Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the Battle of Navarino, while {{under the command of}} Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington. If the Porte was not in the least <b>{{prepared}}</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.|$|E

All of the former residents were scattered in the host communities of Nunavik, the homeland of the Inuit of Quebec. They arrived without housing, without income, and without many of their personal effects. Family groups were broken up and the Inuit were separated from their seasonal hunting territory.
